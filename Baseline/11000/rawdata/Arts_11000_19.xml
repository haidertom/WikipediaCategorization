'''.design''' is a [[top-level domain]] name. It was proposed in [[ICANN]]'s [[Generic top-level domain#New top-level domains|new generic top-level domain (gTLD) program]], and became available to the general public on May 12, 2015. [[Top Level Design]] is the [[domain name registry]] for the string.

==History==
In September 2014, [[Portland, Oregon]]-based [[Top Level Design]] (TLD) won the right to operate the .design [[top-level domain]] after beating out six other applicants in a private auction. According to TLD's CEO [[Ray King (entrepreneur)|Ray King]], winning the auction was "very important" and one of the company's top priorities, evidenced by its name. He told Domain Name Wire, "Think of all the things that require design. Design permeates all aspects of culture.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=Top Level Design wins .design contention set|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2014/09/25/top-level-design-wins-design-contention-set/|publisher=Domain Name Wire|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; design domain registrations became available to the general public on May 12, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allemann|first1=Andrew|title=This week’s new TLDs: .Design and four Early Access|url=http://domainnamewire.com/2015/05/12/this-weeks-new-tlds-design-and-four-early-access/|publisher=Domain Name Wire|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to The Domains, more than 5,200 .design domains were registered on the first day of general availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkens|first1=Michael|title=.Design Winds Up With Over 5K Domain Registrations After 1st Day|url=http://www.thedomains.com/2015/05/14/design-winds-up-with-over-5k-domain-registrations-after-1st-day/|publisher=The Domains|accessdate=May 27, 2015|date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CentralNic]] provides backend services through an exclusive distribution agreement and shares in the global revenues from .design domain names. Ben Crawford, CentralNic's CEO, said of the top-level domain, "It has impressive commercial potential, and it will be adopted more quickly than many other TLDs as it caters, among many other groups, to one of the best-informed professions on new Internet developments – website designers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/73659/centralnic-group-wins-hotly-contested-top-level-domain-battle-73659.html|title=CentralNic Group wins hotly contested top level domain battle|first=John|last=Harrington|date=October 27, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2014|publisher=Proactive Investors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of .design's launch, King said of the gTLD:

{{Quote|Design has always been fundamental to the way people, companies and products present themselves, and since the elegance of the Apple revolution there has been a conscious embrace of how design is a lot more than just how a product or service looks, but a fundamental carrier of one's message. Beyond that, design is what I call a 'horizontal-vertical', in that it is a broad term, but not generic like .web or .online. It touches on many clear vertical markets such as graphic design, interior design, lighting design, web design, fashion design and many more. These are all distinct markets whose survival depends on them being ahead of the curve and defining future trends — .design does just that.&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lau|first1=Richard|title=NamesCon: Spotlight on ICANNWiki|url=http://www.domaininvesting.com/namescon-spotlight-icannwiki/|publisher=DomainInvesting.com|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Chinese|t=天涯織女|s=天涯织女|p=Tiānyá Zhínǚ|pic=A Weaver on the Horizon (intertitle).jpg|210px|piccap=''A Weaver on the Horizon'' [[intertitle]]&lt;br&gt;([[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]] version)}}'''''A Weaver on the Horizon''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 天涯织女) is a 2010 Chinese television series based on the life story of [[Huang Daopo]], who revolutionized the textile industry during the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The story is considered to be [[historical fiction]], as the plot deviates from factual accounts. A central theme of [[feminism]] is also present, as more focus is placed on the female protagonists than their male counterparts. The series premiered on Nanning Television on 14 August 2010 and ran for 36 episodes.

==Synopsis==
[[Huang Daopo|Huang Qiao'er]] (Ivy Lu, [[Janine Chang]]) was born to a poverty-stricken family. She lost her parents at an early age and was raised by her aunt, who taught her [[textile arts]]. While growing up in a weaving mill, Huang developed a close bond with the neighboring dyehouse owner's son, Fang Ning ([[Edwin Siu]]), who fell in love with her. Eventually, Splendid Mill's weavers produce outstanding results and earn an opportunity to work in the palace. Through Huang's friendship with the [[Emperor Duzong of Song|emperor]]'s niece, Zhao Jiayi ([[Cecilia Liu]]), Huang is able to gain access to the palace's study, deepening her knowledge of weaving from its collection. However, the weavers become embroiled in a power struggle with the emperor's concubines, as well as a rivalry with the Iridescent Cloud Mill's weavers, who also work at the palace. 
 
While in the palace, Huang falls in love with a young general, Lin Mufei ([[Justin Yuan]]), at the expense of her friendship with the princess. Lin also rejects the princess' affections, due to his prejudice against imperial family members' corruption, and in spite of his vows to defend the [[Song dynasty]]. During Lin's absence, Fang Ning's legs are crippled while saving Huang from the corrupt members of the imperial court. Feeling guilty for Fang's plight, and hearing rumors that Lin had been killed in battle at the city of Chuzhou (present day [[Huai'an]]), Huang decides to marry Fang. Lin, however, has survived and is heartbroken when he sees the two marry, thus complicating the love triangle between Lin, Huang, and Zhao Jiayi. 
 
Despite Huang Qiao'er's awareness that she cannot be with the man she still loves, due to her marriage to another, she recognizes that being Fang Ning's wife also has its benefits. Her mother-in-law ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]) imparts the family's dyeing secrets, which helps her hone her textile skills. However, Fang is aware that his wife still has feelings towards Lin Mufei. This prompts Fang to become an alcoholic, leading him to repeatedly abuse her. As for Zhao Jiayi, she remains devoted to Lin, and, after learning that he did not die, eventually sneaks away from the palace to search for him. With the help of Lin's mother, Zhao locates him in the city of [[Changzhou]]. She claims that she only wishes to be with Lin Mufei in battle, regardless of whether he would ultimately love her or not. 
 
Not long afterwards, the [[Mongols]], who establish the [[Yuan dynasty]] under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], conquer the Song dynasty.  After experiencing a series of personal misfortunes and tragedies, Lin is traumatized and decides to focus on protecting Zhao Jiayi, and her surviving [[House of Zhao|clan members]], as well as liberating China from the Mongols' tyranny. For three years, while battling their enemies and taking care of one another, Lin and Zhao begin to develop a close bond and mutual understanding. Zhao helps Lin nurse his emotional wounds, resulting from Huang's marriage to Fang Ning and his mother's execution by one of their adversaries. He starts to reciprocate the princess’s affection, when he realizes that there is more to her than her apparent vain behavior.

While fleeing from the Mongols' conquest, Huang has a chance encounter with an extraordinary [[Woodworking|woodwork]] instructor, Feng Jiujin ([[Damian Lau]]), and becomes his apprentice. She ultimately wanders to [[Sanya|Yazhou]] (present day [[Hainan]]), where she learns the arts of cotton farming and weaving, and helps the [[Li people|natives]] improve their textile technology. 
 
After Fang Ning's death, Huang finally resolves the entanglement with Lin and Zhao, by reuniting with them in the city of [[Hangzhou]] (former Song capital [[Lin'an City|Lin'an]]). Huang sadly realizes that she has inadvertently brought two men who loved her nothing but heartbreak, instead of happiness. Regretting her mistakes, she gives her blessing to Lin and Zhao of their newfound love for each other, and accepts her fate as a widow. Huang also realizes her dream of revolutionizing the art of textile weaving and manufacturing, for the welfare of her people. With support from her family and friends, Huang becomes an innovator of the Chinese textile industry. After numerous battles against the Yuan forces with Song remnants, the [[Battle of Yamen]] officially ends to the Song dynasty. Lin and Zhao, after enduring these defeats, realize that the enemy is too powerful and not yet ready for the resistance to overthrow. Desiring to escape from the violence and tragedies in their lives, they choose to elope and go into seclusion together.
 
Lin Mufei and Zhao Jiayi are happily married and return to Hangzhou after spending three years in hiding. By this time, the Splendid Mill and Fang Family Dyehouse have brought in many apprentices and achieved business success, with Huang Qiao'er fulfilling her purpose in life.

==Production==
The Song and Mongol military costumes are originally made for the two television series ''[[The Young Warriors (TV series)|The Young Warriors]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008 TV series)|The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' (2008).

Originally considered for the part of Huang Qiao'er by the casting department, [[Cecilia Liu]] expressed her interest to portray Zhao Jiayi instead, after reading the script. As a result, [[Janine Chang]] was chosen for the starring role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eladies.sina.com.cn/news/2009/1112/0957933715.shtml 劉詩詩入主《衣被天下》 首度挑戰刁蠻公主] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002145702/http://eladies.sina.com.cn/news/2009/1112/0957933715.shtml |date=2011-10-02 }}. Eladies.sina.com.cn. Retrieved on 2012-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deviations from historic accounts ==
In Chinese history, [[Emperor Lizong of Song|Emperor Lizong]] and [[Emperor Duzong of Song|Emperor Duzong]] of the Song dynasty were actually uncle and nephew. In ''A Weaver on the Horizon'', they are changed to brothers to explain Zhao Jiayi's existence. In reality, Zhao Jiayi never existed and is a fictional character solely created for ''A Weaver on the Horizon''. The screenwriters were unwilling to write Zhao as the daughter of Duzong due to his well-known corrupted reputations.

Almost all of the characters in the series are fictional except [[Huang Daopo]], Emperor Duzong, Mongol general [[Bayan of the Baarin|Bayan]], and [[Yelü Chucai]]. Most of the plot does not match actual historic accounts. There are references to the death of Emperor Duzong, the succession and abdication of [[Emperor Gong of Song|Emperor Gongzong]], [[Battle of Xiangyang]], [[Battle of Yamen]] and the deaths of the Song's last two emperors; [[Emperor Duanzong of Song|Emperor Duanzong]] and [[Emperor Bing of Song|Emperor Huaizong]].

[[File:Hans Memling 056.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Advent and Triumph of Christ'' by [[Hans Memling]], 1480, [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.]]

'''''Advent and Triumph of Christ''''' is an [[oil painting]] on a panel of wood, painted c.1480 by German-born [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Hans Memling]].  It was made for the altar of the Tanners' guild in Our Lady's Church in [[Bruges]], but is now held by the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]].  It measures 81 × 189 cm.

The painting shows 25 episodes from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'']] (although some have interpreted it as a version of the [[Seven Joys of the Virgin]]) combined in one narrative composition without a central dominating scene: including the [[Annunciation]]; the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]]; the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]; the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]; the [[Adoration of the Magi]]; the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]; the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]; the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]; [[Pentecost]]; the [[Dormition of Mary|Dormition]] and [[Assumption of Mary]].  A similar narrative style was employed by Memling for his earlier ''[[Scenes from the Passion of Christ]]'' (c.1470), commissioned by [[Tommaso Portinari]] and now held by the [[Galleria Sabauda]] in [[Turin]].

'''Alicia Leeke''', a native South Carolinian, is a [[Painting|painter]] and [[artist]] working in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] and Charleston, South Carolina. She first became known for her [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionistic]] style and incorporation of [[Fauvism]]. Her artwork is distinctive for its dry brush painting technique, gentle distortion of [[linear perspective]], and use of thick line and brush strokes.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;

She became widely known for her curated exhibition, View From Under the Microscope, which uses phytoplankton to garner awareness about climate change and ocean acidification.

== Early life ==
Leeke was born in Columbia, [[South Carolina]]. She began her education at [[Columbia College (South Carolina)|Columbia College]],&lt;ref name="Saatchi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saatchionline.com/leekeka | title=Alicia Leeke | publisher=Saatchi Online | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an all-girls, private liberal arts school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiasc.edu/about/about-columbia-college | title=Why Columbia College? | publisher=Columbia College | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to study biology in hopes of becoming a veterinarian.

During her sophomore year she vacationed in Paris and visited the Louvre, where she fell in love with the French Impressionists and solidified her passion for painting. She also visited her most inspiring spot in France, Montmartre. She later transferred to the [[University of South Carolina]] where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[Journalism]].&lt;ref name="From Sketches"&gt;{{cite news | author=Deena C. Bouknight | date= July 1, 2006 | title=From Sketches to Scarves, Her Art Evolves | work=The State Newspaper | page=E3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, she worked in computer graphics and went on to work for six years at the [[South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control]] as the Art Director.&lt;ref name="World Muse"&gt;{{cite journal

| work = Lake Murray Magazine
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeke then worked at [[General Binding Corporation]] (GBC) in outside sales.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt; Just a year after her employment at GBC, she began taking art classes again at the [[Columbia Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt; and used her spare time off work to attend art shows and sell work in Atlanta and Chicago. She also studied under Virginia Anderson and Ginger Munnerlin.&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt; Inspired by the [[French Impressionism|French Impressionist]] masters, she further developed her own loose, abstract style. She was named by [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]'s Red Sky Gallery as an Emerging Artist in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url=http://www.carolinaarts.com/506gallery80808.html | title=Gallery 80808 in Columbia, SC, Features Works by Alicia Leeke | publisher=Shoestring Publishing Company | work=Carolina Arts | date=May 2006 | accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2008, she experimented with her palette by using a technique known as [[Color Field painting]] and began painting city and landscapes in bright, vibrant colors.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt;  She developed a brushstroke style,&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt; using acrylics in a way to give the appearance of oils and included "intense black lines."&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;

Her company underwent a merger in 2008 and she took the opportunity to embark on her dream of becoming a full-time, self-supporting artist.

== Art career ==
Leeke compares a series of art in a body of work to that of multiple product lines in sales. She has paintings produced in a series over time including: abstracts, landscapes, cityscapes, and the most recent conceptual works in digital media.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2014-10-03/News/Alicia_Leeke_embarks_on_conceptual_art_series.html
| title = Alicia Leeke embarks on conceptual art series {{!}} October 3, 2014 {{!}} www.thecolumbiastar.com {{!}} Columbia Star
| website = www.thecolumbiastar.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her travels to paint landscapes during ''[[plein air]]'' painting sessions led her to produce a body of beautiful abstract paintings inspired by nature’s ever-changing scenery. Although some paintings may take up to a year, she generally prefers to make a painting ''[[alla prima]]'', all in one sitting.

More recently, she is inspired by photographers Susan Kae Grant of Texas and John E. Powell of Columbia, SC to produce a body of work combining conceptual art, photography and digital mixed media.

Leeke has also painted and marketed silk scarves and other consumer products, such as mouse pads, coloring books, and greeting cards.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; Leeke has been invited to exhibit her art in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and has art collectors around the globe.

=== Subject, themes, and methods ===
While the majority of her art involves abstract [[cityscape]]s and [[landscape]]s,&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Margaret Gregory | date=October 2009 | url=http://issuu.com/colametro/docs/october2009 | title=Color Her World: Artist Alicia Leeke’s vibrant home | work=Columbia Metropolitan | pages=48–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; she also focuses on conceptual and science-based work.

==== Conceptual work ====
In 2014, she worked on a series of digital mixed media works that address the issues of consumerism and manufacturing excess by society’s overconsumption. Leeke’s concept for the show was to encourage consumers to choose more wisely and spend more for quality merchandise versus throwing it away.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Science-based work ====
Other themes explored in her work are based on science and biology. Leeke was awarded a grant by the Charleston Scientific and Cultural Education Fund to produce a traveling exhibition in 2015 entitled: View from Under the Microscope: Science-based Learning Through Art. The exhibition consists of 18 vibrant, digitally created paintings that educate the non-scientific community about the importance phytoplankton play in relation to all living things on the planet and the need to maintain healthy, sustainable oceans and water bodies.

=== Influence ===
Leeke’s work is inspired by [[South Carolina]]'s coastal landscape as well as Columbia landmarks, New York, [[Paris]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt; The quaint street scenes and sprawling landscapes found in her paintings strive to capture the essence of common events and convert them into lively images of color and movement. During her second trip to [[Montmartre]], [[France]] in 2009, Leeke developed an interest in Fauvism and began to incorporate intense black lines into her work.&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Color Her World" /&gt;

Leeke’s visits to Europe served as inspiration for many of her works. Her Columbia cityscapes often have the charming appeal of street scenes in Paris, like the painting, ''Nonnah’s'', in which she captures Columbia's vista and Paris' personality.&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt;

She has been influenced by the works of French Impressionist masters, such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], [[Georges Rouault]],&lt;ref name="From Sketches" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; [[Edgar Degas]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Piet Mondrian]].&lt;ref name="World Muse" /&gt; She was inspired by the way they conveyed social conscience, history and architecture.&lt;ref name="Saatchi" /&gt;

[[File:Louis Sullivan circa 1895.jpg|thumb|Louis Sullivan circa 1895]]

The '''American Prize for Architecture''',&lt;ref&gt;https://chi-athenaeum.org/american-architecture-prize.html&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the Louis H. Sullivan Award, is bestowed to an outstanding practitioner in the [[United States]] that has emblazoned a new direction in the history of [[Architecture of the United States|American Architecture]] with [[Aptitude|talent]], [[Foresight (psychology)|vision]], and commitment and has demonstrated consistent contributions to humanity through the built environment and through the art of [[architecture]].
 
The [[award]] periodically honors North and South American architects, as well as other global architects practicing on those continents, whose body of architectural work, over time, exemplifies superior design and humanist ideals.
 
==History==
Instituted in 1994 as The [[Louis H. Sullivan]] Award, The American Prize for Architecture honors the spirit of the founder of modernism, Louis Sullivan, and a subsequent generation of [[Chicago]] practitioners as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Daniel Burnham|Daniel H. Burnham]].
 
The American Prize for Architecture was founded in [[Chicago]] by The [[Chicago Athenaeum]]: Museum of Architecture and Design, and is organized jointly with The European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies as a way to broadcast globally the significant contributions of America’s rich and inspiring architecture practice and its legacy to the world at large.
 
The Director of the prize and President of The Chicago Athenaeum, [[Christian Narkiewicz-Laine]], is the curator of the Prize and the Museum solicits nominations from a range of people, including global practitioners, educators, people in business, and the general public.

Early '''architectural photographers''' include [[Roger Fenton]], [[Francis Frith]] (Middle East and Britain), [[Samuel Bourne]] (India) and [[Albert Levy (photographer)|Albert Levy]] (United States and Europe). They paved the way for the modern speciality of [[architectural photography]]. Later architectural photography had practitioners such as [[Ezra Stoller]] and [[Julius Shulman]]. Stoller worked mainly on the east coast of America, having graduated with a degree in architecture in the 1930s. Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, became an architectural photographer after some images that he had taken of one of [[Richard Neutra]]'s houses in California made their way onto the architect's desk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The '''Art School Cheerleaders''' were a [[performance art]] troupe that used cheerleading as a medium for satirical, political and social commentary on the arts and their place in our society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smfa.edu/Gateways/Alumni/Alumni_Profiles/Alumni_Profile_Rebecca_Goldberg_Oliver.asp SMFA Boston - Alumni Profile: Rebecca Goldberg Oliver&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516173106/http://www.smfa.edu/Gateways/Alumni/Alumni_Profiles/Alumni_Profile_Rebecca_Goldberg_Oliver.asp |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Style Weekly May 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally existing as the SMFA Cheerleaders at the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] from 1996-1998, the SMFA Cheerleaders performed at venues such as Banned In Boston, a benefit which included city luminaries such as the mayor of Boston, and the ''[[Car Talk]]'' anniversary show: A Tribute to Click and Clack: Celebrating 20 years of Bad Car Advice. They were featured in numerous publications including the Sunday Boston Globe, the Sunday New York Times, and the August 1997 issue of Playboy, which featured an anti-[[censorship]] cheer that they had penned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/education/a-new-tactic-for-rousing-and-razzing-arts-crowd.html | work=New York Times|date= August 4, 1997|title=A New Tactic for Rousing and Razzing Arts Crowd|author=TONY MARCANO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Sunday Globe, March 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chronicle for Higher Education, April 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Playboy, Aug 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Herald, March 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The SMFA Cheerleaders also performed on the main stage at the Art Now! March on Washington in support of the arts during the massive 1997 [[National Endowment for the Arts]] budget cuts.

Several of the Art School Cheerleaders were also members of [[Bad Girrls Studios]], a popular artist-run Boston gallery that hosted numerous public art events.

The Art Cheerleaders were resurrected in 2007 in [[Richmond, Virginia]] by one of the co-founders of the SMFA group, Rebecca Goldberg, who pulled together and worked with Richmond artists from many genres to advocate for arts funding in the Richmond area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://styleweekly.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=EF80E7024DF94CD8B7C07D52BB7FAD8E |work=Style Weekly|date= May 30, 2007|title=Give Me an "M-F-A!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; This iteration of the group received a Muse Award for Creativity in Business from the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmfa.museum/muse_winners.html | title=2008 VMFA Muse Award Winners|publisher=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314004247/http://www.vmfa.museum/muse_winners.html|archivedate=March 14, 2008 |date=March 7, 2008|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured as the cover story for Richmond Style Weekly's 2007 year-in-review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://styleweekly.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=70D180B897F040D7982D2C5543EE27BF |work=Style Weekly|date= December 26, 2007|title=The Score|author=Scott Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group separated in late 2008 after leading a parade through the City of Richmond commemorating the 30th anniversary of Richmond's oldest non-profit space for new art, the 1708 Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/blog/index.php/2008/09/03/inlight-richmond-celebrates-1708-gallerys-30th-anniversary/ |work=The Hook|date=September 3, 2008|title="InLight Richmond" celebrates 1708 Gallery's 30th Anniversary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">'''Art of Cesar Department''' refers to the expressions of art in the [[Colombia]]n [[Departments of Colombia|Department]] of [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]]. The diverse range of human activities and artifacts, painting, sculpture, printmaking, musical and dance expressions, literature and other forms of visual and auditory arts. 

The art in Cesar Department is sponsored by the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Culture]], and the local [[Department Secretaries of Cesar Department|Department Secretary]] of [[Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports|Education, Culture and Sports]].

==History of art in Cesar Department==

The first expressions of art in the Cesar Department were developed by the indigenous people's traditions, present since their arrival from [[Mesoamerica]] and the Caribbean. Then there are different cultural expressions from the extinct [[Taironas]], the [[Arhuacos]], [[Kankuamos]] mostly present in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] mountain range. The culture of the Arhuacos is specially rich in sawing wool and ''[[fique]]'', drawings on stones, pottery, work on wood, and other handicrafts. 

With [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|the arrival of the Spanish]] the European art expressions were also introduced, and the Spanish also introduced the African slaves who developed their own artistic expressions in the Cesar Department based on their African heritage. Due to the process of independence from Spain and the political struggle that followed, art expressions in Cesar Department decreased, only maintaining some of the indigenous traditional art, poetry, musical expressions that developed like ''[[cumbia]]'' and ''[[vallenato]]''. The musical expression was born from the strong storytelling tradition, inherited from the three cultural expressions of local indigenous peoples, Europeans and African descendants.&lt;ref name="colarte.com"&gt;[http://www.colarte.com/colarte/conspintores.asp?idartista=16675 Colarte.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th Century and with the creation of [[Cesar Department]] the creation of local government secretaries intended to support and develop artistic expressions were created. in the Cesar Department the governor created the [[Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports|Education, Culture and Sports]]. Each municipal administration depending on its budget created a secretary of culture or through an associated institution such as the ''Casa de la Cultura'' (Cultural house) or the ''Escuela de Bellas Artes'' Fine Arts School in [[Valledupar]].

==Painting==

During the 1970s and with the support from the local government and society, many painters, Some of this new generation were represented by [[Walter Arland]], [[Ineris Cuello]], [[Rita Hinojosa]], [[Eivar Moya]], [[Efrain Quintero Molina]], [[Celso Castro]] (also a photographer), [[Franklin Ramos]], [[Maria Liliana Mejia]], [[Jose Anibal Moya]], [[Alvaro Palomino]], among others.&lt;ref name="colarte.com"/&gt;

'''Artexte''' (in French: Centre d'information '''''Artexte''''') is an independent, federally chartered [[not-for-profit]] arts organization in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada. Its principal mandate is to focus on research, interpretation and dissemination initiatives in order to broaden the influence and appreciation of contemporary visual arts. These activities are informed by a significant collection of art documentation and authoritative resources, as well as a network of multidisciplinary partners. Artexte's partnerships and alliances are built with others who also seek to bring attention to the value of documentation produced by the study and practice of [[contemporary art]]. Artexte affirms the presence of experimental, innovative and critical components of this field. Its activities touch on all aspects of contemporary visual art from 1965 to today, with special emphasis placed on [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]].

Through its bilingual reference services and research assistance, the Centre provides a user-friendly interface between its collection and researchers from Canada and abroad.

==History==
Established in 1980 by art historian Francine Périnet and artists [[Angela Grauerholz]] and [[Anne Ramsden]], Artexte began as a bookstore specializing in Canadian and International contemporary art. The organization responded to an essential need in Quebec and Canada for up to date, accurate information on contemporary visual art.
In order to realize their objective of disseminating this information, the founders opened a documentation centre in [[Montreal]]. They then created Artextes Editions, which today comprises about 20 titles. Artexte also set up a national service for the distribution of exhibition catalogues and independent publications on contemporary art. In 1997, this service was transferred to a private business specializing in the distribution of this type of document, ABC Art Books Canada.
In 1993, the bookstore moved into the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal]]. Two years later Artexte let go of its bookstore operations, which were passed on to Librairie Olivieri in September 1995, under a partnership agreement respecting the initial objectives of Artexte's mandate. The Librairie Olivieri du Musée closed its doors in 2009.

In May 1996, Artexte moved to a larger space at 460 Sainte-Catherine Street West. This move marked the beginning of a new era for the organization and its users, by positioning Artexte within the heart of a network frequented by artists and researchers of contemporary art.

In 2012, Artexte moved to new premises in Montreal's vibrant ''Quartier des spectacles''. Artexte now occupies a large, luminous space on the third floor of the 2-22 Building (at 2 Sainte-Catherine Street East). In addition to having a larger consultation area for research purposes than before, it opened a new exhibition space. The gallery's programming is linked to print culture and addresses issues pertaining to visual arts documents.

Artexte has become a renowned arts organization which, by the scope of its activities, responds with a high level of professionalism to the specific needs of the visual arts network in Canada and beyond.

The origins of the Bhagavata Mela are in [[Kuchipudi]], another more ancient classical Indian dance, found in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Projesh Banerji|title=Indian Ballet Dancing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fXZKe3xHQAC&amp;pg=PA42|year=1983|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02716-9|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the region by Islamic armies led to the fall of a Hindu empire, which triggered the mass migration of Hindu performance artist families to Tamil Nadu in 16th century, where the dance evolved into modern Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt; Prior to its fall, the court records of the Deccan region based [[Vijayanagara Empire]] – known for its patronage of the Indian religions and arts – indicate that drama-dance troupes of ''Bhagavatas'' from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}}{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=79-80}} The region saw wars and political turmoil, ending in the formation of Deccan Sultanates in 16th century.&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilkees I.

Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra,&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim [[Nawab]] of [[Golkonda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]], saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dances of India: A General Survey and Dancers' Guide|last=Massey|first=Reginald|last2=Massey|first2=Jamila|publisher=Tricolour Books|year=1989|isbn=0-948725-04-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kuchipudi: Indian Classical Dance Art|last=Kothari|first=Sunil|last2=Pasricha|first2=Avinash|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2001|isbn=9788170173595|location=India|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahsan Jan Qaisar|author2=Som Prakash Verma|author3=Mohammad Habib|title=Art and Culture: Endeavours in Interpretation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hic3XnRU-VgC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-315-1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name="Eraly2000p408"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC |year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-100143-2 |pages=408–409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Khokar|title=Traditions of Indian classical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prjnAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Peter Owen |isbn=978-0-7206-0574-7|pages=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deccan region saw wars and political turmoil with Mughal imperial expansion ending the Deccan Sultanates by the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilkees I. Latif|title=Forgotten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-SCyobP0koC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306454-1|pages=132, 71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, more Bhagavatar community families moved south, invited by the newly established Maratha rajas in the Kaveri delta, to settle in and around Kumbakonam. These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;

==Repertoire==
The Bhagavata Mela is traditionally celebrated in Hindu temple grounds or next to a temple, starting after dusk and through the night, and like the original Kuchipudi artists, male [[Brahmin]]s were the artists who played the role of men and women characters in the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FisherShay2009p388"/&gt; Modern productions include both male and female artists, and has evolved to show influences of both Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam – the main classical dance of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name=brandon10&gt;{{cite book|author1=James R. Brandon|author2=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttnH5W9qoBAC&amp;pg=PA79|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58822-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all classical dances of India, the Bhagavata Mela incorporates sophisticated gestures as sign language combined with intricate footwork and acting (''abhinaya'') to communicate a religious story with spiritual message.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt;&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; These aspects of the Bhagavata Mela have roots in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', the ancient Hindu text on performance arts.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}} The performance includes ''Nritta'', ''Nritya'' and ''Natya''. The ''Nritta'' performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of pure dance.&lt;ref name=koskoff955/&gt; The ''Nritya'' is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=koskoff955&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Koskoff|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73MO0eiQD_EC&amp;pg=PA955 |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-99404-0 |pages=955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Natya'' is a play performed by a team of artists.{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=33-38, 83-84, 207-214}}&lt;ref name="NettlStone1998p516"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruno Nettl|author2=Ruth M. Stone|author3=James Porter et al|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA516|year=1998|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1 |pages=516–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''abhinaya'' are also found in the ''Natyashastra'' text which describes basic units of dance, the gestures and movements that connect with the audience and aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, and transports the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=3-5}}

The communication in Bhagavata Mela is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) synchronized to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt; Like other Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt;

The Bhagavata Mela stories are typically from the Hindu Epics or the [[Puranas]], with ''Prahlada Charitram'' being particularly popular.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt; The music is [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] style, and most of the underlying story is sung to the rhythm of the music while the dance artists perform.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; The repertoire is aided by an orchestra of musical instruments, with [[mridangam]] (drum) and cymbals providing the beat, and flute, string instruments and harmonium completing the ensemble.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt;

==History==
In 1933, a department was founded within the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]] for the conservation of the ruins of antiquity. After the establishment of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] in 1971, the department became an office of this new ministry. Following a series of name changes, finally in 200, it was renamed "Cultural Assets and Museums Department" ({{lang-tr|Kültür Varlıkları ve Müzeler Genel Müdürlüğü}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,43034/tarihce.html Page of the department {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The Committees on Conservation of Cultural Assets are province-based subdivisions of this department at the ministry. (''see'' [[SİT areas in Turkey]])

==List of committees==
Currently, there are 34 provincial committees:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,43078/kultur-varliklarini-koruma-bolge-kurulu-mudurlukleri.html Committee list]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bertall ill Les Cygnes sauvages1.png|thumb|Vignette de Les Cygnes sauvages par Bertall représentant la princesse Élisa et les trois crapauds. (Thumbnail of The Wild Swans by Bertall representing the Princess Eliza and three toads.)]]
'''Crapaud''' is a [[French language|French]] word meaning "[[toad]]" in [[English language|English]].
==Heraldry==
Crapaud is sometimes used as an incorrect reference to the [[Fleur-de-lys]] on the ancient [[Heraldry|heraldic]] flag of the kings of France. The three fleurs-de-lys were sometimes misinterpreted as "three toads erect, saltant", instead of "three [[Lilium|lily flowers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|isbn=1840223103|pages=438–439|author=Ebenezer Cobham Brewer|year=2001|quote=Fleur-de-lis, -lys, or -luce (Fr. lily-flower), which is the name of several varieties of iris, and also of the heractic lily, which is here shown and which was borne as a charge on the old French royal coat-of-arms. In the reign of Louis VII (1137–80) the national standard was thickly charged with flowers. In 1365 the number was reduced by Charles VI to ''three'' (the mystical church number). Guillim, in his ''Display of Heraldrie'', 1611, says the device is "Three toads erect, saltant".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
The word ''crapaud'' is used extensively by fictional British soldier [[Richard Sharpe (fictional character)|Richard Sharpe]] as a derogatory term for the French in [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s novels set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen J. Millington. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jPRsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 Heraldry in history, poetry, and romance]''. Chapman and Hall; 1858 [cited 27 September 2012]. p. 8–.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jean Crapaud==
'''Jean Crapaud''', also Johnny Crappeau or Johnny Crappo, as defined by ''Webster's Online Dictionary'', "is a [[wiktionary:jocose|jocose]] name given to a Frenchman. It is intended as a national personification of the French people as a whole in much the same sense as [[John Bull]] is to the [[England|English]]. It is sometimes used as a literary device to refer to a typical Frenchman, usually in the form of ''Monsieur Jean Crapaud''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/Jean+Crapaud Jean Crapaud.] Webster's Online Dictionary. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the word "crapaud" in this case is similar to the [[list of ethnic slurs#F|derogative use of the word]] "[[wikt:frog#English|frog]]", referencing the supposed French affinity for [[frog legs]] as a delicacy, and thus considered to be a [[pejorative|slur]] and [[derogative]].

== Jersey Crapaud ==

The name ''Crapaud'' is used in the [[Channel Islands]] to describe a person from [[Jersey]] in a derogatory way, the name meaning ''toad'' in the local [[Patois]] languages, including [[Jèrriais]] and [[Guernésiais]]. Toads live in Jersey but not on the other islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-29530886 |title=Jersey toad is unique species, say experts |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crucifixion''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Giovanni Bellini]], created around 1455–1460. It is housed in the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice]].

The work was originally in the church of [[San Salvador, Venice|San Salvador]] of Venice, and is part of the [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]-influenced phase of Bellini's early career.

==Description==
The painting shows the crucified Jesus, portrayed with a very pale skin, on a broad landscape background. The deep blue sky is populated by [[cherubim]]s who are weeping his death. In the lower part are Mary and St. John. 

The background shows several details, including a lake with a wooden bridge, a quarry, small houses and a series of small working figures. Such a fragmented, detailed composition was typical of [[Jacopo Bellini]], the artist's father, and was replaced by a more coherent one in Bellini's later works. Other elements typical of his early works are the rather crude painting strokes, the thin figures and the sharp lines.

Amphora depicting the abduction of Iphigenia by Artemis
]]
[[Iphigenia]] was the daughter of [[Agamemnon]] and [[Clytemnestra]].  According to the story, Agamemnon committed a mistake and had to sacrifice Iphigenia to Artemis to appease her.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_iphigenia_aulis.html|title=Ancient Literature|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different versions of the story. According to one side of the story, before Agamemnon could sacrifice her, Artemis saved her and replaced her with a deer on the altar. In the other version, Agamemnon actually went through with the sacrifice. The different versions aid in the different depictions of Iphigenia.

The death of Iphigenia is immortalized on many different mediums. Vases are a common base for the story, but there are mosaics, paintings, and written works from every era illustrating the myth of Iphigenia. The most common scene depicted in the different visual media of Iphigenia is when she about to be offered up to Artemis on the altar.

== Descriptions of the death by Pausanias  ==
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Paisanias]] was a traveler who wrote the ''Description of Greece'' which depicted his accounts of what he has seen on mainland Greece.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient-literature.com/greece_euripides_iphigenia_aulis.html|title=Iphigenia at Aulis - Euripides - Ancient Greece - Classical Literature|website=www.ancient-literature.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded a few depictions of the death of Iphigenia. He mentions that the temple of Artemis was where the sacrifice was to take place. He goes on to describe the temple of Artemis after its destruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pausanias's Description of Greece, Volume 5|last=|author=Pausanias|publisher=Macmillan and Company|year=1913|isbn=|location=University of Michigan|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias then gives an example of an artistic depiction of Iphigenia that was found in Catalonia. In the mosaic, Iphigenia is being led to the altar and it is seen that Artemis is in the back waiting and holding a deer to replace Iphigenia with.

There are several vases that were made and decorated with illustrations of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The volute krater shown was made in Apulia around 370 BC-350 BC. It is in the red-figure technique. Here the sacrifice is about to take place, with the altar depicted in white. Agamemnon is also painted here with a knife in his hand, showing that he about to commit the sacrifice. Artemis and Apollo are also illustrated. Artemis is looking down upon Iphigenia and Apollo is seated on a rock to the left, looking back. Death is imminent because the offering is going to be made with an audience around.

Recently, a mosaic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.gr/2017/07/1800-year-old-mosaic-found-in-ancient.html#bSMLXjICdkTwhict.97|title=1,800 year old mosaic found in ancient Greek city of Perge|work=The Archaeology News Network|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicting Iphigenia was found in Perge, Turkey during an excavation by archeologists. It is said to be about 1,800 years old. The mosaic shows Iphigenia during the Trojan War. It was concluded that the site was a cult area founded in the basement of a shop that could have existed during the days of Ancient Greece. In this depiction, Iphigenia is replaced by a deer, harrowingly missing death.

=== ''[[Iphigenia in Aulis]]'' ===
''Iphigenia in Aulis'' is a play written by a Greek playwright [[Euripides]]. It revolves around Agamemnon's decision to sacrifice his daughter's life for Artemis. In this account of the story, Iphigenia actually dies. It is written through the eyes of Agamemnon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Euripides|last=McClure|first=Laura|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=9781119257516|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0108:card=80&amp;highlight=iphigenia|title=Euripides, Iphigenia in Aulis|last=Coleridge|first=E.P.|date=1891|website=Perseus Tufts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death is a main theme in this play because of the Iphigenia's circumstance, but also because the Trojan war is on the cusp.

=== ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' ===
Iphigenia in Tauris is another play written by Euripides. In this telling of the tale, Iphigenia is not dead, and she meets with her brother. She is made a priestess in the temple of Artemis of the Taurians She recounts her story and tells how she arrived to the place by the hands of Artemis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0006.tlg013.perseus-eng1:1-41|title=Euripides, Iphigenia in Tauris|last=Potter|first=Robert|date=1938|website=Perseus Tufts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iphigenia conducts rites as a priestess to Artemis. Although, Iphigenia has eluded death in this play, it is still a theme and effects the tone because of it was the beginning of a domino effect for the play.

The '''dithyramb''' ({{lang-grc|διθύραμβος}}, ''dithyrambos'') was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[hymn]] sung and danced in honor of [[Dionysus]], the god of [[wine]] and [[fertility]]; the term was also used as an [[epithet]] of the god:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2326816 Dithurambos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus. ''Dithyrambos'' seems to have arisen out of the hymn: just as ''paean'' was both a hymn to and a title of [[Apollo]], ''Dithyrambos'' was an [[epithet]] of Dionysos as well as a song in his honour; see Harrison (1922, 436).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]'', while discussing various kinds of music mentions "the birth of Dionysos, called, I think, the dithyramb."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'',  iii.700 B.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also remarks in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that dithyrambs are the clearest example of poetry in which the poet is the only speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=Republic|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D3%3Asection%3D394c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in [[Apology (Plato)|The Apology]] Socrates went to the dithyrambs with some of their own most elaborate passages, asking their meaning but got a response of, "Will you believe me?" which "showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|title=The Republic &amp;#124; Edited by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler |url=http://www.feedbooks.com/book/678/apology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] contrasted the dithyramb's wild and [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstatic]] character with the [[paean]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Ei at Delphi''. Plutarch himself was a priest of Dionysos at Delphi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], the dithyramb was the origin of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (1449a10–15): "Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the [[Fertility rite|phallic processions]] which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature"; see Janko (1987, 6).&lt;/ref&gt; A wildly enthusiastic speech or piece of writing is still occasionally described as ''dithyrambic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dithyrambic Definition of dithyrambic]. [[TheFreeDictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dithyrambs were sung by choirs at [[Delos]], but the literary fragments that have survived are largely [[Classical Athens|Athenian]]. In Athens, dithyrambs were sung by a [[Greek chorus]] of up to fifty men or boys dancing in circular formation, who may or may not have been dressed as [[Satyr]]s, probably accompanied by the ''[[aulos]]''. They would normally relate some incident in the life of [[Dionysus]] or just celebrate wine and fertility.

The ancient Greeks laid out the criteria of the dithyramb as follows:
* special rhythm
* ''[[aulos]]'' accompaniment in [[Phrygian mode]] &lt;ref&gt;Harvey (1955). [[Aristotle]] records the failed attempt to set it in [[Dorian mode]], in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (8.7).&lt;/ref&gt;
* enriching text
* considerable narrative content
* originally [[Antistrophe|antistrophic character]]

Competitions between groups singing and dancing dithyrambs were an important part of the festivals of Dionysis, such as the [[Dionysia]] and [[Lenaia]]. Each tribe would enter two choirs, one of men and one of boys, each under the leadership of a ''[[coryphaeus]]''. The names of the winning teams of dithyrambic contests in Athens were recorded. The successful ''[[choregos]]'' would receive a statue that would be erected—at his expense—as a public monument to commemorate the victory. However, most of the poets remain unknown.

The earliest mention of dithyramb, found by [[Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge|Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb, Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in a fragment of [[Archilochus]], who flourished in the first half of the seventh century BCE: "I know how to lead the fair song of the Lord Dionysus, the dithyramb, when my wits are fused with wine." As a literary composition for chorus, their inspiration is unknown, although it was likely Greek, as [[Herodotus]] explicitly speaks of [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] as "the first of men we know to have composed the dithyramb and named it and produced it in [[Corinth]]".&lt;ref&gt;Pickard-Cambridge, Sir Arthur Wallace. 1927. ''Dithyramb Tragedy and Comedy''. Second edition revised by T.B.L. Webster, 1962. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-814227-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''dithyramb'' has no known origin, but is frequently assumed to not be derived from Greek.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] eymology (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 333–4).&lt;/ref&gt; An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] or [[Pelasgian language|Pelasgian]], and literally means "Vierschritt", i.&amp;nbsp;e., "four-step", compare ''[[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]]'' and ''[[thriambus]]'', but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation.&lt;ref name="Versnel1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Versnel|first=H. S.|title=Triumphus: An Inquiry Into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPjBSq2jCrcC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=2 January 2015|year=1970|publisher=Brill Publishers|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=90-04-02325-9|pages=16–38|chapter=I. 2 Θρίαμβος}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dithyrambs were composed by the poets [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]] and [[Bacchylides]], as well as [[Pindar]] (the only one whose works have survived in anything like their original form).

Later examples were dedicated to other gods, but the dithyramb subsequently was developed (traditionally by [[Arion]]) into a literary form.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, (1998, 48).&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] developed from the dithyramb; the two forms developed alongside one another for some time. The clearest sense of dithyramb as proto-tragedy comes from a surviving dithyramb by Bacchylides, though it was composed after tragedy had already developed fully.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/ClasDram/chapters/042reading1dithyramb.htm USU.edu] and [http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm UFL.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727023728/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/kvhrtgn/CLT%20Readings/A%20DITHYRAMB.htm |date=2006-07-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacchylides' dithyramb is a dialogue between a solitary singer and a choir. It is suggestive of what tragedy may have resembled before [[Aeschylus]] added a second actor instead of the choir.

In the later 5th century BCE, the dithyramb "became a favorite vehicle for the musical experiments of the poets of the 'new music'."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher G. Brown, "Dithyramb," in N.G. Wilson (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This movement included the poets [[Timotheus of Miletus]], [[Cinesias (poet)|Cinesias]], [[Melanippides]], and [[Philoxenus of Cythera]]. By the 4th century BCE the [[genre]] was in decline, although the dithyrambic competitions did not come to an end until well after the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] takeover of Greece.

==Modern dithyrambs==
Dithyrambs are rare in [[English language]] literature. In [[German literature]] they appear more frequently, and from the 19th century several compositions were inspired by them.

===Literature===
[[John Dryden]]'s ''[[Alexander's Feast (Dryden)|Alexander's Feast]]'' (1697) is a notable example of an English language dithyramb.

[[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote a ''Dithyrambe'' in 1796. [[Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]] composed a set of ''[[Dionysian-Dithyrambs|Dionysos-Dithyramben]]'' in 1888/89.&lt;ref&gt;See the comprehensive commentary in [[Andreas Urs Sommer]], Kommentar zu Nietzsches Der Antichrist. Ecce homo. Dionysos-Dithyramben. Nietzsche contra Wagner (= Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Hg.): Historischer und kritischer Kommentar zu Friedrich Nietzsches Werken, vol. 6/2), Berlin / Boston: Walter de Gruyter 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and dance===
From the 19th century dithyrambs appear frequently in [[classical music]], as well in vocal as instrumental compositions.

[[Franz Schubert]] wrote a song for bass voice based on Schiller's ''Dithyrambe'' ({{D.}} 801, published as Op. 60 No. 2 in 1826). Schubert's earlier attempt at setting the same poem for a more extended vocal ensemble had remained unfinished ({{D.|number=47}}, 1813). [[Johann Friedrich Reichardt]] (in ''Schillers lyrische Gedichte'' volume 2, published around 1809) and [[Wilhelm Taubert]] (Op. 144 No. 2, 1864) were other composers setting Schiller's poem. Other composers basing vocal music on dithyrambs include [[Giuseppe Verdi]] ("[[Brindisi (Song Verdi)|Brindisi]]", No. 6 of his 1845 ''[[Album di Sei Romanze (Verdi)|Album di Sei Romanze]]''), and [[Max Bruch]] (Op. 39, {{circa}} 1871). [[Othmar Schoeck]]'s 1911 [[List of compositions by Othmar Schoeck#Lieder|''Dithyrambe'', Op.&amp;nbsp;22]] is based on an unnamed verse by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;''Werk- und Nachlassverzeichnis Othmar Schoeck (1886 – 1957)''. Zentralbibliothek Zürich. p. 29. See also [http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_text.html?TextId=6588 Dithyrambe 'Alles geben die Götter, die unendlichen'] at The LiederNet Archive, and: Marcel Reich-Ranicki. [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/frankfurter-anthologie/marcel-reich-ranicki-in-der-frankfurter-anthologie-alles-geben-die-goetter-von-johann-wolfgang-von-goethe-12603935.html "„Alles geben die Götter“ von Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"] in ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 4 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumental dithyrambs were composed by [[Robert Volkmann]] and [[Hermann Ritter]]. [[Nikolai Medtner]] composed several dithyrambs, including a set of three for solo piano as his Opus 10. Additionally, the final movement of his first violin sonata carries the title, and the last of his ''Vergessene Weisen'' Op. 40 is a ''Danza ditirambica''.

The last movement of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''Duo Concertant'' for violin and piano is entitled ''Dithyrambe''. [[Richard Edward Wilson]]'s 1983 ''Dithyramb'' is for oboe and clarinet. [[Wolfgang Rihm]] composed a 30-minute work, ''Concerto'', in 2000, with the subtitle ''Dithyrambe'' and a scoring for string quartet and orchestra. 

In 1961 the American choreographer [[James Waring]] created a dance piece entitled ''Dithyramb'' with music and objects by the Fluxus artist [[George Brecht]].

A '''feminist blog''' presents the issues of [[feminism]] through a [[blog]]. Feminist blogs serve the purpose of spreading ideas, sparking debates, raising awareness, discussing opinions, sharing stories, and virtually spreading the notion of feminism throughout the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Gunnarrsun Payne, “Feminist Media As Alternative Media? A Literature Review” Interface: A Journal For And About Social Movements, no. 1 (2009): 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feministing]] consciously includes differing types of blogs, news sources, and organizations providing the site’s commitment to diversity in all aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica M. Mowles, "Framing Issues, Fomenting Change, 'Feministing': A Contemporary Feminist Blog in the Landscape of Online Political Activism, International Reports on Socio-Informatics, vol. 5, issue 1 (2008): 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on feminism==
These blogs have also empowered women in the media field, which still remains largely male dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Hamilton, "Feminist testimony in the internet age: sex work, blogging and the politics of witnessing" Journal of Romance Studies, no. 9 (2009) 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global impact==

With feminist blogging, women can have a voice to speak up about their opinions and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows them to openly discuss about their situation with confidence and can help avoid being seen as silent or submissive. By blogging, it is seen as an effective method in getting the involvement of others or getting the attention of politically active people. With women discussing about events confidently, it allows a community of like minded individuals to understand what is occurring around the world and how they can get involved with different issues. With blogging, there is empowerment to make a difference within governments and international communities by getting involved through blogging. Feminist blogging is seen as a public activity that allows anyone to see a situation from a different viewpoint. Unlike traditional forms of media that discusses situations through a specific view that may appear to be male influence or avoids discussing about it, the information through feminist blogs is seen as transparent rather than edited for appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With feminist blogging, there is an increase in activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many critics{{who|date=October 2015}} argue that nothing gets accomplished, feminist blogging encourages activism. Women use blogging as a method to get information and understanding of concepts or issues. Feminist blogging allows an individual who is in a community that does not understand or have much knowledge of the issues that many women go through. So, it allows individuals to get the information that many news resources may not cover and allows individuals to see through a difference perspective gaze. The gaze is not through a Western perspective, but rather a perspective of women living in that country with different cultural beliefs than Western societies. With women blogging about their opinions and hardships they endure, their personal problems become political and international as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shepherd |first1=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-45388-2|pages=326-346|author2=M. Franklin|authorlink=Sex, Gender and Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=978-0-415-45388-2&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |deadurl=no |accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist blogging can be seen as an essential method in the democratization of women through online activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist blogging allows individuals to understand that activism in the modern era has changed. It allows individuals to incorporate social issues, such as feminism, into political activism and, allows for people to discover different forms of feminist theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Z|title=Julie|url=http://thefbomb.org/2013/03/technology-and-the-future-of-feminism/|work=Technology and the Future of Feminism|publisher=fbomb|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of feminist blogs==
There are many different types of feminist blogs on the Internet. Some of the most common types of feminist blogs include: Personal, Topical, Collaborative, Political, Corporate, and Advice.&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Tobias, “Blog This! An Introduction to Blogs, Blogging, and the Feminist Blogosphere” Feminist Collections, no. 26 (2005): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through [[Feministing]], feminism ideologies of the third-wave era conjoins with political activism to substantially reshape the way in which we look at political discourse. conventional political discourse. Feministing aims at creating awareness and serving as a platform open for blogger commentary on an array of political issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica M. Mowles, "Framing Issues, Fomenting Change, 'Feministing': A Contemporary Feminist Blog in the Landscape of Online Political Activism, International Reports on Socio-Informatics, vol. 5, issue 1 (2008): 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
Different feminist blogs have different rules for participating in the discussion boards and comment boxes. Feminist blogs aim to keep a neutral yet expressive atmosphere in the blog realm since many discussed issues can be very controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth K. Keenan, “Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture”, no. 14 (2010): 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Since blogging is part of the World Wide Web, the atmosphere is not always positive. People of any standpoint can express their opinions and voice their thoughts on specific topics. Blogging can be dangerous in terms of discussing some controversial feminist issues such as abortion etc. because the environment is open to anyone, it can become very opinionated and discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa C. Gregg, “Feeling Ordinary: Blogging As Controversial Scholarship” Last modified November 6, 2006, http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:7740/FeelingOrdinary.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fruits on a Table''''' or '''''Still Life with Apples and Grapes''''' ( ''Nature Morte a la Comptesse de N'') is a [[still life]] painting by French artist [[Paul Gauguin]] painted in 1889.&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/sicilian-autoworker-decorated-kitchen-with-a-gauguin/story-e6frg6so-1226873084750|title=Sicilian autoworker decorated kitchen with a Gauguin|date=3 April 2014|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of two works stolen from the private collection of Terence F.

==Description==
The painting depicts two bowls of brightly coloured apples and grapes on a fringed white linen cloth on a wooden table with a small dog sleeping on the floor in the background. It is signed and dedicated "a la Comptesse De N (Nimal)".&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/uk-italy-gauguin-theft-idUKBREA311H620140402|title=Stolen Gauguin painting found in Italian retiree's kitchen|date=2 April 2014|author=Eleanor Biles|work=Reuters UK edition |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=December 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209141304/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/04/02/uk-italy-gauguin-theft-idUKBREA311H620140402|archivedate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Provenance==
The painting, along with [[Pierre Bonnard]]'s ''Woman With Two Armchairs'' (''La Femme Aux Deux Fauteuils''), was stolen from the home of widower Terence F. Kennedy (his wife Mathilda died in 1964) in [[Regent’s Park]] on June 6, 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top five long-lost art masterpieces|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10906999/Top-five-long-lost-art-masterpieces.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 June 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Press reports at the time said that Mr Kennedy's housekeeper was duped by three men, one posing as a policeman and the others as burglar alarm engineers, and that they cut the paintings from their frames while she was making them tea.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; After the theft the paintings are alleged to have been smuggled through France on the Paris-to-Turin train,&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt; and then to have turned up in the lost-and-found railway depot in Turin. It is said they were auctioned in 1975 and that a worker at the Fiat Factory bought the paintings for a small sum.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;
 
==Recovery==
The paintings are said to have remained in the factory worker's kitchen until an art expert's evaluation in 2014. Once they were identified the [[Carabinieri]] took the paintings into custody. Under Italian law the factory worker could have a right to keep them if he could prove that he bought them in good faith.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref  &gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2595166/Two-paintings-worth-30million-stolen-London-Italian-factory-workers-kitchen-40-years-later.html|title=Two paintings worth £30m - including one by Gaugin - that were stolen from London home in 1970 are found 40 YEARS later in an Italian factory worker's kitchen (after he paid £20 for them) |author=Simon Tomlinson |accessdate=7 April 2014|date=2 April 2014  |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-26848889|title=Stolen Gauguin painting 'hung on factory worker's wall' |author= |accessdate=7 April 2014|date=2 April 2014 |work= |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 they were returned to him by a court in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=12 December 2014 |title=Italian pensioner awarded ownership of Gauguin stolen from London flat |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11289980/Italian-pensioner-awarded-ownership-of-Gauguin-stolen-from-London-flat.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Rome |access-date=4 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simultaneously, the sole and universal heir of the original owner, Mr Terence F. Kennedy, was found and has since made his claim to title.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/2015/british-heir-challenges-italian-factory-worker-s-claim-over-stolen-25m-gauguin/ Article in Antiques Trade Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geriten''', or "head-house", is the skull-house of the [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo people]] of [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It is a pavilion-like structure with a distinctively shaped roof that acted as an [[ossuary]] where skulls of chiefs and important individuals are preserved after their deaths. 

==Structure and function==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten model van een Karo-Batak schedelhuis TMnr 137-14.jpg|thumb|left|The most common type of geriten has a seating platform below its roof.]]
Geriten is a [[Batak Karo language|Batak Karo]] term for [[Ossuary|ossuaries]]. A geriten took many forms, but most commonly it is shaped as a miniature version of the [[Batak_architecture#Karo_architecture|Batak Karo house]]. A geriten may be small-sized or shaped like a pavilion where people may take a rest or do mundane activities below the roof. A geriten may also be designed on top of a Karo house as a sort of roof [[finial]].{{sfn|Domenig|2014|p=195}} 

The most common types of geriten are those which are raised on a single or multiple posts of moderate heights; with a seating platform under its roof. This type is normally 2.5 x 2.5 meters in width.{{sfn|Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|p=32}} The space below the geriten is used as a meeting point for youngsters or resting place for travelers.{{sfn|Domenig|2014|p=195}}

Geriten's roof shape is similar to Karo house architecture. The skulls of chiefs and important individuals were placed near the roof. [[Water buffalo]] figureheads were the standard ridge ornaments of Karo house roofs in general, however in mortuary structures such as the geriten, sometimes the buffalo figureheads were replaced with finely carved wooden boards representing plant motifs, or by small flags. A short distance inward of the roof-ridge, behind where the neck part of the buffalo figurehead usually rises, another plant-like carving is attached, depicted as growing upward and outward. In the middle of the ridge, two similar plant-like forms rise. A model of a geriten displayed in the [[Linden Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]] has a long vertical pole stabilized by two shorter ones in the center of the ridge. This pole is topped with a plume of [[Arenga pinnata|ijuk fibers]]. A similar bunch of ijuk fibers appears on top of a tower-like mortuary structure for a Karo chief. This plume may have emphasized that the structure was intended to be visited by spirits, as opposed to the normal Karo houses.{{sfn|Domenig|2014|p=412}} 

A geriten may assume the status of a village shrine when the skulls of the village founder and his ruling male descendants and their wives{{clarification needed|reason=Whose wives? This looks, based on how it appears in the sentence, like it refers to the wives of the village founder, but it seems more likely that it is supposed to refer to the wives of both the founder and his ruling male descendants.|date=November 2017}} are kept below its roof. In 1883, Hagen noted a geriten in the village of Nagasaribu, which was dedicated to the guardian ancestor spirit of the village.{{sfn|Domenig|2014|p=195}}

==Decline==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het wooncomplex van Pa Mbelga met schedelhuis (geriten) en duiventil te Kabandjahe TMnr 60038147.jpg|thumb|right|Many geriten on top of this Batak Karo housing complex served as a kind of finials in [[Kabanjahe]], [[North Sumatra]].]]
A geriten is a perishable structure. Offerings around a geriten are made only for a limited time after a person's death. Very often it became neglected after it had served in the final funeral ceremony. Many geriten were left to decay under the elements even in the late 19th-century. Larger geriten, such as those used to place the remains of the chief, were usually the only ones that were maintained by the villagers.{{sfn|Domenig|2014|p=412}} The tradition is in decline and geritens have become a rare sight.{{sfn|Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|p=32}}

The '''''Hamburg Dramaturgy''''' ({{lang-de|Hamburgische Dramaturgie}}) is a highly influential work on [[drama]] by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], written between 1767 and 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not originally conceived as a unified and systematical book, but rather as series of essays on the theater, which Lessing wrote as commentary on the short-lived [[Hamburg National Theatre|Hamburg National Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Barr)|first=Nisbet, H. B. (Hugh|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. In many ways, the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' defined the new field of [[dramaturgy]], and also introduced the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/lessingdra.htm|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing: Hamburgische Dramaturgie (1767)|publisher=[[University of Duisburg]]|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time Lessing wrote the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy,'' there was a new movement of German theatre, based on self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were beginning to perform the inner and outer lives of their characters at the same time. One of Lessing's most famous and renowned quotes from the compilation considers the responsibilities of the actor and the playwright: “The great discernment of the drama critic lies in his ability to distinguish, whenever he feels pleasure or displeasure, to what extent that feeling should be credited to the writer or to the actor”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/notice/|title=Lessing’s Preface to the "Hamburg Dramaturgy" {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic to reflect on the Hamburg National Theater's efforts was conceived by the theatre's founder [[Johann Friedrich Löwen]], and [[Abel Seyler]], "the power behind the throne," who at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Nisbet|first=H. B. (Hugh Barr)|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the plays of the new German Bourgeoisie theatre became more detailed and complicated, the audience often felt confused or left out; Lessing’s development of the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' was in part a reaction to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stegemann|first1=Bernd|title=On German dramaturgy|publisher=Routledge|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics covered by Lessing in the series of essays include Aristotle's theory of tragedy, acting theory, the role of theater in society, the means by which theater achieves its emotional effects, criticism of the actor and the play, issues of translation, and a nascent theory of the psychology of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldyga|first=Natalya|date=May 2017|title=Corporeal Eloquence and Sensate Cognition: G.

== Analysis of actors ==

The analysis of the actor, according to Lessing, is grey area for a dramaturge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/essay-101-102-103-104/|title=Essay 101, 102, 103, &amp; 104 {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|last=|first=|date=|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|at=§17|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know that with an actor's performance, the circumstances are a large factor to the performance, whereas, for example, the text itself is easier to judge because it simply involves literary analysis. When analyzing an actor's performance, current events, environment, and mentality of the actor must all be taken into account. When Lessing published his essays, numerous actors from Hamburg plays were upset with Lessing's carelessness and disregard of their talents in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Stegemann, “On German dramaturgy.” In The Routledge Companion to Dramturgy, ed. Magda Romanska (New York: Routledge, 2015), 45.

== Translations ==

In 1890, Helen Zimmern published an English translation of the text, which was re-published by Dover in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hamburg Dramaturgy|last=Lessing|first=G. E.|publisher=Dover|year=1962|isbn=|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Zimmern|translator-first=Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmern's translation omits nearly 30% of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translators [[Wendy Arons]] and Sara Figal, with editor Natalya Baldyga, are producing a new, complete, and fully annotated translation of the text; the essays are being [http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/ published online at MediaCommons Press] and will be published in print form by [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Routledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/|title=Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessing's collection of essays are still being used as references today for the topic of dramaturgy, especially as a reference for art of theatre as an outlet for self-reflection, and how circumstances of the era during which a play was written affects how the audience perceives the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''He's Just Not That Into You''''' is a [[self-improvement]] book written by [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]] that was published in 2004 and later adapted into a film by the [[He's Just Not That Into You (film)|same name]] in 2009. It was a [[New York Times bestseller]] and was featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.

== Background ==
The book was inspired by an episode of ''[[Sex and the City]],'' "Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little", in which [[Miranda Hobbes]] asks [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s boyfriend, [[Jack Berger]], to analyze the post-date behavior of a potential love interest. Because the man declined Miranda's invitation to come up to her apartment after the date, stating that he has an early meeting, Berger concludes, "He's just not that into you", adding, "When a guy's really into you, he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting." The book authors, [[Greg Behrendt]] and [[Liz Tuccillo]], were writers on the show.

==Synopsis==
The book is a "self-help" guide aimed for single women. The premise of the book, as stated in the title, tells women readers that if a man in whom you are interested is not making the effort to pursue you, he is simply "just not that into you."

== Film ==
{{main|He's Just Not That Into You (film)}}

A film based on the book was released by [[New Line Cinema]] on February 6, 2009. Produced by [[Flower Films]] (Drew Barrymore's production company), filming was completed at the end of 2007. The film was released in theaters February 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.msn.com/movies/movie.aspx?m=2119539&amp;mp=syn |title=He's Just Not That Into You (2009) - Synopsis&amp;nbsp;— MSN Movies |publisher=Entertainment.msn.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Kwapis]] directed the film, which featured an all-star cast including [[Ben Affleck]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Ginnifer Goodwin]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], and [[Justin Long]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/fullcredits#cast|title=IMDB for He's Just Not That Into You}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing over $180 million worldwide.

== In popular culture ==

The book appears in ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' episode "Pulp Friction", when [[Lorelai Gilmore]] prepares the Dragon Fly Inn's library for her interview and states that all of the good books are gone, leaving her with five copies of ''He's Just Not That Into You'', which she hands an employee to dispose of. The book was also referenced in the movie ''[[Zombieland]]'', in season two of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'' and in TV series "[[Vexed]]".

'''Hendrick van Anthonissen''' (29 May 1605 - 12 November 1656) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Marine art|marine painter]].

==Biography==
Van Anthonissen was born and died in [[Amsterdam]].  He was the son of [[Aert Anthonisz]] (a.k.a. Aart van Antum) and painted in the style of his brother-in-law and teacher [[Jan Porcellis]] and of [[Jan van Goyen]]. He is the author of sea paintings in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and the [[National Gallery in Prague|Prague Gallery]], which through their signatures have been ascribed to a mythical Hendrik van Antem. In the 1630s he lived in The Hague, Leiden, and Leiderdorp, but from 1642 he was back in Amsterdam. He is known for beach scenes and seascapes in the manner of Jan Porcellis, sometimes in [[grisaille]]. He was the father of the marine painter [[Arnoldus van Anthonissen]].

==Notable works==
In 2014 one of Anthonissen's paintings ''View of Scheveningen Sands'', which was painted in 1641, underwent conservation at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]]. Restoration work uncovered a beached whale in the picture which had been obscured before 1873, when it was donated to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |title=Restoration reveals hidden whale in 17th-century Dutch painting |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/04/restoration-hidden-whale-dutch-painting |accessdate=5 June 2014 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/hidden-beached-whale-revealed-17th-century-dutch-painting-120128166.html |title=Hidden Beached Whale Revealed in 17th-Century Dutch Painting |publisher=''[[LiveScience]]'' (via ''[[Yahoo!]]'') |author=Megan Gannon |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermeneutics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɜːr|m|ə|ˈ|nj|uː|t|ɪ|k|s}})&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hermeneutics "hermeneutics"]. ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is the theory and [[methodology]] of interpretation,&lt;ref name="ahd"&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=hermeneutics American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hermeneutics Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; especially the interpretation of [[Biblical hermeneutics|biblical texts]], [[wisdom literature]], and [[Philosophy|philosophical texts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |last= Audi|first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521637228 |pages=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion|last=Reese |first=William L. |year=1980 |publisher=Harvester Press |location=Sussex |isbn=0855271477 |page= 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermeneutics#Modern hermeneutics|Modern hermeneutics]] includes both verbal and non-verbal communication&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy in Organization Studies'', Routledge, 2015, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN"&gt;Joann McNamara, ''From Dance to Text and Back to Dance: A Hermeneutics of Dance Interpretive Discourse'', PhD thesis, Texas Woman's University, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[semiotics]], [[presupposition]]s, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or [[exegesis]], of [[Religious texts|scripture]], and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to  Philosophical Hermeneutics|last=Grondin|first=Jean|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-300-05969-8}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''hermeneutics'' and ''exegesis'' are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and non-verbal&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN" /&gt; communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.

Hermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, [[double hermeneutic]]).

==Etymology==
''Hermeneutics'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύω}} (''hermēneuō'', "translate, interpret"),&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A complete etymological dictionary of the English language: dealing with the origin of words and their sense development, thus illustrating the history of civilization and culture'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2000, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύς}} (''hermeneus'', "translator, interpreter"), of uncertain etymology ([[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] (2009) suggests a [[Pre-Greek]] origin).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical term {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεία}} (''hermeneia'', "interpretation, explanation") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of [[Aristotle]]'s work {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας}} ("Peri Hermeneias"), commonly referred to by its Latin title ''[[De&amp;nbsp;Interpretatione]]'' and translated in English as  ''On Interpretation''. It is one of the earliest (c.&amp;nbsp;360&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;) extant philosophical works in the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]] to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of "hermeneutics" places it within the boundaries of the [[sacred]].&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Divinity|divine]] message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). ''Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk etymology===
[[File:Hermes Musei Capitolini MC60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Hermes]]'', messenger of the gods.]]
[[Folk etymology]] places its origin with [[Hermes]], the mythological Greek [[deity]] who was the 'messenger of the gods'.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy"&gt;Hoy, David Couzen (1981). The Critical Circle. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0520046399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a mediator between the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the [[Hades|underworld]] upon death.

Hermes was also considered to be the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief and a trickster.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; The Greek view of language as consisting of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.

===Mesopotamian hermeneutics===
{{See|Exegesis#Mesopotamian Commentaries}}

===Talmudic hermeneutics===
{{Main|Talmudic hermeneutics}}
{{See also|Judaism#Rabbinic hermeneutics|l1=Judaism § Rabbinic hermeneutics}}
{{Eras of the Halakha}}

Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, [[Hillel the Elder]], although the thirteen principles set forth in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]] are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., [[A fortiori argument|''a fortiori'' argument]] [known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as קל&amp;nbsp;וחומר&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp; ''kal v'chomer'']) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears ([[Talmudical Hermeneutics#Gezerah Shavah|Gezerah Shavah]]). The [[rabbi]]s did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., Rambam Hilkhot Talmud Torah 4:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the [[Tanakh]] (the Jewish bibilical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found [[Esotericism|secret]] or [[Mysticism|mystical]] levels of understanding.

===Vedic hermeneutics===
{{Main|Mimamsa}}

Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the [[Vedas]], the earliest holy texts of [[Hinduism]]. The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what [[Dharma]] (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the [[Mimamsa Sutras|Mimamsa Sutra]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by [[Śabara]] (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

===Buddhist hermeneutics===
{{Main|Buddhist hermeneutics}}

Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]], particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the [[Buddha]] ([[Buddhavacana]]) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract [[Upaya|skillful means]] of reaching spiritual enlightenment or [[nirvana]]. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

===Biblical hermeneutics===
{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}
Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.

The early [[Church Fathers|patristic]] traditions of biblical [[exegesis]] had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] offers hermeneutics and [[homiletics]] in his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]''. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine’s hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the [[Platonism]] of his time, he corrects and recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in De doctrina christianae | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are traditionally fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/hermeneutics-principles-of-biblical-interpretation Hermeneutics – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literal====
{{See also|Biblical literalism}}
Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means “a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the ‘plain meaning’ expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.” The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"&gt;'Hermeneutics' 2014, Encyclopædia Britannica, Research Starters, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moral====
Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Allegorical====
Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as [[typology (theology)|typological]], where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as “types” (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah’s Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a “type” of the Christian church that God designed from the start.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Anagogical====
This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It purports to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the [[Kabbalah|Jewish Kabbalah]], which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of [[Hebrew]] words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval [[Zohar]]. In Christianity, it can be seen in [[Mariology]].&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

==Philosophical hermeneutics==

===Ancient and medieval hermeneutics===
{{Main|History of hermeneutics}}

===Modern hermeneutics&lt;!-- 'Epistemological hermeneutics', 'Straussian hermeneutics', 'Radical hermeneutics', 'Romantic hermeneutics', 'Methodological hermeneutics', 'Ontological hermeneutics', 'Hermeneutic idealism', 'Hermeneutic realism', 'Analytic hermeneutics' and 'Engaged hermeneutics' redirect here--&gt;===
The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new [[Humanism|humanist]] education of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century as a historical and critical [[methodology]] for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved in 1440 that the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'' was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] emphasized ''scriptura sui ipsius interpres'' (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used ''brevitas et facilitas'' as an aspect of [[theological hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;Myung Jun Ahn, "Brevitas et facilitas : a study of a vital aspect in the theological hermeneutics of John Calvin" [http://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/26944?show=full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] led hermeneutists, especially [[Protestant]] exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.&lt;ref name="ramberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/|title=Hermeneutics|author1=Bjorn Ramberg|author2=Kristin Gjesdal|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th- and 20th-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (''[[Verstehen]]'') through the work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] ('''[[Jena Romanticism|Romantic]] hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Mueller-Vollmer]] (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CXY_h9rkUSUC&amp;dq= ''The Hermeneutics Reader''], Continuum, 1988, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''[[Scholarly method|methodological]] hermeneutics'''),&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Joseph Echeverria, ''Criticism and Commitment: Major Themes in Contemporary "Post-Critical" Philosophy'', Rodopi, 1981, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Böckh]] (methodological hermeneutics),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M.

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of [[analytic philosophy]], there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger’s [[philosophy of science]], an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]]: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that meaning determines [[reference]] or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities)&lt;ref&gt;Steven Galt Crowell, Jeff Malpas (eds.), ''Transcendental Heidegger'', Stanford University Press, 2007, pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert L.

Dreyfus, Mark A. Wrathall (eds.), ''Heidegger Reexamined: Truth, realism, and the history of being'', Routledge, 2002, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] and [[Peter Winch]].  Roy J. Howard termed this approach '''analytic hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Howard, ''Three Faces of Hermeneutics: An Introduction to Current Theories of Understanding'', University of California Press, 1982, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]&lt;ref name="ramberg" /&gt; ('''engaged hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aarde|first=Andries G.

====Dilthey (1833–1911)====
[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, "The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on [[empathy]]. Empathy involves a direct identification with the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. Interpretation involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind ([[human sciences]]) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

* Experience means to feel a situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggested that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thought when we try to experience it. His understanding of experience is very similar to that of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Edmund Husserl]].
* Expression converts experience into meaning because the discourse has an appeal to someone outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggested that one can always return to an expression, especially to its written form, and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in science. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible, and therefore the humanities may be labeled as science. Moreover, he assumed that an expression may be "saying" more than the speaker intends because the expression brings forward meanings which the individual consciousness may not fully understand.
* The last structural level of the science of the mind, according to Dilthey, is comprehension, which is a level that contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means, more or less, ''wrong understanding''. He assumed that comprehension produces coexistence: "he who understands, understands others; he who does not understand stays alone."

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to [[Existentialism|existential]] understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct — and thus more authentic — way of being-in-the-world (''In-der-Welt-sein'') than merely as "a way of knowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper and Row | last = Heidegger | first = Martin| title = Being and Time | origyear = 1927| year = 1962 }} p. H125&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he called for a "special hermeneutic of empathy" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of "other minds" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | last = Agosta| first = Lou | title = Empathy in the Context of Philosophy | year = 2010 }} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same [[scientific method]]s that are used in the [[natural science]]s, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of [[antipositivism]]. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the [[social context]] in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the [[hermeneutic circle]]. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]].

====Gadamer (1900–2002) et al.====
[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not ''per se'' without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the [[hermeneutic circle]].

[[Bernard Lonergan]]'s (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist [[Frederick G. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick G. Lawrence, "Martin Heidegger and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "Hans-Georg Gadamer and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "The Hermeneutic Revolution and Bernard Lonergan: Gadamer and Lonergan on Augustine's Verbum Cordis – the Heart of Postmodern Hermeneutics", "The Unknown 20th-Century Hermeneutic Revolution: Jerusalem and Athens in Lonergan's Integral
Hermeneutics", ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1–2 (2008) 7–30, 31–54, 55–86, 87–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]] (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.

[[Karl-Otto Apel]] (b. 1922) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American [[semiotics]]. He applied his model to [[discourse ethics]] with political motivations akin to those of [[critical theory]].

[[Jürgen Habermas]]  (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized [[Marxism]] and previous members of the [[Frankfurt School]] for missing the hermeneutical dimension of [[critical theory]].

Habermas incorporated the notion of the [[lifeworld]] and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.

[[Andrés Ortiz-Osés]] (b. 1943) has developed his [[symbolic hermeneutics]] as the [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean]] response to [[Northern Europe]]an hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] is a [[symbol]]ic healing of injury.

Two other important hermeneutic scholars are [[Jean Grondin]] (b. 1955) and [[Maurizio Ferraris]] (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of [[analogic hermeneutics]], which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the [[Thought|history of thought]].

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist [[Emilio Betti]] and the American literary theorist [[E. D. Hirsch]].

====New hermeneutic====
[[New hermeneutic]] is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through [[existentialism]]. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, "Ernst Fuchs", by John Hayes, 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the event of language. [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]],&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an&amp;nbsp;Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Ebeling]], and [[James M. Robinson]] are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

====Marxist hermeneutics&lt;!--'Marxist hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
The method of '''Marxist hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has been developed by the work of, primarily, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama|Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels]]''&lt;ref name=Erasmus/&gt; ("Trauerspiel" literally means "mourning play" but is often translated as "tragic drama").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Verso | isbn = 978-1844673483 | last = Benjamin | first = Walter | title = Origin of the German Tragic Drama |year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]] draws on Biblical hermeneutics, [[Ernst Bloch]],&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;David Kaufmann, "Thanks for the Memory: Bloch, Benjamin and the Philosophy of History," in ''Not Yet: Reconsidering Ernst Bloch'', ed. Jamie Owen Daniel and Tom Moylan (London and New York: Verson, 1997), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Northrop Frye]], to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential ''[[The Political Unconscious]]''. Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled "On Interpretation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0-8014-9222-8 | last = Jameson | first = Fredric | title = The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act |year = 1982 }} p. 17 - 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the Mode of Production, and eventually, history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0801492846| last = Dowling | first = William C | title = Jameson, Althusser, Marx: Introduction to the Political Unconscious |year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective hermeneutics&lt;!--'Objective hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
[[Karl Popper]] first used the term "'''objective hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" in his ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] (ed.), ''Phenomenology of Life – From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: Book II. The Human Soul in the Creative Transformation of the Mind'', Springer, 2007, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Association for Objective Hermeneutics]] (AGOH) was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objective-hermeneutics.com Association for Objective Hermeneutics website.] Accessed: January 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

{{quote|Our approach has grown out of the empirical study of family interactions as well as reflection upon the procedures of interpretation employed in our research. For the time being we shall refer to it as objective hermeneutics in order to distinguish it clearly  from  traditional  hermeneutic  techniques  and orientations.  The  general  significance  for  sociological  analysis  of objective hermeneutics issues from the fact that, in the social sciences, interpretive methods constitute the fundamental procedures of measurement and of the generation of research data relevant to theory. From our perspective, the standard, nonhermeneutic  methods of quantitative social research can only be justified because they permit a shortcut in generating data (and research "economy" comes about under specific conditions). Whereas  the conventional methodological attitude in the social sciences justifies qualitative approaches as  exploratory or preparatory activities, to be succeeded by standardized approaches and techniques as the actual scientific procedures (assuring  precision, validity, and objectivity), we regard hermeneutic  procedures as the basic method for gaining precise and valid knowledge in the social  sciences. However, we do not simply reject alternative approaches dogmatically. They are in fact useful wherever the loss in precision and objectivity necessitated by the requirement of research economy can be condoned and tolerated in the light of prior hermeneutically elucidated research experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Oevermann, Ulrich; Tilman Allert, Elisabeth Konau, and Jürgen Krambeck. 1987.

==Applications==

===Archaeology===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
In [[archaeology]], hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and  social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in [[stone tool]]s, where descriptions such as "scraper" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of [[microwear analysis]] some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too [[Relativism|relativist]] and that their own interpretations are based on [[Common sense|common-sense]] evaluation.

===Architecture===

There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]], such as [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], and [[Nader El-Bizri]] in the circles of  [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. 2000. ''The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: Experience, Interpretation, Comparison'', p.263;''Volume Two: Hermeneutical Calisthenics: A Morphology of Ritual-Architectural Priorities'', Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dalibor Vesely]] situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Vesely, D. 2004. ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition fits within a critique of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Gomez, A. 1985. ''Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also informed design-studio teaching. [[Adrian Snodgrass]] sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp 165–180.&lt;/ref&gt; He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp. 29–55&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Richard Coyne]], he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A.B., and Coyne, R.D. 1992. "Models, Metaphors and the Hermeneutics of Designing." ''Design Issues'', 9(1): 56 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
[[Environmental hermeneutics]] applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including "[[nature]]" and "[[wilderness]]" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpreting Environments|year=1995|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpretations on Behalf of Place|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

===International relations===
Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both [[critical theory]] and [[constitutive theory]] (both of which have made important inroads into the [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] branch of [[international relations theory]] and [[political science]]), it has been applied to international relations.

[[Steve Smith (academic)|Steve Smith]] refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding a [[Foundationalism (international relations)|foundationalist]] yet postpositivist theory of international relations.

Radical [[postmodernism]] is an example of a postpositivist yet [[Anti-foundationalism (international relations)|anti-foundationalist]] [[paradigm]] of international relations.

===Law===
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to [[Law#Legal theory|legal theory]] since at least the 11th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Italian Renaissance]], the schools of ''[[glossator]]es'', ''commentatores'', and ''usus modernus'' distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of "laws" (mainly [[Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]). The [[University of Bologna]] gave birth to a "legal Renaissance" in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as [[Irnerius]] and [[Decretum Gratiani#Author|Johannes Gratian]]. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Alberico Gentili]].

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and [[Emilio Betti]], among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. [[Interpretivism (legal)|Legal interpretivism]], most famously [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

===Political philosophy===
Italian philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, "A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history)."&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view [[Epistemological anarchism|interpretation as anarchy]] and affirmed that "existence is interpretation" and that "hermeneutics is weak thought."

=== Psychoanalysis ===
{{see also|Freud and Philosophy}}
Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since [[Sigmund Freud]] first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' 'makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[''i.e.''] "interpreting" a dream implies assigning a "meaning" to it.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=The Hogarth Press|year=1900|isbn=|volume=Standard Edition, Vols. IV and V|location=London|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s hermeneutical phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-meaning-p51.html|title=Lacan and Meaning: Sexuation, Discourse Theory, and Topology in the Age of Hermeneutics.|last=Urban|first=William J.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1530345502|location=New York|pages=51–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Postcognitivism}}

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Computer science|computer scientists]] have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].

[[Hubert Dreyfus]]'s critique of conventional [[artificial intelligence]] has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] (cf. [[Embodied cognition]]) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (cf. [[Discursive psychology]]).

Hermeneutics is also influential in [[humanistic psychology]].&lt;ref name=Rennie&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Hermeneutics and Humanistic Psychology|author= David L. Rennie |journal = The Humanistic Psychologist |year=2007 |volume=35|issue=1 |url= http://www.apa.org/divisions/div32/pdfs/hermeneutics.pdf|accessdate= 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and theology===
{{See also|Exegesis|Biblical hermeneutics|Talmudical hermeneutics|Quranic hermeneutics}}
The understanding of a [[Theology|theological]] [[Literature|text]] depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as [[Paul Ricœur]], have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).

[[Mircea Eliade]], as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a [[hierophany]].&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2002), ''Introducere în hermeneutică'' (''Introduction to Hermeneutics''), Brașov: Orientul latin, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''The Hermeneutics of the Myth'', in ''Lumină lină'', number 3, New York, pages 33-49. {{ISSN|1086-2366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1978), ''La nostalgie des origines. Méthodologie et histoire des religions'', Paris: Editions Gallimard, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety science===
In the field of [[safety science]], and especially in the study of [[human reliability]], scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomist]] Donald Taylor that [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanist]] models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1080/00140138108924870|title= The hermeneutics of accidents and safety|author= Donald Taylor |journal = Ergonomics |year=1981 | volume=24 |issue=6| pages=487–495 |url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/678312573-78650925/content~content=a775985337~db=all~order=page|accessdate= 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of [[qualitative data]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/0018726703056005004|title= Applied Hermeneutics and Qualitative Safety Data|author= Wallace,B., Ross, A., &amp; Davies, J.B. |journal = Human Relations |year=2003| volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=587–607 |url= http://hum.sagepub.com/content/56/5/587.abstract=page|accessdate= 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
In [[sociology]], hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes the importance of both context&lt;ref&gt;Willis, W. J., &amp; Jost, M. (2007). Foundations of qualitative research; Interpretive and critical approaches. London: Sage. Page 106&lt;/ref&gt; and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or [[world view]] from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the "thumbs-up" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/body-speaks.aspx Kris Rugsaken, "Body Speaks: Body language around the world"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, putting a piece of paper into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of democratic elections (the act of putting a [[Ballot|ballot paper]] into a box).

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's "[[hermeneutic circle]]" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schleiermacher/#4 |title= Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher |last= Forster |first= Michael |publisher= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Pressler, Fabio B. Dasilva, ''Sociology and Interpretation: From Weber to Habermas'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] criticizes [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendelson|first=Jack|date=1979-01-01|title=The Habermas-Gadamer Debate|jstor=487850|journal=New German Critique|issue=18|pages=44–73|doi=10.2307/487850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Hans Hermann-Hoppe]], both economists of the [[Austrian school]], have criticized the hermeneutical approach to economics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. 1989.

'''John Bordley Rawls''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ɔː|l|z}};&lt;ref&gt;"Rawls" entry in ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'', Random House, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; February 21, 1921 – November 24, 2002) was an American [[moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy|political]] philosopher in the [[Liberalism|liberal]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin, Douglas|title=John Rawls, Theorist on Justice, Is Dead at 82|date=26 November 2002|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/26/obituaries/26RAWL.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/rawls/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Wenar|first=Leif|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held the [[James Bryant Conant]] [[Harvard University Professor|University Professorship]] at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Fulbright Fellowship]] at the [[Christ Church, Oxford|University of Oxford]]. Rawls received both the [[Schock Prize]] for Logic and Philosophy and the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 1999, the latter presented by President [[Bill Clinton]], in recognition of how Rawls's work "helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19990929.html |title=The National Medal Of The Arts And The National Humanities Medal |publisher=Clinton4.nara.gov |date=1999-09-29 |accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1990 introduction to the field, Will Kymlicka wrote that "it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21762535|title=Contemporary political philosophy : an introduction|last=Will.|first=Kymlicka,|date=1990|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=|isbn=0198277245|location=Oxford [England]|pages=11|oclc=21762535}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63136336|title=Political philosophy : a beginners' guide for students and politicians|last=1961-|first=Swift, Adam,|date=2006|publisher=Polity|year=|isbn=0745635326|edition=Second edition, revised and expanded|location=Cambridge|pages=10|oclc=63136336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls has often been described as the most important political philosopher of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;[[David Gordon (philosopher)|Gordon, David]] (2008-07-28) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/article/2008/jul/28/00024/ Going Off the Rawls], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He has the unusual distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr/article/viewPDFInterstitial/136/187|title=Fair Opportunity to Participate|date=June 2009|publisher=The Canadian Political Science Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to by practising politicians in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/search/?s=%22john+rawls%22|title=They Work For You search: "John Rawls"|date=|publisher=Theyworkforyou.com|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawls's theory of [[Justice as Fairness|"justice as fairness"]] recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the "[[original position]]", in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Rawls was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the second of five sons of William Lee Rawls, "one of the most prominent attorneys in Baltimore",&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; and Anna Abell Stump Rawls.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix"&gt;Freeman, 2010:xix&lt;/ref&gt; Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two of his brothers died in childhood because they had contracted fatal illnesses from him. ... In 1928, the seven-year-old Rawls contracted [[diphtheria]]. His brother Bobby, younger by 20 months, visited him in his room and was fatally infected. The next winter, Rawls contracted [[pneumonia]]. Another younger brother, Tommy, caught the illness from him and died.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rawls's biographer [[Thomas Pogge]] calls the loss of the brothers the "most important events in John's childhood".&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;

Rawls attended the [[Calvert School]] in Baltimore for six years, before transferring to the [[Kent School]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Connecticut]]. Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended [[Princeton University]] where he graduated ''summa cum laude'' and was accepted into [[The Ivy Club]] and the [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19400412-01.2.3&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN-rawls----# |title=Daily Princetonian 12 April 1940 — Princeton Periodicals |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date=1940-04-12 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his last two years at Princeton, he "became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines." He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthood&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Cohen and Thomas Nagel, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5931573.ece "John Rawls: On My Religion"], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 18 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote an "intensely religious senior thesis (''BI)''."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s student.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/rawls/|title=John Rawls|last=Wenar|first=Leif|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] in February of that year.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military service, 1943–46===
During [[World War II]], Rawls served as an [[infantry]]man in the Pacific, where he toured [[New Guinea]] and was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]];&lt;ref&gt;"His first experience of combat was in New Guinea – a country which saw fighting for almost the whole duration of the Pacific campaign – where he won a Bronze Star."  From article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|Philippines]], where he endured intensive trench warfare and witnessed horrific scenes such as seeing a soldier remove his helmet and take a bullet to the head, rather than continue with the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm|title=Thinkers at War – John Rawls|date=2014-06-13|newspaper=Military History Monthly|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"One soldier in a dugout close to Rawls stood up and deliberately removed his helmet to take a bullet to the head, choosing to die rather than endure the constant barrage. ... Later Rawls confided the whole experience was 'particularly terrible' ..."  From an article by [[Iain King]], titled [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he lost his Christian faith.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Academic career===
In early 1946,&lt;ref&gt;Date from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy.

He married Margaret Warfield Fox, a [[Brown University]] graduate, in 1949. They had four children, Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox.&lt;ref name="Freemanxix" /&gt;

After earning his PhD from Princeton in 1950, Rawls taught there until 1952 when he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to [[Oxford University]] ([[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian [[Isaiah Berlin]] and the legal theorist [[H. L. A. Hart]]. After returning to the United States he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at [[Cornell University]]. In 1962 he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. That same year he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Allan Gibbard]], [[Onora O'Neill, Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve|Onora O'Neill]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Elizabeth S. Anderson]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Susan Neiman]], [[Claudia Card]], [[Thomas Pogge]], [[T. M. Scanlon]], [[Barbara Herman]], [[Joshua Cohen (philosopher)|Joshua Cohen]], [[Thomas E. Hill (academic)|Thomas E. Hill Jr.]], [[Gurcharan Das]], [[Andreas Teuber]], Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman.

===Later life===
Rawls seldom gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially born out of the deaths of two of his brothers via infections contracted from himself)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Ben |title=Obituary: John Rawls |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries |website=theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "bat-like horror of the limelight",&lt;ref name="guardian2002"&gt;Rogers, 27.09.02&lt;/ref&gt; did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life.&lt;ref name="guardian2002" /&gt;

In 1995 he suffered the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete a book titled ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'', the most complete statement of his views on international justice, and shortly before his death in November 2002 published ''Justice As Fairness: A Restatement'', a response to criticisms of ''A Theory of Justice''.

Rawls died on 24 November 2002 and is buried at the [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, their four children, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2002/12/john-rawls-influential-political-philosopher-dead-at-81-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical thought==
Rawls published three main books. The first, ''A Theory of Justice'', focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, ''Political Liberalism'', addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, ''The Law of Peoples'', focused on the issue of global justice.

===''A Theory of Justice''===
Rawls's ''magnum opus'' titled ''A Theory of Justice'', published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls's resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called ''justice as fairness''. By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory.

Rawls's ''A Theory of Justice'' (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the "[[original position]]". The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls's original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice.

The original position is Rawls' [[hypothetical]] scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a "[[veil of ignorance]]": each lacks knowledge, for example, of his or her gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society.

Rawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess.  First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan.  Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know.  It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which.  Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it.  Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage.  The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust – such as that blacks or women should not be allowed to hold public office – will not be proposed, in this, Rawls' original position, because it would be ''irrational'' to propose them.  The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person.  This position is expressed in the [[difference principle]], according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.

Rawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the "initial situations" of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. (Each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality s/he intends the thought experiment to generate.)&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha; Frontiers of Justice; Harvard U Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts; 2006; Kindle location 1789&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iain King]] has suggested the original position draws on Rawls' experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while "imagining away all that had gone before."&lt;ref&gt;"Deciding what this new (Japanese) society should look like was the task of the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers, and Rawls took this question – what should the rules of a society be – back to the US. But only in 1971 did he come up with a comprehensive answer. His theory starts by imagining away all that had gone before, just as the past had been erased in Hiroshima." Taken from [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-john-rawls.htm Thinker at War: Rawls], published in Military History Magazine, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore.  Rawls's aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice.

In  setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of "[[reflective equilibrium]]", a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one's general principles and one's considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another.

====Principles of justice====
Rawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a ''personal property'' right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect,&lt;ref name=Rawls_114&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|2001|pp=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the [[classical liberalism]] of John Locke and the [[libertarianism]] of Robert Nozick).

Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the "fair worth" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nozick|first1=Robert|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|pages=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Justice as Fairness#Difference Principle|difference principle]]. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.

Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the "basic structure" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of [[Gerald Cohen]]).

Rawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.

Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a "well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice".&lt;ref name=Rawls_397&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to "ideal theory", the determination of "principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances".&lt;ref name=Rawls_216&gt;{{Harvnb|Rawls|1971|pp=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of "partial compliance" under "nonideal theory".{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===''Political Liberalism''===
In ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable – the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in ''A Theory of Justice'' can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate.

The intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of ''A Theory of Justice'', namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency.

The core of Political Liberalism, accordingly, is its insistence that, in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the "ideal of [[public reason]]". This roughly means  that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status ''as'' reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of "public reasons". For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child's development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non-public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons – their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing.

Rawls held that the duty of civility – the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons – applies within what he called the "public political forum". This forum extends from the upper reaches of government – for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society – all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.

The ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values – freedom, equality, and fairness – that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the "reasonable comprehensive doctrines" and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls's idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls's account of stability presented in ''A Theory of Justice'' is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one – Kantian – comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls's famous notion of an "[[overlapping consensus]]".

Such a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are "unreasonable", and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard – freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is – nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would – as has been noted – proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed – or at least open – to them. Rawls's concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place.

Rawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half):

# Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.
# Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

These principles are subtly modified from the principles in ''Theory''. The first principle now reads "equal claim" instead of "equal right", and he also replaces the phrase "system of basic liberties" with "a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties". The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three.

===''The Law of Peoples''===
{{Main|The Law of Peoples}}
Although there were passing comments on international affairs in ''A Theory of Justice'', it wasn't until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of ''The Law of Peoples''.  He claimed there that "well-ordered" peoples could be either "liberal" or "decent".  Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating ''decent peoples'', which differ from ''liberal peoples'', among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of [[minority group|minority]] [[faith]]s the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of "liberal" or "decent" peoples are referred to as "outlaw states", "societies burdened by unfavourable conditions" or "benevolent absolutisms" depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples.

Rawls's views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, [[Charles Beitz]] had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls's Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that states, unlike citizens, were self-sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies.  Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions.  He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a [[moral hazard]] problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.

Rawls's discussion of "non-ideal" theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in [[World War II]], as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.

==Reception and influence==
John Rawls is the subject of ''[[A Theory of Justice: The Musical!]]'', an award-nominated musical billed as an "all-singing, all-dancing romp through 2,500 years of political philosophy". The musical premiered at Oxford in 2013 and was revived for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherwell.org/news/college/2012/10/02/ppe-finalists-create-revision-musical |title=Oxford / News / Colleges / PPE finalists create revision musical |publisher=Cherwell.org |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of John Rawls have had wide-ranging influence. In the field of religious and moral education, Rawls's concepts of overlapping consensus, reasonable pluralism and hypothetical contract have been applied to consider problems of fairness and representation in public education, yielding conclusions that differ substantially from his own position on these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Daniel|last2=Robson|first2=James|date=2012|title=Doing God in a liberal democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=539–550|doi=10.1080/03054985.2012.722863|issn=0305-4985|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moulin|first=Dan|date=2009|title=A too liberal religious education?

The story of the '''Knight of the Swan''', or '''Swan Knight''', is a [[Medieval poetry|medieval]] [[Epic poetry|tale]] about a mysterious rescuer who comes in a [[swan]]-drawn boat to defend a [[Damsel in distress|damsel]], his only condition being that he must never be asked his name.

The earliest versions (preserved in ''Dolopathos'') do not provide specific identity to this knight, but the Old French [[Crusade cycle]] of ''[[chansons de geste]]'' adopted it to make the Swan Knight (''Le Chevalier au Cigne'', first version around 1192) the legendary ancestor of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]]. The ''Chevalier au Cigne'', also known as '''Helias''', figures as the son of Orient of L'Islefort (or Illefort) and his wife Beatrix in perhaps the most familiar version, which is the one adopted for the late fourteenth century [[Middle English]] ''[[Chevalere Assigne|Cheuelere Assigne]]''.&lt;ref name=gibbs-i&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1868|pp=i-ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's mother's name may vary from Elioxe (probably a mere echo of Helias) to Beatrix depending on the text, and in a Spanish version, she is called Isomberte.

At a later time, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] incorporated the swan knight '''[[Lohengrin|Loherangrin]]''' into his [[Arthurian]] epic ''[[Parzival]]'' (first quarter of the 13th century). A German text, written by [[Konrad von Würzburg]] in 1257, also featured a Swan Knight without a name. Wolfram's and Konrad's were used to construct the libretto for [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' (Weimar 1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jaffray|1910|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the motif is Brangemuer, the knight that lay dead in a boat tugged by a swan, and whose adventure was taken up by Gawain's brother Guerrehet ([[Gareth]] or [[Gaheris]]) in the first Continuation to [[Chrétien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]''.

==Swan Children==
The "Swan-Children" appears to have been originally separate from the Godfrey cycle and the Swan Knight story generally.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239/&gt; Paris identifies four groups of variants, which he classifies usually by the name of the mother of the swan children.
&lt;ref name=Hibbard240&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale in all variants resemble not only such [[chivalric romance]]s as ''[[The Man of Law's Tale]]'' and ''[[Emaré]]'', but such fairy tales as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]''.{{r|schlauch}} It also bears resemblance to the fairy tale ''[[The Six Swans]]'', where brothers transformed into birds are rescued by the efforts of their sister.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80}}

===Dolopathos===
Included in Johannes de Alta Silva's ''Dolopathos sive de Rege et Septem Sapientibus'' (ca. 1190), a Latin version of the ''[[Seven Sages of Rome]]'' is a story of the swan children which has served as a precursor to the poems of the [[Crusade cycle]].&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.lxxxxi-&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was adapted into the French ''Li romans de Dolopathos'' by the poet Herbert.&lt;ref name=gerritsen&gt;{{Harvnb|Gerritsen|Van Melle|1998}}, ''Dictionary of Medieval Heroes'', reprinted 2000, pp.247 "Seven Sages of Rome"&lt;/ref&gt; The story is as follows:&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hibbard240-1&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|pp=240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nameless young lord becomes lost in the hunt for a [[white stag]] and wanders into an [[enchanted forest]] where he encounters a mysterious woman (clearly a [[swan maiden]] or [[fairy]]) in the act of bathing, while clutching a gold necklace. They fall instantly for each other and consummate their love. The young lord brings her to his castle, and the maiden (just as she has foretold) gives birth to a [[septuplet]], six boys and a girl, with golden chains about their necks. But her evil mother-in-law swaps the newborn with seven puppies. The servant with orders to kill the children in the forest just [[Child abandonment#In fiction|abandons]] them under a tree. The young lord is told by his wicked mother that his bride gave birth to a litter of pups, and he punishes her by burying her up to the neck for seven years.  Some time later, the young lord while hunting encounters the children in the forest, and the wicked mother's lie starts to unravel. The servant is sent out to search them, and find the boys bathing in the form of swans, with their sister guarding their gold chains. The servant steals the boys' chains, preventing them from changing back to human form, and the chains are taken to a goldsmith to be melted down to make a goblet. The swan-boys land in the young lord's pond, and their sister, who can still transform back and forth into human shape by the magic of her chain, goes to the castle to obtain bread to her brothers. Eventually the young lord asks her story so the truth comes out. The goldsmith was actually unable to melt down the chains, and had kept them for himself. These are now restored back to the six boys, and they regain their powers, except one, whose chain the smith had damaged in the attempt. So he alone is stuck in swan form. The work goes on to say obliquely hints that this is the swan in the Swan Knight tale, more precisely, that this was the swan “''quod cathena aurea militem in navicula trahat armatum'' (that tugged by a gold chain an armed knight in a boat).”&lt;ref name=OFCC-Dolopathos/&gt;

===Crusade cycle: ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne''===
The Knight of the Swan story appears in the Old French ''[[chansons de geste]]'' of the first [[Crusade cycle]], establishing a legendary  ancestry of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who in 1099 became ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. Godfrey loomed large in the medieval Christian imagination, and his shadowy genealogy became a popular subject for writers of the period.

The swan-children tale occurs in the first or ''La Naissance du Chevalier au Cygne'' branch of the [[Literary cycle|cycle]]. The texts can be classed into four versions, 1) ''Elioxe'', 2) ''Beatrix'', 3) an Elioxe-Beatrix composite, and 4) Isomberte.  Of ''Isomberte'' no French copy survives, and it's known only from the Spanish ''Gran conquista de Ultramar''.&lt;ref name="elioxe-intro-OFCC"/&gt;  
([[Gaston Paris]] also used a somewhat similar classification scheme for swan-children cognate tales which he refers to as Version I.&lt;ref name=Hibbard239 /&gt;)

[[File:Helias 2.gif|thumb|Helias, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] (16th-century)]]

'''Elioxe''' follows the ''Dolopathos'' tale closest, but tells a courtlier version of the story,&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC&gt;{{Harvnb|Mickel|Nelson|1977}}, Myer's essay, p.xciii-&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the young lord who becomes lost with King Lothair, a ruler from beyond [[Hungary]] and the maiden with Elioxe. Lothair loses his way and stops by a fountain, and while asleep, is tended by Elioxe who comes out of the woodworks of the mountains. King Lothair decides to wed her, despite his mother's protest. However Elioxe foretells her own death giving birth to seven children, and that one of the offspring shall be king of the Orient.

While Lothair is absent warring, the queen mother Matrosilie orders a servant to carry the children in two baskets and expose them in the forest, and prepares the lie that their mother gave birth to serpents and died from their bites. The servant however had left the children by the hermit's hut, so they survive, and seven years later are discovered by a greedy courtier named Rudemart. Allured by the gold chains the children are wearing, he obtains instruction from the queen mother to steal them, but failing to take account of their numbers, misses the chain belonging to the girl. The six boys bereft of the chains fly out in swan form, and their father Lothair issues an order of protection. The king's nephew tries to hunt one of the birds to please him, but the king in a fit hurls a gold basin which breaks. Matrosilie then provides one of the necklaces to make the repair. Eventually the truth is untangled through the sister of the swan siblings. All the boys regain human form but one. While other seek their own fortunes, one boy cannot part with his brother turned permanently into a swan, and becomes Swan Knight.&lt;ref name=elioxe-intro-OFCC/&gt;

In the '''Beatrix''' variants, the woman had taunted another woman over her alleged adultery, citing a [[multiple birth]] as proof of it, and was then punished with a multiple birth of her own.&lt;ref name="hibbard242"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Beatrix versions, the mother is also an avenging justice.{{sfnp|Schlauch|1969|p=80–1}} In the '''Isomberte''' variants, the woman is a princess fleeing a hated marriage.&lt;ref  name="hibbard242"/&gt;

==Swan Knight==
Version II involves the Swan Knight himself. These stories are sometimes attached to the story of the Swan Children, but sometimes appear independently, in which case no explanation of the swan is given. All of these describe a knight who appears with a swan and rescues a lady; he then disappears after a taboo is broken, but not before becoming the ancestor of an illustrious family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this is merely a brief account to introduce a descendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second version of this tale is thought to have been written by the [[Normans|Norman]] [[trouvère]] [[Jean Renart]].

In [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] the name of the Knight of the Swan is ''Helias''. It has been suggested that this connects him to the Greek solar god, [[Helios]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hibbard|1963|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name is in fact a common variant of the name of the prophet [[Elijah]], who nevertheless was connected to the Greek solar god by orthodox worship because of his association to Mount Horeb and a fire chariot.

[[File:Lohengrin-kitsch.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Lohengrin postcard around 1900 by unknown artist]]

==Lohengrin==
{{main|Lohengrin}}
In the early 13th century, the German poet [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] adapted the Swan Knight motif for his epic ''[[Parzival]]''. Here the story is attached to Loherangrin, the son of the protagonist Parzival and the queen of Pelapeire Condwiramurs. As in other versions Loherangrin is a knight who arrives in a swan-pulled boat to defend a lady, in this case Elsa of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. They marry, but he must leave when she breaks the taboo of asking his name.

In the late 13th century, the poet Nouhusius (Nouhuwius) adapted and expanded Wolfram's brief story into the romance ''[[Lohengrin]]''. The poet changed the title character's name slightly and added various new elements to the story, tying the Grail and Swan Knight themes into the history of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="kalinke"/&gt; In the 15th century an anonymous poet again took up the story for the romance ''Lorengel''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalinke|1991|pp=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version omits the taboo against asking about the hero's name and origins, allowing the knight and princess a happy ending.

In 1848, [[Richard Wagner]] adapted the tale into his popular [[opera]] ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', probably the work through which the Swan Knight story is best known today.&lt;ref&gt;Toner, Frederick L. (1991). "Richard Wagner". In Norris J. Lacy, ''The New Arthurian Encyclopedia'', pp. 502–505. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0-8240-4377-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[festschrift]] in her honour was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lymberopoulou|first1=Angeliki|title=Image of the Byzantine World: Visions, Messages and Meanings. Studies Presented to Leslie Brubaker.|date=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=1409407764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband is the Oxford medievalist, Professor [[Christopher Wickham]].

== Research ==

Brubaker began as an expert in Byzantine illuminated manuscripts, writing a pathbreaking book on one manuscript, Paris Grec. 510, in her ''Vision and Meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maguire|first1=Henry|title=Review in Slavic Review|jstor=2697076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her interests have extended since to the cultural history of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] and the development of the cult of icons, on which she wrote two now-basic books on the subject with John Haldon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Charles|title=Review in Speculum|jstor=20060651}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written substantially on the relationship between material culture and its visual expressions, and other aspects of cultural history, including visual and textual representations of gender, and female patronage.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

She has been fellowships at [[Dumbarton Oaks Research Library]] and Collection, first in 1980-81 as a Junior Fellow, a Summer Fellow in 1984 and a Spring Fellow in 2001 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Prior Fellows and Visiting Scholars|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/fellows/fellows-and-visiting-scholars-in-byzantine-studies|website=Dumbarton Oaks|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her research into icons, relics and the proliferation of the cult of the Virgin Mary (known as the [[Theotokos]]) in Byzantium developed into a major research project subsidized by an [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] grant and the International Iconoclasms network, led by Brubaker with Dr Richard Clay (University of Birmingham),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iconoclasms - Practices of the Past; Interpretations of the Present|url=http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=AH/J002518/1|website=Gateway to Research (Research Councils UK)|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Under Attack: Histories of British Iconoclasm - Exhibition at the Tate Britain|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm|website=Tate|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art museum]]s of '''[[Ukraine]]''' possess a large number of '''[[Western painting|Western European paintings]]'''. There, one can see canvases by world-famous artists (such as [[Titian]], [[Francesco Guardi]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Rubens]]) as well as by the painters whose works throughout the world are unique (such as [[Master of the Osservanza]], [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], [[Jacob Ferdinand Voet]], [[Georges de La Tour]] and others).

== Before the year 1917 ==
The museum collections of Western European paintings were formed in different ways. Usually they were based on private collections. The collectors often sold or presented pictures they owned to other owners; sometimes (mostly after the [[1905 Russian Revolution]]) large collections were sold abroad.

A number of Ukrainian art lovers spoke out against the export of the artistic wealth and strove for its preservation in public museums and galleries. As early as in the middle of the 19th century, in Ukraine there existed private museums and ‘cabinets of fine arts’ in the universities of [[Kiev]], [[Kharkov]], and [[Odessa]]. It was due to the public efforts that the first Ukrainian public museum was opened in 1886 in Kharkov, and the municipal art gallery in [[Lvov]] in 1907. Both had large sections of Western European paintings. Some educated people paid their own money to acquire artistic objects which they wanted to donate to their native cities. In such a manner, I. Betsky and A. Alfyorov, graduates of [[Kharkiv University|Kharkov University]], started the collection of Western European paintings at the local museum. In Kiev, it was [[Bogdan Khanenko|Bogdan and Varvara Khanenko]] who in the 1870s began collecting works by Western European artists.

== Between the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War ==
After the October Revolution, all artistic works located in Ukraine were nationalised and distributed to museums and art galleries, both to the existing and to the newly formed ones.

But the new rulers kept selling works of art abroad. Besides, Ukrainian museum pieces were being exchanged for far less valuable ones from [[Russia]]n museums. For example, against Varvara Khanenko’s will, the [[Bolsheviks]] split the collection of [[Museum of Western and Oriental Art|Kiev Museum]]. Some pieces were sold to the USA for little money that was to be spent on military equipment and arms. Varvara’s will was violated once again after her death when the mention of the Khanenkos disappeared from the name of the museum. After that, it was for a long time called Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art.

In 1925-1926, the museum was enriched with Shchavinsky’s collection of the 17th century pictures by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artists.

In 1919, [[Zhitomir Local History Museum]] was created. Its art gallery was based on the Chaudoirs’ collection with a number of first-rate canvases by Western European painters.

The works from the stock of Odessa Committee for the Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity and the ones from the metropolitan museums formed Odessa Art Museum. It was opened in 1920. Its present name is [[Odessa State Museum of Western and Eastern Art]].

In November 1920, the [[Crimea]] having become [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], the regional section for the protection of monuments of art and antiquity started work effecting the order of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee. The section was to expropriate and inventory the art treasures from the palaces and mansions of the Crimean South Coast. In December, the objects expropriated formed the basis of [[Yalta]] Popular Artistic Museum where Western European authors prevailed. In 1927, Yalta Museum's collection was transferred to the newly created [[Sevastopol Art Museum]]. The same year, the museum in Sevastopol received [[Simferopol]] Art Museum’s entire collection of Western European art that included a lot of valuable Flemish and Dutch paintings.

After the annexation of [[Ukraine|Western Ukraine]] to the [[USSR]] in 1939, [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lviv Art Gallery]] was enriched with nationalised private collections containing plenty of wonderful works by Western Europeans.

== During the Great Patriotic War ==
On June 29, 1941, most pieces from Kiev Museum of Western and Oriental Art started being evacuated to [[Penza]] and [[Saratov]]. But it appeared impossible to move the whole collection. When the [[Germans]] came, they started plundering the collection, a process that was put the brakes on for some time only by Dietrich Roskamp who was the keeper of the museum at that time. He protested against the misappropriation of the artistic objects and moving the collection to Germany. But it was hardly possible to fully stop it, and in 1943, due to the [[Red Army]]’s advance, the invaders organised the exportation of the collection to Germany. They did it methodically at first, listing and carefully packing the objects, and later hastily and chaotically. Altogether, the [[Nazi]]s took 474 pictures, 10 sculptures and about 25,000 prints from the museum. Luckily, a few valuable works had managed to be hidden, among them [[Perugino]]’s ''Archangel'' and [[Marco Palmezzano]]’s ''Madonna with a Saint''.

225 works of art were plundered from [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lviv Art Gallery]] during the German invasion, many of them were destroyed. Among them was the unique collection of Dürer’s paintings.

In [[Kharkov Art Museum]], only five thousand pieces survived.

Before the war, the collection of [[Poltava Art Museum]] numbered about 30,000 pieces. The exposition failed to be evacuated and was almost all destroyed. Among the losses was the priceless Western European collection with unique works by [[Giambattista Tiepolo]], [[Rubens]], [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]], [[Adriaen van Ostade]], [[Vigee Le Brun|Vigée-LeBrun]] and others.

The major part of the objects from [[Sevastopol Art Gallery]] was evacuated and preserved by its director Mikhail Kroshitsky. After the war, the works of art from Sevastopol Gallery were on display in [[Simferopol Art Museum|Simferopol]] for some time, because [[Sevastopol]] lay in ruins and the house of the museum had been burnt down.

Only eleven objects of all the pre-war treasures survived in the [[Donetsk Art Museum|Art Museum]] in [[Donetsk]] (at that period the name of the city was Stalino).

== After World War II ==
Kiev and Odessa have the largest collections that exist as independent museums of western and eastern (oriental) art. The Western European collection in Lvov, though as rich and valuable as those in Odessa and Kiev, is but a department of the local art gallery. Sections containing a lot of valuable works by Western Europeans exist in art museums of Kharkov, Sevastopol, and in [[Zhitomir]] Local History Museum. A number of important canvases by foreign artists are possessed by the museums of [[Poltava]], [[Sumy]], [[Lutsk]], [[Uzhgorod]].

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''A'''{{note label|Davis||1}}{{note label|Muni||2}}[[Bette Davis]]' performance in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) and [[Paul Muni]]'s performance in ''[[Black Fury (film)|Black Fury]]'' (1935) were not nominated for Oscars. As a result of Davis's failure to get a nomination, several influential people campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year, and the following year also, the Academy allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible. At the [[6th Academy Awards|6th]], [[7th Academy Awards|7th]] and [[8th Academy Awards]], the Academy publicly announced those that placed second and third in the vote. Davis placed third ahead of one official nominee and Muni placed second, ahead of three official nominees, and both Davis and Muni are listed on the Academy's official database as write-in nominees who placed in the final voting. From the [[9th Academy Awards]], the nominating committees were no longer used and the entire membership of each individual branch voted for the nominees in their respective categories.&lt;br&gt;
'''B'''{{note label|Olivier|1}}[[Laurence Olivier]] received a total of 13 Oscar nominations, winning two. In addition to his 10 acting nominations (one win), he received two [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] nominations; for producing 1944 film ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (released in the US in 1946) and 1948 film ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (for which he won), and received a [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] nomination for ''Hamlet''. Olivier also received two [[Honorary Oscar]]s; one for bringing ''Henry V'' to the screen, and a second in 1979 for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;br&gt;
'''C'''{{note label|Washington||1}}{{note label|MacLaine||2}}{{note label|DiCaprio||2}}{{note label|Cooper||3}}[[Denzel Washington]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Bradley Cooper]] have all received an additional nomination in a non-acting category. MacLaine received an additional nomination in the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] category as co-director of the 1975 documentary ''[[The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir]]''. Washington, DiCaprio and Cooper have received an additional nomination in the Best Picture category, Washington for co-producing ''[[Fences (film)|Fences]]'' (2016), DiCaprio for co-producing ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013), and Cooper for co-producing ''[[American Sniper]]'' (2014)&lt;br&gt;
'''D'''{{note label|Shearer||1}}{{note label|Colman||2}}{{note label|Garbo||3}}Rules at the time of the first three Academy Award ceremonies allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film. At the [[1st Academy Awards|1st ceremony]], [[Emil Jannings]] won Best Actor for his work in two films and [[Janet Gaynor]] won Best Actress for her work in three films. [[Richard Barthelmess]] also received a nomination for two films at the 1st ceremony. At the [[3rd Academy Awards|3rd ceremony]], [[George Arliss]], [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Ronald Colman]], [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Norma Shearer]] all received a single nomination for their work in two films. This is why the Academy lists Colman and Garbo as three-time nominees and Shearer as a five-time nominee. Barthelmess, Arliss and Chevalier are one-time nominees, so do not feature in the above lists. No official reason was ever given as to why Arliss and Shearer were named Best Actor and Best Actress for only one of the two films for which they were listed.&lt;br&gt;
'''E'''{{note label|Muni||1}}{{note label|Chatterton||2}}At the [[2nd Academy Awards]] only the Best Actor and Best Actress winners were announced. There was no announcement of nominations. The official Academy site states that "although not official nominations, the additional names in each category, according to in-house records, were under consideration by various boards of judges". Although unofficial, [[Ruth Chatterton]]'s nomination at the 2nd ceremony (the first of her two) counts towards her total in the above lists, and Paul Muni's nomination at the 2nd ceremony, counts as one of his five nominations in the above lists (his write-in vote from 1935 is not counted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |publisher=Academy Awards |title=Academy Awards database |accessdate=17 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208011732/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''F'''{{note label|Clooney||1}}{{note label|Thompson||2}}{{note label|Pitt||3}}{{note label|Damon||4}}[[George Clooney]], [[Emma Thompson]], [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Matt Damon]] have all won Oscars in non-acting categories. Clooney has eight Oscar nominations (four for acting, two for writing, one for directing and one for producing) with two wins. In addition to his win for Best Supporting Actor, he won Best Picture for co-producing ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'' (2012). Thompson is a five-time nominee with two wins. In addition to her Best Actress win, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995). Pitt is a six-time Oscar nominee (three for acting, three for producing). He won an Oscar for co-producing Best Picture winner ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' (2013). Damon is a five-time nominee (three for acting, one for writing and one for co-producing 2016 Best Picture nominee ''[[Manchester by the Sea (film)|Manchester by the Sea]]''), winning the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] (shared with [[Ben Affleck]]) for ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997).&lt;br&gt;
'''G'''{{note label|Chaplin||1}}At the 1st Academy Award ceremony, [[Charlie Chaplin]] received four nominations (including Best Actor) for his film ''[[The Circus (film)|The Circus]]'', before the Academy decided to remove his name from the competitive categories and instead honor him with a special award. A letter sent by the Academy to Chaplin told him that they had "Unanimously decided that your name should be removed from the competitive classes, and that a special award be conferred upon you for writing, acting, directing and producing ''The Circus''. The collective accomplishments thus displayed place you in a class by yourself". Chaplin went on to receive nominations for Best Actor, Best Writing and Best Picture (the latter credited to Charlie Chaplin Productions) for the 1940 film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' and a Best Writing nomination for the 1947 film ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]''. He received a second Honorary Oscar at the [[44th Academy Awards]] in 1972, before winning his first competitive Oscar at the [[45th Academy Awards]] in 1973 for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Dramatic Score]] for his 1952 film ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'', which was eligible for that years Oscars because it was not released in Los Angeles until 1972.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-disqualifies-oscar-nominated-song-675480| work=The Hollywood Reporter |title=Academy disqualifies Oscar nominated song |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23950">Many authors will use quotations from literature as the [[title (publishing)|title]] for their works.  This may be done as a conscious allusion to the themes of the older work or simply because the phrase seems memorable.  The following is a partial '''list of book titles taken from literature'''.  It does not include phrases altered for parody. (Titles taken from works by [[William Shakespeare]] do not appear here: see [[List of titles of works taken from Shakespeare]].)

'''''Posse''''' is a 1993 American  [[revisionist Western]] film directed by and starring [[Mario Van Peebles]]. Featuring a large [[ensemble cast]], the film tells the story of a posse of [[African American|African-American]] soldiers and one ostracized white soldier, who are all betrayed by a corrupt colonel. The story starts with the group escaping with a cache of gold, and continues with their leader Jesse Lee (Van Peebles) taking revenge on the men who killed his preacher father. The story is presented as a flashback told by an unnamed old man ([[Woody Strode]]). The title of the film refers to a group of people who are summoned to help law enforcement officers. This film was the first film to be released by [[Gramercy Pictures]].

[[Melvin Van Peebles]], the father of director [[Mario Van Peebles]], recorded a new song, "Cruel [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]", for the film. This marked his first music recording in 20 years, after his 1974 album ''[[What the....You Mean I Can't Sing?!]]''&lt;ref name=Bessman&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bessman |first1=Jim |title=Capitol's Melvin Van Peebles Issues 1st Album In 20 Years |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=107 |issue=9 |page=8 |date=March 4, 1995 |issn=0006-2510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It led to the production of a new album, ''[[Ghetto Gothic]]'', released in 1995.&lt;ref name=Bessman/&gt;

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=September 2015}}
In 1898, [[Buffalo Soldiers]] from the U.S. Army's [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]], led by Jesse Lee ([[Mario Van Peebles]]), are fighting in the [[Spanish–American War]] in [[Cuba]]. As the segregated [[African American|African-American]] unit is barely holding its own against constant attacks from enemy troops, Jessie runs back to the command post of the corrupt and racist Colonel Graham ([[Billy Zane]]) to request that the 10th Cavalry be allowed to pull back. Colonel Graham orders Jessie to shoot a deserter in exchange for allowing the 10th to retreat. Unable to kill a man in cold blood, Jessie demonstrates excellent marksmanship by shooting the man's cigar from his mouth. Colonel Graham then kills the deserter, and offers Jesse's command of the 10th to Little J ([[Stephen Baldwin]]), another White prisoner (the alternative would be to face the firing squad). Graham then orders the 10th to fall back in order to begin another mission, one in which they will be required to wear civilian clothing, as opposed to their Cavalry uniforms. They are ordered to rob a Spanish gold shipment, which is a setup to give the Colonel an excuse to execute the entire 10th Cavalry as deserters. As he meets them with his own cavalry force, his aide Weezie ([[Charles Lane (filmmaker)|Charles Lane]]) causes a distraction, allowing the 10th to shoot the Colonel and his cavalry down.

With Colonel Graham and his troops supposedly dead, the remnants of the 10th—including Jesse, Obobo ([[Tom Lister, Jr.|Tiny Lister]]), Angel ([[Tone-Lōc]]) and Little J, along with Weezie sneak out of Cuba and Jesse leads them to [[New Orleans]]. Soon after arriving their arrival, Little J meets a gambler named Father Time ([[Big Daddy Kane]]) and they begin playing poker, at which point Time is caught cheating. Little J helps the gambler escape and they go back to the hotel room where the others are hiding, telling them "We were never here" in fear that the vengeful gamblers might come for them. Doing just as J feared, the gamblers come in search of him and Father Time, only to be shot in the back by Colonel Graham and his troops, who survived the skirmish in Cuba. Angel is killed in the firefight while Little J, Father Time and the others barely escape. They meet up with Jesse who had left earlier to finish some business in a town out West.

The newly formed "posse" heads West with Colonel Graham on their heels every step of the way. They eventually stop in a town where Jesse has ammunition custom-made out of gold in order to kill the demons of his past, using one to kill the man who made the ammunition—as he was one of the men who lynched Jesse's father King David ([[Robert Hooks]]) years earlier (Father Time later explains that the [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] ladies in New Orleans believe that gold is the only way to kill a demon). They make their way to Freemanville, a town founded by King David and composed entirely of African-Americans. Jesse is reunited with several old acquaintances, including his good friend Carver ([[Blair Underwood]]), who is now the sheriff of Freemanville. Carver's deputy goes to Cutterstown, not wanting to tip anyone off that Carver is working with Cutterstown's sheriff, Bates ([[Richard Jordan]]). He informs Bates that Jesse has returned to Freemanville. The "posse" enjoys the hospitality of Freemanville until Bates tells Carver that the town will burn unless Jesse is turned over to him and his deputies (Sheriff Bates and one of his deputies were men that had lynched King David, and were afraid that Jesse had come back for revenge). Bates and a few of his deputies attack Freemanville that same night looking for Jesse. One of the deputies beats Weezie in order to get answers. Watching in disgust, Little J fights back in defense of Weezie. Outnumbered, Little J is kicked and beaten to death by Bates and his men, and while Obobo and Jesse's former mentor Papa Joe ([[Melvin Van Peebles]]) are taken to Cutterstown as prisoners. Jessie and Father Time soon rescue them by posing as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members and storming into the Cutterstown jail. Jessie kills one of the deputies, who was another one of King David's murderers.

When he returns he convinces the townspeople to fight Sheriff Bates by telling them he wants the land for himself to sell to the railroad when it comes through. The citizens of Freemanville fight Bates the next day when he rides in. As they begin to gain the upper hand, Colonel Graham arrives with his cavalry and a [[Gatling gun]] which he uses to cut the people down. Jesse charges the gun with a stick of dynamite destroying the gun and killing some of Graham's troops.

Meanwhile, Carver plans to flee with the deeds to all of the property in Freemanville—all of which are in his name—but is stopped by Papa Joe's daughter Lana ([[Salli Richardson]]). Father Time shows up just in time to stop Carver from harming Lana. Time kills one of Carver's deputies, but is killed by Carver. Before Carver can flee, he is stopped by Bates who reveals that they had a deal to split the proceeds from the land 50-50. Jesse arrives just in time to hear about the deal, and watches as Carver is betrayed and murdered by Bates. Jesse kills Bates in a showdown, finally putting his past demons to rest. Colonel Graham captures Lana and orders Jesse into the saloon, where they have a climactic fight resulting in Graham's death and the destruction of the saloon (which Graham had set ablaze). Jesse, Obobo, Weezie and Lana watch as the townspeople fight the fire.

The story ends almost a century later with an old man ([[Woody Strode]]) being interviewed by reporters ([[Reginald Hudlin]], [[Warrington Hudlin]]) about the black [[cowboy]]s of the [[American Frontier|Old West]]. The man, who was a young boy when he met Jessie in Freemanville, gives the reporters a small book that Jesse had given him.

In the end, a caption goes on to tell that there had been over 8,000 black cowboys in the Old West whose stories had never been told due to omission by [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and others alike.

The film was panned by most mainstream critics and has a 29% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 17 reviews.

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated, "On the one hand, this obviously talented film maker celebrates all the aggrandizing features of the genre: the laconic tough talk, the manly camaraderie, the proud posturing, the power of walking tall past the awestruck citizenry of a prairie town. On the other hand, "Posse" does its best to reject and avenge what it regards as the flagrant distortions of the past."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE4D81430F937A25756C0A965958260 New York Times Posse movie review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] described it as "an overdirected, overphotographed, overdone movie that is so distracted by its hectic, relentless style that the story line is rendered almost incoherent."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990828182911/http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/1993/05/857463.html Roger Ebert's review of Posse movie]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a C+ and said it was "a glossy, kinetic pastiche of Western conventions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306613,00.html Entertainment weekly's Posse review]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82222">'''Postcolonial literature''' is the [[literature]] by people from formerly [[colonization|colonized]] countries. It exists on all [[continent]]s except [[Antarctica]]. [[Postcolonial]] literature often addresses the problems and consequences of the [[decolonization]] of a country, especially questions relating to the political and cultural independence of formerly subjugated people, and themes such as [[racialism (Racial categorization)|racialism]] and colonialism.{{sfn|Hart|Goldie|1993|p=155}} A range of [[literary theory]] has evolved around the subject. It addresses the role of literature in perpetuating and challenging what postcolonial critic [[Edward Said]] refers to as [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29600508|title=Culture and imperialism|last=W.|first=Said, Edward|date=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679750541|edition=  1st Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=29600508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Migrant literature]] and postcolonial literature show some considerable overlap. However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration. A question of current debate is the extent to which [[postcolonial theory]] also speaks to migration literature in non-colonial settings.

== Terminology ==
The significance of the prefix "post-" in "postcolonial" is a matter of contention. It is difficult to determine when colonialism begins and ends, and therefore to agree that "postcolonial" designates an era "after" colonialism has ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Literature|last=Gunning|first=Dave|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0748639380|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial history unfolds in overlapping phases: [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] expansion begins in the 15th century; [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[German Empire|German]] colonization unfold from between the 16th and 18th centuries until the [[Decolonization|independence movements]] of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean in the mid-twentieth century. It is also difficult to determine the postcolonial status of [[Settler colonialism|settler colonies]] such as [[History of Australia|Australia]] and [[History of Canada|Canada]], or that of pre-colonial-era colonies such as [[History of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Postcolonial Literature, Vol 1|last=Quayson|first=Ato, ed|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neocolonialism]] and the effects of [[imperialism]] (i.e. the western attitudes that justify colonial practices), which persist even after the end of [[colonialism]] (i.e. the practice of securing colonies for economic gain), make it difficult to determine whether a colonizer's physical evacuation guarantees post-colonial status.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Literatures in Context|last=Mullaney|first=Julie|publisher=Continuum|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of the term ===
Before the term "postcolonial literature" gained currency, "commonwealth literature" was used to refer to writing in English from countries belonging to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British commonwealth]]. Even though the term included British literature, it was most commonly used for writing in English produced in British colonies. Scholars of commonwealth literature used the term to designate writing in English that dealt with colonialism's legacy. They advocated for its inclusion in literary curricula, hitherto dominated by the British [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]]. However, the succeeding generation of postcolonial critics, many of whom belonged to the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophical tradition, took issue with the Commonwealth label for separating non-British writing from "English" literature produced in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism 1981-1991|last=Rushdie|first=Salman|publisher=Granta Books|year=1991|isbn=|location=London|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggested that texts in this category had a short-sighted view of imperialism's impact.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/824119565|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946-|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946-|isbn=9780415661904|edition=  Third |location=London|oclc=824119565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used for the writing in English from former British colonies include terms that designate a national corpus of writing such as Australian or Canadian Literature; "English Literature Other than British and American," "New Literatures in English," "International Literature in English;" and "World Literatures." These have, however, been dismissed either as too vague or too inaccurate to represent the vast body of dynamic writing emerging from the colonies both during and after colonial rule. The term "colonial" and "postcolonial" continue to be used for writing emerging during and after colonial rule respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonial and Postcolonial Fiction: An Anthology|last=Ross|first=Robert L., ed.|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York, Oxford|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonial? Or postcolonial? ===
The consensus in the field is that "post-colonial" (with a hyphen) signifies a period that comes chronologically "after" colonialism. "Postcolonial," on the other hand, signals the persisting impact of colonization across time periods and geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; While the hyphen implies that history unfolds in neatly distinguishable stages from pre- to post-colonial, omitting the hyphen creates a comparative framework by which to understand the varieties of local resistance to colonial impact. Arguments in favor of the hyphen suggest that the term "postcolonial" dilutes differences between colonial histories in different parts of the world and that it homogenizes colonial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60323144|title=The post-colonial studies reader|others=Ashcroft, Bill, 1946-, Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen,|isbn=0415345642|edition=  Second |location=London|oclc=60323144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of [[Criticism|critical writing]] that participates in these debates is called [[Postcolonial Theory|Postcolonial theory]].

== Critical approaches ==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|150px|thumb|In ''La Réforme intellectuelle et morale'' (1871), the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] [[Ernest Renan]] advocated imperial stewardship for civilising the non–Western peoples of the world.]] 
Postcolonial fiction writers deal with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], either by modifying or by subverting it, or both.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/130987358|title=The empire writes back : theory and practice in post-colonial literatures|last=1946-|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen.|isbn=0203426088|edition=  2nd|location=London|oclc=130987358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcolonial literary [[theory]] re-examines colonial and postcolonial literature, especially concentrating upon the social discourse between the colonizer and the colonized that shaped and produced the literature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]] analyzed the fiction of [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and [[Lautréamont]] (Isidore-Lucien Ducasse), exploring how they shaped and were influenced by the societal fantasy of European [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racial superiority]]. He pioneered the branch of postcolonial criticism called [[colonial discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd ed.|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415350648|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important theorist of colonial discourse is [[Harvard University]] professor [[Homi K Bhabha]], (1949 – ). He has developed a number of the field's neologisms and key concepts, such as [[hybridity]], [[Third Space Theory|third-space]], mimicry, difference, and ambivalence.&lt;ref name="huddart"&gt;Huddart, David. "Homi K. Bhabha", Routledge Critical Thinkers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Western canonical works like Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest#Postcolonial|The Tempest]],'' Charlotte Brontë's ''[[Jane Eyre]],'' Jane Austen's ''[[Mansfield Park#Slavery and Mansfield Park|Mansfield Park]],'' Rudyard Kipling's ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]],'' and Joseph Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' have been targets of colonial discourse analysis. The succeeding generation of postcolonial critics focus on texts that "[[The Empire Writes Back|write back]]" to the colonial center.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In general, postcolonial theory analyzes how [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] ideas, such as anti-conquest, national unity, [[négritude]], [[pan-Africanism]] and [[postcolonial feminism]] were forged in and promulgated through literature.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd edition|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415350648|location=|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent theorists include [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Bill Ashcroft]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Leela Gandhi]], [[Gareth Griffiths (academic)|Gareth Griffiths]], [[Abiola Irele]], John McLeod, [[Hamid Dabashi]], [[Helen Tiffin]], [[Khal Torabully]], and [[Robert J.C. Young|Robert Young]].

=== Nationalism ===
The sense of identification with a nation, or [[nationalism]], fueled anti-colonial movements in the aftermath of colonialism. Language and literature were factors in consolidating this sense of [[national identity]] to resist the impact of colonialism. With the advent of the [[printing press]], newspapers and magazines helped people across geographical barriers identify with a shared national community. This idea of the [[nation]] as a homogeneous [[imagined community]] connected across geographical barriers through the medium of language became the model for the modern nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932385849|title=Imagined communities : reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism|last=1936-2015,|first=Anderson, Benedict R. O'G. (Benedict Richard O'Gorman),|isbn=1784786756|edition=  Revised |location=London|oclc=932385849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcolonial literature not only helped consolidate national identity in anti-colonial struggles but also critiqued the European colonial pedigree of nationalism. As depicted in [[Salman Rushdie|Salman Rushdie's]] novels for example, the homogeneous nation was built on European models by the exclusion of marginalized voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd ed|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made up of religious or ethnic elites who spoke on behalf of the entire nation, silencing minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Dipesh|date=Winter 1992|title=Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for "Indian" Pasts?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2928652|journal=Representations|volume=37|pages=1–26|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negritude, pan-Africanism and pan-nationalism ===
'''[[Négritude]]''' is a literary and ideological philosophy, developed by francophone African intellectuals, writers, and politicians in France during the 1930s. Its initiators included Martinican poet [[Aimé Césaire]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] (a future President of Senegal), and [[Léon Damas]] of French Guiana. Négritude intellectuals disapproved of French colonialism and claimed that the best strategy to oppose it was to encourage a common racial identity for native Africans worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Studies: the key concepts, 3rd ed.|last=Ashcroft et al.|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415661911|location=|pages=176, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pan-Africanism]] was a movement among English-speaking black intellectuals who echoed the principles négritude. [[Frantz Omar Fanon]] (1925 – 1961), a [[Martinique]]-born [[Afro-Caribbean]] [[psychiatrist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[revolutionary]], and writer, was one of the proponents of the movement. His works are influential in the fields of [[post-colonial studies|postcolonial studies]], [[critical theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/frantz-fanon/|title=Biography of Frantz Fanon|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Intellectualism|intellectual]], Fanon was a [[Political radicalism|political radical]] and [[Marxist]] [[Marxist humanism|humanist]] concerned with the [[psychopathology]] of [[colonization]],&lt;ref&gt;Seb Bra, [https://www.academia.edu/9474429/Franz_Fanon_%C3%A0_Dehil%C3%A8s_Attention_Boumedienne_est_un_psychopathe "Frantz Fanon à Dehilès: « Attention Boumedienne est un psychopathe"], Academia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the human, social, and cultural consequences of [[decolonization]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Gordon, ''Fanon and the Crisis of European Man'' (1995), New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hussein Abdilahi Bulhan, ''Frantz Fanon and the Psychology of Oppression'' (1985), New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frantz Fanon, [http://www.openanthropology.org/fanonviolence.htm "Concerning Violence"], from ''The Wretched of the Earth''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] ([[UNIA-ACL]]).&lt;ref name="BackToAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unia-acl.org/archive/themyth.htm|title=The "Back to Africa" Myth|author=|date=14 July 2005|work=UNIA-ACL website|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230195707/http://www.unia-acl.org/archive/themyth.htm|archivedate=30 December 2006|accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the [[Black Star Line]], a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the [[African diaspora]] to their ancestral lands. Prior to the 20th century, leaders such as [[Prince Hall]], [[Martin Delany]], [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], and [[Henry Highland Garnet]] advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. However, Garvey was unique in advancing a [[Pan-African philosophy]] to inspire a global [[mass movement]] and [[economic empowerment]] focusing on Africa. The philosophy came to be known as [[Garveyism]].&lt;ref name="BackToAfrica" /&gt; Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of ''African Redemption'', Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the [[Nation of Islam]] to the [[Rastafari movement]] (some sects of which proclaim Garvey as a prophet).

Against advocates of literature that promoted African racial solidarity in accordance with negritude principles, [[Frantz Fanon]] argued for a national literature aimed at achieving national liberation.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; [[Paul Gilroy]] argued against reading literature both as an expression of a common black racial identity and as a representation of [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments. Rather, he argued that black cultural forms—including literature—were [[Diaspora|diasporic]] and [[Transnationality|transnational]] formations born out of the common historical and geographical effects of [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery.]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28112279|title=The black Atlantic : modernity and double consciousness|last=1956-|first=Gilroy, Paul,|isbn=0674076052|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=28112279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-conquest ===
The “anti-conquest narrative” recasts the indigenous inhabitants of colonized countries as victims rather than foes of the colonisers.&lt;ref name="Revie"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists and Writers at the Falls, from Discovery through the Twentieth Century| first=Linda L.| last=Revie| year=2003| publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press| pages=95| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8J3zgXVq_MC&amp;dq=%22anti+conquest+narrative%22| isbn=0-88920-433-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depicts the colonised people in a more human light but risks absolving colonisers of responsibility by assuming that native inhabitants were "doomed" to their fate.&lt;ref name="Revie" /&gt;

In her book ''Imperial Eyes,'' [[Mary Louise Pratt]] analyzes the strategies by which European [[Travel literature|travel writing]] portrays Europe as a secure home space against a contrasting representation of colonized outsiders. She proposes a completely different theorization of "anti-conquest" than the ideas discussed here, one that can be traced to Edward Said. Instead of referring to how natives resist colonization or are victims of it, Pratt analyzes texts in which a European narrates his adventures and struggles to survive in the land of the non-European [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation" (1992). In chapters 3 and 4, titled, "Narrating the Anti-Conquest" and "Anti-Conquest II: Mystique of Reciprocity".&lt;/ref&gt; This secures the innocence of the imperialist even as he exercises his dominance, a strategy Pratt terms "anti-conquest." The anti-conquest is a function of how the narrator writes him or her self out of being responsible for or an agent, direct or indirect, of colonization and colonialism. This different notion of anti-conquest is used to analyze the ways in which colonialism and colonization are legitimized through stories of survival and adventure that purport to inform or entertain. Pratt created this unique notion in association with concepts of [[The Contact Zone (theoretical concept)|contact zone]] and [[transculturation]], which have been very well received in Latin America social and human science circles.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The terms refer to the conditions and effects of encounter between the colonizer and the colonized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Postcolonial feminist literature===
[[Postcolonial feminism]] emerged as a response to the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] focus of [[feminism]].  It accounts for the way that [[racism]] and the long-lasting political, economic, and cultural effects of [[colonialism]] affect non-white, non-Western women in the [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] world.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite book|last=Weedon|first=Chris|title=Feminist practice &amp; poststructuralist theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-631-19825-3|edition=  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Islands==
[[File:Witi Ihimaera.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Witi Ihimaera]], from [[New Zealand]], the first published [[Māori people|Māori]] novelist.]]
The '''Pacific Islands''' comprise 20,000 to 30,000 [[island]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Depending on the context, it may refer to countries and islands with common [[Austronesian]] origins, islands once or currently [[colonized]], or [[Oceania]].
 
There is a burgeoning group of young pacific writers who respond and speak to the contemporary [[Pacific Islands|Pasifika]] experience, including writers [[Lani Wendt Young]], [[Courtney Sina Meredith]] and [[Selina Tusitala Marsh]], among others. Reclamation of culture, loss of culture, [[diaspora]], all themes common to postcolonial literature, are present within the collective Pacific writers. Pioneers of the literature include two of the most influential living authors from this region: [[Witi Ihimaera]], [[New Zealand]]'s first published [[Māori people|Māori]] novelist,&lt;ref name="DomPost profile"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Career Diplomat | work=The Dominion Post - Your Weekend magazine | date=12 March 2016 | author=Black, Eleanor | location=Wellington | pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoa]]n poet [[Albert Wendt]] (1939 –  ).&lt;ref&gt;http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/albert-wendt-very-flattered-over-new-zealand-s-top-honour-5454287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Tay, [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10126837 "Witi Ihimaera – the life of a Maori boy"], ''NZ Herald'', 23 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Wendt lives in New Zealand. Among his works is ''Leaves of the Banyan Tree'' (1979). He is of German heritage through his paternal great-grandfather, which is reflected in some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trout.auckland.ac.nz/journal/15/15_10.html Interview with Albert Wendt: 1], Brandy Nālani McDougall, 12 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his family heritage as "totally Samoan", even though he has a German surname. However, he does not explicitly deny his German heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Patke (2006), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable figure from the region is [[Sia Figiel]] (1967   ), a contemporary [[Samoans|Samoan]] [[novelist]], [[poet]], and [[Painting|painter]], whose debut novel ''Where We Once Belonged'' won the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] ''Best First Book of 1997,'' ''South East Asia and South Pacific Region''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pontas-agency.com/Autors/ENG/Author_Sia_Figiel_6533.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923192528/http://www.pontas-agency.com/Autors/ENG/Author_Sia_Figiel_6533.asp |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sia Figiel grew up amidst traditional Samoan singing and poetry, which heavily influenced her writing.

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian literature#Aboriginal writers and themes}}

At the point of the first colonization, [[Indigenous Australians]] had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of aborigines come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genoni|first=Paul|title=Subverting the Empire: Explorers and Exploration in Australian Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Common Ground|location=Altona, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early accounts by Dutch explorers and the English buccaneer [[William Dampier]] wrote of the "natives of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]" as being "barbarous savages", but by the time of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[First Fleet]] marine [[Watkin Tench]] (the era of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), accounts of aborigines were more sympathetic and romantic: "these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans", wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=James|title=The Journal of HMS Endeavour, 1768–1771|year=1977|publisher=Genesis|location=Surrey, England|isbn=0904351025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his father, [[James Unaipon]] (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of aboriginal mythology written by the missionary George Taplin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkin|first=Graham|title=Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri|year=1979|publisher=Rigby|location=Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Unaipon]] (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of aboriginal mythology written by an aboriginal: "''[[Legendary Tales of the Aborigines]]"''. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author. [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (1920–1995) (born Kath Walker) was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. She was also a campaigner for [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] rights.&lt;ref name="awap"&gt;{{cite web|last=Land |first=Clare |title=Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1993) |publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project |date=16 September 2013 |url= http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/IMP0082b.htm |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oodgeroo was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse ''[[We Are Going]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;"Oodgeroo Noonuccal."

[[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s novel ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]'' (1987) was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading aboriginal activists [[Marcia Langton]] (''[[First Australians]]'', 2008) and [[Noel Pearson]] (''[[Up From the Mission]]'', 2009) are active contemporary contributors to [[Australian literature]].

The voices of [[Australian Aborigines|Indigenous Australians]] are being increasingly noticed and include the [[playwright]] [[Jack Davis (playwright)|Jack Davis]] and [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]]. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include [[Kim Scott]], [[Alexis Wright]], Kate Howarth [[Tara June Winch]], in poetry [[Yvette Holt]] and in popular fiction [[Anita Heiss]].

Indigenous authors who have won Australia's high prestige [[Miles Franklin Award]] include [[Kim Scott]] who was joint winner (with [[Thea Astley]]) in 2000 for ''[[Benang]]'' and again in 2011 for ''[[That Deadman Dance]].'' [[Alexis Wright]] won the award in 2007 for her novel ''[[Carpentaria (novel)|Carpentaria]].''

Many notable works have been written by non-indigenous Australians on aboriginal themes. [[Eleanor Dark]]'s (1901–1985) ''[[The Timeless Land]]'' (1941) is the first of ''The Timeless Land'' trilogy of novels about European settlement and exploration of Australia. The narrative is told from English and [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] points of view. The novel begins with two Aboriginal men watching the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] at [[Sydney Harbour]] on 26 January 1788. Other examples include the poems of [[Judith Wright]], ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' by [[Thomas Keneally]], ''Ilbarana'' by [[Donald Stuart (novelist)|Donald Stuart]], and the short story by [[David Malouf]]: "The Only Speaker of his Tongue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-contents.aspx?ID=12252|title=Page Not Found - W.

===South Africa===
{{See also|South African poetry}}
[[Elleke Boehmer]] (cf. Cullhed, 2006: 79) writes, “Nationalism, like patriarchy, favours singleness—one identity, one growth pattern, one birth and blood for all ... [and] will promote specifically unitary or ‘one-eyed’ forms of consciousness.” The first problem any student of [[South African literature]] is confronted with, is the diversity of the [[literary systems]]. [[Gerrit Olivier]] notes, "While it is not unusual to hear academics and politicians talk about a 'South African literature', the situation at ground level is characterised by diversity and even fragmentation". [[Robert Mossman]] adds that "One of the enduring and saddest legacies of the apartheid system may be that no one – White, Black, Coloured (meaning of mixed-race in South Africa), or Asian – can ever speak as a "South African."  The problem, however, pre-dates Apartheid significantly, as South Africa is a country made up of communities that have always been linguistically and culturally diverse. These cultures have all retained autonomy to some extent, making a compilation such as the controversial ''Southern African Literatures'' by [[Michael Chapman (South Africa)|Michael Chapman]], difficult. Chapman raises the question:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]hose language, culture, or story can be said to have authority in South Africa when the end of apartheid has raised challenging questions as to what it is to be a South African, what it is to live in a new South Africa, whether South Africa is a nation, and, if so, what its mythos is, what requires to be forgotten and what remembered as we scour the past in order to understand the present and seek a path forward into an unknown future.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

South Africa has 11 national languages: [[Afrikaans]], English, [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda]], [[SiSwati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]. Any definitive literary history of South Africa should, it could be argued, discuss literature produced in all eleven languages. But the only literature ever to adopt characteristics that can be said to be "national" is Afrikaans. Olivier argues: "Of all the literatures in South Africa, Afrikaans literature has been the only one to have become a national literature in the sense that it developed a clear image of itself as a separate entity, and that by way of institutional entrenchment through teaching, distribution, a review culture, journals, etc. it could ensure the continuation of that concept." Part of the problem is that English literature has been seen within the greater context of English writing in the world, and has, because of English's global position as ''lingua franca'', not been seen as autonomous or indigenous to South Africa – in Olivier’s words: "English literature in South Africa continues to be a sort of extension of British or international English literature." The African languages, on the other hand, are spoken across the borders of Southern Africa - for example, Tswana is spoken in Botswana, and Tsonga in Zimbabwe, and Sotho in Lesotho. South Africa's borders were drawn up by the [[British Empire]] and, as with all other colonies, these borders were drawn without regard for the people living within them. Therefore: in a history of South African literature, do we include all Tswana writers, or only the ones with South African citizenship? Chapman bypasses this problem by including "Southern" African literatures. The second problem with the African languages is accessibility, because since the African languages are regional languages, none of them can claim the readership on a national scale comparable to Afrikaans and English. Sotho, for instance, while transgressing the national borders of the RSA, is on the other hand mainly spoken in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and bears a great amount of relation to the language of [[Natal (region)|Natal]] for example, Zulu. So the language cannot claim a national readership, while on the other hand being "international" in the sense that it transgresses the national borders.

Olivier argues that "There is no obvious reason why it should be unhealthy or abnormal for different literatures to co-exist in one country, each possessing its own infrastructure and allowing theoreticians to develop impressive theories about polysystems". Yet political idealism proposing a unified "South Africa" (a remnant of the colonial British approach) has seeped into literary discourse and demands a unified national literature, which does not exist and has to be fabricated. It is unrealistic to ever think of South Africa and South African literature as homogenous, now or in the near or distant future, since the only reason it is a country at all is the interference of European colonial powers. This is not a racial issue, but rather has to do with culture, heritage and tradition (and indeed the constitution celebrates diversity). Rather, it seems more sensible to discuss South African literature as literature produced within the national borders by the different cultures and language groups inhabiting these borders. Otherwise the danger is emphasising one literary system at the expense of another, and more often than not, the beneficiary is English, with the African languages being ignored. The distinction "black" and "white" literature is further a remnant of colonialism that should be replaced by drawing distinctions between literary systems based on language affiliation rather than race.

The first texts produced by black authors were often inspired by missionaries and frequently deal with African history, in particular the history of kings such as [[Shaka|Chaka]]. Modern South African writing in the African languages tends to play at writing realistically, at providing a mirror to society, and depicts the conflicts between rural and urban settings, between traditional and modern norms, racial conflicts and most recently, the problem of AIDS.

In the first half of the 20th century, epics largely dominated black writing: historical novels, such as [[Sol T. Plaatje]]’s ''[[Mhudi]]: An Epic of South African Native Life a Hundred Years Ago'' (1930), [[Thomas Mofolo]]’s ''[[Chaka (novel)|Chaka]]'' (trans. 1925), and epic plays including those of [[H. I. E. Dhlomo]], or heroic epic poetry such as the work of [[Mazizi Kunene]]. These texts “evince black African patriarchy in its traditional form, with men in authority, often as warriors or kings, and women as background figures of dependency, and/or mothers of the nation” (Cullhed, 2006: 21). Female literature in the African languages is severely limited because of the strong influence of patriarchy, but over the last decade or two society has changed much and it can be expected that more female voices will emerge.

The following are notable white South African writers in English: [[Athol Fugard]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], and [[Wilbur Smith]]. [[André Brink]] has written in both Afrikaans and English while [[Breyten Breytenbach]] writes primarily in [[Afrikaans]], though many of their works have been translated into English. [[Dalene Matthee]]'s (1938 – 2005) is another Afrikaner, best known for her four ''Forest Novels'', written in and around the [[Knysna Forest]], including ''[[Fiela se Kind]]'' (1985) (''Fiela's Child'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalenematthee.co.za/english/biography/index.html|title=Dalene Matthee|website=www.dalenematthee.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books have been translated into fourteen languages, including English, [[French (language)|French]], and [[German (language)|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mieliestronk.com/skryfdmatthee.html|title=Skrywer Dalene Matthee|website=www.mieliestronk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over a million copies have been sold worldwide.

It is the story of [[Bertha Mason|Antoinette Cosway]], a white [[Creole peoples|Creole]] heiress, from the time of her youth in [[Jamaica]], to her unhappy marriage to a certain English gentleman—he is never named by the author. He renames her to a prosaic Bertha, declares her mad, and requires her to relocate to England. Caught in an oppressive [[patriarchal]] society in which she fully belongs neither to the white Europeans nor the black [[Jamaica]]ns, Cosway is Rhys' version of Brontë's devilish "madwoman in the attic." As with many postcolonial works, the novel deals with the themes of racial inequality and the harshness of displacement and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. It is also concerned with power relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Suneeta Peres da Costa ''Wide Sargasso Sea'', Fifty Years on". ''[[Sydney Review of Books]]'',  9 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[West Indies]]" first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as [[Samuel Selvon]], [[John Edgar Colwell Hearne|John Hearne]], [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], [[V.S. Naipaul]], and [[George Lamming]] began to be published in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Ramchand|Ramchand, Kenneth]]. ''The West Indian Novel and Its Background.'' London: Faber, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the [[BBC]] radio programme ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of producer [[Henry Swanzy]], and broadcast back to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Glyne. "Deconstructing Nationalisms: Henry Swanzy, Caribbean Voices and the Development of West Indian Literature", Small Axe, Number 10 (Volume 5, Number 2), September 2001, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines such as ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]'' in Guyana, ''[[Bim (magazine)|Bim]]'' in Barbados, and ''[[Focus (Jamaican magazine)|Focus]]'' in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dalleo, Raphael.

Many—perhaps most—West Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] in order to make a living from their work—in some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, [[V. S. Naipaul]] ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and [[Paule Marshall]] American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers "West Indian".

West Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other "national" literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience.

One unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of "[[dialect]]" forms of the national language, often termed [[Creole language|creole]]. The various local variations in the language adopted from the [[colonial powers]] such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation - now commonly termed [[nation language]] - and the standard form of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waters|first=Erika J.|authorlink=Erika J.

Two West Indian writers have won the [[Nobel Prize for literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[Derek Walcott]] (1992), born in St. Lucia, resident mostly in Trinidad during the 1960s and '70s, and partly in the United States since then; and [[V. S. Naipaul]], born in Trinidad and resident in the [[United Kingdom]] since the 1950. ([[Saint-John Perse]], who won the Nobel Prize in 1960, was born in the French territory of [[Guadeloupe]].)

Other notable names in (anglophone) Caribbean literature have included [[Earl Lovelace]], [[Austin Clarke (novelist)|Austin Clarke]], [[Claude McKay]], [[Orlando Patterson]], [[Andrew Salkey]], [[Edward Kamau Brathwaite]] (who was born in Barbados and has lived in Ghana and Jamaica), [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]], and [[Michelle Cliff]], to name only a few. In more recent times, a number of literary voices have emerged from the Caribbean as well as the Caribbean diaspora, including Kittitian [[Caryl Phillips]] (who has lived in the UK since one month of age), [[Edwidge Danticat]], a [[Haiti]]an immigrant to the United States; [[Anthony Kellman]] from Barbados, who divides his time between Barbados and the United States; [[Andrea Levy]] of the United Kingdom, Jamaicans [[Colin Channer]] and [[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]], the author of the [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014) (as well as ''John Crow's Devil'', ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'', the unpublished screenplay "Dead Men", and the short story "Under Cover of Darkness"), Antiguan [[Marie-Elena John]], and [[Lasana M. Sekou]] from St. Maarten/St. Martin.

[[Earl Lovelace]] (1935 –  ) is an award-winning [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[novelist]], [[journalist]], [[playwright]], and [[short story writer]]. He is particularly recognized for his descriptive, dramatic fiction on Trinidadian culture: "Using Trinidadian dialect patterns and standard English, he probes the paradoxes often inherent in social change as well as the clash between rural and urban cultures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349553/Earl-Lovelace "Earl Lovelace"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Bernardine Evaristo]] notes, "Lovelace is unusual among celebrated Caribbean writers in that he has always lived in Trinidad. Most writers leave to find support for their literary endeavours elsewhere and this, arguably, shapes the literature, especially after long periods of exile. But Lovelace's fiction is deeply embedded in Trinidadian society and is written from the perspective of one whose ties to his homeland have never been broken."&lt;ref&gt;Bernardine Evaristo, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/29/is-just-movie-earl-lovelace-review "Is Just a Movie by Earl Lovelace – review.

[[Bharati Mukherjee]]  although of [[Indian subcontinent|East Indian]] ancestry has gone on record that she considers herself an [[American writers|American writer]], and not an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian expatriate]] writer. In a 1989 interview with Amanda Meer, Mukherjee said: "I totally consider myself an American writer, and that has been my big battle: to get to realize that my roots as a writer are no longer, if they ever were, among Indian writers, but that I am writing about the territory about the feelings, of a new kind of pioneer here in America. I’m the first among Asian immigrants to be making this distinction between immigrant writing and expatriate writing. Most Indian writers prior to this, have still thought of themselves as Indians, and their literary inspiration, has come from India. India has been the source, and home. Whereas I’m saying, those are wonderful roots, but now my roots are here and my emotions are here in North America."&lt;ref&gt;Meer, Amanda http://bombsite.com/issues/29/articles/1264 Fall 1989, Retrieved May 20, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====African-American literature====
Throughout American history, [[African American]]s have been discriminated against and subject to racist attitudes.  This experience inspired some Black writers, at least during the early years of [[African-American literature]], to prove they were the equals of European-American authors.  As Henry Louis Gates, Jr, has said, "it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"&gt;"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By refuting the claims of the dominant culture, African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States.  Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"/&gt;  This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination.  By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke "the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Marjorie Pryse in "The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, perhaps most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref name = "jhu_theory"&gt;Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html "African-American Theory and Criticism"] (accessed July 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puerto Rico====
[[Giannina Braschi]] (1953) is a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] writer, who is credited with writing the first [[Spanglish]] novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' (1998), the [[post-modernism|post-modern]] poetry trilogy ''Empire of Dreams'' (1994), and the [[philosophical fiction]] ''[[United States of Banana]]'' (2011), which chronicles the [[Latin American]] [[immigrant]]s' experiences in the United States and the Puerto Rican battle with Spanish and American colonialism.

====Native American Renaissance====
[[Native American Renaissance]] is a term originally coined by [[literary critic|critic]] Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book ''Native American Renaissance'' to categorise the significant increase in production of [[Literature|literary works]] by [[Native Americans in the United States]] in the late 1960s onwards. A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of [[N. Scott Momaday]]'s ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' in 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, "Introduction", in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1969.

According to Said's work "the Orient" is a term constructed as the inferior shadow to the civilized and powerful West, the Occident. Its supposed inferiority is explained in racial terms. The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]], against British rule in Egypt and the Sudan, had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old.

===Philippines===
[[Philippine literature]] includes the legends of prehistory, and the colonial legacy of the Philippines. Pre-Hispanic Philippine literature were actually epics passed on from generation to generation originally through oral tradition. However, wealthy families, especially in Mindanao were able to keep transcribed copies of these epics as family heirloom. One such epic was the '''''Darangen''''', epic of the [[Maranao people|Maranaos]] of Lake Lanao. Most of the epics were known during the Spanish era.

Most of the notable literature of the Philippines was written during the Spanish period and the first half of the 20th century in the Spanish language. Philippine literature is written in [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Spanish]], [[Philippine literature in English|English]], or any indigenous [[Philippine languages]].
Notable authors include [[F. Sionil José]], [[Jose Dalisay, Jr.]], [[N. V. M. Gonzalez]] and [[Nick Joaquin]].

===India===
One of the key issues is the superiority/inferiority of [[Indian Writing in English]] as opposed to the literary production in the various languages of India. Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.

The views of [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Amit Chaudhuri]] expressed through their books ''The Vintage Book of Indian Writing'' and ''The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature'' respectively essentialise this battle. Rushdie's statement in his book&amp;nbsp;– "the ironic proposition that India's best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear"&amp;nbsp;– created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions&amp;nbsp;– "Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?"

Chaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, [[Indian writing in English]] started employing magical realism, bagginess, non-linear narrative and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as [[R. K. Narayan]] where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indian is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the vernacular literature. He further adds "the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybrid by which the West celebrates not so much Indian, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself".

Some of these arguments form an integral part of what is called [[postcolonial theory]]. The very categorisation of IWE&amp;nbsp;– as IWE or under post-colonial literature&amp;nbsp;– is seen by some as limiting. [[Amitav Ghosh]] made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for his book ''[[The Glass Palace]]'' in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.

The renowned writer V. S. Naipaul, a third generation Indian from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and a [[Nobel prize]] laureate, is a person who belongs to the world and usually not classified under IWE. Naipaul evokes ideas of homeland, rootlessness and his own personal feelings towards India in many of his books.

Indian authors like [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Rohinton Mistry]], [[Meena Alexander]], [[Arundhati Roy]] and [[Kiran Desai]] have written about their postcolonial experiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The most significant novels of the current generation of [[Urdu literature|Indian novelists in Urdu]] are ''[[Makaan]]'' by [[Paigham Afaqui]] (1956 – ), ''Do Gaz Zameen'' by Abdus Samad, and ''Pani'' by Ghazanfer. These works, especially ''Makaan'', has moved the Urdu novel beyond the prevalent themes relating to [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistan's gaining of independence]] in 1947, and identity issues, and take it into modern-day realities and issues of life in India. ''Makaan'' influenced many English writers including [[Vikram Seth]]. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, ''[[Paleeta]]'', was published in 2011 and depicts the political cynicism of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence.

The [[Hungry Generation]] was a [[Bengali literature|literary movement in the Bengali language]] launched by what is known today as the "Hungryalist quartet", ''i.e.'' [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]] and [[Debi Roy]] (''alias'' Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in [[Kolkata]], India. Due to their involvement in this [[avant garde]] cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Uttam Das, Reader, Calcutta University, in his dissertation 'Hungry Shruti and Shastravirodhi Andolan'&lt;/ref&gt;

The novels of [[J. G. Farrell]] are important texts dealing with the collapse of the [[British Empire]]. ''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'', is set during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921), and is the first instalment in Farrell's "Empire Trilogy", preceding ''[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]'' and ''[[The Singapore Grip]]'', all written during the 1970s. Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. ''The Siege of Krishnapurn'' was inspired by events such as the sieges of [[Siege of Cawnpore]] ([[Kanpur]]) and [[Siege of Lucknow|Lucknow]], and details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] from the perspective of the British residents. ''The Singapore Grip'' is [[Satire|satirical]] book about events following Japan's entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]] and occupation of [[Singapore]]. The story centres on a British family who control one of the colony's leading trading companies.

Novelist [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924) takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the [[British Raj]]. Forster connects personal relationships with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the [[Marabar Caves]].

[[The Raj Quartet]]  a four-volume [[novel sequence]], written by [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]], also deals with the subject of the British in India, in this case the concluding years of the [[British Raj]] in India. The series was written during the period 1965&amp;ndash;75. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "one of the most important landmarks of post-war fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/book.htm?command=Search&amp;db=main.txt&amp;eqisbndata=0099439964|title=Penguin Books|website=www.randomhouse.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of ''The Raj Quartet'' begins in 1942. [[World War II]] is at its zenith, and in [[South East Asia]], the Allied forces have suffered great losses. [[Burma]] has fallen, and the Japanese invasion of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the east appears imminent.  The year 1942 is also marked by Indian nationalist leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]]’s call for the [[Quit India|Quit India movement]] to the British rulers of India. ''The Raj Quartet'' is set in this tumultuous background for the British soldiers and civilians stationed in India who have a duty to manage this part of the [[British Empire]]. One recurrent theme is the moral certainty of the older generation as contrasted with the [[anomie]] of the younger.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in ''Day of the Scorpion'', Sarah Layton envies the "self-assurance" of her older aunt. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3K2JoacH24C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=%22virtues+of+self-assurance+and+moral+certainty%3B+what%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Day of the Scorpion'', Book Two Part Two ch. IV]&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[racism]] to which this leads.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Day of the Scorpion'', Hari Kumar describes how the British were shocked and embarrassed at the sight of an Englishwoman treating an Indian as a human being rather than as an inferior being. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=rcDyGQ-2EngC&amp;pg=PT183&amp;lpg=PT183&amp;dq=%22Chatterjee+was+incapable+of+accepting+immediately%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Day of the Scorpion'' Book Two Part One Ch. I]&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the racism and combat this danger of anomie and disintegration, the British characters let themselves be "trapped by codes and principles, which were in part to keep their own fears and doubts at bay."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/books/397731/when-the-sun-finally-set.thtml review of ''Raj Quartet''] in [[The Spectator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
The whole of [[Wales]] was annexed by England and incorporated within the [[English law|English legal system]] under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. Distinctive [[Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century, and Welsh national feeling grew during the 20th century. The Welsh nationalist party, ''[[Plaid Cymru]]'', was formed in 1925 and the [[Welsh Language Society]] in 1962.

[[Saunders Lewis]] (1893 – 1985), the noted [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh language poet, novelist, dramatist]], and nationalist, rejected the possibility of [[Anglo-Welsh]] literature, because of its use of [[English language|English]], the language of the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonialists, affirming that '"the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature".&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Collins, "Keeping the Flag Flying: Anglo-Welsh Poetry in the Twentieth Century". ''World Literature Today'', Vol. 56, no. 1 (Winter 1982); Saunders Lewis, "Is There an Anglo-Welsh Literature", Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders Lewis was himself born in [[Wallasey]] in England to a Welsh-speaking family.

The attitude of the post-war generation of [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh writers in English]] towards [[Wales]] differs from the previous generation, in that they were more sympathetic to [[Welsh nationalism]] and to the [[Welsh language]]. The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by [[Saunders Lewis]] and the burning of the Bombing School on the [[Lleyn Peninsula]] in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pocket Guide'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry [[R. S. Thomas]] (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century, beginning with ''The Stones of the Field'' in 1946 and concluding with ''No Truce with the Furies'' (1995). While he "did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English",&lt;ref name=LATimesObit&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', "Obituary", September 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; he wanted the Welsh language to be made the first language of Wales, and the official policy of bilingualism abolished. He wrote his autobiography in Welsh, but said he lacked the necessary grasp of the language to employ it in his poems. Although an Anglican priest, he was a fervent nationalist and advocated non-violent action against English owners of holiday homes in Wales.&lt;ref name=LATimesObit /&gt; As an admirer of Saunders Lewis, Thomas defended his need to use English: "Since there is in Wales a mother tongue that continues to flourish, a proper Welshman can only look on English as a means of rekindling interest in the Welsh language, and of leading people back to the mother tongue."&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Thomas, ''Selected Prose'', ed. Sandra Anstey. Brigend: Poetry Wales Press, 1986, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation the [[National Assembly for Wales]], under the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], Wales now has more local autonomy from the central government in England. The [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality. English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the ''de facto'' main language. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh.&lt;ref name="2011 Census Language"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286268 |title=2011 Census, Key Statistics for Unitary Authorities in Wales |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=11 December 2012|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/English/publications/Publications/332.doc |title=Census 2001: Main statistics about Welsh |publisher=[[Welsh Language Board]] |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063247/http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/english/publications/publications/332.doc |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|"Birth of the Irish Republic" by Walter Paget, depicting the [[Dublin]] [[General Post Office|GPO]] being shelled during the [[Easter Uprising]] of 1916.]]
The English language was introduced to [[Ireland]] in the 13th century, following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. The [[Irish language]], however, remained the dominant language of [[Irish literature]] down to the 19th century, despite a slow decline which began in the 17th century with the expansion of English power.

The 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the traditional aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little sympathy for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms.&lt;ref&gt;TLG 201–223.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]] and the anonymous authors of ''Pairliment Chloinne Tomáis'', a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction to Williams (1981). The text is bilingual.&lt;/ref&gt; Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of [[Geoffrey Keating]] (Seathrún Céitinn) and the compilation known as the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.

The consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included [[Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin]] and [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] of [[Sliabh Luachra]]. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Caerwyn Williams and Ní Mhuiríosa (1979), pp. 252–268, 282–290. See Corkery (1925) for a detailed discussion of the social context.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 18th century Dublin was the home of an Irish-language literary circle connected to the Ó Neachtain (Naughton) family, a group with wide-ranging Continental connections.&lt;ref&gt;Caerwyn Williams and Ní Mhuiríosa (1979), pp. 279–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, though Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the [[Gaelic Revival]] (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and [[Northern Ireland]], which remained a part of the [[United Kingdom]].

'''Qalaat Tannour''' (also known as '''Qalaat et Tannoûr''') is a [[Shepherd Neolithic]] archaeological site located halfway between [[Britel]] and [[Haour Taala]], {{convert|12|km|mi}} southwest of [[Baalbek]] in the [[Baalbek District]] of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

The surface site was discovered by  M. Besançon in 1966 on a hill of exposed limestone rocks. It was the furthest south of all of the Shepherd Neolithic sites catalogued at the time. [[Flint]] tools found at the location were generally in a brown or grey, some showing a white [[patina]]. Blade types were typically short but also included thin and backed varieties, steep-scrapers and cores. The material was stored with the [[Saint Joseph University]], [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

Several [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tomb]]s were also noted at the site.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

'''Quinto Cenni''' (20 March 1845 – 13 August 1917) was an [[Italian People|Italian]] [[painter]], [[engraver]], [[lithographer]] and [[illustrator]] who specialized in depicting military personnel and their uniforms.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Imola]] in the [[Papal States]] to a family with liberal sympathies, some of whose members later fought with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/quinto-cenni_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Brief biography and appreciation] @ [[Treccani]] (includes a biography of his son, Italo).&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1856 and his children became scattered. Quinto was sent to [[Bologna]], where a government grant from the city of Imola enabled him to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna|Accademia di Belle Arti]],&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/trombealvento/cartoline/cenni.htm Brief biography] @ Libero.&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied with [[Napoleone Angiolini]]. He soon became interested in new technologies and, from 1862 to 1867, studied [[xylography]] with [[Francesco Ratti]]. In 1867, three years after the death of his mother, he moved to [[Milan]] where he continued his studies at the [[Brera Academy|Accademia di Brera]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;
[[File:1er régiment d'infanterie légère napolitain, 1812.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''First Infantry Regiment from Naples in 1812'']]
At that time, photography was still a cumbersome process, so Cenni had an opportunity to develop his skills as an engraver and lithographer by providing images for the numerous illustrated magazines that were coming into existence after the [[Risorgimento]]. After 1870, he worked for numerous periodicals, notably ''Emporio pittoresco'' (published by [[Edoardo Sonzogno|Casa Sonzogno]]) and ''{{ill|L'Illustrazione Italiana|it}}'' (published by {{ill|Fratelli Treves|it}}).&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; From 1887 to 1897, he was Editor of ''L'Illustrazione Militare Italiana''.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt;

By then, he had already chosen to specialize in military subjects, spending many hours on research to assure that the details of the uniforms and equipment were perfectly accurate. Sometimes, he consulted with foreign experts on weaponry specifications. He strove to make daily life in the barracks as interesting as the more dramatic maneuvers, carried out during summer in the picturesque Italian countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Quinto Cenni, plates 307-419 "Esercito Italiano Dell' Ottocento", Rivista Militare 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Peacetime soldiering was portrayed in his works as a generally attractive and challenging fulfillment of one's patriotic duty toward the newly [[Italian unification|unified Italian state]].

Even after the beginning of World War I, he attempted to stay fully informed, but this became increasingly difficult as the situation deteriorated, and he died in [[Carate Brianza]] before the war was over.
[[File:Quinto Cenni - Uniformi della Marina.jpg|thumb|275px|''Uniforms of the Italian Royal Navy'', 1873]]
From 1878 to 1916, he published over a dozen albums featuring various aspects of the Italian military, including volumes on the [[Bersaglieri]] (1886), [[Grenadier|Granatieri]] (1887), and [[Carabinieri]] (1894). He also provided illustrations for ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]; ''Ettore Fieramosca'' and ''Niccolò de' Lapi'', both by [[Massimo D'Azeglio]]; and ''L'assedio di Firenze'' by [[Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt;

Hundreds of his watercolors are currently held in the National Museum at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] and the [[Museum of the Risorgimento (Milan)|Museum of the Risorgimento]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In 2000, fifty previously unpublished works were presented at an exhibition in [[New York City|New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27405">[[File:Borodin.jpg|right|200px|[[help:contents|demo]]]]'''Symphony No. 2 in B minor''' by [[Alexander Borodin]] was composed intermittently between 1869 and 1876. It consists of four movements and is considered the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself. It has many melodic resemblances to both ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', two theatre works that diverted Borodin's attention on and off during the six years of composition.

==Composition==
Although he had a keen interest in music, Borodin's scientific research and teaching duties as an adjunct professor of Chemistry in the Medico-Surgical Academy at [[St. Petersburg]] since 1874 interrupted his composition of the Second [[Symphony]]. As a result, this symphony took several years to complete.

{{quote|On visiting him I seldom found him working in the laboratory which adjoined his apartment. When he sat over his retorts filled with some colorless gas and distilled it by means of a tube from one vessel into another, I used to tell him that he was ‘transfusing emptiness into vacancy’. Having finished his work, he would go without me to his apartment, where he began musical operations or conversations, in the midst of which he used to jump up, run back to the laboratory to see whether something had not burned out or boiled over; meanwhile he filled the corridor with incredible sequences from successions of ninths or sevenths.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Lee. Greenwalt. "A Study of the Symphony in Russia from Glinka to the Early Twentieth Century." (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilm, 1972), 120.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Rimsky-Korsakov]]}}

Immediately after the successful premiere of his first symphony in E-flat conducted by [[Mily Balakirev]] at the Imperial Russian Music concert in 1869, Borodin began writing the Second Symphony in B minor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Abraham]], foreword to Alexander Borodin, "Symphony No. 2 in B minor," 1869–76 (London: Ernst Eulenberg), ii.&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, he left off work on the piece in order to work on ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (Knyaz Igor), an opera based on a 12th-century epic "the Story of Igor's Army," suggested by his friend and first biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]]. Borodin suddenly decided to abandon ''Prince Igor'' in March 1870, criticizing his own inability to write a libretto that would satisfy both musical and scenic requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W Oldani, "Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir’yevich," in [[Grove Music Online]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com] (accessed 10 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; He told his wife, "There is scarcely any drama or scenic movement… Anyhow, opera seems to me an unnatural thing… besides I am by nature a lyricist and symphonist; I am attracted by the symphonic forms."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after setting ''Prince Igor'' aside, Borodin returned to the B minor Symphony, assuring Stasov that the "materials" created for the opera would be used in the newly revived symphony. According to Stasov in an article contributed to the "Vestnik Evropi" in 1883, Borodin told him more than once that in the first movement he wished to depict a gathering of Russian warrior-heroes, in the slow movement the figure of a bayan—a type of Russian [[accordion]], and in the finale a scene of heroes feasting to the sound of guslis—an ancient plucked instrument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He composed most of the first movement in April 1870, and he wrote it out onto a piano score a year later, in spring 1871. In that same year he sketched the Scherzo and Andante. That summer he orchestrated the first movement, and in October he drafted the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borodin's work on the symphony was again interrupted when the Director of the Imperial Theatres, Stephan Gedenov, asked him to collaborate on an extravagant opera-ballet ''[[Mlada]]'' with other members of [[Vladimir Stasov]]'s "mighty little heap," namely [[Cesar Cui]], [[Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Maes, A History of Russian Music: From Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar, translated by [[Arnold J. Pomerans]] and Erica Pomerans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In his usual fashion of composing, Borodin borrowed heavily from earlier works, in this case ''Prince Igor''. The show was ultimately cancelled because of production costs, and Borodin once again turned to the B minor Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new interest took his attention away from the composition once again in the fall of 1872 as the [[Tsar Alexander II]]'s government passed legislation allowing women to take advanced medical courses. As an advocate of the new campaign, Borodin became the founder of a School of Medicine for women, where he taught several courses. Despite these distractions, Borodin finished the piano score in May 1873.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Oldani, "Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir’yevich."&lt;/ref&gt;

The following academic year (1873–74), more and more aggravated that he was not receiving support or recognition for his scientific work, he published his last paper on aldehydes and turned to teaching; it was at this time that he became director of the Medical-Surgical Academy's laboratory facilities. Meanwhile, he also took up ''Prince Igor'' again and worked on orchestrating the final three movements of the symphony, although this work was not ultimately completed until 1875.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In the autumn of 1876, the [[Russian Musical Society]] showed an interest in performing the symphony; however, Borodin was disconcerted to find that he had lost the full score.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Although the middle movements were eventually found, he had to reorchestrate the outer two movements while sick in bed. The work was premiered 10 March 1877&lt;ref&gt;26 February/10 March. Dates in scholarly texts for this and other Russian works are frequently shown with both the earlier [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] dates, and later [[Gregorian calendar]] dates; Russia used the Eastern Orthodox calendar until the fall of tsarist Russia with the beginning of the [[communist]] regime when [[Lenin]] changed to the Gregorian calendar.&lt;/ref&gt; under the baton of [[Eduard Nápravník]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This symphony fits in the debate over the merit of [[folklore]] elements and traditional western art music values, which was a central conflict of [[Romantic nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was popular, but according to Rimsky-Korsakov, only enjoyed "moderate success" because Borodin had written the brass part too thickly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Borodin's relationship with [[Liszt]] also had impacted his symphonic writing. Later in 1877, Borodin traveled to Germany in order to enroll some of his chemistry pupils in Jena University. While in Germany, Borodin visited Liszt in [[Weimar]] where the two played through both of Borodin's symphonies in four-hand piano arrangements. Liszt had been an admirer of Borodin's music and he arranged performances of Borodin's symphonies, making them the first Russian symphonies to be received abroad. Regarding Borodin's attempt to revise his score, Liszt said,

{{quote|Heaven forbid! Do not touch it; alter nothing. Your modulations are neither extravagant nor faulty. Your artistic instinct is such that you need not fear to be original. Do not listen to those who would deter you from following your own way. You are on the right road. Similar advice was given to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who wisely ignored it. Despite the adage that ‘there is nothing new under the sun,’ your Second Symphony is entirely new. Nobody had done anything like it. And it is perfectly logical in structure."…. From another source you are always lucid, intelligent and perfectly original […] work in your own way and pay no attention to anyone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

==Score and edition==
In 1879 Borodin revised the orchestration of the symphony and thinned out the heavy brass parts. The premiere of this final version took place 4 March 1879 under the baton of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] at a Free School Concert.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, v.&lt;/ref&gt; Borodin became occupied with the symphony one last time in 1886, while preparing the manuscript full score for the printer. He made a few refinement changes suggested by Rimsky-Korsakov, who also provided the [[metronome]] markings based on the successful second performance.

==Description==
[[File:Theme from the second symphony (Borodin's tomb).JPG|220 px|thumb|Theme of the first movement on Borodin's grave monument.]]

The B minor [[Symphony]] is arguably the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself, and is considered to be one of his greatest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It has many melodic resemblances to both ''Prince Igor'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', which were two theatrical works that diverted Borodin's attention away from the B minor symphony between 1869–75.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; According to the account of Borodin's friend [[Nikolay Kashkin]], the symphony's striking and abrupt opening theme originated from the abandoned chorus of [[Polovtsian]]s,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biographer Serge Dianin notes that there is a common thread present in all three pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Dianin, Borodin, translated by Robert Lord (London: [[Oxford University Press]], 1963), 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dianin, "it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes [[Borodin]] uses in these works." &lt;ref&gt;According to Dianin, "it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes [[Borodin]] uses in these works."&lt;/ref&gt; The relation to the heroic world of ''Prince Igor'' led Stasov to nickname the work the "''Bogatirskaya simfoniya''" ("Heroic symphony").&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===I. Allegro moderato===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=73]]

Excluding the E natural, the opening theme is made up of an [[octatonic]] subcollection which consists of the major and minor 3rd above the tonic. The alternation between major and minor thirds is found throughout the symphony, and is based on this opening theme.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The lyrical second theme in D major not only sets a contrast to the first theme, but also to present the cyclic elements evident in the whole work. This is very recognizable in the trio of the [[scherzo]] movement, and distantly echoed in the finale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Maes states that the second theme is a protyazhnaya stylization, which he defines as "a splendid form of melismatically decorated song set to poetry of great expressive power and lyrical intensity." &lt;ref&gt;Maes, A History of Russian Music, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second theme in the recapitulation is also in E-flat (a diminished fourth away from the opening theme), making it an [[enharmonic]] major third above B natural. This makes the interchange between the major and minor third not only melodic, but structural as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Musicologist A. Peter Brown notes that the first movement is a [[sonata form]], shaped by a somewhat unusual key scheme in the recapitulation, and provides the following analysis of the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;A. Peter Brown and Brian Hart, The European Symphony from ca. 1800 to ca. 1930, vol. 3, part B: Great Britain, Russia, and France. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008), 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Borodin treats the exposition in a typical manner, S in the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] does not return to the tonic key or even to a closely related key. Instead, he uses two keys (E-flat and C) which are not only distant from B minor, but also unrelated to the tonic key of S in the exposition. Brown concludes with the following thoughts about the first movement:

{{quote|For a supposedly dilettante [[composer]] who had little training in the academic studies of musical composition, this first movement is a significant accomplishment. Though it has virtually no [[polyphony]], Borodin has sustained this piece with attractive melodies motivically interrelated, a large-scale sense of rhythm, effective orchestration in the revised version, and idiosyncratic use of harmony and [[modulation]], particularly in the recapitulation. This masterly first movement is a considerable advance over that of his First Symphony, whose high originality made it at times less effective.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2008), 316&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In spite of the first movement's sonata-like form, according to Brown, musicologist Francis Maes states that because of a compulsive repetition of the motto – in sequences, diminutions, and augmentations – the orchestration – with intensive use of the low brass – and the peculiarity of tempo changes, "all this turns the first movement into a montage of contrasts rather than into a developing sonata form."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Despite this apparent conflict, music critic David Fanning argues that Borodin's use of melodic material, and the heroic themes that result, are "virtually unprecedented in the history of the symphony." &lt;ref&gt;Fanning, David. "Building a Library; Borodin's Symphony No. 2." [[BBC Music Magazine]]. Vol. 5, issue 8. (London: [[BBC]] Magazines, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===II. Scherzo. Molto vivo===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=74]]

The second movement is unconventional in many ways, as it moves to the key of F major – a very remote key; which may have been Balakirev's idea originally.&lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; It breaks from the usual triple meter, and it groups together unusual lengths of phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Borodin opts for {{music|time|1|1}} time with a tempo marking of 108 – four quarter notes to a bar with a whole note receiving the beat – and alternates between four and five bar phrases, with an occasional one or two bar phrase.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a great deal of rhythmic contrast between the two main ideas; the first is firmly on the beat, while the second is syncopated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

After a four bar introduction, a majority of the [[Scherzo]] proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a "kaleidoscope of color."&lt;ref&gt;After a four bar introduction, a majority of the Scherzo proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a "kaleidoscope of color."&lt;/ref&gt; Dianin notes that the second subject in this passage ends in an unusual fashion, marked by descending leaps of a fourth;&lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; while Maes points out the recollection of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], particularly the [[oriental]]-sounding Trio (Allegretto).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Following the transition to the Allegretto section in {{music|time|6|4}}, we have the second main theme. Brown had the following thoughts of this portion of the second movement:

{{quote|Perhaps, this Allegretto is a Russian Barcarolle with its lilting rhythms in compound-duple meter, mild [[hemiola]]s, and a melody marked [[cantabile]] e dolce. Borodin's orchestration of the background is almost [[Klangfarben]] with harp, triangle, and horns providing a pointilistic accompaniment. The form builds through repetitions of its four-measure theme with changes to its background in good kuchkist fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the Allegretto is a return of the Scherzo proper, which [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] found to be the weak link in the symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

===III. Andante===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=75]]
According to Borodin's friend and chief biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]], the third movement of the symphony was intended to depict the Slavic minstrel [[Boyan (bard)|Boyan]] accompanying himself on a [[gusli]] (a type of [[zither]]), represented by the [[harp]]. While this movement is similar to the third movement of his first symphony, the structure differs being [[rondo]]-like:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Andante begins with what Oldani calls "one of Borodin's most serene melodies," &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; played by solo clarinet and accompanied by the harp, and what follows is a horn solo with the ornamental grace notes that are quite typical of Borodin's lyrical melodies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This melody is heard from various instruments throughout the piece, while some of the material incorporates the interaction between minor and major thirds present in the Allegro (I).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The movement ends in a similar fashion to how it began, with clarinet solo followed by horn solo, accompanied by harp. Maes eloquently summarizes the mystique of the third movement by pointing out how powerfully it refers to the "mythical, imaginary world of both ''Ruslan'' and ''Prince Igor''." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===IV. Finale. Allegro===
[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=76]]
According to Oldani the finale is in sonata form, but more free than the first movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, Brown points out that there are at least three viable ways to interpret the formal structure of this movement:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt; 1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic sonata form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.&lt;ref&gt;1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic [[sonata]] form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.&lt;/ref&gt; This section begins with a pentatonic theme in the violin and viola, with the development consisting of a [[whole-tone]] passage which is also used in both Mlada and the prologue of ''Prince Igor''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Stasov states that this movement is a scene of great celebration, which Borodin conveys by writing Slavic dances in mixed triple and duple meter, and [[syncopated]] [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeats]]. These elements, combined with the addition of cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and bass drum, give the music not only a Slavic dance feel, but also makes it "[[Music of Turkey|Turkish]]" sounding to western ears.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Each dance has its own bold rhythmic motion which is a result of the syncopation, as well as the resilient anacrustic formations;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Dianin describes the tone of the movement as being "bright and jubilant." &lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
According to Dianin, Stasov believed that Borodin had the knights and [[heroic]] figures of ancient Russia in mind with this piece. "The first movement depicts an assembly of Russian knights […] the Scherzo could be intended to suggest a headlong chase, but it could equally well be a festive scene […] the third movement was to have depicted Bayan, the legendary minstrel who appears in the ''Lay of Igor's Campaign'' […] and the finale is meant to depict ‘the knights’ feast, the sound of the gusli, and a jubilant throng of people." &lt;ref&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dianin concludes by stating that the overall character of Borodin's Symphony No. 2 is patriotic, and that he is showing his sincere admiration for the strength and courage of the men of old, who "saved Russia from her enemies."&lt;ref name="Dianin, Borodin, 209"&gt;Dianin, Borodin, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Borodin not only admired these great heroes of Russian history, but was able to capture their essence in his music.&lt;ref name="Dianin, Borodin, 209"/&gt; In summing up the work, Brown had the following comment:

{{quote|The Second Symphony proved to be Borodin's great work. Whatever Borodin's technical limitations as a composer, they fail to be revealed in this symphony. The power, the playfulness, the lyricism, and the liveliness incorporated into each of the movements make for a compelling gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 327.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''São Jorge Castle''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de São Jorge}}; {{IPA-pt|kɐʃˈtɛlu dɨ sɐ̃w̃ ˈʒɔɾʒ(ɨ)}}; Saint George Castle) is a [[Moors|Moorish]] [[castle]] occupying a commanding hilltop overlooking the historic centre of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] city of [[Lisbon]] and [[Tagus River]]. The strongly fortified [[citadel]] dates from medieval period of Portuguese history, and is one of the main tourist sites of Lisbon.

==History==
[[File:Castle-DuarteGalvao3.jpg|thumb|left|235px|A 16th-century illuminated manuscript of Lisbon, in the ''Crónica de D. Afonso Henriques'' by Duarte Galvao, depicting the castle and walls, including the Royal Palace (''Alcáçova'') (1505)]]
[[File:Lisbon - Lisbonne - Lisboa 1572.png|thumb|235px|left|Caravels and carracks in the Tagus River, with the castle in the centre distance, unknown artist (1572)]]
Although the first fortifications on this hilltop date from the 2nd century BC, [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations have identified a human presence in the Tagus valley as far back as the 6th century BC. The first fortification was, presumably, erected in 48 BC, when Lisbon was classified as a Roman municipality.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=3128 |title=Castelo de São Jorge e restos das cercas de Lisboa (PT031106120023) |publisher=SIPA–Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=João |last=Silva |first2=Albertina |last2=Rodrigues |year=2002 |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hill was first used by indigenous [[Celt]]ic tribes, then by [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] as a defensible outpost that was later expropriated by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Suevi|Suebic]], [[Visigoths|Visigothic]], and [[Moors|Moorish]] peoples. During the 10th century, the fortifications were rebuilt by Muslim [[Berbers|Berber]] forces, these included the walls or ''Cerca Moura'' ("Moorish Encirclement").&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Kingdom===
In the context of the [[Christian]] ''[[Reconquista]]'', the castle and the city of Lisbon were freed from Moorish rule in 1147 by [[Afonso Henriques]] and northern European knights in the [[Siege of Lisbon]]  during the [[Second Crusade]]; this victory was the only notable success of that failed crusade.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; According to an oft-repeated [[legend]], the [[knight]] [[Martim Moniz]], noticing that one of the doors to the castle was open, prevented the Moors from closing it by throwing his own body into the breach, thus allowing Christian soldiers to enter at the cost of his own life. With the taking of the castle Christian forces were able to maintain the defense of Lisbon until the end of the 12th century. 

[[File:Castelo Sao Jorge Lisboa 1.JPG|thumb|170px|The castle walls and towers, constructed during the Moorish occupation of Lisbon]]
When Lisbon became the capital of the kingdom in 1255, the castle served as the ''alcáçova'', a fortified residence for [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], in his role as governor.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; It was extensively renovated around 1300 by [[Denis I of Portugal|King Denis I]], transforming the Moorish alcáçova into the Royal Palace of the Alcáçova.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1373 and 1375, King [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] ordered the building of the ''Cerca Nova'' or ''Cerca Fernandina'', the walled compound that enclosed the entirety of the castle.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The master builders João Fernandes and Vasco Brás were responsible for its construction.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; This wall, which partially replaced the old Moorish walls, was designed to encircle previously unprotected parts of the city. Completed in two years, it had 77 towers and a perimeter of {{convert|5400|m|ft}}.

The castle and the city resisted the forces of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] several times during the 14th century (notably in 1373 and in 1383–1384). It was during this period (the late 14th century) that the castle was dedicated to [[Saint George]] by King [[John I of Portugal|John I]], who had married the English princess [[Philippa of Lancaster]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Saint George, the warrior-saint, was normally represented slaying a dragon, and was very popular in both countries.

From this point onward many of the kingdom's records were housed in the ''Torre de Ulisses'' ("Tower of Ulysses"), also known as the ''Torre Albarrã'', until the reign of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The Portuguese [[Torre do Tombo|National Archive]], where the eminent Portuguese [[chronicle]]rs [[Fernão Lopes]] and [[Damião de Góis]] once worked, is still referred to as the ''[[Torre do Tombo]]'' (literally the "Tower of the Archive"). On 9 December 1448, Gil Pires was named the castle master builder to replace Afonso Esteves, being paid 400 [[Portuguese real|réis]] for his work.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1448 and 1451, the master builder was paid several stipends for his work on the palace. Similarly, the mason João de Alverca was paid a substantial sum for stonework. These public works continued from 1449 until 1452, with additional payments being made for labor and materials to convert the building from a fortified castle to a royal residence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

As the royal palace, the castle was the setting for the reception by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] of the navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] when he returned from discovering the maritime route to India in 1498. The castle also served as a theater in 1502 when pioneering playwright [[Gil Vicente]] staged his ''Monólogo do Vaqueiro'' to honor the birth of Manuel I's son and heir, the future [[John III of Portugal|João III]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Around the early 16th century, following the construction of the [[Ribeira Palace]] beside the [[Tagus]] river, the Palace of Alcáçova  began to lose its importance.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; An [[1531 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]] occurring in 1531 further damaged the old castle, contributing further to its decay and neglect.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1569, King [[Sebastiao I of Portugal|Sebastian]] ordered the rebuilding of the royal apartments in the castle, intending to use it as his official residence. As part of the rebuilding, in 1577 Filippo Terzi demolished one of the towers near the principal facade of the Church of Loreto.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; However, many of the works were never completed after the young king's apparent death during the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]]. The following [[Struggle for the throne of Portugal|Portuguese dynastic crisis]] opened the way for [[Iberian Union|sixty years of Spanish rule]] and the castle was converted into military barracks and a prison.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; On 30 December 1642, Teodósio de Frias the Younger was appointed master builder to continue the works begun by his father, Luís de Frias, and his grandfather, Teodósio de Frias. This was part of a greater plan by the Spanish forces to recommission the fortification. 
[[File:Castelo de São Jorge (14005714101).jpg|thumb|center|500px|Lisbon seen from São Jorge Castle]]
However, after Portugal regained its independence following the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the works were taken over by the Portuguese government. On 6 November 1648, Nicolau de Langres was called upon to take over the design, execution and construction of a new fortification that would surround the Castle of São Jorge and the city walls of Lisbon. In 1650 the military architect Mateus do Couto was named master builder of the project and reconstruction took on a new formality: although the military engineer João Gillot built new walls in 1652, construction again followed Couto's plans between 1657 and 1733. In 1673, the Soldiers' Hospital, dedicated to ''São João de Deus'' (St John of God), was installed on the grounds beside the Rua do Recolhimento. At the end of the 17th century the ''Recolhimento do Castelo'' ("Castle Shelter") was constructed along the southeast angle of the courtyard, and in 1733, new projects were initiated by master Custódio Vieira.

The [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] severely damaged the castle and contributed to its continuing decay: apart from the walls of the old castle, the soldier's hospital and the ''Recolhimento'' were left in ruins. The necessity of maintaining a supporting military force within the capital city required expansion of the site's role of garrison and presidio. From 1780 to 1807, the charitable institution [[Casa Pia]], dedicated to the education of poor children, was established in the citadel, while soldiers continued to be garrisoned on site. Inspired by the events of the earthquake and the following tsunami, the first [[geodesy|geodetic]] observatory in Portugal was constructed in 1788 at the top of one of the towers of the castle, later referred to as the ''Torre do Observatório'' (Observatory Tower).

===Republic===
As part of the commemorative celebrations marking the foundation of nationhood and restoration of independence ({{lang-pt|Fundação da Nacionalidade e da Restauração da Independência}}), the government of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] initiated extensive renovations at the site. Most of the incongruous structures added to the castle compound in previous centuries were demolished, under the supervision of the DGEMN, and there was a partial restoration of the ''Recolhimento''. In addition, on 25 October 1947, a monument dedicated to [[Afonso Henriques]], presented by the city of Porto, of a replica created by Soares dos Reis (in 1887) was installed on the grounds.

In 1998, the semi-rectangular spaces, columns and cistern were adapted into the museum ''Olissipónia''.

On 22 August 2006, Direcção Regional de Cultura Lisboa (DRCLisboa) defined a special protection zone, that included the Castle of São Jorge and the rest of the walls of Lisbon, the ''Baixa Pombalina'' and various properties that were already classified as cultural heritage. The ''Conselho Nacional de Cultura'' (National Council of Culture) proposed shelving this definition on 10 October 2011, which was supported by [[IGESPAR]].

==Architecture==
[[File:CastleSaintGeorge.jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panorama of the entire Castle of São Jorge]]
The castle is in the centre of [[Lisbon]], on a hill, while many of its walls extend around the citadel into the civil parishes that surround it to the east and south.

The castle's plan is roughly square, and it was originally encircled by a wall, to form a [[citadel]]. The castle complex consists of the castle itself (the ''castelejo''), some ancillary buildings (including the ruins of the royal palace), gardens, and a large terraced square from which an impressive panorama of Lisbon is visible. The main entrance to the citadel is a 19th-century gate surmounted by the [[coat-of-arms]] of Portugal, the name of [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen Maria II]], and the date 1846. This gate permits access to the main square (''Praça d'Armas''), which is decorated with old cannons and a bronze statue of [[Afonso Henriques]], the Portuguese monarch who took the castle from the Moors. This statue is a copy of the 19th-century original, by the [[Romanticism|romantic]] sculptor [[António Soares dos Reis]], which is located near [[Guimarães Castle]] in northern Portugal.

The remnants of the royal palace are located near the main square, but all that is left are some walls and a few rebuilt rooms such as the ''Casa Ogival''. It now hosts the ''Olissipónia'', a multimedia show about the history of Lisbon.

The medieval castle is located toward the northwest corner of the citadel, at its highest point. Hypothetically, during a [[siege]], if attackers managed to enter the citadel, the castle was the last stronghold, the last place in which to take refuge. It is rectangular, with ten towers. A wall with a tower and a connecting door divides the castle courtyard into halves. A series of stairways allow visitors to reach the walkway atop the wall and the towers, from which magnificent views of Lisbon can be enjoyed. The Tower of Ulysses (where the [[Torre do Tombo|''Torre do Tombo'' archive]] used to be) had in 1998 a [[camera obscura]] installed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera-obscura.org.uk/Camera_Obscura/Camera_Obscuras.html Camera Obscuras]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows spectators a 360-degree view of the city and [[Tagus River]].

Apart from its main walls, the castle is protected, on its southern and eastern sides, by a [[barbican]] (''barbacã''), a low wall that prevented [[siege engines]] from approaching the main castle walls. The northern and western sides of the castle, on the other hand, were naturally protected by the steep hillside sloping downward from the castle's foundations. The castle is also partially encircled by a [[moat]], now dry. The main entrance is fronted by a stone bridge across the moat. On the west side, there is a long curtain wall extending downhill, ending at a tower (the ''Torre De Couraça''). This tower served to control the valley below, and it could also be used to escape, in case the castle was taken by enemies.

{{other uses|Face of War (disambiguation){{!}}Face of War}}

'''''The Face of War''''' ('''''The Visage of War'''''; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''La Cara de la Guerra'') (1940) is a painting by the Spanish [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. It was painted during a brief period when the artist lived in [[California]].

The trauma and the view of war had often served as inspiration for Dalí’s work. He sometimes believed his artistic vision to be premonitions of war. This work was painted between the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and beginning of the [[Second World War]].

The painting depicts a disembodied face hovering against a barren desert landscape. The face is withered like that of a corpse and wears an expression of misery. In its mouth and eye sockets are identical faces. In their mouths and eyes are more identical faces in a process implied to be [[recursion|infinite]]. Swarming around the large face are biting serpents. In the lower right corner is a hand print that Dalí insisted was left by his own hand.

'''''The Gouden Bocht on the Herengracht in Amsterdam, Seen from the West''''' is a 1672 painting by the Dutch artist [[Gerrit Berckheyde]] (1638-1698). As its title suggests it shows a section of the [[Herengracht]] canal.

Between 1933 and 1940 it was bought from an art dealer by Jacques Gaudicicker. It was purchased by the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam in 1980 for 310,000 guilders - it is still in the Rijksmuseum collection.

'''The Housemartins''' were an English [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] who were active in the 1980s,&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"&gt;{{cite book

The group's [[a cappella]] cover version of "[[Caravan of Love]]" (originally by [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]) was a UK Number 1 single in December 1986.

After breaking up in 1988, [[Paul Heaton]] and [[Dave Hemingway]] formed [[the Beautiful South]], while bassist Norman Cook became an [[electronic dance music]] DJ and music producer, founding the groups [[Beats International]], [[Pizzaman (band)|Pizzaman]] and [[Freak Power]], before rebranding himself as [[Fatboy Slim]].

==Career==
===Formation===
The band was formed in late 1983 by [[Paul Heaton]] (vocals) and [[Stan Cullimore]] (guitar), initially as a busking duo. Throughout his tenure with the band, Heaton billed himself as "P.d. Heaton".  &lt;!-- Yes, Capital P, small d.  P.d. Heaton, not p.d. or P.D., is how it is spelled on ALL Housemartins singles and albums. Do not change this. --&gt;

Heaton and Cullimore recorded a demo tape with Ingo Dewsnap and Sharon Green of Les Zeiga Fleurs which brought them to the attention of [[Go! Discs]]. They then expanded by recruiting Ted Key (bass), former guitarist with the Gargoyles. Their first live performance as a band was at [[Hull University]] in October 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, Pete (1999) ''Pete Frame's Rockin' Around Britain: Rock'n'roll Landmarks of the UK and Ireland'', Omnibus Press, {{ISBN|978-0711969735}}, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The band's membership changed considerably over the years. Key left at the end of 1985 and was replaced by [[Norman Cook]] (the future [[Fatboy Slim]]). Drummer Chris Lang was replaced by [[Hugh Whitaker]], former drummer with the Gargoyles, who in turn was replaced with [[Dave Hemingway]].&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beautiful South Fans Housemartins Page"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beautifulsouthfans.co.uk/the-housemartins.html | title=The Housemartins | work=Beautiful South and Paul Heaton Fans | accessdate=28 October 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226232247/http://www.beautifulsouthfans.co.uk/the-housemartins.html | archivedate=26 December 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band often referred to themselves as "the fourth best band in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]". The three bands that were "better" were [[Red Guitars]], [[Everything but the Girl]], and the Gargoyles.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;

=== Breakthrough ===
In 1986, having recorded two [[John Peel]] sessions, the band broke through with their third single "[[Happy Hour (The Housemartins song)|Happy Hour]]", which reached No. 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book
| first= David
| last= Roberts
| year= 2006
| title= British Hit Singles &amp; Albums
| edition= 19th
| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited
| location= London
| isbn= 1-904994-10-5
| page= 261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single's success was helped by a [[claymation]] animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time, featuring a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by television comedian [[Phill Jupitus]], who toured with the band under his stage name of "Porky the Poet". 

Debut album ''London 0 Hull 4'' was released later in 1986 and contained their previous two singles as well as alternative versions of first single "[[Flag Day (song)|Flag Day]]" and follow-up to Happy Hour, "[[Think for a Minute]]".

=== Caravan of Love ===
At the end of 1986 they had their only UK No.&amp;nbsp;1 single on 16 December with a cover version of [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]'s "[[Caravan of Love]]".&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; It was knocked off the top spot by [[Jackie Wilson]]'s "[[Reet Petite]]" on 23 December, denying the Housemartins the coveted Christmas No. 1 single.

The [[a cappella]] style of "Caravan of Love" was not to the taste of all Housemartins' [[fan (person)|fans]], although a cappella material had always been part of the band's repertoire. "Caravan of Love" was first performed by the band in their second [[List of Peel sessions|Peel session]] in April 1986, prior to their initial chart success. At Peel's suggestion, the band then recorded another session (under the name the Fish City Five), consisting entirely of a cappella performances, and on at least one occasion (at The Tower nightclub in Hull, the same concert at which they were filmed as the Housemartins for the BBC programme, ''Rock Around the Clock''), played support act for their own performance under this alternative name.  The "Caravan of Love" single featured four a cappella gospel songs on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].

===Second album and after===
The Housemartins' second album ''[[The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death]]'' was released in September 1987, and included their two previous singles "[[Five Get Over Excited]]" and "[[Me and the Farmer]]". A third single from the album, "[[Build (song)|Build]]", was released in November; a Peel Session from the same month provided a recording used for their last single "[[There Is Always Something There to Remind Me]]" in 1988. 

A farewell compilation album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Quite Good]]'' was released later that year.

===After the split===
The band split in 1988, but the members have remained friends and have worked on each other's projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with [[Beats International]] and then as [[Fatboy Slim]], while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie [[Sean Welch]] formed [[the Beautiful South]].

In August 2009, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine arranged for The Housemartins' original members to get together for a photo-shoot and interview, for the first time in many years, but in the interview all the members maintained that the band would not re-form.

In December 2009, Cullimore co-wrote songs for (and appeared in) a pre-school music series called ''[[The Bopps]]'', which first showed on [[Nick Jr. (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nick Jr.]] in the UK in April 2010.

Cullimore and Whitaker joined Heaton on stage during a show by Heaton and [[Jacqui Abbott]] in 2014 at Hull's legendary The New Adelphi Club, on the stage where the band had signed their Go-Discs record contract, although it was not a Housemartins reunion. The trio performed the Housemartins hit "Me and the Farmer", and Cullimore and Heaton closed the show with a performance of "Caravan of Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longhorn |first=Danny |url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Housemartins-reunite-Adelphi-Caravan-Love-Paul/story-23049884-detail/story.html |title=Housemartins reunite for Adelphi Caravan of Love as Paul Heaton joined on stage by Stan Cullimore and Hugh Whitaker |newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]] |date=6 October 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010043514/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Housemartins-reunite-Adelphi-Caravan-Love-Paul/story-23049884-detail/story.html |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''London 0 Hull 4'' was re-released on 22 June 2009, with a bonus disc featuring tracks released as additional content on 12-inch singles and demo tracks.

==Musical style and lyrics==
The band's early releases saw them described as [[jangle pop]], which brought comparisons with bands such as [[the Smiths]] and [[Aztec Camera]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Cooper, Kim &amp; Smay, David (2004) ''Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415969987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;Fletcher, Tony (2012) ''A Light that Never Goes Out: The Enduring Saga of The Smiths'', William Heinemann Ltd, {{ISBN|978-0434022182}}, p. 548&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Quantick]], writing for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', described them in 1986 as playing "traditional '60s-style guitar pop overlaid with soul vocals".&lt;ref name="Quantick"&gt;Quantick, David (1986) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=FL-rqqrDxb8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22the+housemartins%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tiHkUYytDMa0O4-DgegF&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20housemartins%22&amp;f=false Blinded by Gospel]", ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', December 1986, p. 16. Retrieved 15 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cook described the band as "religious, but not Christians", and the band's repertoire included gospel songs.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Quantick" /&gt;

Many of the band's lyrics have [[socialism|socialist]] themes, with Cook stating that "Paul realized that he hated writing about love...and that writing politically came easier to him", describing some of their songs as "angrily political".&lt;ref name="Quantick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamie"&gt;Lamie, Maria "The Housemartins" in Buckley, Peter (ed.)

'''''The Nanny''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] which originally aired on [[CBS]] from 1993 to 1999, starring [[Fran Drescher]] as [[Fran Fine]], a Jewish fashion queen from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing, New York]] who becomes the nanny of three children from the New York/British high society.

The show was created and produced by [[Fran Drescher|Drescher]] and her husband [[Peter Marc Jacobson]], taking much of its inspiration from Drescher's personal life growing up in Queens, involving names and characteristics based on her relatives and friends. The show earned a [[Rose d'Or]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose d'Or: winners|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/02/broadcasting|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one [[Emmy Award]], out of a total of twelve nominations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nanny|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/nanny|publisher=Emmy Awards|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Drescher was twice nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] and an Emmy. The sitcom has also spawned several [[The Nanny (TV series)#Foreign adaptations|foreign adaptations]], loosely inspired by the original scripts.

==Plot==
[[American Jews|Jewish-American]] Fran Fine turns up on the doorstep of British Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) to sell cosmetics after having been both dumped and fired by her boyfriend and employer Danny Imperialli. Instead, she finds herself the nanny of Maxwell's three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Grace.  Maxwell Sheffield is unhappy about it at first, but Fran turns out to be just what he and his family needed.

While Fran Fine manages the children, butler Niles ([[Daniel Davis]]) manages the household and watches all the events that unfold with Fran as the new nanny. Niles, recognizing Fran's gift for bringing warmth back to the family, does his best to undermine Maxwell's business partner C.C. Babcock ([[Lauren Lane]]) who has her eyes on the very available Maxwell Sheffield. Niles is often seen making witty comments directed towards C.C with C.C often replying with a comment of her own in their ongoing game of [[one-upmanship]].

As the series progresses, it becomes increasingly obvious that Maxwell is smitten with Fran even though he won't admit it, and Fran is smitten with him. The show teases the viewers with their closeness and "near misses" as well as with an engagement. Towards the later seasons, they finally marry and expand their family by having [[Fraternal Twins|fraternal twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenanny.com/nannystory.html|title=The Nanny Home Page: Background Story &amp; FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the series, it's also clear that Niles and C.C.'s constant sharp barbs are their bizarre form of flirtation, after a few false starts (including multiple impulsive and failed proposals from Niles) the pair marry in the series finale.

===Main characters===
{{See also|List of The Nanny characters}}
'''Fran Fine''' is the nasal voiced, outgoing protagonist of the series who stumbles upon the Sheffields' doorstep and winds up as the nanny to Mr. Sheffield's three children: Maggie, Brighton, and Grace.  She starts off working for her boyfriend Danny Imperialli in a bridal shop but is dumped and fired not long after. She ends up meeting Maxwell Sheffield and his family while going door to door to sell cosmetics. Her character has an outgoing and humorous personality. Fran, as a result of her mother's overbearing personality, often feels the need to date and is compelled to get married as well. She is usually seen getting into trouble and having to solve those problems through using her street smarts. 

'''Maxwell Sheffield''' is the male protagonist who ends up hiring Fran Fine to watch over his three children, Maggie, Brighton, and Grace. He is a widowed Broadway producer, having lost his wife Sara four years before the start of the series. While he does have some success as a Broadway producer, he remains constantly in the shadow of his rival [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], who always seems to have the upper hand. He does not spend a lot of time with his children due to his busy schedule, hence he ends up hiring Fran Fine as the children's nanny. Despite his mutual attraction to Fran, he tries to keep their relationship professional for fear of commitment.

'''Margaret Sheffield''' is the eldest child of Maxwell Sheffield. She is constantly seen bickering with her brother, Brighton, who views her as a nerd. While she is constantly fighting with Brighton, her relationship with her sister, Grace, is more one of mentorship. Towards the beginning of the series, Maggie is shy and awkward but, with Fran's influence, she becomes a somewhat popular young woman. Upon meeting Fran Fine, the two bond almost instantly.

'''Brighton Sheffield''' is the middle child of the family and the only son of Maxwell Sheffield. Due to being the only son, he often feels left out. This causes him to purposely bring about trouble for his two sisters. He doesn't bond with Fran Fine at first, having disliked all his previous nannies, but eventually becomes close with her as well. He plans to become a Broadway producer, like his father.

'''Grace Sheffield''' is the youngest child in the Sheffield family. She has a habit of naming medical conditions and complicated words. When Fran first became her nanny, Grace was in therapy. But, under Fran Fine's influence and guidance, she eventually doesn't need therapy any more. As the two became close to one another Grace started picking up some of Fran's Jewish slang and dressing habits, eventually thinking of Fran as a mother to her.

'''C.C. Babcock''' is the egocentric business partner of Maxwell Sheffield, with whom she has been working for almost 20 years. She clearly wants him as more than a business partner. Maxwell, however, appears oblivious and Babcock has yet to make a serious move on him. She never seems to be able to remember the names of Maxwell's three children. From her first meeting with Fran Fine, she accurately views the newly hired nanny as a threat and tries to undermine her. Fran is not C.C.'s only enemy in the Sheffield house, as she has an even more contentious relationship with his longtime butler Niles (who hates her just as much as she hates him).

'''Niles''' is the loyal butler and chauffeur for the Sheffield family. He and Maxwell have known each other their whole lives. He bonds with Fran Fine immediately, viewing her as the breath of fresh air that the Sheffield family needs. Niles is known as the household snoop as he is constantly seen listening in on conversations via intercoms, keyholes, and even in the very rooms where the conversations are taking place. He tends to manipulate events in Fran's favor to undermine C.C., his nemesis.  In spite of this, over time it becomes clear that Niles has himself fallen for C.C. and their contentious relationship is a cover for mutual lust.

==Cast==

===Main cast===
{{Main|List of The Nanny characters}}

''The Nanny'' maintained an [[ensemble cast]], keeping the same set of characters for its entire six-season run. Renée Taylor, Ann Morgan Guilbert, and Rachel Chagall were only given starring credit for their roles in the final season, even though they appeared in most episodes of the series, particularly in seasons where the role of the Sheffield children was somewhat reduced.

[[Jon Stewart]] portrayed a Jewish love interest of Fran's until it was discovered at a family wedding that the two were cousins; on the June 29, 2011 airing of ''The Daily Show'', Stewart stated he agreed to make an appearance after receiving a personal call from Fran Drescher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Tom Hanks |series=The Daily Show |date=June 29, 2011 |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-june-29-2011/tom-hanks?xrs=share_copy |network=Comedy Central |last=Stewart |first=Jon (host)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Hamlisch]] appeared as Fran's former high school music teacher, a Marvin Hamlisch look-alike. Fran Drescher also reprised her role of Bobbi Fleckman from the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' and made a [[cameo appearance]] as herself in the third to last episode. Charles Shaughnessy had a double role as a foreign sultan in one episode. Drescher's real-life parents, Morty and Sylvia, initially appeared as a couple in the waiting room of Grace's therapist and made subsequent appearances as Fran's Uncle Stanley and Aunt Rose; her [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]] [[Chester Drescher|Chester]] appeared as C.C.'s pet in more than a dozen episodes. Renée Taylor's husband, actor [[Joseph Bologna]], and their son Gabriel Bologna, had minor roles as doctors on the show. [[Ray Romano]] appeared as Fran's former high school classmate [[Ray Barone]], linking ''The Nanny'' with his comedy ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. Romano and Drescher actually did know each other in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|last2=Tomashoff|first2=Craig|title=Home Truths|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20142516,00.html|accessdate=December 29, 2014|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=October 14, 1996|quote=While a student at Hillcrest High (where The Nanny's Fran Drescher was a classmate), he performed in a comedy troupe at church.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005204/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20142516,00.html|archivedate=May 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Bergeron]] appeared as himself, the host of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', in an episode in which Maxwell appeared as a star on the show's board as a replacement for [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]. [[Tyne Daly]] appeared as a fellow nanny facing forced retirement. [[David Letterman]] made an uncredited appearance during a fantasy sequence, where Fran describes how she exaggerated her fame to impress a pen pal.

==Theme song==
The theme song featured in the pilot was a version of "[[If My Friends Could See Me Now]]", performed by [[Gwen Verdon]] from the 1966 Broadway musical ''[[Sweet Charity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Nanny Intro from the Pilot episode|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvhjX7AUIwk|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the pilot, the theme changed to "The Nanny Named Fran", written by [[Ann Hampton Callaway]] and performed by her and her sister [[Liz Callaway]].&lt;ref name="Communications2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Los Angeles Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=August 2, 2013|date=February 2001|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=138|issn=1522-9149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits: one that is a direct instrumental version of the theme (used only in a few season one episodes), and another with a slightly different arrangement.

==Opening credits==
The opening sequence for the pilot featured Fran in front of a white background, getting herself made up going to work as the nanny; at the end of the sequence, it shows Fran heading toward a stroller and a lipstick print appears to the above right.

Along with the change of the theme song from "If My Friends Could See Me Now" to "The Nanny Named Fran" came the change of the opening sequence, which like the theme, describes (with the main characters in animated form) the story of how Fran Fine went from being fired from the bridal shop by Danny Imperiali to becoming the nanny of the Sheffield children. The opening sequence remained the same even though Renée Taylor, Ann Guilbert and Rachel Chagall began to be credited as "starring" in the in-show credits beginning in season five. The only change to the sequence was in season six when producer Kathy Landsberg was promoted to co-executive producer of the series as her producer credit was moved to the in-show credits, while the creator credits of Drescher and Jacobson, and the developer credits of Sternin and Fraser were added in its place.

The animated opening sequence begins with Fran Fine walking into the bridal shop, only to be kicked out by Danny Imperalli. Then, she hitches a ride in a cab, crosses the bridge from [[Queens]], New York to [[Manhattan]] and arrives at the Sheffield mansion. Maxwell Sheffield opens the door and observes Fran. Then, he pulls her inside and she falls into the flower pot. Niles dusts her off and puts a cap on her head that reads ''Nanny''. Fran whistles for Maggie, Brighton and Gracie and the four of them form a [[conga line]]. C. C. arrives at the door and Fran bumps the door with her hip to close it in her face. Finally, the Sheffields, Niles and Fran gather on the couch for a group picture similar to that of the ''[[One Day at a Time]]'' series opening. However, when Fran presses the camera's button, smoke emits from the camera, covering the entire group in dust and messing up their best clothes.

Rosie O'Donnell employed the same team that created the Nanny's opening credits to do the opening credits for her popular daytime talk show.
O'Donnell mentioned this in an interview with Drescher on that show.

==Closing Credits==
In the background is the picture of the family as if the camera incident never happened.

==Production==

===Development===
''The Nanny'' began in 1991 with a chance meeting on a transatlantic flight between Drescher and Jeff Sagansky, at the time president of [[CBS Corporation]], for whom she had starred in the short-lived TV series ''[[Princesses (TV series)|Princesses]]''. Drescher persuaded Sagansky to let her and her then-husband Jacobson pitch an idea for a sitcom to CBS. Sagansky agreed to a future meeting once all of the parties were back in Los Angeles; however, neither Drescher nor Jacobson had any idea what to pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|title=''The Nanny'' Finds A Home With Viewers|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|publisher=Chicago Tribune|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-28/features/9410280002_1_nanny-fran-drescher-liz-smith|accessdate=June 6, 2011| date=October 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, while in London, Drescher was visiting friend [[Twiggy|Twiggy Lawson]] and her family in London, England, where she went on a culture-clash shopping tour with Lawson's then teenage daughter. Drescher was inspired by her behavior towards the teenage daughter on the shopping trip as functioning in a less parental but "humorous [...] kind of Queens logic, self-serving advice" mode.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"&gt;{{cite web | title=Enter Winning | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrenterwinning.htm | accessdate=June 16, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823140259/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrenterwinning.htm | archivedate=August 23, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drescher immediately called her husband in Los Angeles with her sitcom idea, which she pitched as a spin on ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', except, in Drescher's words: "Instead of [[Julie Andrews]], '''I''' come to the door." Jacobson replied: "That could be it" and the idea for ''The Nanny'' was spawned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drescher|first=Fran|authorlink=Fran Drescher|title=Enter Whining|year=1996|publisher=[[Regan Books]]|isbn=978-0-06-039155-3|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Los Angeles, the pair pitched their idea to Tim Flack and Joe Voci, both in comedy development at CBS.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; Sagansky brought in experienced producers Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; another husband-and-wife team with whom Drescher had worked before while guesting on ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'' in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse David|title=Comedy Undercard: Who's the Boss? vs. The Nanny|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/the-nanny-vs-whos-the-boss-sitcom-smackdown.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested, both couples teamed up to write the script for the pilot together, creating a character with the intention to build off Drescher's image. "Our business strategy was to create a show that was going to complement our writing, complement me as a talent," Drescher said in a 1997 interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; As a result, the characters draw deeply on the Drescher family, including [[Fran Fine]]'s parents, Sylvia and Morty, and grandmother Yetta, who all were named after their real-life counterparts.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; Drescher also drew from her own life in creating her character. Like the character in ''The Nanny'', Drescher was born and raised in [[Flushing, Queens]], and attended [[beauty school]]. However, unlike her on-screen counterpart, Drescher never worked in a bridal shop; Drescher wrote that into the character as a tribute to her mother, who did work in a bridal shop.&lt;ref name="Communications1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Belson|first=Eve|title=Orange Coast Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=October 1994|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=46|issn=0279-0483}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting with his relatives in [[Fort Lauderdale]] around the holidays, Sagansky watched a few episodes with his relatives, realized that he had a hit, and ordered a full 22 episodes for [[List of The Nanny episodes#Season 1 (1993/94)|the first season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Hal Boedeker |publication-date=March 2, 1994 |title=Nanny Loves South Florida, And So Does Fran Drescher |work= [[Miami Herald]] |page= |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=MH&amp;p_product=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_site=miami&amp;s_trackval=MH&amp;s_search_type=keyword&amp;s_dispstring=NANNY%20LOVES%20SOUTH%20FLORIDA,%20AND%20SO%20DOES%20FRAN%20DRESCHER%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(NANNY%20LOVES%20SOUTH%20FLORIDA,%20AND%20SO%20DOES%20FRAN%20DRESCHER)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=_rank_:D&amp;xcal_ranksort=4&amp;xcal_useweights=yes|accessdate=January 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
[[File:7 East 75th Street 001.JPG|thumb|7 East 75th Street on the [[Upper East Side]] of New York City was used for the exterior shots of the Sheffield townhouse.]]
Most of the early episodes of ''The Nanny'' were shot in front of a live studio audience on Stage 6 at the [[Culver Studios]]. During later seasons the taping was no longer performed before an audience due to the complexities of the [[fantasy]] sequences, costume changes, etc. On Mondays, the cast went through the script as a [[table read]]. On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they rehearsed before the series' producers and executives. And, on Thursdays and Fridays, the series was shot using a multi-camera set up in front of a live studio audience.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Denise|title=Nanny on the Spot|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrnannyonthespot.htm|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 21, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703043754/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrnannyonthespot.htm|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 100 crew members were involved in the shooting of a single episode.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abbott|first=Denise|title=In A Family Way|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrinafamilyway.htm|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=May 21, 1997|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703072610/http://home.frognet.net/~ritchie/hrinafamilyway.htm|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Drescher, Fraser, Jacobson and Sternin, the show's only executive producers for the first four seasons, coordinated "pretty much everything" at the beginning,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"/&gt; according to Sternin, they eventually found their niche and in the following years, Drescher and Sternin decided to focus on writing story outlines along with Timothy Kavanagh of Montreal. Kavanagh, known mainly for his writing with Fraser, added a recognizable dry humor to the show. Jacobson presided over the writing team, and Fraser observed the run-throughs.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter4"/&gt; The four of them were later joined by Frank Lombardi, Caryn Lucas and Diane Wilk, who served as the series' executive producer throughout the fifth and sixth season respectively.&lt;ref name="gs-imdb"/&gt;

===Professional laughers===
Stemming from a [[home invasion]] and attack she experienced in 1985, [[Fran Drescher]] requested the show to provide [[prescreened]] [[studio audience|audiences]], based fear of having random strangers invited to the productions. The show hired [[Central Casting]] to gather a cast of "laughers" who would be recorded during taping. The audio track of the laughers would then be added to the episodes in post-production. [[Casting director]] Lisette St. Claire became the world’s first "laugher wrangler" for new type of service, which would continue to be used on other shows.&lt;ref name="Laughers"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Joel Warner|author2=Peter McGraw|title=The Humor Code: Professional Laughers, Straight Out of Central Casting|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/01/humor-code-professional-laughers/|accessdate=30 May 2018|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Julie|title=Look Busy, Feign Interest and Be Paid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/06/jobs/look-busy-feign-interest-and-be-paid.html|accessdate=30 May 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humor==
The comedy in ''The Nanny'' was formulated with many [[running gag]]s, which contributed heavily to the success of the series. Much of this formula was character-based, with all major characters possessing a specific trait or quirks that provided a source of parody for other characters. The conflicting elements of each character's own comedy were often played off against one another ([[Fran Fine|Fran]] and [[Maxwell Sheffield|Maxwell]], [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]] and [[C.C. Babcock|C.C.]], [[Maggie Sheffield|Maggie]] and [[Brighton Sheffield|Brighton]]). Occasionally the characters would break the [[fourth wall]] and comment on the situations themselves, or Fran would comment to the audience or look into the camera. Other running gags are the many references to [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs and the musicals ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Most of the humor Fran uses is aimed toward a Jewish audience. She makes references to Yiddish words and teaches the Sheffield children to be stereotypical Jews (to never pay retail price, to go after men like doctors, etc.) Much of this humor is featured in scenes including her mother Sylvia.

At times, they would also make humorous references to the stars' previous careers or real life off-screen time. This was noticeable when Yetta saw her reflection in the mirror and thought she was seeing Millie Helper from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (the role that Guilbert played on that long-running show), Maxwell remembering how he wanted to hire a former cast member from ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' but thought he wasn't "British" enough (a reference to Charles Shaughnessy's former series), C.C. using props to hide Lauren Lane's real-life pregnancy at the time,&lt;ref name=peoplemagazine&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Nanny'': 1993–1999|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131614,00.html|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=July 30, 2013|date=June 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fran meeting her idol—Fran Drescher—who gave her a hint on what she (the TV Fran) was going to do in the next scene in the second-to-last episode in the last season. Drescher also appeared in the series as tough-talking music publicist Bobbi Fleckman, reprising her role from the 1984 film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', setting up an obvious visual gag where Drescher (as the Nanny) would disguise herself as Fleckman in order to get Mr. Sheffield's attention.

More running gags include Fran's frequent references to classic TV sitcoms (such as ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'') and her many eccentric family members (some never shown, most of them dying); Fran lying about her age—especially to men; Maxwell fighting through his rivalry with actual Broadway producer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]; Maxwell's physical resemblance to [[Pierce Brosnan]]; Maxwell's fondness of [[Kaye Ballard]]; Sylvia loving food in excess;&lt;ref name="peoplemagazine"/&gt; Niles delivering sharp one-liners, often aimed at C.C.; C.C. cold-heartedly reacting to situations that are usually sentimental to others (e.g. the death of [[Bambi]]'s mother); Gracie psychologically analyzing various situations; Niles getting fired because he embarrasses Maxwell or gives Fran ideas that Maxwell extremely dislikes (such as suggesting that Max, C.C. and Fran go to Barbra Streisand's house); Fran and Val lacking intelligence and obsessing over material possessions (e.g. clothes); frequent references to Fran's flamboyant wardrobe and her "big hair"; Fran frequently mentioning shopping at [[Loehmann's]];  Yetta making disconnected comments revealing her [[senility]]; Fran criticizing Maxwell's and Niles' reserved and inhibited British nature; Brighton morphing into a hopeless dork; Fran's attraction to Jewish males; Maxwell passing up the incredibly popular musical, ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', then becoming upset when such an idiotic idea became a success; Niles' last name never being revealed; C.C. covering her long-unrevealed name (finally given as Chastity Claire in the series finale); C.C. failing to remember the names of the Sheffield children (even convinced by [[Niles (The Nanny)|Niles]] in one episode that there was a fourth child named Sydney; note: she didn't have trouble remembering in the early seasons); Sylvia constantly nagging Fran to get married; Fran finding solace in food when she's depressed;  Fran's father, Morty, often featured in the series but never actually seen (until portrayed by [[Steve Lawrence]] in a few later episodes); Morty's only physical trait being the fact that he is bald, in which he is always comically losing his wig, and has several head mannequins to hold different wigs; Niles offering obvious hints to Maxwell and Fran about them realizing they should be together and hints from each other; C.C. pining over her unrequited romantic interest in Maxwell; C.C. developing a nervous [[tic]] and eventually ending up in a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]]; Fran obsessing with [[Barbra Streisand]]. There was also the occasional tryst between Niles and C.C., contrasting with their typical open disdain for each other, which was actually love. Season 4 featured a running gag where both Fran and Maxwell kept secret from the other household members "The Thing" (the fact that in the season 3 finale Maxwell tells Fran he loves her, but then in the Season 4 premiere he takes it back). It's also following "The Thing" that whenever Maxwell makes comments denying he has feelings for Fran, she is temporary "paralyzed" (she can't feel her arm, her entire left side shuts down, etc.).

In addition, there is also a great deal of [[physical comedy]] in ''The Nanny'' including exaggerated falls and chases. Drescher's facial expressions, when shocked or surprised, can also be seen as reminiscent of [[Lucille Ball]]'s portrayals of [[Lucy Ricardo]] and [[Lucy Carmichael]].&lt;ref name=EWReview&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Ken|title=The Nanny Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291309,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=February 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parallels were suggested in a few episodes, where an exasperated Mr. Sheffield refers to Fran as "Mrs. Carmichael", and asks in another: "Mr. Mooney fire you from the bank again?" Another Lucy reference (in which the family travels to Hollywood) is when he alludes to Fran and "Ethel" stealing John Wayne's footprints, and again when Maxwell says "Miss Fine, you got' some 'splaining to do!" like Ricky Ricardo often said to Lucy Ricardo. The episode that featured a visit from Elizabeth Taylor (who also appeared on ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' as a guest star) began with Maxwell and Niles trying to hide the visit from Fran ("Boys, boys, boys. Now do you think my mother gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago?") followed by her gripe "You never introduce me to any of the stars that you know; I've got a good mind to take Little Ricky and... oh. Never mind." Also, there was a reference from the episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' called "Ricky has Labor Pains" where Lucy and Ethel dress up like men and go to Ricky's daddy shower. In an episode of ''The Nanny'', Fran sees a man watching ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' on TV and as the theme song plays she gets a sneaky look on her face and gets the idea to gain entry into Mr. Sheffield's men's only club dressed as a man. Viewers for [[Quality Television]] called ''The Nanny'' "the '90s version of ''[[I Love Lucy]]''. It was well written and entertaining."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenannytv.com/about2.html The Nanny – Official Site – About the Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Reception===
The show performed poorly in its first year. When it was nearly canceled, Sagansky stepped in as its champion. According to Jacobson: "At all those affiliate meetings, he used to say, 'Stick by ''The Nanny''!' He knew it was something special."&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest-tested pilot at the network in years.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The series was also hugely successful internationally, especially in Australia,&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; where it was one of the highest-rated programs during the mid-to-late 1990s.

Although soon emerging as a favorite among the company, sponsors questioned whether the writers had ventured too far in terms of ethnicity and Drescher acted too obviously Jewish.&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt; The actress, however, declined to change Fran Fine into an Italian American: "On TV, you have to work fast, and the most real, the most rooted in reality to me is Jewish. I wanted to do it closest to what I knew."&lt;ref name="jewishjournal"&gt;{{cite web | title=I'm a Survivor! | work=Jewish Journal | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8435 | accessdate=June 18, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708040707/http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8435 | archivedate=July 8, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the producers came to the conclusion that to oppose her should be a family of British origin, so "she wouldn't come across as Jewish so much as the American you were rooting for," Sternin explained. "The idea was to make her the American girl who happens to be Jewish rather than the Jewish girl working for the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]s."&lt;ref name="hw-reporter"/&gt;

===Possible Reboot===
In June 2018 Dresher said, "We’re talking about it. Peter and I are talking about it," Drescher told ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', referencing her ex-husband, Peter Marc Jacobson, who co-created the series with her. "She would’ve maybe gotten involved in more things [that] Fran Drescher is involved with," the actress told ''Entertainment Tonight''. "All kinds of things from environmental issues, to health, to civil liberties, that’s what I think Fran [Fine] would be doing now — opening her big Queens mouth for the greater good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Augusta Statz |url=https://helenair.com/lifestyles/simplemost/fran-drescher-says-the-nanny-reboot-is-possible/article_b2904cfb-c312-5e9c-b315-d39a241e65b4.html |title=Fran Drescher Says ‘The Nanny’ Reboot Is Possible &amp;#124; Simplemost |publisher=helenair.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacardi |first=Francesca |url=https://pagesix.com/2018/06/19/fran-drescher-teases-the-nanny-reboot/ |title=Fran Drescher teases 'The Nanny' reboot |publisher=Pagesix.com |date=2018-06-19 |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of foreign adaptations of The Nanny}}
''The Nanny'' was shown in more than eighty countries worldwide.  In addition, several local versions of the show have been produced in other countries.  These shows follow the original scripts very closely, but with minor alterations in order to adapt to their respective country's culture. The remake in Russia was so popular that some original American writers of the show were commissioned to write new scripts after all original episodes were remade.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title=Still Married, With Children, But in Russian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/world/europe/10sitcom.html | accessdate=February 2, 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=September 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tribute Money''''' is a [[fresco]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] Early [[Renaissance]] painter [[Masaccio]], located in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] of the [[Basilica#Ecclesiastical basilicas|basilica]] of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]], [[Florence]]. Painted in the [[1420s in art|1420s]], it is widely considered among Masaccio's best work, and a vital part of the development of renaissance art.&lt;ref name="G599-600"&gt;Gardner, pp. 599–600.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is part of a cycle on the life of [[Saint Peter]], and describes a scene from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], in which [[Jesus]] directs Peter to find a [[Coin in the fish's mouth|coin in the mouth of a fish]] in order to pay the temple tax. Its importance relates to its revolutionary use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and ''[[chiaroscuro]]''. ''The Tribute Money'' suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] in the 1980s.

The Brancacci Chapel, in the basilica of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]], was founded around 1366/7 by [[Felice Brancacci]].&lt;ref&gt;Ladis, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, [[Felice Brancacci]], who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter [[Masolino da Panicale|Masolino]] to decorate the walls with a series of frescoes from the life of [[Saint Peter]]. Peter was the [[Saint's name|name-saint]] of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice also reflected support for the [[Rome|Roman]] [[pope|papacy]] during the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point Masolino was joined by another artist, the eighteen years younger [[Masaccio]]. Masolino eventually left, either for [[Hungary]] in 1425 or for Rome in 1427, leaving the completion of the chapel to Masaccio. In 1427 or 28, before the chapel was completed, Masaccio joined Masolino in Rome. Only in the 1480s were the frescos in the chapel finished, by [[Filippino Lippi]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, pp. 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tribute Money'', though, is considered Masaccio's work entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the centuries the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted over by the artist [[Vincenzo Meucci]], covering up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state.&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted ''[[a secco]]'': in ''The Tribute Money'', the leaves on the trees were gone, while [[Christ]]'s robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.&lt;ref name="PR230-1"&gt;Paoletti &amp; Radke, pp. 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject matter ==

The scene depicted in ''The Tribute Money'' is drawn from {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:24&amp;ndash;27|NIV}}:

[[Image:Masaccio 012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Peter|Peter]] removing money from a fish's mouth]]{{quotation|24. And when they were come to [[Capernaum]], they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? 25. He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? 26. Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. 27. Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.|Matthew 17:24&amp;ndash;27}}

The story is only found in the Gospel of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], which according to Christian tradition was written by the apostle Matthew, himself a [[tax collector]] according to {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:9–13|NIV}}. The passage has been used as a [[Christianity|Christian]] justification for the legitimacy of secular authority, and is often seen in conjunction with another passage, the "[[render unto Caesar...]]" story.&lt;ref name="BC39"&gt;Baldini &amp; Casazza, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:15&amp;ndash;22|NIV}}, a group of Pharisees try to trick Christ into incriminating himself, by asking if it is "lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not." Pointing out Caesar's image on [[Tribute penny|the coin]], he replies "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{bibleverse||Mark|12:13&amp;ndash;17|NIV}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|20:20&amp;ndash;26|NIV}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
[[Image:Tribute Money perspective.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Painting with drawn-in lines showing how the single-point [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] converges on the head of Christ.]]

The painting diverges somewhat from the biblical story, in that the tax collector confronts the whole group of Christ and the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]]s, and the entire scene takes place outdoors. The story is told in three parts that do not occur sequentially, but the narrative logic is still maintained, through compositional devises. The central scene is that of the tax collector demanding the tribute. The head of Christ is the [[vanishing point]] of the painting, drawing the eyes of the spectator there. Both Christ and Peter then point to the left hand part of the painting, where the next scene takes place in the middle background: Peter taking the money out of the mouth of the fish. The final scene &amp;ndash; where Peter pays the tax collector &amp;ndash; is at the right, set apart by the framework of an architectural structure.&lt;ref name="A98"&gt;Adams, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

This work maintains a heavy importance in the Art History world, as it is widely believed to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as [[Giotto]] or [[Duccio]]. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.

Christ and the disciples are placed in a semicircle, reflecting the shape of the chapel's [[apse]]. The tax collector, on the other hand, stands outside the holy space.&lt;ref name="A98"/&gt; While the group of holy men are dressed almost entirely in robes of [[pastel]] pink and blue, the official wears a shorter [[tunic]] of a striking vermilion. The colour adds to the impertinence expressed through his gestures.&lt;ref name="L26"&gt;Ladis, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way contrast is achieved is in the way &amp;ndash; both in the central scene and on the right &amp;ndash; the tax collector's postures are copying almost exactly those of Peter, only seen from the opposite angle. This gives a three-dimensional quality to the figures, allowing the spectator to view them from all sides.&lt;ref name="PR230-1"/&gt;

== Style ==
[[Image:Masaccio 010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Peter with the [[tax collector]]]]
Masaccio is often compared to contemporaries like [[Donatello]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] as a pioneer of the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name="G599-600"/&gt; One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, was the use of atmospheric, or [[aerial perspective]]. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in [[Roman art#Painting|ancient Rome]], but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.&lt;ref name="G599-600"/&gt;

Masaccio's use of light was also revolutionary. While earlier artists like [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] had applied a flat, neutral light from an unidentifiable source, Masaccio's light emanated from a specific location outside the picture, casting the figures in light and shadow. This created a ''[[chiaroscuro]]'' effect, sculpting the bodies into three-dimensional shapes.&lt;ref name="G599-600"/&gt;

Masaccio is often justly praised for the variety of his facial depictions. In the case of this painting the accolade is somewhat diminished, however, by the fact that the work was unfinished at the time of his death, and the heads of Jesus and St Peter were painted by his senior collaborator [[Masolino da Panicale]], (who painted the corresponding perspective work on the other side of the Chapel, ''[[Brancacci Chapel#Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha|Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha]]''.

== Interpretations ==

[[Image:Tribute Money2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Detail from the painting showing the use of ''chiaroscuro''. The heads are possibly those of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] (2nd from left) and Masaccio himself as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] (right).]]
Several theories have been proposed as to why this specific subject &amp;ndash; not a very common theme in art history &amp;ndash; was chosen.&lt;ref name="L26"/&gt; One suggestion sees the painting as a justification for the so-called ''[[catasto]]'' of 1427; a new form of income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Frederick | last = Hartt | authorlink =  | title = A History of Italian Renaissance Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture | edition =  | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = London | year = 1970 | page = 159 | id = ISBN | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a very likely explanation, however, as Brancacci would stand to lose from the new taxation, and would probably rather have been among its opponents. A more probable explanation links the painting to [[Pope Martin V]]'s 1423 agreement that the Florentine church be subjected to state tax.&lt;ref name="PR230-1"/&gt; The money found in the fish's mouth can also be seen as an expression of how Florence's wealth came from the sea. Felice Brancacci, a silk merchant involved in [[Mediterranean]] trade, was also a member of the city's Board of Maritime Consuls.&lt;ref name="BC39"/&gt;

Central to an understanding of the painting, as well as the entire series, is the relationship the Brancaccis and the city of Florence had with the papacy in Rome. Florence was at the time at war with [[Milan]], and needed the support of the Pope. The Brancacci frescos must therefore be seen in the context of a pro-papal policy, and as an attempt to legitimise the Roman see through its association with Saint Peter &amp;ndash; the first bishop of Rome, and first pope.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story, Peter is clearly singled out among the disciples, and his strong connection with Christ can be seen in Christ's words "for me and thee".&lt;ref name="BC39"/&gt; Peter appears a majestic and energetic figure when he is with Christ and when he performs his work, in contrast to the diminutive shape on the left. This all points forward to his apostolic role as Christ's vicar on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; As such ''The Tribute Money'' represents a transitional scene in the chapel; in doing Christ's bidding Peter goes from being a disciple to being the master.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two of the disciples can be identified with any degree of certainty: Peter with his [[iconography|iconographic]] grey hair and beard, and blue and yellow attire, and [[John the Apostle|John]]; the young beardless man standing next to Christ. John's head is reminiscent of [[Roman sculpture]]s, and it is reflected in the very similar face of another disciple on the right. The person next to this disciple is assumed to be [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], whose dark and sinister face mirrors that of the tax collector.&lt;ref name="A98"/&gt; It has been speculated &amp;ndash; first by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] &amp;ndash; that the face on the far right is a self-portrait of Masaccio himself, as [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ladis, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1895">The '''Victoria Sketch Club''' is a Canadian arts organization, the oldest Canadian arts group west of Ontario.&lt;ref name=maltwood/&gt;

It was established in 1909 as '''The Island Arts Club'''. The 56 charter members included [[Emily Carr]], [[Samuel Maclure]] and [[Josephine Crease]]. The club's stated purpose was "to bring together artists and those interested in art; to hold public exhibitions of art and craft work; and to stimulate general interest in arts and crafts". It was renamed the '''Island Arts and Crafts Society''' in 1912. Most early members were immigrants from Britain and were interested in portraying the local scenery. In 1952, the society was renamed '''The Sketch Club''' and subsequently became the '''Victoria Sketch Club'''. The club continues to hold an annual exhibition of members' work.&lt;ref name=maltwood/&gt;

The '''William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings''' consists of 477 [[watercolor painting|watercolour]] [[botanical illustration|botanical drawings]] of plants and animals of [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] by unknown [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (probably Cantonese) artists that were commissioned between 1819 and 1823 by [[William Farquhar]] (26 February 1774 – 13 May 1839). The paintings were meant to be of scientific value with very detailed drawings, except for those of the birds which have text going beyond their original purpose. For each drawing, the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|scientific]] and/or common name of the specimen in [[Malay language|Malay]], and, occasionally, in English, was written in pencil. A translator also penned the Malay names in [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] using ink. The paper used was normally [[history of paper#Europe|European paper]] framed by a blue frame while some have no frames at all suggesting there are two artist.&lt;ref name="Natural History Drawings EDM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Dozier (ed.)|title=Natural History Drawings: The Complete William Farquhar Collection: Malay Peninsula, 1803–1818|location=Singapore|publisher=Editions Didier Millet; National Museum of Singapore|year=2010|isbn=978-981-4217-69-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Doorean; Durio stercorae; D. zibethina Linn (William Farquhar Collection, 1819–1823).jpg|thumb|The drawing of this [[Durian]] shows a good example of great scientific detail reflecting the inside of the fruit and structure of the seed.]]

During his tenure as [[Governors of Singapore#Resident of Singapore (1819-1826)|Resident and Commandant of Singapore]], Farquhar hired a group of professionally trained Chinese artists from Macau (as described by [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir|Munshi Abdullah]] &lt;ref name="Natural History Drawings EDM"/&gt; ) to paint watercolours of the flora and fauna of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Farquhar donated these in eight volumes to the Museum of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] on 17 June 1826. In 1937, the Society lent six of the volumes to the Library of the British Museum (Natural History) (now the Library of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]), retaining the two volumes of botanical drawings in its own library. In 1991 the Natural History Museum returned the works to the Society for valuation, and on 20 October 1993 the Society offered them for sale by auction at [[Sotheby's]] in London, where they were acquired by Goh Geok Khim, founder of the brokerage firm GK Goh, for [[Singapore dollar|S$]]3 million. Goh donated the drawings to the [[National Museum of Singapore]] in 1995. As at 2011, the collection was believed to be worth at least $11 million. In 2011, 70 works from the collection were placed on permanent display in the [[Goh Seng Choo Gallery]] of the museum, named for Goh's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Deepika Shetty|title=Precious menagerie: The William Farquhar collection of rare watercolours have finally found a permanent home|journal=[[The Straits Times]] (Life!)|date=9 September 2011|pages=D4–D5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Due to the variable quality of work done by some artists, some drawings have proved difficult to identify. Nonetheless, botanists have identified some of these problematic drawings, one a drawing of a male [[Raffles's malkoha]] in which the breast is too yellow. Others which have yet to be identified include a drawing of a climber similar to ''[[Smilax]]''. Plate 29 of the collection inscription reads ''Soogow'', probably a misspelling of "[[Adenanthera pavonina|saga]]". However, the drawing shows little resemblance to the latter.

Historians suggest that many of the backdrops of the drawings were copied from drawing manuals. One such example is a drawing of the [[greater mouse-deer|greater mousedeer]], the background of which shows a [[vine|leafless climber]] attached to a [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Some scholars query this, as mousedeer do not live in such rocky habitats. This suggests that either the artists did not visit the habitat of the subject, or, if they did, that they were not particularly observant.

In the book [[Editions Didier Millet#Books published by Editions Didier Millet|Natural History Drawings: The Complete William Farquhar Collection, Malay Peninsula 1803–1818]] an article by Kwa Chong Guan suggest that there were two artist, one usually frames his works as seen in the illustration of the durian and one who does the opposite of the latter. Usually, the artist who draws a frame around his work does show fungi like shaped rocks while the other takes the rocks in its own natural form also the artist who draw frames usually has drawings of trees with its [[root]]s spread out while the other has its roots in a clenched like manner.

==Books==
The works were published in two volumes, the first being,''The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings'', published in 1999 showing 141 of these illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings|location=Singapore|publisher=Goh Geok Khim|year=1999|isbn=978-981-3065-82-6}} 2 volumes&lt;/ref&gt; A second version containing prints of all 477 works in the Farquhar collection was published by [[Editions Didier Millet]] and the National Museum of Singapore in 2010.
