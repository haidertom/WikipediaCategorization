The '''2009 G20 London summit protests''' occurred in the days around the 2 April [[2009 G20 London summit]]. The summit was the focus of protests from a number of groups over various long-standing and topical issues. These ranged from disquiet over economic policy, anger at the banking system and bankers' remuneration and bonuses, the continued [[war on terror]] and concerns over [[climate change]].

Although the majority of the protests and protesters were peaceful, the threat of violence and criminal damage were used by police as a reason to detain, or "[[kettling|kettle]]", protesters as part of [[Operation Glencoe]]. A bystander, [[death of Ian Tomlinson|Ian Tomlinson]], died shortly after being pushed to the ground by a police officer. A second [[post-mortem]] revealed that Tomlinson may have died from an [[Bleeding|abdominal haemorrhage]]. The inquest into Tomlinson's death found that he was unlawfully killed.

A peace activist climbed over the railings into the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] as a symbolic gesture of "power to the people". When arrested by police he explained that "This is the people's parliament, and I am one of the people".

==Put People First==

On 28 March 2009, 35,000 people marched through London. At a rally in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], they were addressed by [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] co-chair [[Kumi Naidoo]], [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] General Secretary [[Brendan Barber]], environmentalist [[Tony Juniper]], activist comedian [[Mark Thomas]], and global justice author Susan George amongst others. They heard calls for international action to deliver tax justice, [[trade justice]] and a [[Green New Deal]] in both rich and poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.putpeoplefirst.org.uk/2009/03/35000-thanks-a-strong-signal-to-the-g20-from-the-london-put-people-first-march/.

The Put People First alliance of more than 160 unions, development, faith and environment groups called on the G20 leaders to recognise that "only just, fair and sustainable policies can lead the world out of recession, and that a return to 'business as usual' – with the associated poverty, inequality and climate change – is not an option".

Christian NGOs including World Vision and Tearfund organised an ecumenical service on the day at Methodist Central Hall, overseen by the Bishop of London. Delegations joined the march from around the world, including Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Korea, USA, Australia, South Africa, Zambia, Canada and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/economic-crisis-campaign.html|title=404 Not Found|publisher=|access-date=22 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416101446/http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/economic-crisis-campaign.html|archive-date=16 April 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Camp in the City" ({{coord|51.5152|-0.0825|type:landmark}}) on 1 April 2009 aimed to draw attention to [[carbon emission trading|carbon trading]], claiming that far from being a way of reducing release of climate change gasses in the atmosphere it is used as an excuse to continue doing just that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/carbon-trading |title=Carbon trading |publisher=Climate Camp |accessdate=2009-04-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjV5IF5W?url=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk/carbon-trading |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp took place outside the [[European Climate Exchange]] in [[Bishopsgate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/G20-Summit-Protests-Guide-To-Whats-Going-To-Happen-And-When/Article/200904115253140?videoSourceID=2fa12d8859160210VgnVCM1000005d04170aRCRD&amp;lpos=UK_News_Article_Inline_Player_List_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15253140_G20_Summit_Protests%3A_Guide_To_Whats_Going_To_Happen_And_When|title=Timetable of Disruption: The Summit Protests|work=Sky News|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the actual camp a group of participants had played a game called "capture the flag" in the area on 27 March which was used by the protesters to familiarise themselves with the locale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/uk/7961868.stm|title=Eco-activists prepare for protest|work=BBC News | accessdate= 19 April 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Camp organisers agreed to meet with police and exchange contact details shortly before the protest. The meeting was arranged by [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[David Howarth]], who was to mediate at the meeting which was to take place at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

Before the event Commander Simon O'Brien said that the capital would see "almost unprecedented level of activity" of protest activity with seven officially notified demonstrations and possibly many more they don't know about. [[Scotland Yard]] described the G20 policing plan as one of the largest, most challenging and complicated public order operations it has ever devised. They said that the level and style of activity on the internet suggested a re-emergence of groups with similar aims to the anti-globalisation protesters who turned to violence in 2000 and 2001. They said they were determined to avoid the violent scenes of the 2001 [[27th G8 summit|G8 in Genoa]] in which one protester was killed and hundreds more injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7971212.stm|title=The challenge of policing the G20|work=BBC news | date=30 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the days leading up to the summit, the [[Metropolitan police]] warned protest groups that the protests on 1 April would be "very violent" and that they were "up for it, and up to it" in the event of trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest|title=Fears police tactics at G20 protests will lead to violence|last=Lewis|first=Paul|author2=Sandra Laville, John Vidal|date=27 March 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-08 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330060646/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police used the crowd-control tactic known as containment or the “[[Kettling|kettle]]”, to hold 5,000 people inside a police cordon without food, drink or lavatory facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Similar tactics had been used in New York [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/02/politics/campaign/02protest.html?_r=1 Tactics by Police Mute the Protesters, and Their Messages] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; This combined with riot police pushing into crowds with shields and batons.

Ian Tomlinson died after being shoved and struck by a police officer within a police cordon of the G20 Meltdown protest near the Bank of England. Initially the City of London Police denied that any incident with the police had occurred, and the death was attributed to natural causes.

Including a number of raids on squats on 2 April 2009, the police made over 100 arrests and said they had identified and would track down those who had broken the law.

One raid on a climate change group the day after the main protests was ruled to have been illegal in March 2010, the Met Commissioner said that it was unlawful to arrest and search protestors and to force them to be recorded on film. Two protesters were each awarded £3000 compensation after the Met admitted the operation was unlawful as there were no reasonable grounds for suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/met+police+to+pay+g20+protest+compensation/3587057 Met police to pay G20 protest compensation] Channel 4 News 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to police tactics===
The police choice of "Operation Glencoe" as a codename was linked with the [[Glencoe Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/28/g20-protests-london | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=G20 protests: Cry havoc – and let slip a rainbow alliance of summit protesters | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=28 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7973178.stm | work=BBC News | title=Live: G20 Summit Build-up | date=1 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the buildup to the protests the chairman of the [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]], [[Andrew Dismore|Andrew Dismore, MP]], said that "The police have a duty under the Human Rights Act to facilitate protest and not frustrate it. If they act in a confrontational way and use confrontation language, they will start to provoke the kind of behaviour they are seeking to prevent. There may well be a fringe element that want to incite violence. But that doesn't mean police should criminalise every protester." [[David Howarth]], a Liberal Democrat MP, said: "I am increasingly worried that what the police are saying about the protests will end up in a self-fulfilling prophecy. By talking up the prospect of violence they [the police] will put off peaceful demonstrators and start to attract other sorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/mar/27/g20-protest | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Fears police tactics at G20 protests will lead to violence | first=Paul | last=Lewis | date=27 March 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jenny Jones (Green politician)|Jenny Jones]], a member of the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]], said of reports of [[police brutality]] that "If the police were hitting people who were sitting down with their hands up, we have entered a new era of overt violent policing in Britain that will deter people from protesting and cut back our civil liberties". A police Commander said that their "tactics were proportionate and worked".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7981932.stm|title=Concern over G20 police tactics |date=3 April 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090406074158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7981932.stm| archivedate= 6 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Lambert|Jean Lambert, MEP]], of the London [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], wrote an open letter to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner after the event asking for an explanation of the police tactics at the climate camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/region/london/news/2009-04-03formal-letter-to-metropolitan-police-commissioner-sir-paul-stephenson.html |title=Formal letter to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjV5hbom?url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/region/london/news/2009-04-03formal-letter-to-metropolitan-police-commissioner-sir-paul-stephenson.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-06-12 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Union of Journalists]] has considered taking legal action after Section 14 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] was used against journalists covering the protests on 2 April. The City of London police asked them to leave the area at the Royal Exchange for half an hour, and threatened arrest if they refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/17/g20-police-photographers-nuj|title=G20: NUJ considers legal action over police treatment of photographers|last=Brook|first=Stephen|date=17 April 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-24 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090420034123/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/17/g20-police-photographers-nuj| archivedate= 20 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 14 is to prevent "serious public disorder, serious criminal damage or serious disruption to the life of the community". The police earlier apologised to journalists reporting the 1 April protests at the Bank of England: "Section 14 was applied outside the Bank of England to disperse protesters. There may have been some photographers caught up in that. If so we apologise. We respect the right of photographers to cover current events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/08/g20-protest-police-apology-photographers|title=Police apologise for obstructing photographers at G20 protest|last=Sweney|first=Matt|date=8 April 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-04-24 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411024435/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/apr/08/g20-protest-police-apology-photographers| archivedate= 11 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Sir Paul Stephenson]], the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, expressed "concern that the video footage of some police actions are clearly disturbing and should be thoroughly investigated", and a need to be reassured that the use of the containment, or [[kettling]] tactic "remains appropriate and proportionate".&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/8000246.stm | work=BBC News | title=Police begin G20 tactics review | date=16 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] has said that some police behaviour "fell short of the police medal promise to "guard my people"."&lt;ref name=thirdpostmortem/&gt; Others have defended the policing of the protests.

Another demonstrator, Katie Surridge, has alleged that she was pushed to the ground from behind on 1 April by the same officer who later struck Nicola Fisher. That incident has also been reported to the IPCC.&lt;ref name=taser/&gt; IPCC have announced that there is no case to answer.

===Review of the policing of public events===

On 15 April 2009, [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Paul Stephenson]] asked the [[Chief Inspector of Constabulary]] to review policing tactics in the policing of public events. [[Denis O'Connor (Policeman)|Denis O'Connor]] will review the policing of public events following allegations of two assaults by police during the G20 protests in London on 1 April. He will also assess whether the tactic of containment or [[kettling]] is appropriate and proportionate to ensuring people have the right to protest. He said the event was a "complex policing operation", and that footage of clashes with police will be reviewed to check if other incidents need to be examined. Sir Paul stressed that all uniformed officers must wear shoulder identification numbers to be easily identifiable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8000246.stm|title=Police begin G20 tactics review |date=15 April 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-04-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416195221/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8000246.stm| archivedate= 16 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the tactics being reviewed is the crowd-control tactic known as the “[[Kettling|kettle]]”, used to pen in protesters.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk" /&gt; Bob Broadhurst, the commanding officer during the protests, blamed any misconduct of officers on the lack of training they receive in [[crowd control]] and on fear. He revealed during a Commons Home Affairs Committee that officers only receive 2 days of training a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8057685.stm | work=BBC News | title='Training concern' for G20 police | date=19 May 2009 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 25 January 2011, Broadhurst apologised to the home affairs select committee for telling then in May 2009 that no plain-clothes officers were present at the demonstrations; He admitted that numerous City of London police officers had been present at the demonstration, along with more than one Met officer, including PC Mark Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/25/met-undercover-policing-unit-g20|title=Met counter-terrorism chief to take over protest spy unit|author=Rob Evans|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2011 the high court has ruled that the Metropolitan police broke the law in the way they "kettled" protesters at the G20 demonstrations in 2009, and also criticised the use of force by officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |title=Kettling of G20 protesters by police was illegal, high court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/14/kettling-g20-protesters-police-illegal |work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=|date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor in the [[City of London]], died within a police cordon of the G20 Meltdown protest near the Bank of England. Initially the [[City of London Police]] denied that any incident with the police had occurred, and the death was attributed to natural causes. Days later, ''The Guardian'' published video showing Tomlinson had been pushed by a [[Metropolitan Police Service]] officer and hit with a baton minutes before he collapsed and died.&lt;ref name=DoddApril8&gt;Dodd, Vikram.

The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) subsequently ordered a second post mortem and set up an independent criminal inquiry to determine whether Tomlinson was assaulted by police, and whether that assault contributed to his death.&lt;ref name=DoddApril8/&gt; The results of this second post mortem have revealed that Tomlinson actually died from an abdominal haemorrhage.

The first value in each of these signed ordered pairs is the abscissa of the corresponding point, and the second value is its ordinate.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''abscissa''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|b|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|.|ə}}; plural ''abscissae'' or ''abscissæ'' or ''abscissas'') and the '''ordinate''' are respectively the first and second [[coordinate]] of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[coordinate system]].

The '''abscissa''' of a point is the signed [[Measurement|measure]] of its projection on the primary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

The '''ordinate''' of a point is the signed [[Measurement|measure]] of its projection on the secondary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

Usually these are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]].  The terms can also refer to the horizontal and vertical axes respectively (typically ''x''-axis and ''y''–axis) of a two-dimensional graph.  An [[ordered pair]] consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually ''x'') and the ordinate (vertical, usually ''y'')—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space.  

:&lt;math&gt;(\overbrace{x}^\text{abscissa}, \overbrace{y}^\text{ordinate})&lt;/math&gt;

== Etymology ==

Though the word "abscissa" (Latin; "linea abscissa", "a line cut off") has been used at least since ''De Practica Geometrie'' published in 1220 by [[Fibonacci]] (Leonardo of Pisa), its use in its modern sense may be due to Venetian mathematician [[Stefano degli Angeli]] in his work ''Miscellaneum Hyperbolicum, et Parabolicum'' of 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =On the Word "Abscissa" |website =numberwarrior.wordpress.com |last=Dyer |first=Jason |publisher = The number Warrior |date = March 8, 2009 |url = https://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/on-the-word-abscissa/ |accessdate = September 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1892 work ''Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik, Volume 2,'' ("''Lectures on history of mathematics''") German historian of mathematics  [[Moritz Cantor]] writes

In a somewhat obsolete variant usage, the abscissa of a point may also refer to any number that describes the point's location along some path, e.g. the parameter of a [[parametric equation]].&lt;ref name="WolframAlpha"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hedegaard |first=Rasmus |last2=Weisstein |first2=Eric W. |title=Abscissa |work=[[MathWorld]] |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Abscissa.html |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, the abscissa can be thought of as a coordinate-geometry analog to the [[Independent_variable#Independent_variable|independent variable]] in a [[mathematical model]] or experiment (with any ordinates filling a role analogous to [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent_variable|dependent variables]]).

In [[baseball]], '''charging the mound''' is an assault by a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] against the [[pitcher]], usually the result of being [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] or nearly being hit by a pitch, such as a [[brushback pitch|brushback]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/mlb/charging-the-mound.aspx|title=Charging the Mound Definition - Sporting Charts|website=www.sportingcharts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first incidence of a professional charging of the mound has not been identified, but the practice dates back to the game's early days. Charging the mound is the most common initiator of a [[bench-clearing brawl]].

Before charging, the batter usually throws his [[Baseball bat|bat]] and [[Batting helmet|helmet]] aside so that he may face the pitcher unarmed (it is a very serious breach of baseball [[etiquette]], not to mention dangerous, for the batter to charge the mound with a bat). Though serious injuries have occurred from charging in the past, usually fights are either broken up or joined by all other players so the conflict turns into posturing and name-calling; in baseball parlance, this is known as a [[wikt:rhubarb|rhubarb]].

Charging the mound is typically about responding to an indignity rather than an attempt to injure the pitcher. There is long-standing etiquette in baseball regarding what is an acceptable offense to warrant a [[Beanball|beaning]], and there are similar "unwritten rules" for charging in response to being hit.  While these unwritten rules have become more vague, the response of [[Major League Baseball]] to the incidents has become far more strict. Whereas suspensions in the past were rare and usually short, [[Commissioner]] [[Fay Vincent]] and his successor [[Bud Selig]] reacted harshly to both instances of beaning and charging during their respective tenures.  Recently, most incidents which have caused the benches to clear have been met with large fines and lengthy suspensions.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In Japan, pitchers tip their cap to a batter hit by a pitch if it was not their intent to hit the batter to avoid a mound charging incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1987/04/13/106777648/no-tip-of-the-hat-from-this-japanese-pitcher|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|date=|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Codex Totomixtlahuaca WDL2701.png|thumb|Codex Totomixtlahuaca]]
The '''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''' or '''Codex Condumex''' is a colonial-era map produced on a large piece of [[cotton]]. The map represents Totomixlahuaca, [[Mexico]], and includes a creation date of 1564. It documents a meeting over a land conflict in communities of the current Mexican state of [[Guerrero]].

== Description ==
The ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca'' was found in the community of Totomixtlahuaca, located in the southeast of Guerrero, in [[Mexico]]. Using Aztec [[pictogram|pictographs]], the map represents the distribution of lands in 1564.&lt;ref name="wdl" /&gt;

== Preparation ==
The map was drawn on a large piece of cotton, roughly 217&amp;nbsp;cm by 185&amp;nbsp;cm. It was painted with coal.&lt;ref name="cehm" /&gt;

'''Connectionism''' is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|Connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]

==Basic principles==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]].

===Spreading activation===
{{Main|Spreading activation}}
In most connectionist models, networks change over time.  A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is ''activation''. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit.  For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [[probability]] that the neuron would generate an [[action potential]] spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it.  Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks}}
Neural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Most of the variety among neural network models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

Connectionists are in agreement that [[recurrent neural networks]] (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than [[feedforward neural networks]] (directed networks with no cycles, called [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]]. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novo|first=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-03|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate [[gradient descent]] over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the [[partial derivative]] of the error surface with respect to the weight. [[Backpropagation]] (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.

==History==

Connectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.

===Parallel distributed processing===

The prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as '''parallel distributed processing''' (PDP). It was an [[artificial neural network]] approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.  It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:

* A set of ''processing units'', represented by a [[set (computer science)|set]] of integers.
* An ''activation'' for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* An ''output function'' for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations.
* A ''pattern of connectivity'' among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength.
* A ''propagation rule'' spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units.
* An ''activation rule'' for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation.
* A ''[[learning rule]]'' for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables.
* An ''environment'' that provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some [[subset]] of the units.

A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)'' and ''Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)'', by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term "connectionism" is not used in the books.

===Earlier work===
PDP's direct roots were the [[perceptron]] theories of researchers such as [[Frank Rosenblatt]] from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book ''Perceptrons'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]], published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the [[exclusive disjunction]] (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8| title = Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators| journal = Neural Networks| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 359| year = 1989| last1 = Hornik | first1 = K. | last2 = Stinchcombe | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] ([[Artificial neuron|MP neuron]]), [[Donald Olding Hebb]], and [[Karl Lashley]]. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s.  Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments.

===Connectionism apart from PDP===
Though PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.

Many connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|url= |location= |publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0262510486 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.

In the 1950s, [[Friedrich Hayek]] proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.

There are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as [[Ron Sun]]).

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} thus the debate persisted. {{As of | 2016}}, progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.

The recent{{when|date=February 2016}} popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|arxiv=1410.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">In [[thought experiment]]s philosophers occasionally imagine entities with special abilities as a way to pose tough [[Philosophical skepticism|intellectual challenges]] or highlight apparent [[paradox]]es.  Examples include:
* [[Evil demon|Descartes’ malicious demon]] – Cartesian skepticism (also called methodological skepticism) advocates the doubting of all things that cannot be justified through logic. [[Descartes]] uses three arguments to cast doubt on our ability to know objectively: the [[dream argument]], the deceiving God argument, and the malicious demon argument. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dcarg.htm Important Arguments from Descartes' Meditations] by [http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/ David Banach] Department of Philosophy, St. Anselm College (retrieved 8-24-2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Since our senses cannot put us in contact with external objects themselves, but only with our mental images of such objects, we can have no absolute certainty that anything exists in the external world. In the evil demon argument Descartes proposes an entity who is capable of deceiving us to such a degree that we have reason to doubt the totality of what our senses tell us.
* [[Laplace's demon]] is a hypothetical all-knowing being who knows the precise location and momentum of every atom in the universe, and therefore could use [[Newton's laws]] to reveal the entire course of cosmic events, past and future.  Based upon the philosophical proposition of [[causal determinism]].
* [[Maxwell's demon]] can distinguish between fast and slow moving molecules.  If this demon only let fast moving molecules through a trapdoor to a container, the temperature inside the container would increase without any work being applied.  Such a scenario violates the [[second law of thermodynamics]].
* Morton's demon stands at the gateway of a person's senses and lets in facts that agree with that person's beliefs while deflecting those that do not. This demon is used to explain the phenomenon of [[confirmation bias]].
* In aphorism 341 of [[The Gay Science]], [[Nietzsche]] puts forth his [[eternal recurrence]] concept.  In it, he employs a demon with special metaphysical knowledge as an agent for forcing reevaluation of perspective on one's own life.
* The [[Darwinian Demon]] is a hypothetical organism which can simultaneously maximize all aspects of its fitness.

==Similar entities==
There are other creatures which feature in thought experiments about philosophy. One such creature is a [[utility monster]], a creature which derives much more utility (such as enjoyment) from resources than other beings, and hence under a strict utilitarian system would have more or all of the available resources directed to it. [[Newcomb's paradox]] supposes a being who is believed to be capable of predicting human behavior; [[Robert Nozick]] suggested a "being from another planet, with an advanced technology and science, whom you know to be friendly".&lt;ref name="nozick"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Nozick |title=Essays in Honor of Carl G.

The '''Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness''' is a hypothesis by [[Timothy Leary]], and later expanded on by [[Robert Anton Wilson]] and [[Antero Alli]], that "suggested eight periods [circuits] and twenty-four stages of neurological evolution".&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). Info-Psychology. New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Page xii&lt;/ref&gt; The eight circuits, or eight "brains" as referred by other authors, operate within the human nervous system, each corresponding to its own imprint and direct experience of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Wilson, Alli, et al. (1977-95)&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and Alli include three stages for each circuit that details developmental points for each level of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alli, A. (2009). The Eight-Circuit Brain. Vertical Pool publishing, Berkeley, CA. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The first four circuits deal with life on earth, and survival of the species. The last four circuits are post-terrestrial, and deal with the evolution of the species, [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, [[psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] states of mind, and [[psychic]] abilities.  The proposal suggests that these altered states of consciousness are recently realized, but not widely utilized.  Leary describes the first four as "larval circuits", necessary for surviving and functioning in a terrestrial human society, and proposed that the post terrestrial circuits will be useful for future humans who, through a predetermined script, continue to act on their urge to migrate to outer space and live extra-terrestrially.&lt;ref&gt;"Info-Psychology," Chapter 12, Timothy Leary, 1994, New Falcon Publications, Phoenix, Arizona, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Leary, Wilson, and Alli have written about the idea in depth, and have explored and attempted to define how each circuit operates, both in the lives of individual people and in societies and civilization.

The term "circuit" is equated to a metaphor of the brain being [[computer hardware]], and that the wiring of the brain as [[circuitry]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A.(1983). ''Prometheus Rising.'' New Falcon Publications, Reno, NV. Twenty-first Printing, (2009). Pgs. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary uses the eight circuits along with [[recapitulation theory]] to explain the evolution of the human species, the personal development of an individual, and the [[biological evolution]] of all life.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1979) ''Game of Life.'' New Falcon Publications. Phoenix, AZ. 2nd Ed. (1993). Pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1987). ''Info-Psychology.'' New Falcon Press, Los Angeles. Seventh Printing, (2011). Pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Eight Circuits==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}

Each circuit listed has each name from Leary's book "Exo-Psychology" after the preface,&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilson's book "Quantum Psychology" pgs.196-201.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; ''Note:In other books from Leary, Wilson, and Alli, the eight circuits have different names due to different interpretations and findings of each author. Please reference bibliography section for other works on labeling of each circuit.''

===1. (Leary)The vegetative-invertebrate circuit (Wilson)The oral bio-survival circuit&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). Exo-Psychology. Starseed/Peace Press, Los Angeles. Pg. 14 not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/exopsychologyman00learrich#page/n15/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. (1990). Quantum Psychology. New Falcon Press, Tempe, AZ. Page 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===

This circuit is concerned with nourishment, physical safety, comfort and survival,  [[suckling]], cuddling, etc. It begins with one spatial dimension, forward/back.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] early in infancy. The imprint will normally last for life unless it is re-imprinted by a powerful experience. Depending on the nature of the imprint, the organism will tend towards one of two basic attitudes:
*A positive imprint sets up a basic attitude of trust. The organism generally considers the environment benign and accepts and approaches. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
*A negative imprint sets up a basic attitude of suspicion. The organism generally regards the environment as hostile and flees and avoids. This is equivalent to a default life position of "you're not ok" in the [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is said to have appeared in the earliest evolution of the invertebrate brain and corresponds to the reptilian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. This circuit operates in essentially the same way across mammals, reptiles, fish, primates and humans. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[oral stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psychosexual development]], and proposed that this circuit is activated in adults by strong [[opioid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prometheus Rising, pg. 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. (Leary)The emotional-locomotion circuit (Wilson)The anal territorial circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
The emotional-territorial circuit is imprinted in the toddler stage. It is concerned with domination and submission, territoriality, etc.

The imprint on this circuit will trigger one of two states:
*Dominant, aggressive behavior. This imprint creates an '[[Alpha (ethology)|alpha]]' social attitude. Equivalent to the 'top dog' position in the model of [[Fritz Perls]], to 'I'm OK' in the  [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|'life positions' model of Transactional analysis]], and to [[Master–slave morality|master morality]] in the model of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Submissive, co-operative behavior.  Equivalent to the 'bottom dog' position in the model of Fritz Perls, to 'I'm not OK' in the life positions model and to Nietzschean 'slave morality'.

This circuit is activated by [[depressant]] drugs such as [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[barbiturates]], and [[benzodiazepine]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit appeared first in territorial vertebrate animals and is preserved across all mammals. It corresponds to the mammalian brain of [[Triune brain|triune brain theory]]. [[Robert Anton Wilson]] equated this circuit with the [[anal stage]] in the Freudian theory of [[psycho-sexual development]]. This circuit introduces a 2nd spatial dimension; up/down.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The first and second circuits both imprint in a binary fashion: trust/suspicion and dominance/submission.&lt;ref&gt;http://deoxy.org/raw1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there are four possible ways of imprinting the first two circuits:

*Trusting 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're OK]]. Friendly strength in the [[Interpersonal Circumplex]]. [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] in the [[Classical element|four elements model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Choleric in the [[Humorism|four humors model]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trusting 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're OK]]. Friendly weakness. [[Water (classical element)|Water]] in the four elements model. Phlegmatic humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and dominant 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly strength. [[Air (classical element)|Air]] in the four elements model. Sanguine humor.
*Suspicious 1st circuit and submissive 2nd circuit. [[Transactional Analysis#Life positions|I'm not OK; you're not OK]]. Unfriendly weakness. [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] in the four elements model. Melancholic humor.

===3. (Leary)The laryngeal-manual symbolic circuit (Wilson)The semantic time-binding circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This circuit is imprinted by human symbol systems. It is concerned with language, handling the environment, invention, calculation, prediction, building a mental "map" of the universe, physical dexterity, etc.

This circuit is activated by [[stimulant]] drugs such as [[amphetamine]]s, [[cathinone]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[caffeine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This circuit supposedly appeared first when [[hominid]]s started differentiating from the rest of the [[primates]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], being heavily influenced by [[General Semantics]], writes of this circuit as the 'time-binding circuit'. This means that this circuit's contents&amp;nbsp;– including human know-how, technology, science etc. - are preserved [[meme]]tically and passed on from generation to generation, constantly mutating and increasing in sophistication.

===4. (Leary)The socio-sexual domestication circuit (Wilson)The socio-sexual circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This fourth circuit is imprinted by the first [[orgasm]]-mating experiences and tribal "morals". It is concerned with [[sexual pleasure]] (instead of sexual reproduction), local definitions of "moral" and "immoral", [[reproduction]], rearing of the young, etc. The fourth circuit concerns itself with cultural values and operating within [[society|social networks]]. This circuit is said to have first appeared with the development of tribes. Some have pointed out that [[empathogen-entactogen|entactogen]]s such as [[MDMA]] seem to meet some of the requirements needed to activate this circuit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===5. (Leary and Wilson)The neurosomatic circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Exo-Psychology, table of contents&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Quantum Psychology, pgs. 196-201&lt;/ref&gt;===
This is concerned with neurological-somatic feedbacks, feeling high and blissful, [[somatic reprogramming]], etc. It may be called the rapture circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

When this circuit is activated, a non-conceptual feeling of well-being arises. This has a beneficial effect on the health of the physical body.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A., "Quantum Psychology" (1990). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth circuit is consciousness of the [[Human body|body]]. There is a marked shift from linear visual space to an all-encompassing [[aesthetic]] sensory space. Perceptions are judged not so much for their meaning and utility, but for their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T., "Neurologic" (1973). Starseed Publications, San Francisco. Page V-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Experience of this circuit often accompanies an [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] turn-on, a rapturous amusement, a detachment from the previously compulsive mechanism of the first four circuits.

This circuit is activated by ecstatic experiences via physiological effects of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Hatha Yoga]], [[tantra]] and [[Zen meditation]]. Robert Anton Wilson writes, "Tantra yoga is concerned with shifting consciousness entirely into this circuit"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Prolonged sexual play without orgasm always triggers some Circuit V consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe. Page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary describes that this circuit first appeared in the [[upper class]]es, with the development of leisure-class civilizations around 2000 BC.

''Note: Timothy Leary lists this circuit as the sixth, and the neurogenetic circuit as the seventh.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, T. (1977). "Neuropolitics". Starseed Peace Press, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Prometheus Rising", Robert Anton Wilson reversed the order of these two circuits,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, R.A. "Prometheus Rising" (1983). New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; describing the neurogenetic circuit as the sixth circuit, and the metaprogramming circuit as the seventh.

Seventh Printing, (2003). Page 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

This circuit is concerned with re-imprinting and re-programming all earlier circuits and the relativity of "realities" perceived. The sixth circuit consists of the nervous system becoming aware of itself. Leary says this circuit enables [[Telepathy|telepathic communication]] and is activated by low-to-moderate doses of [[LSD]] (50-150&amp;nbsp;µg), moderate doses of [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s and meditation/chanting especially when used in a group or ritual setting. This circuit is traced by Leary back to 500 BC.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

This circuit is the connection of the individual's mind to the whole sweep of evolution and life as a whole. It is the part of consciousness that echoes the experiences of the previous generations that have brought the individual's brain-mind to its present level.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The eighth circuit is concerned with [[Quantum mind|quantum consciousness]], [[Quantum entanglement|non-local awareness]] (information from beyond ordinary [[space-time]] awareness which is limited by the [[speed of light]]),  illumination. Some of the ways this circuit can get activated are: the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]], shock, a [[near-death experience]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], high doses of LSD and according to Robert Anton Wilson almost any dose of ketamine.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE0gRbyXllI&amp;index=6&amp;list=PL8F393A80E80263B3" Robert Anton Wilson - 8 Circuit Psychology 6/7] 01/12/2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This circuit has even been compared to the [[Buddhist]] concept of [[Indra's net]] from the [[Avatamsaka Sutra]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Leary's contribution==
Leary stated "They[The theories presented in ''Info-Psychology''] are scientific in that they are based on empirical findings from physics, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, astronomy, behavioral psychology, information science, and most importantly, neurology." &lt;ref&gt;Info-Psychology, pg 8., seventh printing, 2011 or Info-Psychology, pg. 7, third printing, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary called his book "science faction" or "psi-phy" and noted he had written it "in various prisons to which the author had been sentenced for dangerous ideology and violations of Newtonian and religious laws".&lt;ref&gt;''Info-Psychology, p7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Leary propounded the basic premise of eight "brains" or brain circuits, he was inspired by sources such as the [[Hindu]] ''[[chakra]]'' system.

Leary claimed that among other things this model explained the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social conflict in the 1960s]], where the mainstream was said to be those with four circuits active and characterized by Leary as tribal moralists and clashed with the [[counter-culture|counter-culturists]], who were then said to be those with the fifth circuit active and characterized as [[individualists]] and [[hedonism|hedonists]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Leary's first book on the subject, ''Neurologic'', only included seven circuits when it was published in 1973. ''Exo-Psychology'', published in 1977, expanded the number of circuits to eight and clarified the subject. In it, he puts forward the theory that the later four circuits are "post terrestrial;" intended to develop as we migrate off this planet and colonize others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leary|first= Timothy|date= 1977|title= Exo-Psychology|location= Los Angeles|publisher= Starseed/Peace Press Inc.|page= 103|isbn=0-915238-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once we begin space migration, according to Leary, we will have more ready access to these higher circuits. ''Exo-Psychology'' was re-published as revised by Timothy Leary with additional material in 1989 under the title ''Info-Psychology'' (New Falcon Publishing).

==Other authors on the eight circuits==
[[File:ChaosStar.svg|thumb|130px|In [[chaos magic]] the eight circuits are sometimes related to the eight rays of the [[symbol of chaos]]]]
Leary's ideas heavily influenced the work of [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. Wilson's book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'' is an in-depth work documenting Leary's eight-circuit model of consciousness. Wilson's published screenplay ''[[Reality Is What You Can Get Away With]]'' uses and explains the model. Wilson, like Leary, wrote about the distinction between terrestrial and post-terrestrial life.

''Angel Tech'' by [[Antero Alli]], is structured around the Eight-circuit model of consciousness. Alli defines the word angel as "a being of light" and tech from the word "techne" meaning "art". The title is defined as "the art of being light".&lt;ref&gt;Alli, Antero. (1985) "Angel Tech: A Modern Shaman's Guide to Reality Selection" New Falcon Publications, Tempe.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes suggested activities such as [[meditation]]s and construction of [[Tarot|tarot-card]] collages associated with each circuit and imprint.

The model is fairly prominent in [[chaos magic]]. This concept has been detailed in ''"Chaotopia!"'' by [[Dave_Lee_(chaos_magician)|Dave Lee]], a leading member of the magic society [[Illuminates of Thanateros]]. Leary and Wilson were also members of the society. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Rolf Von Eckartsberg also appears to have been influenced by the model.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eckartsberg, R. (1981a). "Maps of the mind". In Valle, R. &amp; von Eckarsberg, R. ''The metaphors of consciousness''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthportals.com/Portal_Messenger/bohm2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], an '''&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebra''' is a structure defined according to a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. For both algebra and coalgebra, a functor is a convenient and general way of organizing a [[Signature (logic)|signature]].  This has applications in [[computer science]]: examples of coalgebras include [[Lazy evaluation|lazy]], [[Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursive_data_structures_.28structural_recursion.29|infinite]] [[data structure]]s, such as [[Stream (computing)|streams]], and also [[State transition system|transition systems]].

&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebras are [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[F-algebra|&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]]s.  Just as the class of all [[algebraic structure|algebras]] for a given signature and equational theory form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]], so does the class of all &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebras satisfying a given equational theory form a covariety, where the signature is given by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
Let 

:&lt;math&gt;F : \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; 

be an [[endofunctor]] on a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.
An '''&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebra''' is an object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[morphism]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha : A \longrightarrow FA&lt;/math&gt;

of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, usually written as &lt;math&gt;(A, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;.

An &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebra [[homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;(A, \alpha)&lt;/math&gt; to another &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebra
&lt;math&gt;(B, \beta)&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism 

:&lt;math&gt;f:A\longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; 

in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt; Ff\circ \alpha = \beta \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus the &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebras for a given functor ''F'' constitute a category.

== Examples ==

The set of [[conatural numbers]] &lt;math&gt; \overline{\mathbb{N}} := \{0, 1, 2, \ldots \} \sqcup \{\infty\} &lt;/math&gt; consisting of the nonnegative integers and also infinity when equipped with the function &lt;math&gt; \alpha : \overline{\mathbb{N}} \to \overline{\mathbb{N}} \sqcup \{\ast\} &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt; \alpha(0) = \ast &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \alpha(n) = n - 1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; n = 1, 2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \alpha(\infty) = \infty &lt;/math&gt; is a coalgebra of the endofunctor &lt;math&gt; X \mapsto X \sqcup \{*\} : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; that sends a set to its [[disjoint union]] with the singleton set &lt;math&gt; \{ \ast \} &lt;/math&gt;. In fact, &lt;math&gt; (\overline{\mathbb{N}}, \alpha) &lt;/math&gt; is the terminal coalgebra of this endofunctor.

More generally, fix some set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbf{Set} \longrightarrow \mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; that sends &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(X\times A)\cup\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-coalgebra &lt;math&gt;\alpha : X \longrightarrow (X\times A)\cup\{1\} = FX&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or infinite [[stream (computing)|stream]] over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,}} where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of states and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the state-transition function.  Applying the state-transition function to a state may yield two possible results: either an element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; together with the next state of the stream, or the element of the singleton set &lt;math&gt;\{1\}&lt;/math&gt; as a separate "final state" indicating that there are no more values in the stream.

In many practical applications, the state-transition function of such a coalgebraic object may be of the form &lt;math&gt;X \rarr f_1 \times f_2 \times \ldots \times f_n&lt;/math&gt;, which readily factorizes into a collection of "selectors", "observers", "methods" &lt;math&gt;X \rarr f_1, \, X \rarr f_2 \, \ldots \, X \rarr f_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Special cases of practical interest include observers yielding attribute values, and mutator methods of the form &lt;math&gt;X \rarr X^{A_1 \times \ldots \times A_n}&lt;/math&gt; taking additional parameters and yielding states.   This decomposition is dual to the decomposition of initial &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebras into sums of 'constructors'.

Let ''P'' be the [[power set]] construction on the category of sets, considered as a covariant functor. The ''P''-coalgebras are in bijective correspondence with sets with a binary relation. 
Now fix another set, ''A''. Then coalgebras for the endofunctor ''P''(''A''×(-)) are in bijective correspondence with [[labelled transition system]]s, and homomorphisms between coalgebras correspond to functional [[bisimulation]]s between labelled transition systems.

== Applications ==
In [[computer science]], coalgebra has emerged as a convenient and suitably general way of specifying the behaviour of systems and data structures that are potentially infinite, for example classes in [[object-oriented programming]], [[Stream_(computing)|streams]] and [[Transition_system|transition systems]].  While [[algebraic specification]] deals with functional behaviour, typically using inductive datatypes generated by constructors, coalgebraic specification is concerned with behaviour modelled by coinductive process types that are observable by selectors, much in the spirit of [[automata theory]]. An important role is played here by [[Final coalgebra|final coalgebras]], which are complete sets of possibly infinite behaviours, such as streams. The natural logic to express properties of such systems is coalgebraic [[modal logic]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

{{Wittgenstein|Later}}
'''Family resemblance''' ({{lang-de|Familienähnlichkeit}}) is a philosophical idea made popular by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], with the best known exposition given in his posthumously published book ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that things which could be thought to be connected by one essential common feature may in fact be connected by a series of overlapping similarities, where no one feature is common to all of the things. Games, which Wittgenstein used as an example to explain the notion, have become the paradigmatic example of a group that is related by family resemblances. It has been suggested that Wittgenstein picked up the idea and the term from [[Nietzsche]], who had been using it, as did many nineteenth century philologists, when discoursing about [[language families]].&lt;ref&gt;Sluga H., ''Family Resemlance'', Grazer Philosophische Studien 71 (2006) 1; see also ''A Wittgenstein Dictionary'',  ed. H.-J. Glock, London:Blackwell 1996
&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term "Family resemblance" is found in a note from 1930, commenting on [[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L.,(1998) [[Culture and Value]], London:Blackwell, p 14.  Spengler's influence in this and other forms has been considered in papers published after this collection of notes became available, see e.g. DeAngelis W., "Wittgenstein and Spengler," Dialogue 33 (1994):41–61&lt;/ref&gt; The notion itself features widely in Wittgenstein's later work, and in the ''Investigations'' it is introduced in response to questions about the general form of [[proposition]]s and the essence of language – questions which were central to Wittgenstein throughout his philosophical career. This suggests that family resemblance was of prime importance for Wittgenstein's later philosophy; however, like many of his ideas, it is hard to find precise agreement within the secondary literature on either its place within Wittgenstein's later thought or on its wider philosophical significance.

Since the publication of the ''Investigations,'' the notion of family resemblance has been discussed extensively not only in the philosophical literature, but also, for example, in works dealing with classification where the approach is described as "polythetic", distinguishing it from the traditional approach known now as "monothetic". [[Prototype theory]] is a recent development in [[cognitive science]] where this idea has also been explored. As the idea gains popularity, earlier instances of its occurrence are  rediscovered e.g. in 18th century [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]],&lt;ref name="Winsor"&gt;Winsor M., 2003, ''Non-essentialist methods in pre-Darwinian taxonomy'', Biology and Philosophy 18 (2003) 387–400&lt;/ref&gt; in the writings of [[Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="Needham" /&gt; or [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz  W.,'' Postawa estetyczna, literacka i poetycka'' (1933) where it is called 'domino resemblance'.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical context==
The local context where the topic of family resemblances appears is Wittgenstein's critique of language. In ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' §65-71 the plurality of language uses is compared to the plurality of games. Next it is asserted that games have common features but no one feature is found in all of them. The whole argument has become famous under the heading 'language games'.

The larger context in which Wittgenstein's philosophy is seen to develop considers his uncompromising opposition to essences, mental entities and other forms of idealism which were accepted as a matter of fact in [[continental philosophy]] at the turn of the preceding century. In his view, the main cause for such errors is language and its uncritical use. In the received view, concepts, categories or classes are taken to rely on necessary features common to all items covered by them. [[Abstraction]] is the procedure which acknowledges this necessity and derives [[essence]]s, but in the absence of a single common feature, it is bound to fail.

==Terminology==
The term "Family resemblance" as feature of Wittgenstein's philosophy owes much to its translation in English. Wittgenstein, who wrote mostly in German, used the compound word 'Familienähnlichkeit', but as he lectured and conversed in English he used 'family likeness' (e.g. ''The Blue Book'', p.&amp;nbsp;17,33; ''The Brown Book'',§66). However, in the ''Philosophical Investigations'' the separate word 'Ähnlichkeit' has been translated as 'similarity' (§§11,130,185,444) and on two occasions (§§9,90) it is given as 'like'.  The German family-word is common and it is found in [[Deutsches Wörterbuch|Grimm's dictionary]]; a rare occurrence of 'family likeness' has been noted in a lecture by [[John Fletcher Moulton|J. F. Moulton]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;see Griffin, N.: 1974, ''Wittgenstein, Universals and Family Resemblance'', Canadian Journal of Philosophy III,635–651&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and quotes==
Games are the main example considered by Wittgenstein in his text where he also mentions numbers and makes an analogy with a thread. He develops his argument further by insisting that in such cases there is not a clear cut boundary but there arises some ambiguity if this indefiniteness can be separated from the main point.
In §66 Wittgenstein invites us to {{quote|consider for example the proceedings that we call "games"...[to] look and see whether there is anything common to all.}}
The section mentions card games, board games, ball games, games like ring-a-ring-a-roses and concludes:
{{quote|And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; we can see how similarities crop up and disappear.
And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of
similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities.}}
The following §67 begins by stating:
{{quote|I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than "'''family resemblances'''"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. – And I shall say: "games" form a family.}}
and extends the illustration
{{quote|for instance the kinds of number form a family in the same way. Why do we call something a "number"? Well, perhaps because it has a direct relationship with several things that have hitherto been called number; and this can be said to give it an indirect relationship to other things we call the same name. And we extend our concept of number as in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre. And the strength of the thread does not reside in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but in the overlapping of many fibres.}}
The problem of boundaries  begins in §68
{{quote|I can give the concept 'number' rigid limits ... that is, use the word "number" for a rigidly limited concept, but I can also use it so that the extension of the concept is not closed by a frontier. And this is how we do use the word "game". For how is the concept of a game bounded? What still counts as a game and what no longer does? Can you give the boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn. (But that never troubled you before when you used the word  "game".)}}

==Formal models==
There are some simple [[Scientific modelling|model]]s&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham R., 1975, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/65935/Rodney-Needham-Polythetic-Classification-Convergence-and-Consequence ''Polythetic classification: Convergence and consequences''], Man 10 (1975) 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andersen H.,:2000, ''Kuhn's account of family resemblance'', Erkenntnis 52: 313–337&lt;/ref&gt;
which can be derived from the text of §66-9. The most simple one, which fits Wittgenstein's exposition, seems to be the [[sorites paradox|sorites]] type. It consists in a collection of items ''Item_1'', ''Item_2'', ''Item_3''... described by features A, B, C, D, ...:

''Item_1'': A B C D               &lt;br&gt;
''Item_2'':   B C D E             &lt;br&gt;
''Item_3'':     C D E F         &lt;br&gt;
''Item_4'':       D E F G        &lt;br&gt;
''Item_5'':         E F G H      &lt;br&gt;
.........             . . . .

In this example, which presents an indefinitely extended ordered family, resemblance is seen in shared features: each item shares three features with his neighbors e.g. ''Item_2'' is like ''Item_1'' in respects B, C, D, and like ''Item_3'' in respects C, D, E. Obviously what we call 'resemblance' involves different aspects in each particular case. It is also seen to be of a different 'degree' and here it fades with 'distance': ''Item_1'' and ''Item_5'' have nothing in common.

Another simple model is described as:

''Item_1'': A B C   &lt;br&gt;
''Item_2'':   B C D &lt;br&gt;
''Item_3'': A   C D &lt;br&gt;
''Item_4'': A B   D &lt;br&gt;
It exhibits the presence of a constant degree of resemblance and the
absence of a common feature without extending to infinity.

Wittgenstein rejects the [[disjunction]] of features or 'properties', i.e. the set {A,B,C,D,..}, as something shared by all items. He admits that a 'sharing' is common to all but deems that it is only verbal:
{{quote|if someone wished to say: "There is something common to all these constructions – namely the disjunction of all their common properties" – I should reply: Now you are only playing with words. One might as well say: "Something runs through the whole thread – namely the continuous overlapping of those fibres".}}

==Notable applications==
*[[Thomas Kuhn]] uses  Wittgenstein's concept in chapter V ('The Priority of Paradigms) of his famous [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] (1962). [[Paradigm]]s are not reducible to single discoverable sets of scientific rules, but consist of assumptions that relate to other rules that are recognized by parts of a scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T. (2012) 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions', p. 45. Fourth (Anniversary) Edition,  Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Morris Weitz]] first applied family resemblances in an attempt to describe [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Weitz M., ''The Role of Theory in Aesthetics'', Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 15:1 (1956): pp. 27-35.&lt;/ref&gt; which opened a still{{When|date = September 2015}} continuing debate.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman D., ''Family resemblances Relationism and the meaning of "art",'' British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 47, No. 3, July 2007 {{doi|10.1093/aesthj/aym008}} {{cite web |url=http://www.missouristate.edu/assets/phi/Family_Resemblances_Relationalism_and_the_Meaning_of_Art.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100436/http://www.missouristate.edu/assets/phi/Family_Resemblances_Relationalism_and_the_Meaning_of_Art.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Umberto Eco]] argued that while regimes may differ wildly in their particulars, manifestations of [[fascism]] can be recognized by a kind of family resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Eco U., 'Ur-Fascism,' New York Review of Books, vol. 42, No. 11, June 22, 1995  {{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/06/22/ur-fascism/ |title=Ur-Fascism |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Renford Bambrough]] proposed that 'Wittgenstein solved what is known as "the [[problem of universals]]"' and said of his solution (as Hume said of Berkeley's treatment of the same topic) that it is "one of the greatest and most valuable discoveries that has been made of late years in the republic of letters".&lt;ref name="Bambrough"&gt;Bambrough, R.: 1961, ''Universals and Family Resemblance'', Proc. Aris. Soc. 61, 207–22&lt;/ref&gt; His view provided the occasion for numerous further comments.&lt;ref&gt;a recent summary in Blair D. (2006), ''Wittgenstein, Language and Information'', p.118 (note 117); see  also Dilman, I.: ''Universals: Bambrough on Wittgenstein'',  Aris. Soc. Proc., 79 (1978): 35–58; reprinted in John V. Canfi  ed., ''The Philosophy of Wittgenstein'', Vol. 5, Method and Essence, pp. 305–328. New York: Garland Publishing, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rodney Needham]] explored family resemblances in connection with the problem of [[Political alliance|alliance]] and noted their presence in taxonomy where they are known as a polythetic classification.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch]] used family resemblances in her cognitivist studies.&lt;ref&gt;

== Game studies ==
Wittgenstein's suggestion (PI, §66) about the impossibility of formulating a definition of games portrays a predicament for disciplines, which entail games as their subject matter, because it denies the possibility to know what games are. One possible solution is to point out that Wittgenstein merely acts out his failing attempt to define the concept of game, because he wanted to demonstrate a mechanism of language. He wasn't particularly concerned about games, nor about the concept of 'game', but he was interested in the consequence of a definitory failure. The demonstration aims to show, that there is no reason to search for real definitions, which describe essential attributes of things, but rather nominal definitions, which describe the use of the term in a community. He connected this idea to language games – lingual expressions combined with action – as a more adequate alternative to explain the function of language. Confusing this is his choice to denominate the approach (PI, §7) as 'language games', further fueling the impression that he provides insights about the concept of game. Wittgenstein wasn't interested in games but in language, therefore his theories and examples are only superficially related to academic disciplines with games as subject matter.

==Criticism and comments==

''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' is the primary text used in discussing family resemblances, even though the topic appears also in other works by Wittgenstein, notably [[Blue and Brown Books|''The Brown Book'']].&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein
L., ''The Blue and Brown Books'', London: Blackwell (1958);I 68, 17, 73&lt;/ref&gt; Many contributions to the discussion are by people involved in philosophical research but concerned with more pragmatic questions such as taxonomy&lt;ref name="Winsor"/&gt; or information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Blair D., Wittgenstein, Language and Information, Berlin:Springer, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Sluga]] has observed that "the notion of family resemblance... draws on two quite different sets of ideas, two different vocabularies, but treats them as if they were one and the same. The first is the vocabulary of kinship, of descent, of some sort of real and causal connection.. the second is that of similarity, resemblance, affinity and correspondence."&lt;ref&gt;Sluga H., Family Resemlance, ''Grazer Philosophische Studien'' 71 (2006) 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The main focus for criticism is{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} the notion of similarity, which is instrumental for family resemblance. A similarity is always found for two arbitrarily selected objects, or a series of intermediaries can link them into a family. This problem has been known as underdeterminacy or open ended texture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Admittedly infinity is only potential {{clarify|date=December 2015}} but for any finite family some common element can be pointed out, especially if relational properties are taken into consideration. {{Examples|date=December 2015}}
Wittgenstein's insistence that boundaries do not really exist but can
be traced arbitrarily has been described as [[conventionalism]] and more generally the acceptance of his conception has been seen to present a refined [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Resemblance Nominalism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7358">'''Feminist biology''' is an approach to [[biology]] that is concerned with the influence of gender values, the removal of gender bias, and the understanding of the overall role of social values in biological research and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work “Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women” and inspired the university’s endowed fellowship for feminist biology),&lt;ref&gt;David, Tenembaum. "First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology." University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the [[sex and gender distinction|assessment of the meaning of words such as “gender” and “sex.”]]
Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of [[biological determinism]], whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Johnna. "A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology." Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure.

==Contributions==
[[Donna J. Haraway]], a biologist and primatologist hailing from the University of California, put forth male bias criticisms in 1989 concerning the study of human evolution and culture via primatology by denoting a prominent lack of focus in female primates.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna Jeanne. Primate visions: Gender, race, and nature in the world of 
modern science. Psychology Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit.

Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and “come to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.”&lt;ref&gt;Biology and Gender Study Group, et al. "The Importance of Feminist Critique for Contemporary Cell Biology." Hypatia (1988): 61-76.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a general trend of “active” biological description associated with the sperm gamete and “passive” description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2&amp;nbsp;million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a dichotomous lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled “The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.” She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes – even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: “Ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.”&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling, Anne. "The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough." The Sciences Mar/Apr. 1993: 20-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure – which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take.

==Motivation==
The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices.&lt;ref&gt;Schiebinger, Londa. 1999. Has Feminism Changed Science? Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. [[Reductionism]], for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and [[biological determinism]], contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Mechanism without Reductionism", NWSA Journal, 16(1), 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. 

==Controversy==
There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that there sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, "Introduction," Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28, no. 3 (Spring 2003): 859-866.&lt;/ref&gt;. Individuals such as [[Carla Fehr]] offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, Carla, "Feminist Philosophy of Biology", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In combustion physics, '''fuel mass fraction''' is the ratio of [[fuel]] [[mass flow]] to the total mass flow of a fuel mixture. If an air flow is fuel free, the fuel mass fraction is zero; in pure fuel without trapped gases, the ratio is unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kanury | first = a. | title = Introduction to Combustion Phenomena | publisher = Gordon and Breach | location = New York | year = 1975 | pages = 150 | isbn = 0-677-02690-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As fuel is burned in a [[combustion]] process, the fuel mass fraction is reduced. The definition reads as

:&lt;math&gt;Y_F = \frac{m_F}{m_{\rm{tot}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt;m_F&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the fuel in the mixture
*&lt;math&gt;m_{\rm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total mass of the mixture

'''Fuzzy cold dark matter''' is a hypothetical form of [[cold dark matter]] proposed to solve the [[cuspy halo problem]]. It would consist of extremely light [[scalar particle]]s with masses on the order of &lt;math&gt;\approx 10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV. Fuzzy cold dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies would manifest wave behavior on astrophysical scales, and the cusps would be avoided through the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold and Fuzzy Dark Matter|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1158|year=2000|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1158–61|pmid=10991501|arxiv=astro-ph/0003365|last1=Hu|first1=Wayne|last2=Barkana|first2=Rennan|last3=Gruzinov|first3=Andrei|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..85.1158H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They do so by regulating and controlling information in social interaction.&lt;ref name= Piwinger&gt;{{Cite book | last=Piwinger | first= Manfred | last2=Ebert | first2= Helmut | year=2001 | chapter=Impression Management: Wie aus Niemand Jemand wird| title=in: Bentele, Guenther et al.

At an important game, a player would want to showcase themselves in the best light possible, because there are college recruiters watching. This person would have the flashiest pair of cleats and try and perform their best to show off their skills. Their main goal may be to impress the college recruiters in a way that maximizes their chances of being chosen for a college team rather than winning the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/impression-management-in-sociology-theory-definition-examples.html#lesson|title=Impression Management in Sociology: Theory, Definition &amp; Examples|website=Study.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Impression management is usually used synonymously with [[Self-concept|self]]-presentation, in which a person tries to influence the perception of their image. The notion of impression management was first applied to [[face-to-face communication]], but then was expanded to apply to [[computer-mediated communication]]. The concept of impression management is applicable to academic fields of study such as psychology and sociology as well as practical fields such as corporate communication and media.

== Background ==
The foundation and the defining principles of impression management were created by Erving Goffman in ''[[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]''. Impression management theory states that one tries to alter one's perception according to one's goals. In other words, the theory is about how individuals wish to present themselves, but in a way that satisfies their needs and goals. Goffman "proposed to focus on how people in daily work situations present themselves and, in so doing, what they are doing to others", and he was "particularly interested in how a person guides and control how others form an impression of them and what a person may or may not do while performing before them".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Theory ==

=== Motives ===
A range of factors that govern impression management can be identified. It can be stated that impression management becomes necessary whenever there exists a kind of social situation, whether real or imaginary. Logically, the awareness of being a potential subject of monitoring is also crucial. Furthermore, the characteristics of a given social situation are important. Specifically, the surrounding [[cultural norms]] determine the appropriateness of particular nonverbal behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions have to be appropriate to the targets, and within that culture, so that the kind of audience as well as the relation to the audience influences the way impression management is realized. A person's goals are another factor governing the ways and strategies of impression management. This refers to the content of an assertion, which also leads to distinct ways of presentation of aspects of the self. The degree of self-efficacy describes whether a person is convinced that it is possible to convey the intended impression.&lt;ref&gt;Doering 1999, p. 261-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new study finds that, all other things being equal, people are more likely to pay attention to faces that have been associated with negative gossip than those with neutral or positive associations.
The study contributes to a body of work showing that far from being objective, human perceptions are shaped by unconscious brain processes that determine what they "choose" to see or ignore—even before they  become aware of it. The findings also add to the idea that the brain evolved to be particularly sensitive to "bad guys" or cheaters—fellow humans who undermine social life by deception, theft or other non-cooperative behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21596956 | doi=10.1126/science.1201574 | volume=332 | issue=6036 | title=The visual impact of gossip. | date=Jun 2011 | journal=Science | pages=1446–8 | pmc=3141574 | last1 = Anderson | first1 = E | last2 = Siegel | first2 = EH | last3 = Bliss-Moreau | first3 = E | last4 = Barrett | first4 = LF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many methods behind self-presentation, including [[self disclosure]] (identifying what makes you "you" to another person), managing appearances (trying to fit in), ingratiation, aligning actions (making one's actions seem appealing or understandable), and alter-casting (imposing identities on other people). These self-presentation methods can also be used on the corporate level as impression management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-impression-management.htm|title=What is Impression Management?|website=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-presentation  ===

Self-presentation is conveying information about oneself – or an image of oneself – to others. There are two types and motivations of self-presentation:
* presentation meant to match one's own self-image, and
* presentation meant to match audience expectations and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister|first1=Roy F.|title=Self-Presentation Theory: Self-Construction and Audience Pleasing|journal=Springer Series in Social Psychology|date=1987|volume=Theories of Group Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-presentation is expressive. Individuals construct an image of themselves to claim personal identity, and present themselves in a manner that is consistent with that image.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=37}} If they feel like it is restricted, they often exhibit [[reactance (psychology)|reactance]] or become defiant – try to assert their freedom against those who would seek to curtail self-presentation expressiveness. An example of this dynamic is the "preacher's daughter", whose suppressed personal identity and emotions cause an eventual backlash at her family and community.

* '''Boasting''' – [[Theodore Millon|Millon]] notes that in self-presentation individuals are challenged to balance boasting against discrediting themselves via excessive self-promotion or being caught and being proven wrong. Individuals often have limited ability to perceive how their efforts impact their acceptance and likeability by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millon|first1=Theodore|title=Handbook of Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-38404-5|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Flattery''' – [[Flattery]] or [[praise]] to increase social attractiveness{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=169}}
* '''Intimidation''' aggressively showing [[anger]] to get others to hear and obey one's demands.&lt;ref&gt;Felson 1984, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-presentation can be either defensive or assertive strategies. Whereas defensive strategies include behaviours like avoidance of threatening situations or means of [[self-handicapping]], [[assertive]] strategies refer to more active behaviour like the verbal idealisation of the self, the use of status symbols or similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;Piwinger; Ebert 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

These strategies play important roles in one's maintenance of [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Leary; Kowalski 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; One's self-esteem is affected by their evaluation of their own performance and their perception of how others react to their performance. As a result, people actively portray impressions that will elicit self-esteem enhancing reactions from others.&lt;ref&gt;Hass 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social interaction ===
Goffman argued in his 1967 book, ''Interaction ritual'', that people participate in social interactions by performing a "line", or "pattern of verbal and nonverbal acts", which is created and maintained by both the performer and the audience.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior|last=Goffman|first=E.|publisher=Aldine|year=1967|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By enacting a line effectively, the person gains positive social value, which is also called "face". The success of a social interaction will depend on whether the performer has the ability to maintain face.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As a result, a person is required to display a kind of character by becoming "someone who can be relied upon to maintain himself as an interactant, poised for communication, and to act so that others do not endanger themselves by presenting themselves as interactants to him".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Goffman analyses how a human being in "ordinnary work situations presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them”.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, 1959, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

When Goffman turned to focus on people physically presented in a social interaction, the "social dimension of impression management certainly extends beyond the specific place and time of engagement in the organization". Impression management is "a social activity that has individual and community implications".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; We call it "pride" when a person displays a good showing from duty to himself, while we call it "honor" when he "does so because of duty to wider social units, and receives support from these duties in doing so".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another approach to moral standards that Goffman pursues is the notion of "rules of conduct", which "can be partially understood as obligations or moral constraints". These rules may be substantive (involving laws, morality, and ethics) or ceremonial (involving etiquette).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rules of conduct play an important role when a relationship "is asymmetrical and the expectations of one person toward another are hierarchical."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dramaturgical analogy ===
Goffman presented impression management [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgically]], explaining the motivations behind complex human performances within a social setting based on a play metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman's work incorporates aspects of a symbolic [[Interactionism|interactionist]] perspective,{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=34}} emphasizing a qualitative analysis of the interactive nature of the communication process. Impression management requires the physical presence of others. Performers who seek certain ends in their interest, must "work to adapt their behavior in such a way as to give off the correct impression to a particular audience" and "implicitly ask that the audience take their performance seriously".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Goffman proposed that while among other people individual would always strive to control the impression that others form of him or her so that to achieve individual or social goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/Books/the-social-thought-of-erving-goffman|title=The Social Thought of Erving Goffman|last=Jacobsen|first=Michael|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Søren|date=2015|location=Thousand Oaks, California|doi=10.4135/9781483381725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor, shaped by the environment and target audience, sees interaction as a performance. The objective of the performance is to provide the audience with an impression consistent with the desired goals of the actor.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, impression management is also highly dependent on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these goals, individuals differ in responses from the interactive environment, some may be non-responsive to an audience's reactions while others actively respond to audience reactions in order to elicit positive results. These differences in response towards the environment and target audience are called [[self-monitoring theory|self-monitoring]].&lt;ref name="Doring"&gt;Döring 1999, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in impression management is [[self-verification theory|self-verification]], the act of conforming the audience to the person's [[self-concept]].

The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image. An example is provided by situations in which embarrassment occurs and threatens the image of a participant.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffman proposes that performers "can use dramaturgical discipline as a defense to ensure that the 'show' goes on without interruption."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Goffman contends that dramaturgical discipline includes:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# coping with dramaturgical contingencies;
# demonstrating intellectual and emotional involvement;
# remembering one's part and not committing unmeant gestures or faux pas;
# not giving away secrets involuntarily;
# covering up inappropriate behavior on the part of teammates on the spur of the moment;
# offering plausible reasons or deep apologies for disruptive events;
# maintaining self-control (for example, speaking briefly and modestly);
# suppressing emotions to private problems; and
# suppressing spontaneous feelings.

=== Manipulation and ethics ===
In business, "managing impressions" normally "involves someone trying to control the image that a significant stakeholder has of them". The ethics of impression management has been hotly debated on whether we should see it as an effective self-revelation or as cynical [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some people insist that impression management can reveal a truer version of the self by adopting the strategy of being '''transparent''', which is a kind of openness. Because [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] "can be provided so easily and because it produces information of value to the audience, it changes the nature of impression management from being cynically manipulative to being a kind of useful adaptation".

[[Virtue signalling]] is used within groups to criticize their own members for valuing outward appearance over substantive action (having a real or permanent, rather than apparent or temporary, existence).

[[Psychological manipulation]] is a type of [[social influence]] that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.  The process of manipulation involves bringing an unknowing victim under the domination of the manipulator, often using deception, and using the victim to serve their own purposes.

[[Machiavellianism]] is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, and therefore able to detach him or herself from conventional morality and hence to deceive and manipulate others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sideways-view/201611/the-machiavellian-boss|title=The Machiavellian Boss|work=Psychology Today|date=November 18, 2016|author=Adrian Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]].)

[[Sophism]]
In modern usage sophist and sophistry are redefined and used disparagingly. A sophism is a '''specious''' argument for displaying ingenuity in reasoning or for deceiving someone. A sophist is a person who reasons with clever but fallacious and deceptive arguments.

[[Corporate jargon]]
Variously known as corporate speak, corporate lingo, business speak, business jargon, management speak, workplace jargon, or commercialese, is the jargon often used in large corporations, bureaucracies, and similar workplaces.[1][2] The use of corporate jargon, also known as "corporatese", is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult.

== Application ==

=== Face-to-face communication ===

==== Self, social identity and social interaction ====
The social psychologist, Edward E. Jones, brought the study of impression management to the field of psychology during the 1960s and extended it to include people's attempts to control others' impression of their personal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Leary; Kowalski 1990&lt;/ref&gt; His work sparked an increased attention towards impression management as a fundamental interpersonal process.

The concept of [[self]] is important to the theory of impression management as the images people have of themselves shape and are shaped by social interactions{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=47}} Our self-concept develops from social experience early in life.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=85}} Schlenker (1980) further suggests that children anticipate the effect that their behaviours will have on others and how others will evaluate them. They control the impressions they might form on others, and in doing so they control the outcomes they obtain from social interactions.

[[Social identity]] refers to how people are defined and regarded in social interactions .{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=69}} Individuals use impression management strategies to influence the social identity they project to others.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=85}} The identity that people establish influences their behaviour in front of others, others' treatment of them and the outcomes they receive. Therefore, in their attempts to influence the impressions others form of themselves, a person plays an important role in affecting his social outcomes.{{sfn|Schlenker|1980|p=90}}

Social interaction is the process by which we act and react to those around us. In a nutshell, social interaction includes those acts people perform toward each other and the responses they give in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/social-interactions-definition-types-quiz.html|title=Social Interactions: Definition &amp; Types|last=Moffitt|first=Kimberly|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic function of self-presentation is to define the nature of a social situation (Goffman, 1959). Most social interactions are very role governed. Each person has a role to play, and the interaction proceeds smoothly when these roles are enacted effectively. People also strive to create impressions of themselves in the minds of others in order to gain material and social rewards (or avoid material and social punishments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jdb/452/452_chapter_07.pdf|title=CHAPTER 07 SELF-PRESENTATION|last=Brown|first=Jonathon|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cross-cultural communication   ====
Understanding how one's impression management behavior might be interpreted by others can also serve as the basis for smoother interactions and as a means for solving some of the most insidious communication problems among individuals of different racial/ethnic and gender backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenfeld|first=Paul|last2=Giacalone|first2=Robert A.|last3=Riordan|first3=Catherine A.|date=1994-03-01|title=Impression Management Theory and Diversity Lessons for Organizational Behavior|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/37/5/601|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=37|issue=5|pages=601–604|doi=10.1177/0002764294037005002|issn=0002-7642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"People are sensitive to how they are seen by others and use many forms of impression management to compel others to react to them in the ways they wish" (Giddens, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;142). An example of this concept is easily illustrated through cultural differences. Different cultures have diverse thoughts and opinions on what is considered beautiful or attractive. For example, Americans tend to find tan skin attractive, but in Indonesian culture, pale skin is more desirable.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/553/impression-management-considering-cultural-social-and-spiritual-factors|title=Impression Management: Considering Cultural, Social, and Spiritual Factors|last=Norris|first=Ashley|date=2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another illustration of how people attempt to control how others perceive them is portrayed through the clothing they wear. A person who is in a leadership position strives to be respected and in order to control and maintain the impression. This illustration can also be adapted for a cultural scenario. The clothing people choose to wear says a great deal about the person and the culture they represent. For example, most Americans are not overly concerned with conservative clothing. Most Americans are content with tee shirts, shorts, and showing skin. The exact opposite is true on the other side of the world. "Indonesians are both modest and conservative in their attire" (Cole, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;77).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Companies use [[cross-cultural training]] (CCT) to facilitate effective cross-cultural interaction. CCT can be defined as any procedure used to increase an individual's ability to cope with and work in a foreign environment. Training employees in culturally consistent and specific impression management (IM) techniques provide the avenue for the employee to consciously switch from an automatic, home culture IM mode to an IM mode that is culturally appropriate and acceptable. Second, training in IM reduces the uncertainty of interaction with FNs and increases employee's ability to cope by reducing unexpected events.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Team-working in hospital wards   ====
Impression management theory can also be used in health communication. It can be used to explore how professionals 'present' themselves when interacting on hospital wards and also how they employ front stage and backstage settings in their collaborative work.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Simon|last2=Reeves|first2=Scott|date=2011-05-01|title=Enacting 'team' and 'teamwork': using Goffman's theory of impression management to illuminate interprofessional practice on hospital wards|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=72|issue=10|pages=1595–1602|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.037|issn=1873-5347|pmid=21549467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hospital wards, Goffman's front stage and backstage performances are divided into 'planned' and 'ad hoc' rather than 'official' and 'unofficial' interactions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Planned front stage is the structured collaborative activities such as ward rounds and care conferences which took place in the presence of patients and/or carers.

Ad hoc front stage is the unstructured or unplanned interprofessional interactions that took place in front of patients/carers or directly      involved patients/carers.

Planned backstage is the structured MDT meetings in which professionals gathered in a private area of the ward, in the absence of patients, to discuss management plans for patients under their care.

Ad hoc backstage is the use of corridors and other ward spaces for quick conversations between professionals in the absence of patients/carers.

Offstage is the social activities between and among professional groups/individuals outside of the hospital context.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Results show that interprofessional interactions in this setting are often based less on planned front stage activities than on ad hoc backstage activities. While the former may, at times, help create and maintain an appearance of collaborative interprofessional 'teamwork', conveying a sense of professional togetherness in front of patients and their families, they often serve little functional practice. These findings have implications for designing ways to improve interprofessional practice on acute hospital wards where there is no clearly defined interprofessional team, but rather a loose configuration of professionals working together in a collaborative manner around a particular patient. In such settings, interventions that aim to improve both ad hoc as well as planned forms of communication may be more successful than those intended to only improve planned communication.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Computer-mediated communication ===
The [[hyperpersonal model]] of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) posits that users exploit the technological aspects of CMC in order to enhance the messages they construct to manage impressions and facilitate desired relationships. The most interesting aspect of the advent of CMC is how it reveals basic elements of interpersonal communication, bringing into focus fundamental processes that occur as people meet and develop relationships relying on typed messages as the primary mechanism of expression. "Physical features such as one's appearance and voice provide much of the information on which people base first impressions face-to-face, but such features are often unavailable in CMC. Various perspectives on CMC have suggested that the lack of nonverbal cues diminishes CMC's ability to foster impression formation and management, or argued impressions develop nevertheless, relying on language and content cues. One approach that describes the way that CMC's technical capacities work in concert with users' impression development intentions is the hyperpersonal model of CMC (Walther, 1996). As receivers, CMC users idealize partners based on the circumstances or message elements that suggest minimal similarity or desirability. As senders, CMC users selectively self-present, revealing attitudes and aspects of the self in a controlled and socially desirable fashion. The CMC channel facilitates editing, discretion, and convenience, and the ability to tune out environmental distractions and re-allocate cognitive resources in order to further enhance one's message composition. Finally, CMC may create dynamic feedback loops wherein the exaggerated expectancies are confirmed and reciprocated through mutual interaction via the bias-prone communication processes identified above."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther|first=Joseph B.|date=2007-09-01|title=Selective self-presentation in computer-mediated communication: Hyperpersonal dimensions of technology, language, and cognition|url=http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/38956.pdf|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=23|issue=5|pages=2538–2557|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2006.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to O'Sullivan's (2000) impression management model of communication channels, individuals will prefer to use mediated channels rather than face-to-face conversation in face-threatening situations. Within his model, this trend is due to the channel features that allow for control over exchanged social information. The present paper extends O'Sullivan's model by explicating information control as a media affordance, arising from channel features and social skills, that enables an individual to regulate and restrict the flow of social information in an interaction, and present a scale to measure it. One dimension of the information control scale, expressive information control, positively predicted channel preference for recalled face-threatening situations. This effect remained after controlling for social anxiousness and power relations in relationships. O'Sullivan's model argues that some communication channels may help individuals manage this struggle and therefore be more preferred as those situations arise. It was based on an assumption that channels with features that allow fewer social cues, such as reduced nonverbal information or slower exchange of messages, invariably afford an individual with an ability to better manage the flow of a complex, ambiguous, or potentially difficult conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feaster|first=John Christian|date=2010-10-01|title=Expanding the Impression Management Model of Communication Channels: An Information Control Scale|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01535.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=115–138|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01535.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals manage what information about them is known, or isn't known, to control other's impression of them.

==== Corporate brand ====
The impression management perspective offers potential insight into how corporate stories could build the corporate brand, by influencing the impressions that stakeholders form of the organization. The link between themes and elements of corporate stories and IM strategies/behaviours indicates that these elements will influence audiences' perceptions of the corporate brand.&lt;ref name="Sara Spear 491–501"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sara Spear|last2=Stuart Roper|date=2013-11-01|title=Using corporate stories to build the corporate brand: an impression management perspective|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/JPBM-09-2013-0387|journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management|volume=22|issue=7|pages=491–501|doi=10.1108/JPBM-09-2013-0387|issn=1061-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Corporate storytelling =====
Corporate storytelling is suggested to help demonstrate the importance of the corporate brand to internal and external stakeholders, and create a position for the company against competitors, as well as help a firm to bond with its employees (Roper and Fill, 2012). The corporate reputation is defined as a stakeholder's perception of the organization (Brown et al., 2006), and Dowling (2006) suggests that if the story causes stakeholders to perceive the organization as more authentic, distinctive, expert, sincere, powerful, and likeable, then it is likely that this will enhance the overall corporate reputation.

Impression management theory is a relevant perspective to explore the use of corporate stories in building the corporate brand. The corporate branding literature notes that interactions with brand communications enable stakeholders to form an impression of the organization (Abratt and Keyn, 2012), and this indicates that IM theory could also therefore bring insight into the use of corporate stories as a form of communication to build the corporate brand. Exploring the IM strategies/behaviors evident in corporate stories can indicate the potential for corporate stories to influence the impressions that audiences form of the corporate brand.&lt;ref name="Sara Spear 491–501"/&gt;

===== Corporate document =====
Firms use more subtle forms of influencing outsiders' impressions of firm performance and prospects, namely by manipulating the content and presentation of information in corporate documents with the purpose of "distort[ing] readers" perceptions of corporate achievements" [Godfrey et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;96]. In the accounting literature this is referred to as impression management. The opportunity for impression management in corporate reports is increasing. Narrative disclosures have become longer and more sophisticated over the last few years. This growing importance of descriptive sections in corporate documents provides firms with the opportunity to overcome information asymmetries by presenting more detailed information and explanation, thereby increasing their decision-usefulness. However, they also offer an opportunity for presenting financial performance and prospects in the best possible light, thus having the opposite effect. In addition to the increased opportunity for opportunistic discretionary disclosure choices, impression management is also facilitated in that corporate narratives are largely unregulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/business/staff/doris_merkl-davies.php.en|title=Dr Doris Merkl-Davies  {{!}} Bangor Business School {{!}} Bangor University|last=University|first=Bangor|website=www.bangor.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media ====
The medium of communication influences the actions taken in impression management. Self-efficacy can differ according to the fact whether the trial to convince somebody is made through face-to-face-interaction or by means of an e-mail.&lt;ref name="Doring" /&gt; Communication via devices like telephone, e-mail or chat is governed by technical restrictions, so that the way people express personal features etc. can be changed. This often shows how far people will go.

===== Profiles on social networking sites =====
Social networking users will employ protective self-presentations for image management. Users will use subtractive and repudiate strategies to maintain a desired image.&lt;ref name="Rui, J 2013"&gt;Rui, J. and M. A. Stefanone (2013). Strategic Management of Other-Provided Information Online: Personality and Network Variables. System Sciences (HICSS), 2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on.&lt;/ref&gt; Subtractive strategy is used to untag an undesirable photo on Social Networking Sites. In addition to un-tagging their name, some users will request the photo to be removed entirely. Repudiate strategy is used when a friend posts an undesirable comment about the user. In response to an undesired post, users may add another wall post as an innocence defense. Michael Stefanone states that "self-esteem maintenance is an important motivation for strategic self-presentation online."&lt;ref name="Rui, J 2013" /&gt; Outside evaluations of their physical appearance, competence, and approval from others determines how social media users respond to pictures and wall posts. Unsuccessful self-presentation online can lead to rejection and criticism from social groups. Social networking sites like MySpace, Facebook, and StudiVZ are popular means of communicating personality. Recent theoretical and empirical considerations of homepages and Web 2.0 platforms show that impression management is a major motive for actively participating in social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krämer|first=Nicole C.|last2=Winter|first2=Stephan|date=2008-01-01|title=Impression Management 2.0|url=http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.106|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=106–116|doi=10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.106|issn=1864-1105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online social media presence often varies with respect to users' age, gender, and body weight. While men and women tend to utilize social media in comparable degrees, both uses and capabilities vary depending on individual preferences as well perceptions of power or dominance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In terms of performance, men tend to display characteristics associated with masculinity as well as more commanding language styles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In much the same way, women tend to present feminine self-depictions and engage in more supportive language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

With respect to usage across age variances, many children develop digital and social media literacy skills around 7 or 8 and begin to form online social relationships via virtual environments designed for their age group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The years between thirteen and fifteen demonstrate high social media usage that begins to become more balanced with offline interactions as teens learn to navigate both their online and in-person identities which may often diverge from one another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Social media platforms often provide a great degree of social capital during the college years and later&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During middle adulthood, users tend to display greater levels of confidence and mastery in their social media connections while senior users tend to utilize social media for educational and supportive purposes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908698924|title=Social media : enduring principles|last=Ashlee.|first=Humphreys,|isbn=9780199328437|location=Oxford|oclc=908698924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These myriad factors influence how users will form and communicate their online personas.

Studies also suggest that adolescents body weight and their health status might influence their self-presentation practices. For example, research focusing on adolescent patients with obesity indicate that particularly girls with obesity tend to present themselves in such a way that their weight is not in focus, or avoid presenting food items that are associated with overweight/obesity &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Berg|first2=Christina|last3=Hillman|first3=Thomas| last4=Lissner|first4=Lauren|last5=Chaplin|first5=John E.|date=2018-10-16|title= Self-presentation in digital media among adolescent patients with obesity: Striving for integrity, risk-reduction, and social recognition|url=  http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2055207618807603|journal=Digital Health|volume=4|pages=1–15|doi=10.1177/2055207618807603|}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

According to Marwick, social profiles create implications such as "context collapse" for presenting oneself to the audience. The concept of ‘‘context collapse,’’ suggests that social technologies make it difficult to vary self-presentation based on environment or audience. "Large sites such as Facebook and Twitter group friends, family members, coworkers, and acquaintances together under the umbrella term ‘‘friends’ "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Online Identity|last=Marwick|first=Alice E.|publisher=Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=355–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Political impression management =====
One arena where impression management is essential is in politics. "Political impression management" was coined in 1972 by sociologist Peter M. Hall, who defined the term as the art of making a candidate look electable and capable (Hall 1972). This is due in part to the importance of "presidential" candidates—appearance, image, and narrative are a key part of a campaign and thus impression management has always been a huge part of winning an election (Katz 2016). As social media becomes more and more a part of the political process, political impression management is becoming more challenging as the online image of the candidate often now lies in the hands of the voters themselves.

== Implications  ==
Impression management can distort the results of empirical research that relies on interviews and surveys, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "social desirability bias". Impression management theory nevertheless constitutes a field of research on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Tedeschi 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
When it comes to practical questions concerning public relations and the way organizations should handle their public image, the assumptions provided by impression management theory can also provide a framework.&lt;ref&gt;Piwinger; Ebert 2001, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination of different impression management strategies acted out by individuals who were facing criminal trials where the trial outcomes could range from a death sentence, life in prison or acquittal has been reported in the forensic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2010). "[http://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/support-files/female-psychopathic-killers.pdf The Last Frontier: Myths &amp; The Female Psychopathic Killer]". ''Forensic Examiner'', Summer 2010, 50-67.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Perri and Lichtenwald article examined female [[psychopathic]] killers, whom as a group were highly motivated to manage the impression that attorneys, judges, mental health professions and ultimately, a jury had of the murderers and the murder they committed. It provides legal case illustrations of the murderers combining and/or switching from one impression management strategy such as ingratiation or supplication to another as they worked towards their goal of diminishing or eliminating any accountability for the murders they committed.

Since the 1990s, researchers in the area of sport and exercise psychology have studied self-presentation.  Concern about how one is perceived has been found to be relevant to the study of athletic performance.  For example, anxiety may be produced when an athlete is in the presence of spectators.  Self-presentational concerns have also been found to be relevant to exercise.  For example, the concerns may elicit motivation to exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ginis, K.A., Lindwall, M., &amp; Prapavessis, H. (2007).  Who cares what other people think?  Self-presentation in exercise and sport.  In R. Eklund &amp; G. Tenenbaum (Eds.), Handbook of Sport Psychology (pp. 136–153).  Hoboken, NJ:  John Wiles &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research investigating the effects of impression management on social behaviour showed that social behaviours (e.g. eating) can serve to convey a desired impression to others and enhance one's self-image. Research on eating has shown that people tend to eat less when they believe that they are being observed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Herman; Roth; Polivy 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Individualism sidebar}}
An '''individual''' is that which exists as a distinct [[entity]]. '''Individuality''' (or [[wikt:selfhood|selfhood]]) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing his or her own [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|needs]] or [[Personal goal setting|goals]], [[right]]s and [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of [[biology]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]].

From the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]]) ''individual'' meant "[[divisible|indivisible]]", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person". From the 17th century on, ''individual'' indicates separateness, as in [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Although individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a [[sanity|sane]] adult [[human|human being]] is usually considered by the [[State (polity)|state]] as an "individual person" in law, even if the person denies individual [[culpability]] ("I followed instructions"). An individual person is [[accountability|accountable]] for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to [[prosecution]] in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached [[age of majority]], often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of [[voting right]]s, [[tax]] and [[military duty|military duties]]/ individual [[Right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] (protected only under certain constitutions). In line with [[hierarchy]], ultimate individual human reward for [[Social status|success]] and responsibility for [[failure]] is nonetheless found at the top of [[society|human society]].

==Law==
in [[International law]]:
:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Article 1 of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

in [[Law of the United States|American law]]:
:A natural person is a human being. A legal person is an entity such as a company, which is regarded in law as having its own 'legal personality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jon Rush|author2=Michael Ottley|title=Business Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2gFZhuB5boC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law'' states: A "natural person" is "A human being as distinguished from person (as a corporation) created by operation of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merriam-Webster, Inc|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYs74quLWLIC&amp;pg=PA323|year=1996|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1910 legal dictionary states: "Individual: As a noun, this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Campbell Black|title=A Law Dictionary Containing Definitions of the Terms and Phrases of American and English Jurisprudence, Ancient and Modern. 2nd edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PNQgVoT2_aQC&amp;pg=PA618|year=1910|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Buddhism===
In [[Buddhism]], the concept of the individual lies in [[anatman]], or "no-self." According to anatman, the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that, working together, give the appearance of being a single, separated whole. In this way, anatman, together with [[anicca]], resembles a kind of [[bundle theory]]. Instead of an atomic, indivisible self distinct from reality, the individual in Buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing, impermanent universe (see [[Interdependence]], [[Nondualism]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocity]]).

===Empiricism===
Early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[Ibn Tufail]]&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  in early 12th century Islamic Spain, and [[John Locke]] in late 17th century England, [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan#Empiricism, tabula rasa, nature versus nurture|introduced the idea]] of the individual as a [[tabula rasa]] ("blank slate"), shaped from birth by experience and education. This ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual, society as a [[social contract]] between [[Rationality|rational]] individuals, and the beginnings of [[individualism]] as a doctrine.

===Hegel&lt;!--linked from 'Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel'--&gt;===
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] regarded history as the gradual evolution of Mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Each time the mind applies its concepts to the world, the concept is revealed to be only partly true, within a certain context; thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). The individual comes to rise above his or her own particular viewpoint,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and grasps that he or she is a part of a greater whole{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} insofar as he or she is bound to family, a social context, and/or a political order.

===Existentialism===
With the rise of [[existentialism]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]] rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of [[the will to power]] and the heroic ideal of the [[Übermensch]]. The individual is also central to [[Sartre]]'s philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and [[free will]]. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]), the individual is called upon to create his or her own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality.

===Objectivism===
[[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] regards every human as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his or her own life, a right derived from his or her nature as a rational being. Individualism and Objectivism hold that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of [[individual rights]]&amp;nbsp;— and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. Since only an individual man or woman can possess rights, the expression "individual rights" is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in today's intellectual chaos), but the expression "[[collective rights]]" is a contradiction in terms. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority]] has no right to vote away the rights of a [[minority group|minority]]; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual).&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualism.html ''"Individualism"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1961), [http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individualrights.html ''"Individual Rights"'']. Ayn Rand Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology&lt;!--Linked from 'Extraterrestrial life'--&gt;==
In [[biology]], the question of the individual is related to the definition of an [[organism]], which is an important question in biology and [[philosophy of biology]], despite there having been little work devoted explicitly to this question.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Wilson | first = R | title = The biological notion of individual | journal = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | year = 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-individual/}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a "unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]]".&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; [[Gene]]s, [[genome]]s, or groups may function as individual units.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

[[Asexual reproduction]] occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical. Such a colony is called a [[genet (biology)|genet]], and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. The colony, rather than the individual, functions as a unit of selection. In other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of [[sexual reproduction]].

The '''International FAIRTRADE Certification Mark''' is an independent [[certification mark]] used in over 50 countries. It appears on products as an independent guarantee that a product has been produced according to Fairtrade political standards.

The FAIRTRADE Mark is owned and protected by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]] (FLO), on behalf of its 25-member and associate member Fairtrade producer networks and labelling initiatives.

For a product to carry the FAIRTRADE Mark, it must come from [[FLO-CERT]] inspected and certified producer organizations. The crops must be marketed in accordance with the International Fairtrade standards set by [[FLO International|Fairtrade International]]. The supply chain is also monitored by [[FLO-CERT]]. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the primary cooperative and its member farmers must operate to certain political standards, imposed from Europe. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organisations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008).

==How it works==
The marketing system for Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade coffee is identical in the consuming countries, using mostly the same importing, packing, distributing and retailing firms. Some independent brands operate a virtual company, paying importers, packers and distributors and advertising agencies to handle their brand, for cost reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, 'Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies', Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; In the producing country Fairtrade is marketed only by Fairtrade cooperatives, while other coffee is marketed by Fairtrade cooperatives (as uncertified coffee), by other cooperatives and by ordinary traders.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S.

Cooperative traders and exporters can sell coffee as Fairtrade certified if they meet the political standards of FLO and they pay a certification and inspection fee. Other administration costs and production costs are incurred to meet these standards. The exporter (not the farmer) is paid a minimum price for Fairtrade certified coffee when the world market is oversupplied, and a Fairtrade premium of 15c per lb at other times. The cooperatives can, on average, sell only a third of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and sell the rest at world prices.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, S. (2010).

Disambiguation:  There is widespread confusion because the fair trade industry standards provided by Fairtrade International (The Fairtrade Labelling Organization) use the word “producer” in many different senses, often in the same specification document.

Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for democratic decision making, ensuring that producers have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested etc. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.

Fairtrade Standards for hired labour situations ensure that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining|bargain collectively]]. Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s must also ensure that there is no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. (These labor standards do not apply to, Fairtrade "small farmer cooperatives" though some have an average of 2.39 ha per farmer of just one crop, coffee, with some single farmers having more than 23 ha coffee, implying substantial use of hired labor.)&lt;ref&gt;Weber, J. G. (2011). How much more do growers receive for Fair Trade organic coffee. Food Policy , 677-684.&lt;/ref&gt; In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade Standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.

For some products, such as coffee, only Fairtrade Standards for small farmers' organizations are applicable. For others, such as tea, both small farmers' organizations and plantations can be certified.

Trade standards cover the payment of premiums, of minimum prices, where applicable, the provision of credit to buy the crop, and commercial relationships between the exporting cooperative or other organization and the importer.

Typically, in order for a product to be marked as "Fair-trade " at least 20% of its mass must be made up of a Fairtrade product.

Fairtrade Standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade Standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, certification staff etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006).

Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however criticisms of the standards. There have been complaints that Fairtrade standards are inappropriate and may harm producers, sometimes imposing months of additional work for little return.&lt;ref&gt;Utting-Chamorro, K. (2005).

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of13their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% to as much as 60% of their turnover.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs have been met must be spent on “social projects”  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (FLO) (2011), “Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations”  version: 1 April 2011 http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf accessed 15 January 2013; Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The producers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent. They are generally used for improvements in health, education or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. As part of the Fairtrade criteria, registered producers are accountable to [[FLO-CERT]] for the use of this money. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

There are complaints that the standards relating to paying of price premiums, minimum prices, provision of credit, etc. by importers in rich countries are not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E.

They found that this kickback was 10c a pound over a period when the official price premium was 5c or 10c a pound, and this, plus the certification fee, meant that the cooperatives made a loss in years when a premium was payable, and were paid substantially less than the official minimum prices in years when a minimum price was payable. These should have been identified and rectified by the certification agency.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out, for a fee,&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) “. (2011). Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. Retrieved January 3, 2013, from http://www.flo-cert.net: http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for profit, body created by Fairtrade International in 2004. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade Standards and that producers have invested any surplus received through Fairtrade in social projects.

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).

There have been claims that adherence to fair trade standards by producers has been poor and that enforcement of standards by Fairtrade is very weak, notably by Christian Jacquiau.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"&gt;Hamel, I.: 2006, 'Fairtrade Firm Accused of Foul Play', Swiss Info http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Fair_trade_firm_accused_of_foul_play.html?cid=5351232 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Paola Ghillani, who spent four years as president of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations.&lt;ref name="swissinfo.ch"/&gt; There is criticism of poor enforcement: labourers on Fairtrade farms in Peru are paid less than the minimum wage;&lt;ref&gt;Weitzman, H.

It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;

==Costs and returns==

Fairtrade farmers and marketing organizations incur a wide range of costs in achieving and maintaining certification. They incur these costs on all their production, but they can only recover costs on the small part of their production that they can sell as "Fairtrade certified". In practice they can sell only small of their output as Fairtrade, because of lack of demand, and must sell the rest as uncertified at world prices. For example, there is not enough demand to take all the certified coffee produced, so most has to be sold as uncertified. In 2001 only 13.6% could be sold as certified&lt;ref&gt;Muradian, R., and W. Pelupessy. 2005. "Governing the Coffee Chain: The Role of Voluntary Regulatory Systems” World Development 33(12): 2029-2044., cited in de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010).

The cooperative or other certified organization has to spend money on conforming to the standards, with changed employment practices, the introduction and administration of the required democratic processes, changed processing, labelling and packing, changed material. They also incur extra costs in selling: . Weber&lt;ref name="Weber, J. 2006"/&gt; reports cooperatives not able to cover the extra costs of a marketing team for Fairtrade, with one covering only 70% of these costs after six years of Fairtrade membership.

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. (2011) “Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard,” p11  {{cite web|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}  accessed 15 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These cost money, mean that the farmers have to do more work in the hot sun, and that they have to hire labour instead of using family labour. In times when world prices are so low that there is no “social premium” and the minimum price is paid, some farmers have negotiated that some of the money is paid to them, rather than being used for social projects.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[image:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|left|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;Fairtrade labelled coffee, the first [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade labelled]] product, was first launched in the Netherlands in 1988. The label, launched by [[Nico Roozen]] and Dutch missionary [[Frans van der Hoff]], was then called [[Max Havelaar]] after a fictional Dutch character who opposed the exploitation of coffee pickers in Dutch colonies. Fairtrade labelling allowed Fairtrade Certified goods to be sold outside the [[World shops]] for the first time and into mainstream retailers, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting sales significantly.

The concept caught on: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called “Max Havelaar” (in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and France), "Transfair" (in Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan), or carrying a national name: “Fairtrade  Mark” in the UK and Ireland, "Rättvisemärkt" in Sweden, and "Reilu Kauppa" in Finland. Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now known simply as [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|Fairtrade International (FLO)]]. FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|FLO]] launched a new FAIRTRADE Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, convey a dynamic, forward-looking image for [[Fairtrade]], facilitate cross border trade and simplify procedures for importers and traders.

The FAIRTRADE Mark harmonization process is still under way – as of March 2011, all but two labelling initiatives {{Dubious|date=June 2010}}([[TransFair USA]] and [[TransFair Canada]]) have fully adopted the new international Certification Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/certification_mark.html The Certification Mark]. URL accessed on November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These two organizations currently use the [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]], however Canadian organization began actively promoting the new international Certification Mark in 2010 as part of a total transition toward it. TransFair USA has apparently elected to continue with its own mark for the time being,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "Some LIs, including TransFair USA, have elected to continue using their current labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, over 19 FLO Member Labelling Initiatives are using the International Fairtrade Certification Mark. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, quinoa, herbs and spices, wine and footballs etc.&lt;ref name=FLOPRO/&gt;

==Criticism==
According to the economist [[Bruce Wydick]] with the median coffee drinker willing to pay a premium of 50 cents for a cup of fair-trade coffee even in the best-case scenario for fair trade, when world prices are at their lowest, the maximum amount a fair-trade grower from that same cup of coffee would receive is only one third of a cent&lt;ref name="zeit.de"&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Die Zeit|Title=Fairtrade: Keine langfristig positiven Effekte |PublicationPlace=Hamburg|ISSN=0044-2070|language=German|URL=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2014-08/fairetrade-kaffee/seite-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wydick lists his points against the alleged benefits of fair trade:
* The flawed design of the system undermines its own benefits: zero benefits in the long run. 
* For certification Fair trade imposes significant costs on impoverished growers
* Fair trade attracts bad beans by making growers dump their bad beans into fair-trade channels.
* Costs to growers imposed by restrictions on fertilizers and other inputs diminish yields.
* Fair trade doesn’t help the poorest growers.
* Relatively little fair-trade coffee originates from the poorest countries. 
* Purported social investments of the fair-trade system lack transparency.
* The fair-trade system is inefficient at transferring coffee consumers’ goodwill to producers.
* Direct trade is probably more efficient and sustainable than fair trade.
* Artificially stimulating more coffee production keeps coffee growers poor, because overproduction makes the prices fall on the world markets.
* Fair-trade coffee fails to address the root of poverty issues which aren't payment of producers but social, political and educational conditions.
* Among the 16 best methods to fight poverty fair trade was the second but last with regard to cost efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost-Effective Compassion: The 10 Most Popular Strategies for Helping the Poor|trans-title=|periodical=ChristianityToday.com|publisher=|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/february/popular-strategies-helping-the-poor.html?paging=off|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Reasons Fair-Trade Coffee Doesn't Work|trans-title=|periodical=The Huffington Post|publisher=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-wydick/10-reasons-fair-trade-coffee-doesnt-work_b_5651663.html|format=|accessdate=2016-06-18|last=University of San Francisco; author Bruce Wydick Professor of economics and international studies|date=2014-08-07|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9210">The '''junkyard tornado''' is an argument used to deride the probability of [[abiogenesis]] as comparable to "the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/abioprob.html |title=Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations |work=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |first=Ian |last=Musgrave |date=December 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Johnson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/weekinreview/28johnson.html |title=Bright Scientists, Dim Notions |work=NY Times |date=October 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gatherer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gatherer |first1=Derek |year=2008 |title=Finite Universe of Discourse: The Systems Biology of Walter Elsasser (1904-1991) |journal=The Open Biology Journal |volume=1 |pages=9–20 |doi=10.2174/1874196700801010009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used originally by [[Fred Hoyle]], in which he applied statistical analysis to the origin of life, but similar observations predate Hoyle and have been found all the way back to Darwin's time,&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt; and indeed to [[Cicero]] in [[Classical era|classical times]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' 2.37&lt;/ref&gt; While Hoyle himself was an atheist, the argument has since become a mainstay of [[creationist]] and [[intelligent design]] [[criticism of evolution|criticisms of evolution]].

This argument is rejected by the vast majority of [[biology|biologists]].  From the modern [[evolution]]ary standpoint, while the odds of the sudden construction of higher lifeforms are indeed improbably remote, evolution proceeds in many smaller stages, each driven by [[natural selection]] rather than by chance, over a long period of time.  The transition as a whole is plausible, as each step improves survivability; the Boeing 747 was not designed in a single unlikely burst of creativity, and modern lifeforms were not constructed in one single unlikely event, as the junkyard tornado posits.

==Hoyle's statement==
According to [[Fred Hoyle]]'s analysis, the probability of cellular life's arising from non-living matter ([[abiogenesis]]) was about one-in-10&lt;sup&gt;40,000&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |year=1983 |title=The Intelligent Universe |page=17}} The Boeing 747 metaphor is reported in Nature, 294 (1981), p.10{{failed verification |which article? http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v294/n5836/index.html|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented:

{{quote|The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable to the chance that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a [[Boeing 747]] from the materials therein.}}

This echoes his stance, reported elsewhere:

{{quote|Life as we know it is, among other things, dependent on at least 2000 different enzymes. How could the blind forces of the primal sea manage to put together the correct chemical elements to build enzymes?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Fred Hoyle |first=Fred |last=Hoyle |title=The Intelligent Universe |year=1983 |isbn=0-7181-2298-4}}{{page needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoyle used this to argue in favor of [[panspermia]], that the origin of life on earth was from preexisting life in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoyle|first1=Fred|last2=Wickramasinghe|first2=N. C.|title=Astronomical Origins of Life|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-9401058629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The junkyard tornado derives from arguments most popular in the 1920s, prior to the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], which are rejected by evolutionary biologists.&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMSmith"/&gt; A preliminary step is to establish that the [[phase space]] containing some biological entity (such as humans, working cells, or the eye) is enormous, something not contentious.  The argument is then to infer from the huge size of the phase space that the probability that the entity could appear by chance is exceedingly low, ignoring the key process involved, [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;

Sometimes, arguments invoking the junkyard tornado analogy also invoke [[Borel's Law]], which claims that highly improbable events do not occur.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;  The usual argument against Borel's "Law" is that if ''all'' possible outcomes of a natural process are highly improbable when taken individually, then a highly improbable outcome is certain.  The true law being referenced is actually the [[law of large numbers|Strong Law of large numbers]], but creationists have taken a simple statement made by Borel in books written late in his life concerning probability theory and called this statement Borel's Law.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

This "Borel's Law" is actually the [[universal probability bound]], which when applied to evolution is axiomatically incorrect. The universal probability bound assumes that the event one is trying to measure is completely random, and some use this argument to prove that evolution could not possibly occur, since its probability would be much less than that of the universal probability bound. This, however, is fallacious, given that evolution is not a completely random effect ([[genetic drift]]), but rather proceeds with the aid of natural selection.

The junkyard tornado is also applied to cellular biochemistry. This is comparable to the older [[infinite monkey theorem]] but instead of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the claim is that the probability that a [[protein]] molecule could achieve a [[function (biology)|functional]] sequence of [[amino acids]] is too low to be realised by chance alone.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt;  The argument conflates the difference between the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and as such may evolve under natural selection to become better adapted and perhaps more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in [[Boeing 747]]). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.

According to Ian Musgrave in ''Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, and Probability of Abiogenesis Calculations'':
{{quote|These people, including Fred, have committed one or more of the following errors.
#They calculate the probability of the formation of a "modern" protein, or even a complete bacterium with all "modern" proteins, by random events. This is not the [[abiogenesis]] theory at all.
#They assume that there is a fixed number of proteins, with fixed sequences for each protein, that are required for life.
#They calculate the probability of sequential trials, rather than simultaneous trials.
#They misunderstand what is meant by a probability calculation.
#They underestimate the number of functional enzymes/ribozymes present in a group of random sequences.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;}}

==Reception==
The junkyard tornado argument is rejected by evolutionary biologists,&lt;ref name="Gatherer"/&gt; since, as the late [[John Maynard Smith]] pointed out, "no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step."&lt;ref name="JMSmith"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]], ''The Problems of Biology'', p.49. (1986), {{ISBN|0-19-289198-7}}, "What is wrong with it? Essentially, it is that no biologist imagines that complex structures arise in a single step."&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Evolutionary biology]] explains how complex [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] structures evolved by analysing the intermediate steps required for [[precellular]] life. It is these intermediate steps that are omitted in creationist arguments, which is the cause of their overestimating of the improbability of the entire process.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt;

Hoyle's argument is a mainstay of [[creationist]], [[intelligent design]], [[orthogenetic]] and other criticisms of evolution. It has been labeled a [[fallacy]] by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his two books ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' and ''[[Climbing Mount Improbable]]''.&lt;ref name="Abiogenesis Calculations"/&gt; Dawkins argues that the existence of God, who under theistic uses of Hoyle's argument is implicitly responsible for the origin of life, defies probability far more than does the spontaneous origin of life even given Hoyle's assumptions, with Dawkins detailing his counter-argument in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', describing God as the [[Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit]].

[[Law]] in Oceania refers to the different legal systems within the geographical area of Oceania. Countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] follow in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] tradition of common law, and until recently were subject to the United Kingdom [[House of Lords]]. Other countries and islands trace their legal heritage to different former colonialists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''League of peace''' ([[Latin]]: '''''foedus pacificum''''') is an expression coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]". The league of peace should be distinguished from a [[peace treaty]] (''pactum pacis'') because a peace treaty prevents or terminates only one war, while the league of peace seeks to end all wars forever. This league does not hold any power of the state, but only exists for "the maintenance and security of the freedom of the state and of other states in league with it, without there being any need for them to submit to civil laws and their compulsion, as men in a state of nature must submit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch 1795|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4137">In [[tensor analysis]], a '''mixed tensor''' is a [[tensor]] which is neither strictly [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] nor strictly [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]]; at least one of the indices of a mixed tensor will be a subscript (covariant) and at least one of the indices will be a superscript (contravariant).

A mixed tensor of '''type''' or '''valence''' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\binom{M}{N}&lt;/math&gt;, also written "type (''M'', ''N'')", with both ''M'' &gt; 0 and ''N'' &gt; 0, is a tensor which has ''M'' contravariant indices and ''N'' covariant indices.  Such a tensor can be defined as a [[linear operator|linear function]] which maps an (''M'' + ''N'')-tuple of ''M'' [[one-form]]s and ''N'' [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s to a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]. 

==Changing the tensor type==
{{main|raising and lowering indices}}
Consider the following octet of related tensors:
:&lt;math&gt; T_{\alpha \beta \gamma}, \ T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\gamma, \ T_\alpha {}^\beta {}_\gamma, \ 
T_\alpha {}^{\beta \gamma}, \ T^\alpha {}_{\beta \gamma}, \ T^\alpha {}_\beta {}^\gamma, \ 
T^{\alpha \beta} {}_\gamma, \ T^{\alpha \beta \gamma} &lt;/math&gt;.
The first one is covariant, the last one contravariant, and the remaining ones mixed.  Notationally, these tensors differ from each other by the covariance/contravariance of their indices.  A given contravariant index of a tensor can be lowered using the [[metric tensor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt;, and a given covariant index can be raised using the inverse metric tensor ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt; could be called the ''index lowering operator'' and ''g&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;'' the ''index raising operator''.

Generally, the covariant metric tensor, contracted with a tensor of type (''M'', ''N''), yields a tensor of type (''M'' − 1, ''N'' + 1), whereas its contravariant inverse, contracted with a tensor of type (''M'', ''N''), yields a tensor of type (''M'' + 1, ''N'' − 1).

===Examples===
As an example, a mixed tensor of type (1, 2) can be obtained by raising an index of a covariant tensor of type (0, 3),
:&lt;math&gt; T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\lambda = T_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \, g^{\gamma \lambda} &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the same tensor as &lt;math&gt; T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;, because
:&lt;math&gt;  T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\lambda \, \delta_\lambda {}^\gamma = T_{\alpha \beta} {}^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;,
with Kronecker ''δ'' acting here like an identity matrix.

Likewise,
:&lt;math&gt; T_\alpha {}^\lambda {}_\gamma = T_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \, g^{\beta \lambda}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_\alpha {}^{\lambda \epsilon} = T_{\alpha \beta \gamma} \, g^{\beta \lambda} \, g^{\gamma \epsilon},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T^{\alpha \beta} {}_\gamma = g_{\gamma \lambda} \, T^{\alpha \beta \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T^\alpha {}_{\lambda \epsilon} = g_{\lambda \beta} \, g_{\epsilon \gamma} \, T^{\alpha \beta \gamma}. &lt;/math&gt;

Raising an index of the metric tensor is equivalent to contracting it with its inverse, yielding the [[Kronecker delta]],
:&lt;math&gt; g^{\mu \lambda} \, g_{\lambda \nu} = g^\mu {}_\nu = \delta^\mu {}_\nu &lt;/math&gt;,
so any mixed version of the metric tensor will be equal to the Kronecker delta, which will also be mixed.It is known as Mixed tensor

In '''philosophy''', '''moral conversion''' is an [[Existential humanism|existential]] [[Existential crisis|change]] in the person, who is perceived as the moral agent adopting new moral standards (or [[mores]]) in a process of internal transformation. Moral conversion is a relatively rare event in a person's normal development. It involves a decision that is both conscious and existentialist (i.e. based on critical questioning).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=194}} Moral conversion is based on the [[internalist]] view of [[morality]].{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=7}}

==As an existential event==
The process of moral conversion was described by [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] of the [[University of Chicago]], who developed the so-called [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]. Six classes of moral conversion were identified, based on progressively higher and higher levels of moral reasoning, beginning with the ''preconventional'' level of a child, and concluding with the ''postconventional'' (or autonomous) level of an adult aware of ethical principles guiding universally moral behaviour.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=203}}

Notably, the notion of moral conversion has been distinguished from the theory of moral development ''per se'', by [[Walter E. Conn]] (of [[Villanova University]]) and [[John C. Gibbs]] (of the [[Ohio State University]]).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=205}} Moral conversion, according to Conn and Gibbs, involves critical questioning and therefore differs from any spontaneous moral development (Kohlberg). It results in the setting forth of the "self-chosen values" (Conn), which bring the existential dimension to the transforming process.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=219&amp;ndash;224}}

[[Alfredo J. Mac Laughlin]] of St. Ambrose University defines moral conversion by the frequent occurrence of the "{{nobreak|sharp-turn}} conversions" resulting from the presence of [[free will]], which differ from the natural/spontaneous development taking place in incremental stages (Kohlberg).{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=234}} The most significant aspect of moral conversion is the withdrawal from the moral convictions of the past, which is based on "critical self-appropriation" or the ''critical'' discovery of oneself.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=250}} It depends on the sense of authenticity beyond the possibility of predictions.{{sfn|Mac Laughlin|2008|p=253}}

==As self-transcendence==
[[Bernard Lonergan]] explains that moral conversion is not moral perfection. It is the "withdrawal from self-enclosure" or the shift from personal satisfaction criterion to values that transcend oneself (or one's own group interests). Moral conversion, according to Lonergan, is one of three different types of conversion along with the ''intellectual'' and the [[Religious conversion|''religious'' conversion]].{{sfn|Conn|1982}} From a causal point of view, it is the difference between varying levels of consciousness leading to a higher sense of responsibility for the world.{{sfn|Doran|2011|p=13&amp;ndash;18}}

'''“Mowgli syndrome”''' is a term used by [[Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty]] in her 1995 book ''Other Peoples’ Myths: The Cave of Echoes'' to describe mythological figures who succeed in bridging the animal and human worlds to become one with nature, a human animal, only to become trapped between the two worlds, not completely animal yet not entirely human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It is also a rarely used descriptive term for so-called [[feral child]]ren; “Mowgli syndrome” is not a recognized psychological or physiological malady. The term originates from the character [[Mowgli]], a fictional feral child from [[Rudyard Kipling]]’s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893675823|title=The Medical Lives of History's Famous People|last=James|first=Maloney, William|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781608059362|location=|pages=136-139|oclc=893675823|quote=|via=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Physical Laboratory of India''', situated in [[New Delhi]], is the [[measurement standards laboratory]] of India. It maintains standards of [[SI units]] in India and calibrates the national standards of weights and measures.

== History of measurement systems in India ==

{{main|History of measurement systems in India}}

One of the most ancient texts of India, ''Manusmriti'', describes among the duties of the king: ''The king should examine the weights and balances every six months to ensure true measurements and to mark them with the royal stamp.'' -- ''Manusmriti'', 8th Chapter, [[Shlokas|Shloka]] 403. In the [[Harappa]]n era, which is nearly 5000 years old, one finds excellent examples of town planning and architecture. The sizes of the bricks were the same all over the region. In the time of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], some 2400 years ago, there was a well - defined system of weights and measures. The [[government]] of that time ensured that everybody used the same system. In the Indian medical system, [[Ayurveda]], the units of mass and volume were well defined.

The measurement system during the time of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, [[Akbar]], the ''guz''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-23|title=Guz|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guz&amp;oldid=740810309|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the measure of length. The ''guz'' was widely used till the introduction of the metric system in [[India]] in 1956. During the [[British Raj|British period]], efforts were made to achieve uniformity in weights and measures. A compromise was reached in the system of measurements which continued till India's independence in 1947. After independence in 1947, it was realized that for fast industrial growth of the country, it would be necessary to establish a modern measurement system in the country. The [[Lok Sabha]] in April 1955 resolved : ''This house is of the opinion that the [[Government of India]] should take necessary steps to introduce uniform weights and measures throughout the country based on [[metric system]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian units of measurement]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

== History of the National Physical Laboratory, India ==
The National Physical Laboratory, India was set up in 1900) is one of the earliest national laboratories set up under the [[Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research]]. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] laid the foundation stone of NPL on 4 January 1947. Dr. [[K. S. Krishnan]] was the first Director of the laboratory. The main building of the laboratory was formally opened by Former [[Deputy Prime Minister of India|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 21 January 1950. Former [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], inaugurated the Silver Jubilee Celebration of the Laboratory on 23 December 1975.

NPL Charter:-

The main aim of the laboratory is to strengthen and advance physics-based research and development for the overall development of science and technology in the country. In particular its objectives are:

To establish, maintain and improve continuously by research, for the benefit of the nation, National Standards of Measurements and to realize the Units based on International System (Under the subordinate Legislations of Weights and Measures Act 1956, reissued in 1988 under the 1976 Act). 
To identify and conduct after due consideration, research in areas of physics which are most appropriate to the needsof the nation and for advancement of field

To assist industries, national and other agencies in their developmental tasks by precision measurements, calibration, development of devices, processes, and other allied problems related to physics.

To keep itself informed of and study critically the status of physics.

== Maintenance of standards of measurements in India ==
Each modernized country, including [[India]] has a National Metrological Institute (NMI), which maintains the standards of measurements. This responsibility has been given to the National Physical Laboratory, [[New Delhi]].

=== Metre ===
The standard unit of [[length]], [[metre]], is realized by employing a stabilized [[Helium]] - [[Neon]] [[laser]] as a source of light. Its frequency is measured experimentally. From this value of frequency and the internationally accepted value of the [[speed of light]] (299,792,458 metres/second), the wavelength is determined using the relation:

&lt;center&gt;Wavelength = Velocity of light / frequency&lt;/center&gt;

The nominal value of wavelength, employed at NPL is 633 nanometer. By a sophisticated instrument, known as an optical interferometer, any length can be measured in terms of the wavelength of laser light.

The present level of [[uncertainty]] attained at NPL in length measurements is '''± 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;'''. However in most measurements, an uncertainty of '''± 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;''' is adequate.

=== Kilogramme ===
The Indian national standard of [[mass]], [[kilogramme]], is copy number 57 of the international prototype kilogram supplied by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM : French - Bureau International des Poids et Mesures), [[Paris]]. This is a [[Platinum]] [[Iridium]] cylinder whose mass is measured against the international prototype at BIPM. The NPL also maintains a group of transfer standard kilograms made of non - magnetic [[stainless steel]] and [[nickel]] - [[chromium]] alloy.

The uncertainty in mass measurements at NPL is '''± 4.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Second ===
The national standard of [[time]] interval, [[second]] as well as [[frequency]], is maintained through four parameters, which can be measured most accurately. Therefore, attempts are made to link other physical quantities to time and frequency. The standard maintained at NPL has to be linked to different users. This process, known as dissemination, is carried out in a number of ways. For applications requiring low levels of uncertainty, there is satellite based dissemination service, which utilizes the Indian national satellite, [[INSAT]]. Time is also disseminated through [[TV]], [[radio]], and special [[telephone]] services. The [[caesium]] [[atomic clock]]s maintained at NPL are linked to other such instituted all over the world through a set of [[Global Positioning System|global positioning satellites]].

=== Ampere ===
The unit of electric current, [[ampere]], is realized at NPL by measuring [[volt]] and [[Ohm (unit)|Ohm]] separately.

The uncertainty in measurement of ampere is '''± 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Kelvin ===
The standard of [[temperature]] is based on the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]] (ITS-90). This is based on the assigned temperatures to several fixed points. One of the most fundamental temperatures of these is the triple point of water. At this temperature, ice, water and steam are at equilibrium with each other. This temperature has been assigned the value of 273.16 [[kelvin]]s. This temperature can be realized, maintained and measured in the laboratory. At present temperature standards maintained at NPL cover a range of 54 to 2,473 kelvins.

The uncertainty in its measure is '''± 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Candela ===
The unit of [[luminous intensity]], [[candela]], is realized by using an absolute radiometer. For practical work, a group of tungsten incandescent lamps are used.

The level of uncertainty is '''± 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

=== Mole ===
Experimental work has been initiated to realize [[mole (unit)|mole]], the SI unit for amount of substance

=== Radiation ===
The NPL does not maintain standards of measurements for ionizing [[radiation]]s. This is the responsibility of the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|Homi Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]], [[Mumbai]].

== Calibrator of weights and measures ==
The standards maintained at NPL are periodically compared with standards maintained at other National Metrological Institutes in the world as well as the [[BIPM]] in [[Paris]]. This exercise ensures that Indian national standards are equivalent to those of the rest of the world.

Any measurement made in a country should be directly or indirectly linked to the national standards of the country, For this purpose, a chain of laboratories are set up in different [[States and territories of India|states]] of the country. The weights and measures used in daily life are tested in the laboratories and certified. It is the responsibility of the NPL to calibrate the measurement standards in these laboratories at different levels. In this manner, the measurements made in any part of the country are linked to the national standards and through them to the international standards.

The weights and balances used in local markets and other areas are expected to be certified by the Department of Weights and Measures of the local government. Working standards of these local departments should, in turn, be calibrated against the state level standards or any other laboratory which is entitled to do so. The state level laboratories are required to get their standards calibrated from the NPL at the national level which is equivalent to the international standards.


== Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND) or Indian Reference Materials ==

Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya (BND) or Indian reference materials are reference materials developed by NPL which derive their traceability from National Standards.

== Research ==
NPL is also involved in research. One of the important research activities undertaken by NPL is to devise the chemical formula for the indelible ink which is being used in the [[Elections in India|Indian elections]] to prevent fraudulent voting. This ink, manufactured by the [[Mysore Paints and Varnish Limited]] is applied on the finger nail of the voter as an indicator that the voter has already cast his vote.

NPL also have section working on development of [[biosensors]]. Currently the Biomedical Instrumentation section is headed by Dr. R. K. Kotnala and section is primarily focusing on development of sensor for [[cholesterol]],  measurement and microfluidic based biosensors. Section is also developing biosensors for [[Uric acid]] detection.

NPL has developed [[Hydroelectric Cell]], which is form of [[galvanic cell]]. The novelty of this work lies in the generation of electrical energy by water molecule dissociation using lithium substituted magnesium ferrite at room temperature. Porous magnesium ferrite has been explored extensively for its water molecule sensing properties via chemidissociation of water molecule. More about this can be checked from NPL website.

== NPL's Contributions ==

=== The Indelible Mark/Ink ===

During general election, nearly 40 million people wear a CSIR mark on their fingers. The Indelible ink used to mark the fingernail of a Voter during general elections is a time-tested gift of CSIR to the spirit of democracy. Developed in 1952, it was first produced in-campus. Subsequently industry has been manufacturing the Ink. It is also exported to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Turkey and other democracies.

=== Pristine Air-Quality Monitoring Station at Palampur ===

National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has established an atmospheric monitoring station in the campus of Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) at Palampur (H.P.) at an altitude of 1391 m for generating the base data for atmospheric trace species &amp; properties to serve as reference for comparison of polluted atmosphere in India. At this station, NPL has installed state of art air monitoring system, greenhouse gas measurement system and Raman Lidar. A number of parameters like CO, NO, NO2, NH3, SO2, O3, PM, HC &amp; BC besides CO2 &amp; CH4 are being currently monitored at this station which is also equipped with weather station (AWS) for measurement of weather parameters.&lt;ref&gt;http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=159487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.mygov.in/csir-npl-launches-indias-first-pristine-air-quality-monitoring-station-at-palampur/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gold Standard (BND-4201) ===

The BND-4201 is first Indian reference material for gold of ‘9999’ fineness (gold that is 99.99% pure with impurities of only 100 parts-per-million).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7322">The '''Nebraska Innocence Project''' is a member organization [[Nebraska]]-based chapter of a U.S non-profit organization called the [[Innocence Project]], located in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=InnocenceNetwork-AlphabeticalListing&gt;{{cite web|title=Alphabetical listing of all Innocence Network member organizations|url=http://innocencenetwork.org/members/#alpha|website=The Innocence Network|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to use DNA testing to investigate, litigate and exonerate those in prison who were wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/nebraska-innocence-project-to-hire-staff-attorney/article_e3cd8116-528e-59e8-a9e8-79cd24a82c52.html|title=Nebraska Innocence Project to hire staff attorney|date=October 1, 2015|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|last1=Pilger|first1=Lori|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter was founded in 2005 by a group of volunteers who were inspired by the work of [[Barry Scheck]] and [[Peter Neufeld]], founders of the Innocence Project in 1992.

== Founding ==
A group of volunteers including an Iowa attorney formed the Iowa/Nebraska Innocence Project in 2005 after meeting the founders of the [[Innocence Project]], Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and several exonerated people at a national conference. Their goal was to form a local version of the project. By 2007 the Iowa/Nebraska Innocent Project became the Nebraska Innocence Project. The organization is part of the Innocence Network, which is a group of 40 innocence projects across the nation, all working to provide accessible information, consultation on cases, and media resources [[Pro bono|pro-bono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nebraskainnocenceproject.org/about-2/|title=Innocence Project|last=|first=|date=|website=Innocence Project|publisher=Nebraska Innocence Project|access-date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
The Nebraska Innocence Project works primarily with cases involving [[Genetic testing|DNA testing]]. According to the New York Innocence Project, more than 75% of people who have been exonerated in the United States through DNA testing, have served in prison on the basis of faulty eyewitness accounts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/dna-testing-ordered-in--year-old-omaha-rape-case/article_a4cca32e-f389-5b4c-b94e-cc7bc55ffc8e.html|title=DNA testing ordered in 40-year-old Omaha rape case|last=Beck|first=Margery|date=February 21, 2014|work=Lincoln Journal Star|access-date=March 16, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a recent change to Nebraska state law will allow the project to look at cases not involving DNA such as arson cases, Shaken Baby Syndrome, bite marks, and show print-analysis.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt; The Nebraska Innocence Project relies on the work of volunteers and essentially works without a budget. A partnership between the Nebraska chapter and the Midwest Innocence Project, which launched in October 2015, allows Nebraska to take advantage of the Midwest Innocence Project's paid administration, which they intend to do by hiring a paid legal director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/nebraska-innocence-project-merges-with-regional-group-plans-to-hire/article_d39fa282-7303-11e5-8927-03a1edba7352.html | title=Nebraska Innocence Project merges with regional group, plans to hire first paid legal director | work=Omaha.com | date=15 October 2015 | accessdate=26 March 2016 | author=Hammel, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners, the Nebraska Innocence Project sends requests to the Midwest Innocence Project, based in Kansas City, Missouri who prepares the cases and sends them back to Nebraska for investigation and possible litigation.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt; Legal director, Tricia Bushnell assists the Nebraska chapter by organizing cases and finding experts who could help the case.&lt;ref name="LincolnJournalStar-NEInnocenceProject-2015" /&gt;

== Notable Cases ==

=== Beatrice 6 ===
Commonly referred to the [[Beatrice 6]], a 1985 case in [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]] involved the rape and murder of 68-year-old woman, Helen Wilson, in her apartment. Six people, three men and three women were found guilty of committing the crime.&lt;ref name=LincolnJournalStar-Beatrice6-2014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/judge-grants-mistrial-in-beatrice-case/article_867ef362-d50f-5a69-a773-e24775cc6163.html|title=Judge grants mistrial in Beatrice 6 case|last=Pilger|first=Lori|date=January 30, 2014|work=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surfacing evidence that their conviction was based on coerced confessions and the malpractice of forensics, DNA testing of the original evidence proved their innocence.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://netnebraska.org/article/news/972218/beatrice-6-damage-claim-case-returns-federal-court|title=Beatrice 6 Damage Claim Case Returns to Federal Court|last=Kelly|first=Bill|date=May 8, 2015|work=[[Nebraska Educational Telecommunications|Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NET)]]|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA evidence was the first to be used as means to exonerate someone in the state of Nebraska.&lt;ref name=NET-Beatrice6-2015 /&gt; The six were awarded between $35,000-$500,00 by the state of Nebraska for their wrongful conviction under the Wrongful Conviction Act.

=== Juneal Pratt ===
In 1975 Juneal Pratt was convicted of rape, sexual assault and robbery of two sisters from Iowa in an Omaha motel. At 19 he was arrested and was picked from a lineup by the two sisters months later despite witnesses who claimed he was at home at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to 32 to 90 years in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pratt has since maintained his innocence and requested DNA testing after a 2001 Nebraska law was passed that  allows convicted felons to request DNA testing of preserved evidence if such technology was unavailable during their trial.

In [[Dvaita]] [[theology]], '''Nitya-samsarins''', as classified by [[Shri Madhvacharya]], are [[soul]]s which are [[eternity|eternally]] [[reincarnation|transmigrating]].

Madhva divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ([[Mukti-yogyas]]), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration (Nitya-samsarins), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitya-samsarins delight only in [[worldliness|worldly]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and feel no need for [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] life. By reaping the fruits of their own actions, they pass through continuous [[birth]]s and [[death]]s eternally.

'''Ousterhout's dichotomy''' is [[computer scientist]] [[John Ousterhout]]'s categorization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html |title=Scripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century |accessdate=2011-10-09 |author=Ousterhout, John |date= March 1998|work=IEEE Computer magazine |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[high-level programming language]]s tend to fall into two groups, each with distinct properties and uses: ''[[system programming]] languages'' and ''[[scripting language]]s'' – compare [[programming in the large and programming in the small]]. This distinction underlies the design of his language [[Tcl]].

System programming languages (or ''applications languages'') usually have the following properties:
* They are [[static typing|typed statically]]
* They support creating complex [[data structure]]s
* Programs in them are compiled into [[machine code]]
* Programs in them are meant to operate largely independently of other programs
System programming languages tend to be used for components and applications with large amounts of internal functionality such as operating systems, database servers, and Web browsers.  These applications typically employ complex algorithms and data structures and require high performance. Prototypical examples of system programming languages include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Modula-2]].

By contrast, scripting languages (or ''[[glue language]]s'') tend to have the following properties:
* They are [[dynamic typing|typed dynamically]]
* They have little or no provision for complex data structures
* Programs in them (''scripts'') are [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]]
Scripting languages tend to be used for applications where most of the functionality comes from other programs (often implemented in system programming languages); the scripts are used to ''glue'' together other programs or add additional layers of functionality on top of existing programs.  Ousterhout claims that scripts tend to be short and are often written by less sophisticated programmers, so execution efficiency is less important than simplicity and ease of interaction with other programs.  Common applications for scripting include Web page generation, report generation, graphical user interfaces, and system administration. Prototypical examples of scripting languages include [[AppleScript]], [[C shell]], [[DOS]] [[batch file]]s, and [[Tcl]].

==History==
The dichotomy was fully set out in {{Harvtxt|Ousterhout|1998}}, though Ousterhout had drawn this distinction since at least the design of Tcl (1988), and had stated it publicly at various times. An early episode was "[http://www.vanderburg.org/OldPages/Tcl/war/ The Tcl War]" of late September and October 1994, where [[Richard Stallman]] posted an article critical of Tcl, entitled "Why you should not use Tcl",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Why you should not use Tcl |last=Stallman |first=Richard |date=1994-09-23 |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=9409232314.AA29957@mole.gnu.ai.mit.edu |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/3JBTj5I43yAJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Ousterhout replied with an articulation of his dichotomy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Re: Why you should not use Tcl |last=Ousterhout |first=John |date=1994-09-26  |newsgroup=comp.lang.tcl |message-id=367307$1un@engnews2.Eng.Sun.COM |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.lang.tcl/7JXGt-Uxqag/vQNLEgvjmWsJ |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
I think that Stallman's objections to Tcl may stem largely from one aspect of Tcl's design that he either doesn't understand or doesn't agree with. This is the proposition that you should use *two* languages for a large software system: one, such as C or C++, for manipulating the complex internal data structures where performance is key, and another, such as Tcl, for writing small-ish scripts that tie together the C pieces and are used for extensions.}}

==Criticism==
Many {{who|date=May 2012}} believe that the dichotomy is highly arbitrary, and refer to it as ''Ousterhout's fallacy'' or ''Ousterhout's false dichotomy''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While strong-versus-weak typing, data structure complexity, and independent versus stand-alone might be said to be unrelated features, the usual critique of Ousterhout's dichotomy is of its distinction of compiling versus interpreting, since neither semantics nor syntax depend significantly on whether code is compiled into machine-language, interpreted, tokenized, or byte-compiled at the start of each run, or any mix of these. Many languages fall between being interpreted or compiled (e.g. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], [[UCSD Pascal]], [[Perl]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]). This makes compiling versus interpreting a dubious parameter in a taxonomy of programming languages.

In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of a set''' is a grouping of the set's elements into non-empty [[subset]]s, in such a way that every element is [[Collectively exhaustive events|included in one]] and [[Mutually exclusive events|only one]] of the subsets.

Every [[equivalence relation]] on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation. A set equipped with an equivalence relation or a partition is sometimes called a [[setoid]], typically in [[type theory]] and [[proof theory]].

== Definition ==
A partition of a set ''X'' is a set of [[nonempty]] [[subset]]s of ''X'' such that every element ''x'' in ''X'' is in exactly one of these subsets&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Halmos|first=Paul|title=Naive Set Theory R.|publisher=Springer|year=1960|isbn=9780387900926|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6cZBQ9qtgoC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., ''X'' is a [[disjoint union]] of the subsets).

Equivalently, a [[family of sets]] ''P'' is a partition of ''X'' if and only if all of the following conditions hold:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucas|first=John F.|title=Introduction to Abstract Mathematics|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=9780912675732|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jklsb5JUgoQC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The family ''P'' does not contain the empty set (that is &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \notin P&lt;/math&gt;).
*The [[union (set theory)|union]] of the sets in ''P'' is equal to ''X'' (that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigcup_{A\in P} A = X&lt;/math&gt;). The sets in ''P'' are said to '''cover''' ''X''.
* The [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two distinct sets in ''P'' is empty (that is &lt;math&gt;(\forall A,B \in P)\; A\neq B \implies A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;). The elements of ''P'' are said to be [[pairwise disjoint]].

The sets in ''P'' are called the ''blocks'', ''parts'' or ''cells'' of the partition.{{sfn|Brualdi|2004|pp=44–45}}

The '''rank''' of ''P'' is |''X''| &amp;minus; |''P''|, if ''X'' is finite.

== Examples ==
*The [[empty set]] &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one partition, namely &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
*For any nonempty set ''X'', ''P'' = {''X''} is a partition of ''X'', called the '''trivial partition'''.
**Particularly, every [[singleton set]] {''x''} has exactly one partition, namely { {''x''} }.
*For any non-empty [[proper subset]] ''A'' of a set ''U'', the set ''A'' together with its [[complement (set theory)|complement]] form a partition of ''U'', namely, {''A'', ''U'' \ ''A''}.
*The set { 1, 2, 3 } has these five partitions (one partition per item):
** { {1}, {2}, {3} }, sometimes written 1|2|3.
** { {1, 2}, {3} }, or 12|3.
** { {1, 3}, {2} }, or 13|2.
** { {1}, {2, 3} }, or 1|23.
** { {1, 2, 3} }, or 123 (in contexts where there will be no confusion with the number).
*The following are not partitions of { 1, 2, 3 }:
** { {}, {1, 3}, {2} } is not a partition (of any set) because one of its elements is the [[empty set]].
** { {1, 2}, {2, 3} } is not a partition (of any set) because the element 2 is contained in more than one block.
** { {1}, {2} } is not a partition of {1, 2, 3} because none of its blocks contains 3; however, it is a partition of {1, 2}.

== Partitions and equivalence relations ==
For any [[equivalence relation]] on a set ''X'', the set of its [[equivalence class]]es is a partition of ''X''. Conversely, from any partition ''P'' of ''X'', we can define an equivalence relation on ''X'' by setting {{nowrap|''x'' ~ ''y''}} precisely when ''x'' and ''y'' are in the same part in ''P''. Thus the notions of equivalence relation and partition are essentially equivalent.{{sfn|Schechter|1997|p=54}}

The [[axiom of choice]] guarantees for any partition of a set ''X'' the existence of a subset of ''X'' containing exactly one element from each part of the partition. This implies that given an equivalence relation on a set one can select a canonical representative element from every equivalence class.

== Refinement of partitions ==
[[File:Set partitions 4; Hasse; circles.svg|thumb|left|300px|Partitions of a 4-set ordered by [[Partition refinement|refinement]]]]
A partition ''α'' of a set ''X'' is a '''refinement''' of a partition ''ρ'' of ''X''—and we say that ''α'' is ''finer'' than ''ρ'' and that ''ρ'' is ''coarser'' than ''α''—if every element of ''α'' is a subset of some element of ''ρ''. Informally, this means that ''α'' is a further fragmentation of ''ρ''.  In that case, it is written that ''α'' ≤ ''ρ''.

This ''finer-than'' relation on the set of partitions of ''X'' is a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] (so the notation "≤" is appropriate). Each set of elements has a [[least upper bound]] and a [[greatest lower bound]], so that it forms a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], and more specifically (for partitions of a finite set) it is a [[geometric lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lattice Theory|volume=25|series=Colloquium Publications|publisher=American Mathematical Society|first=Garrett|last=Birkhoff|authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff|edition=3rd|year=1995|isbn=9780821810255|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y8d-MdtVwkC&amp;pg=PA95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''partition lattice'' of a 4-element set has 15 elements and is depicted in the [[Hasse diagram]] on the left.

Based on the [[cryptomorphism]] between geometric lattices and [[matroid]]s, this lattice of partitions of a finite set corresponds to a matroid in which the base set of the matroid consists of the [[Atom (order theory)|atoms]] of the lattice, namely, the partitions with &lt;math&gt;n-2&lt;/math&gt; singleton sets and one two-element set. These atomic partitions correspond one-for-one with the edges of a [[complete graph]]. The [[Matroid#Closure operators|matroid closure]] of a set of atomic partitions is the finest common coarsening of them all; in graph-theoretic terms, it is the partition of the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the complete graph into the [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the subgraph formed by the given set of edges. In this way, the lattice of partitions corresponds to the lattice of flats of the [[graphic matroid]] of the complete graph.

Another example illustrates the refining of partitions from the perspective of equivalence relations. If ''D'' is the set of cards in a standard 52-card deck, the ''same-color-as'' relation on ''D'' – which can be denoted ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; – has two equivalence classes: the sets {red cards} and {black cards}.  The 2-part partition corresponding to ~&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; has a refinement that yields the ''same-suit-as'' relation ~&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, which has the four equivalence classes {spades}, {diamonds}, {hearts}, and {clubs}.

==Noncrossing partitions==
A partition of the set ''N'' = {1, 2, ..., ''n''} with corresponding equivalence relation ~ is '''[[noncrossing partition|noncrossing]]''' if it has the following property: If four elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' of ''N'' having ''a'' &lt; ''b'' &lt; ''c'' &lt; ''d'' satisfy ''a'' ~ ''c'' and ''b'' ~ ''d'', then ''a'' ~ ''b'' ~ ''c'' ~ ''d''. The name comes from the following equivalent definition: Imagine the elements 1, 2, ..., ''n'' of ''N'' drawn as the ''n'' vertices of a regular ''n''-gon (in counterclockwise order). A partition can then be visualized by drawing each block as a polygon (whose vertices are the elements of the block). The partition is then noncrossing if and only if these polygons do not intersect.

The lattice of noncrossing partitions of a finite set has recently taken on importance because of its role in [[free probability]] theory.  These form a subset of the lattice of all partitions, but not a sublattice, since the join operations of the two lattices do not agree.

== Counting partitions ==
The total number of partitions of an ''n''-element set is the [[Bell numbers|Bell number]] ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first several Bell numbers are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1,
''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 15, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 52, and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 203 {{OEIS|A000110}}. Bell numbers satisfy the [[recursion]]

: &lt;math&gt;B_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k} B_k&lt;/math&gt;

and have the [[generating function|exponential generating function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{B_n}{n!}z^n=e^{e^z-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:BellNumberAnimated.gif|right|thumb|Construction of the [[Bell triangle]]]]
The Bell numbers may also be computed using the [[Bell triangle]]
in which the first value in each row is copied from the end of the previous row, and subsequent values are computed by adding two numbers, the number to the left and the number to the above left of the position. The Bell numbers are repeated along both sides of this triangle. The numbers within the triangle count partitions in which a given element is the largest [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]].

The number of partitions of an ''n''-element set into exactly ''k'' nonempty parts is the [[Stirling number of the second kind]] ''S''(''n'', ''k'').

The number of [[noncrossing partition]]s of an ''n''-element set is the [[Catalan number]] ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', given by

:&lt;math&gt;C_n={1 \over n+1}{2n \choose n}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">'''Pirate utopias''' were defined by [[anarchist]] writer [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]], who coined the term in his 1995 book ''Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes'' as secret islands once used for supply purposes by [[pirate]]s. Wilson's concept is largely based on speculation, although he admits to adding a bit of fantasy to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Lamborn Wilson |url=http://hermetic.com/bey/pirate-utopias/pirate-utopias.html |title=Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs &amp; European Renegadoes |publisher=[[Autonomedia]]|ISBN=1-57027-158-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wilson's view, these pirate enclaves were early forms of autonomous proto-[[anarchism|anarchist]] societies in that they operated beyond the reach of [[government]]s and embraced unrestricted [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

== On the Barbary Coast ==
Located on the [[Barbary Coast]] ([[Salé]], [[Algiers]] and [[Tunis]]), these bases were havens for renegade [[Muslim]] pirates from the 16th to the 18th century. The pirates, dubbed "[[Barbary Corsairs]]", ravaged European shipping operations and enslaved many thousands of captives. However, thousands of Europeans also converted to Islam, forming the "Renegados" and joining the pirate [[religious war|holy war]]. Wilson writes that these men and women were not only [[Apostasy|apostates]] and [[Treason|traitors]], as they were considered in their homelands, but their voluntary betrayal of [[Christendom]] can also be thought of as a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] of social resistance.  Wilson focuses on the Pirate [[Republic of Salé]], in 17th century Morocco, which may have had its own lingua franca. Like some other pirate states, it even used to pass treaties from time to time with some European countries, agreeing not to attack their fleets. Wilson/Bey's idea of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s developed from his historical review of pirate utopias. When describing them Wilson says "We've certainly had to use our imagination more than a "real" historian would allow, erecting a lot of suppositions on a shaky framework of generalizations, and adding a touch of fantasy (and what [[Pirate studies|piratologist]] has ever been able to resist fantasy?). I can only say that I've satisfied my own curiosity at least to this extent: That something like a [[Renegado]] culture could have existed; that all the ingredients for it were present, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguous]], and [[Synchronicity|synchronic]]."

==Libertatia==
{{mainarticle|Libertatia}}
[[Libertatia]] (also known as Libertalia) was a possibly fictional anarchist colony founded in the late 17th century in [[Madagascar]] by [[pirate]]s under the leadership of Captain James Misson. Whether or not Libertatia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' by [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Captain Charles Johnson]], an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a [[pseudonym]] of [[Daniel Defoe]]. Much of the book is a mixture of fact and fiction, and it is possible the account of Libertatia is entirely fabricated.

According to Johnson's description, Libertatia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known, however, most sources say it stretched from the [[Bay of Antongil]] to [[Mananjary, Fianarantsoa|Mananjary]], including [[Île Sainte Marie]] and [[Mahavelona|Foulpointe]]. [[Thomas Tew]], Misson, and an Italian Dominican priest named Caraccioli were involved in founding it.

== In literature and popular culture ==
''[[Cities of the Red Night]]'', a novel by American author [[William S. Burroughs]], revolves around a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by [[Libertatia|Captain James Misson]].

The attempted establishment of a [[Republic of Pirates]] utopia (free from either British or Spanish rule) is a significant plot element in the [[Ubisoft]] video game ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''.

In the movie ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End]]'' the main characters gather at "Shipwreck Cove", a city built out of wrecked ships and constructed platforms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.ign.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-men-tell-no-tales/106716/feature/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-story-so-far|title=Pirates of the Caribbean: The Story So Far|author=|date=17 May 2017|website=ign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertalia is also a central plot element and setting in the video game ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]''. However, in this interpretation, Libertalia was founded by the pirate [[Henry Avery]] and others including Tew, [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Edward England]].

The 2015 video game ''[[Fallout 4]]'' features an area in the game called Libertalia. The area is a series of off-shore platforms (made of various debris) that has become home to a large gang of raiders.

A '''price signal''' is [[information]] conveyed to [[consumer]]s and [[production (economics)|producer]]s, via the price charged for a [[commodity|product or service]], which provides a signal to increase or decrease supply or demand. The information carried by prices is an essential function in the fundamental coordination of an economic system, coordinating things such as what has to be produced, how to produce it and what resources use in its production. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Perfect competition==
In [[neoclassical economics|mainstream (neoclassical) economics]], under [[perfect competition]] [[relative prices]] signal to producers and consumers what [[production (economics)|production]] or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] decisions will contribute to [[allocative efficiency]].

== Pricing power ==
Alternative theories include that prices reflect relative [[pricing power]] of producers and consumers. A [[monopoly]] may set prices so as to maximize [[monopoly profit]], while a [[cartel]] may engage in [[price fixing]]. Conversely, on the consumer side, a [[monopsony]] may negotiate or demand prices that do not reflect the cost of production.

== Value ==
{{main|Theory of value (economics)}}
A long thread in economics (from [[Aristotle]] to [[classical economics]] to the present) distinguishes between [[exchange value]], [[use value]], price, and (sometimes) intrinsic [[Value (economics)|value]]. It is frequently argued that the connection between price and other types of value is not as direct as suggested in the theory of price signals, other considerations playing a part.

== Speculation ==
Financial [[speculation]], particularly buying or selling assets with borrowed money, can move prices away from their [[fundamental analysis|economic fundamentals]]. [[Credit bubble]]s can sometimes distort the price signal mechanism, causing large-scale malinvestment and [[financial crises]]. Adherents of the [[Austrian economics]] attribute this phenomenon to the interference of [[central bank]]ers, which they propose to eliminate by introducing [[full-reserve banking]]. [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian economists]], such as [[Hyman Minsky]], have described it as a fundamental flaw of [[capitalism]], corrected by [[financial regulation]]. Both schools have been the subject of renewed attention in the Western world since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]].{{cn|date=December 2015}}

== Price discrimination ==
Firms use [[price discrimination]] to increase profits by charging different prices to different consumers or groups of consumers. Price discrimination may be regarded as an unfair practice used to drive out competitors

A '''prisoner''', (also known as an '''inmate''' or '''detainee''') is a person who is deprived of liberty against his or her will. This can be by confinement, captivity, or by forcible restraint. The term applies particularly to serving a [[prison sentence]] in a [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prisoner |title=Prisoner - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term does not apply to [[Defendant#Criminal defendants|defendants]] who are [[pre-trial]].

==English law==
"Prisoner" is a legal term for a person who is [[Imprisonment|imprisoned]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rastell]]. [[Termes de la Ley]]. 1636. Page 202. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA202-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Digital copy] from [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 1 of the [[Prison Security Act 1992]], the word "prisoner" means any person for the time being in a [[Prison#United Kingdom|prison]] as a result of any requirement imposed by a court or otherwise that he be detained in [[legal custody]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prison Security Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/25/section/1 section 1(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Prisoner" was a legal term for a person prosecuted for [[felony]]. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for [[misdemeanour]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. A First Book of English Law. [[Sweet and Maxwell]]. Fourth Edition. 1960. Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour by section 1 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] has rendered this distinction obsolete.

Glanville Williams described as "invidious" the practice of using the term "prisoner" in reference to a person who had not been convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 3, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cornelis De Wael - To Visit the Imprisoned - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|''To Visit the Imprisoned'' by Flemish artist [[Cornelis de Wael]] c. 1640]]
The earliest evidence of the existence of the prisoner dates back to 8,000 BC from prehistoric graves in [[Lower Egypt]]. This evidence suggests that people from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] enslaved a [[Bushmen|San]]-like tribe.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh: ''The Slave Trade'' Simon and Schuster; Rockefeller Centre; New York, New York; 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
===In solitary confinement===
Among the most extreme adverse effects suffered by prisoners, appear to be caused by [[solitary confinement]] for long durations. When held in "Special Housing Units" (SHU), prisoners are subject to [[sensory deprivation]] and lack of social contact that can have a severe negative impact on their mental health.

Long durations may lead to depression and changes to brain physiology. In the absence of a social context that is needed to validate perceptions of their environment, prisoners become highly malleable, abnormally sensitive, and exhibit increased vulnerability to the influence of those controlling their environment. Social connection and the support provided from social interaction are prerequisite to long-term social adjustment as a prisoner.

Prisoners exhibit the paradoxical effect of social withdrawal after long periods of solitary confinement. A shift takes place from a craving for greater social contact, to a fear of it. They may grow lethargic and apathetic, and no longer be able to control their own conduct when released from solitary confinement. They can come to depend upon the prison structure to control and limit their conduct.

Long-term stays in solitary confinement can cause prisoners to develop clinical depression, and long-term impulse control disorder. Those with pre-existing mental illnesses are at a higher risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Some common behaviours are self-mutilation, suicidal tendencies, and psychosis.

A psychopathological condition identified as "SHU syndrome" has been observed among such prisoners. Symptoms are characterized as problems with concentration and memory, distortions of perception, and hallucinations. Most convicts suffering from SHU syndrome exhibit extreme generalized anxiety and panic disorder, with some suffering amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622 |author=Bruce A.

The psychological syndrome known as [[Stockholm syndrome]], describes a paradoxical phenomenon where, over time, hostages develop positive feelings towards their captors.

==Inmate culture==
The founding of ethnographic prison sociology as a discipline, from which most of the meaningful knowledge of prison life and culture stems, is commonly credited to the publication of two key texts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simon|first=Jonathan|title=The `Society of Captives' in the Era of Hyper-Incarceration|journal=Theoretical Criminology|date=1 August 2000|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1177/1362480600004003003|page=287}} {{cite journal |last=Crewe|first=Ben|title=Male prisoners’ orientations towards female officers in an English prison|journal=[[Punishment &amp; Society]]|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=395–421|doi=10.1177/1462474506067565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Clemmer's ''The Prison Community'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=The Prison Community|year=1940|publisher=Holt, Rhineheart and Winston|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first published in 1940 and republished in 1958; and Gresham Sykes classic study ''The Society of Captives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sykes|first=Gresham M.|title=The Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison|year=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_YjooNYRMQQC|isbn=0691130647}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also published in 1958. Clemmer's text, based on his study of 2,400 convicts over three years at the Menard Branch of the Illinois State Penitentiary where he worked as a clinical sociologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=Leadership Phenomena in a Prison Community|journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]]|date=Mar–Apr 1938|volume=28|issue=6|page=861 n. 1|doi=10.2307/1136755|jstor=1136755}}&lt;/ref&gt; propagated the notion of the existence of a distinct inmate culture and society with values and norms antithetical to both the prison authority and the wider society.
[[File:The Bashful Model.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A scene in [[Newgate Prison]], London]]

In this world, for Clemmer, these values, formalized as the "inmate code", provided behavioural precepts that unified prisoners and fostered antagonism to prison officers and the prison institution as a whole. The process whereby inmates acquired this set of values and behavioural guidelines as they adapted to prison life he termed "prisonization", which he defined as the "taking on, in greater or lesser degree, the folkways, mores, customs and general culture of the penitentiary'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeRosia|first=Victoria R.|title=Living Inside Prison Walls: Adjustment Behavior|year=1998|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95895-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-m-b-IgbM4C&amp;pg=PA23|edition=1. publ.|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Clemmer argued that all prisoners experienced some degree of prisonization this was not a uniform process and factors such as the extent to which a prisoner involved himself in primary group relations in the prison and the degree to which he identified with the external society all had a considerable impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faine|first=John R.|title=A self-consistency approach to prisonization|journal=Sociological Quarterly|date=Autumn 1973|volume=14|issue=4|page=576|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb01392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisonization as the inculcation of a convict culture was defined by identification with primary groups in prison, the use of prison slang and argot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollack|first=Joycelyn M.|title=Prisons: Today and Tomorrow|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers Inc.|location=Ontario|isbn=0-7637-2904-3|pages=95–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsQtASGLeZUC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of specified rituals and a hostility to prison authority in contrast to inmate solidarity and was asserted by Clemmer to create individuals who were acculturated into a criminal and deviant way of life that stymied all attempts to reform their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bright|first=Charles|title=The Powers that Punish : Prison and Politics in the Era of the "Big House," 1920-2009|year=1996|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=0-472-10732-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9c2qHtsxUYC&amp;pg=PA6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposed to these theories, several European sociologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mathiesen]], T. (1965) The Defences of the Weak: a Study of Norwegian Correctional Institution, London: Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that inmates were often fragmented and the links they have with society are often stronger than those forged in prison, particularly through the action of work on time perception&lt;ref&gt;Guilbaud, Fabrice (2010) "Working in Prison: Time as Experienced by Inmate-Workers", ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40033161]'' '''51'''-Annual English Selection-Supplement, p. 41-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict code===
[[File:Inmates Orleans Parish Prison.jpg|thumb|Inmates in a prison yard]]
The convict code was theorized as a set of tacit behavioural norms which exercised a pervasive impact on the conduct of prisoners. Competency in following the routines demanded by the code partly determined the inmate’s identity as a convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson|first1=Rod|last2=Sharrock|first2=Wes|title=Conversational actions and organizational actions|volume=8|issue=2|year=1990|page=26|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547/article_reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a set of values and behavioural guidelines, the convict code referred to the behaviour of inmates in antagonising staff members and to the mutual solidarity between inmates as well as the tendency to the non-disclosure to prison authorities of prisoner activities and to resistance to rehabilitation programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brannigan|first=Augustine|title=Review: D. Lawrence Wieder, ''Language and Social Reality: The Case of Telling the Convict Code''|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|date=May 1976|page=349|doi=10.2307/2064132|jstor=2064132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was seen as providing an expression and form of communal resistance and allowed for the psychological survival of the individual under extremely repressive and regimented systems of carceral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colvin|first=Mark|title=Review: David Ward. ''Alcatraz: The Gangster Years''|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=115|issue=1|date=February 2010|page=247|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.1.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sykes outlined some of the most salient points of this code as it applied in the post-war period in the United States:

{{further|Human rights in the United States#Prison system}}
[[File:Punishment of the Paddle, 1912.jpg|thumb|230px|1912 illustration of an inmate being punished in an American prison]]
Both federal and state laws govern the rights of prisoners. Prisoners in the United States do not have full rights under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], however, they are protected by [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment VIII]] which prohibits [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/prisoners_rights |title=Prisoners' rights &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing research associates education with a number of positive outcomes for prisoners, the institution, and society. Although at the time of the ban’s enactment there was limited knowledge about the relationship between education and recidivism, there is growing merit to idea that education in prison is a preventative to re-incarceration. Several studies help illustrate the point. For example, one study in 1997 that focused on 3,200 prisoners in Maryland, Minnesota, and Ohio, showed that simply attending school behind bars reduced the likelihood of re-incarceration by 29 percent. In 2000, the Texas Department of Education conducted a longitudinal study of 883 men and women who earned college degrees while incarcerated, finding recidivism rates between 27.2 percent (completion of an AA degree) and 7.8 percent (completion of a BA degree), compared to a system-wide recidivism rate between 40 and 43 percent.10 One report, sponsored by the Correctional Education Association, focused on recidivism in three states, concluding that education prevented crime. More recently, a 2013 Department of Justice funded study from the RAND Corporation found that incarcerated individuals who participated in correctional education were 43% less likely to return to prison within 3 years than prisoners who did not participate in such programs. The research implies that education has the potential to impact recidivism rates positively by lowering them.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt, Restoring Pell Grants for Prisoners- Growing Momentum for Reform http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2814358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*[[Civilian internee]]s are [[civilians]] who are detained by a party to a [[war]] for security reasons. They can either be friendly, neutral, or enemy nationals.
*[[Convicts]] are prisoners that are incarcerated under the legal system. In the [[United States]], a [[federal inmate]] is a person convicted of violating [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal law]], who is then incarcerated at a federal prison that exclusively houses similar criminals. The term most often applies to those convicted of a [[felony]].
*[[Detainees]] is a frequent term used by certain governments to refer to individuals who are held in custody and are not liable to be classified and treated under the law as either [[prisoners of war]] or [[suspect]]s in [[criminal]] cases. It is generally defined with the broad definition: "someone held in custody".
*[[Hostage]]s are historically defined as prisoners held as security for the fulfillment of an agreement, or as a deterrent against an act of war. In modern times, it refers to someone who is seized by a criminal abductor.
*[[Prisoners of war]], also known as a POWs, are individuals incarcerated in relation to [[wars]]. They can be either [[civilian]]s affiliated with [[combatants]], or combatants acting within the bounds of the [[laws and customs of war]].
*[[Political prisoner]]s describe those imprisoned for participation or connection to political activity. Such inmates challenge the legitimacy of the detention.
*[[Slaves]] are prisoners that are held captive for their use as labourers. Various methods have been used throughout history to deprive slaves of their liberty, including forcible restraint.
*[[Prisoner of conscience]] are anyone imprisoned because of their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], religion, or political views.

Other types of prisoners can include those under police [[arrest]], [[house arrest]], those in [[psychiatric institution]]s, [[internment camp]]s, and peoples restricted to a specific area such as Jews in the [[Warsaw ghetto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12691">'''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies''' (PET) are the methods of [[Data Protection|protecting data]] in accordance with the law. PET allow [[User (computing)|online users]] to protect the [[data privacy|privacy]] of their [[personally identifiable information]] (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PET uses techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|van Blarkom|Borking|Olk|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals of PETs==
The objective of PETs is to protect personal data and ensure the users of technology that their information is confidential and management of data protection is a priority to the organizations who withhold responsibility for any [[Personally identifiable information|PII]] - allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users.

The goal of privacy-enhancing technologies include increasing control over personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users)([[Informational self-determination|self-determination]]). PETs aim to minimize personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants, use [[Pseudonym|pseudonyms]] or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity, and strive to achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision/ Vision on privacy enhanced identity management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011000720/https://www.prime-project.eu/about/vision |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualized agreements through the ongoing choice among service alternatives, therefore providing the possibility to negotiate the terms and conditions of giving personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation). Within private negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy-negotiations.de Key Facts on Privacy Negotiations]&lt;/ref&gt;

PETs provide the possibility to remotely audit the enforcement of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance), allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions, and facilitate the use of their legal rights of data inspection, correction and deletion.

==Existing PETs==
Examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are:
* '''[[Anonymizer|Communication anonymizers]]''' hiding the real online identity (email address, IP address, etc.) and replacing it with a non-traceable identity (disposable / one-time email address, random IP address of hosts participating in an anonymising network, pseudonym, etc.). They can be applied to email, Web browsing, [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] networking, [[Voice over IP|VoIP]], Chat, instant messaging, etc.
* '''Shared bogus online accounts'''. One person creates an account for MSN, providing bogus data for Name, address, phone number, preferences, life situation etc. They then publish their user-IDs and passwords on the Internet. Everybody can now use this account comfortably. Thereby the user is sure that there is no personal data about him or her in the account profile. (Moreover, he is freed from the hassle of having to register at the site himself.)
*  '''Obfuscation''' refers to the many practices of adding distracting or misleading data to a log or profile, which may be especially useful for frustrating precision analytics after data has already been lost or disclosed. Its effectiveness against humans is questioned, but it has greater promise against shallow algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/obfuscation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8328401/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Access to personal data''': The service provider's infrastructure allows users to inspect, correct or delete all their data stored at the service provider.
*'''[[Enhanced privacy ID]] (EPID)''' is a [[Digital Signature Algorithm|digital signature algorithm]] supporting anonymity. Unlike traditional digital signature algorithms (e.g., [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]), in which each entity has a unique public verification key and a unique private signature key, EPID provides a common group public verification key associated with many of unique private signature keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/PEC2011/presentations2011/brickell.pdf|title=Enhanced Privacy Id|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPID was created so that a device could prove to an external party what kind of device it is (and optionally what software is running on the device) without needing to also reveal exact identity, i.e., to prove you are an authentic member of a group without revealing ''which'' member. It has been in use since 2008.

==Future PETs==
Examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed include&lt;ref&gt;The EU PRIME research project's [https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf White Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817132944/https://www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V2.pdf |date=2007-08-17 }} (Version 2)&lt;/ref&gt; limited disclosure technology, anonymous credentials such as online car rental, negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions, and data transaction log. '''Limited disclosure technology''' provides a way of protecting individuals' privacy by allowing them to share only enough personal information with service providers to complete an interaction or transaction. This technology is also designed to limit tracking and correlation of users’ interactions with these third parties. Limited disclosure uses [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] techniques and allows users to retrieve data that is vetted by a provider, to transmit that data to a relying party, and have these relying parties trust the authenticity and integrity of the data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/limited-disclosure-technology Gartner IT Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Anonymous credentials''' are asserted properties or rights of the [[credential]] holder that don't reveal the true identity of the holder; the only information revealed is what the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user himself/herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example:

'''Online car rental'''. The car rental agency doesn't need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a drivers license, [[health insurance]] (i.e. for accidents, etc.), and that the customer is paying. Thus there is no real need to know the customers name nor their address or any other [[personal information]]. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimization), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and [[credit card number]], provides the following credentials, all issued to [[pseudonym]]s (i.e. not to the real name of the customer):
* An assertion of minimal age, issued by the state, proving that the holder is older than 23 (note: the actual age is not provided)
* A [[driving licence]], i.e. an assertion, issued by the motor vehicle control agency, that the holder is entitled to drive cars
* A [[proof of insurance]], issued by the health insurance
* Digital cash
'''Negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions'''. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on [[Trusted computing]] modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse [[personal data]], users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spdp.di.unimi.it/papers/samarati-ifip06.pdf|title=Enhancing User Privacy Through Data Handling Policies|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|publisher=|access-date=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the '''data transaction log''' allows users the ability to log the personal data they send to service provider(s), the time in which they do it, and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], which is a pre-requisite of being in control.

'''Public Netbase''' was a cultural media initiative, open access internet platform, and advocate for the development of electronic art. The project increasingly came into conflict with the Austrian political establishment{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} during the 1990s. It received awards and recognition by [[UNESCO]].

==Early development==
Public Netbase was founded by [[Konrad Becker]] and Francisco de Sousa Webber in Vienna's Messepalast (later renamed to [[Museumsquartier]]) in 1994 as a non-profit internet provider and a platform for the participatory use and critical analyses of information and communication technology. Its parent organization was the ''Institute for New Culture Technologies-t0'', founded in 1993.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | title=About Public Netbase / t0 |url=http://www.netbase.org/t0/about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the Institute's activities after 1994 occurred through Public Netbase, leading to the names and establishment dates being loosely applied, even in the organization's official material. The name of its [[World Wide Web]] server, ''t0'', was often appended to either name as well. During the first years of its existence, Public Netbase shared a space in [[Museumsquartier]] with the initiative ''Depot – Kunst und Diskussion''.&lt;ref&gt;http://depot.or.at/index.php?article_id=1&amp;clang=1. Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; After it relocated to own rooms (also in [[Museumsquartier]]), the number of wokshops and instruction courses increased and the program of discursive events was now realized on an almost daily basis.

==Art and culture==
[[Image:Netbase 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2]]
Public Netbase focused on aiding the development of electronic art and the impact of the nascent World Wide Web on culture.  Its own online presence earned it an award for distinction at the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Prix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prix Ars Electronica 1995 World Wide Web Distinction |url=http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528# |accessdate=2006-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129084500/http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_projekt.asp?iProjectID=2528 |archivedate=November 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the web space provided through Public Netbase supported Austrian artists, although some hosted projects, such as the [[Transformation Story Archive]], had wider recognition.  The physical location in the Museumsquartier was also used for sponsored events, ranging from art symposia to a conference of the [[Association of Autonomous Astronauts]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Association of Autonomous Astronauts' Intergalactic Conference in Vienna, Earth, June 21-22 1997 |date=1997-06-06 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1274&amp;page=1#660 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a "lecture/performance/event" by [[Critical Art Ensemble]] about biotechnology &lt;ref name="CAE"&gt;{{cite press release |title=FLESH MACHINE: A Genexploitation Project |date=1997-11-17 |url=http://www.rhizome.org/thread.rhiz?thread=1475&amp;page=1#940 |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of conferences/exhibitions such as ROBOTRONIKA&lt;ref&gt;http://robot.t0.or.at/ Retrieved 2013-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; (1998) and SYNWORLD&lt;ref name="synworld.t0.or.at"&gt;http://synworld.t0.or.at/.

==Involvement in politics==
When the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPÖ) and its leader [[Jörg Haider]] began to rise in power in Austria, Public Netbase took an increasingly political activist role while facing increasing government pressure.  Haider accused Public Netbase of sponsoring child pornography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.medialounge.net/lounge/workspace/crashhtml/cc/29.htm| publisher=Crash Media| title=Sex slaves to public opinion - Public Netbase kicks back...| first=Micz| last= Flor| date=1998-11-27| accessdate=2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conflated Christina Göstl's hosted erotic art with a commercial porn site run from the British Virgin Islands during a speech in parliament.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | publisher=Salon | title=Is it Sex or is it Art? | first=Janelle | last=Brown | date=1998-09-06 | accessdate=2006-10-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901125303/http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/06feature.html | archivedate=2006-09-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Public Netbase sponsored a "virtual alternative to Austria's far right government" that offered Austrian Web Resistance Awards to web sites dedicated to opposing Haider's government.&lt;ref name="GAA"&gt;{{cite web |title=About government-austria.at |url=http://government-austria.at/index.php3?lang=&amp;menuid=about |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the organization's successes were insufficient to stave off problems.  Its lease at the Museumsquartier was not renewed after the controversial remodelling period in 2000,&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wassermair |first=M. |title='In Austria, the Clock Ticks with a Different Beat': Short Story of Public Netbase t0, its International Success and Recent Political Struggles |journal=Cultivate Interactive |issue=2 |date=2000-10-16 |issn=1471-3225 |url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue2/netbase/ |accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it faced a series of audits and other bureaucratic obstacles.

'''Sensemaking''' is the process by which people give [[semantics|meaning]] to their collective experiences. It is often formally defined as "the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing" ([[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 2005, p. 409]]). The concept was introduced to [[organizational studies]] by [[Karl E. Weick]] in the 1970s and has affected both theory and practice. The concept was intended to encourage a shift away from the traditional focus of organization theorists on [[decision-making]] and towards the processes that constitute the meaning of the decisions that are enacted in behavior.

==Roots in social psychology==

In 1966, [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and [[Robert L. Kahn]] published their highly influential book ''The Social Psychology of Organizations'' ([[#Reference-Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. 1966|Katz &amp; Kahn, 1966]]). In 1969, Karl Weick played on this title in his seminal ''The Social Psychology of Organizing'', shifting the focus from organizations as entities to organiz''ing'' as an activity. It was especially the second edition, published ten years later ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1979|Weick, 1979]]) that established Weick's approach in organization studies.

==Properties==

Weick identified seven properties of sensemaking ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]):

# ''Identity'' and identification is central&amp;nbsp;– who people think they are in their context shapes what they enact and how they interpret events ([[#Reference-Pratt, M.G. 2000|Pratt, 2000]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, et al., 2005]]; [[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 2009|Watson, 2009]]).
# ''Retrospection'' provides the opportunity for sensemaking: the point of retrospection in time affects what people notice ([[#Reference-Dunford, R., &amp; Jones, D. 2000|Dunford &amp; Jones, 2000]]), thus attention and interruptions to that attention are highly relevant to the process ([[#Reference-Gephart, R. P. 1993|Gephart, 1993]]).
# People ''enact'' the environments they face in dialogues and narratives ([[#Reference-Bruner, J. 1991|Bruner, 1991]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1998|Watson, 1998]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]). As people speak, and build narrative accounts, it helps them understand what they think, organize their experiences and control and predict events ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]) and reduce complexity in the context of change management ([[#Reference-Kumar, P. and Singhal, M. 2012|Kumar &amp; Singhal, 2012]]).
# Sensemaking is a ''social'' activity in that plausible stories are preserved, retained or shared ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Maitlis, S. 2005|Maitlis, 2005]]). However, the audience for sensemaking includes the speakers themselves ([[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1995|Watson, 1995]]) and the narratives are "both individual and shared...an evolving product of conversations with ourselves and with others" ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]: 565).
# Sensemaking is ''ongoing'', so Individuals simultaneously shape and react to the environments they face. As they project themselves onto this environment and observe the consequences they learn about their identities and the accuracy of their accounts of the world ([[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]). This is a feedback process so even as individuals deduce their identity from the behaviour of others towards them, they also try to influence this behaviour. As Weick argued, "The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]: 635).
# People ''extract cues'' from the context to help them decide on what information is relevant and what explanations are acceptable ([[#Reference-Salancick, G., &amp; Pfeffer, J. 1978|Salancick &amp; Pfeffer, 1978]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D., Stacey, P., &amp; Nandhakumar, J. 2007|Brown, Stacey, &amp; Nandhakumar, 2007]]). Extracted cues provide points of reference for linking ideas to broader networks of meaning and are 'simple, familiar structures that are seeds from which people develop a larger sense of what may be occurring." ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 50).
# People favour ''plausibility over accuracy'' in accounts of events and contexts ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D. 2005|Brown, 2005]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]): "in an equivocal, postmodern world, infused with the politics of interpretation and conflicting interests and inhabited by people with multiple shifting identities, an obsession with accuracy seems fruitless, and not of much practical help, either" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 61).

Each of these seven aspects interact and intertwine as individuals interpret events. Their interpretations become evident through [[narrative]]s&amp;nbsp;– written and spoken&amp;nbsp;– which convey the sense they have made of events ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]), as well as through [[diagrammatic reasoning]] and associated material practices ([[#Reference-Huff, A. S. 1990|Huff, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Stigliani, I., &amp; Ravasi, D. 2012|Stigliani &amp; Ravasi, 2012]]).

==From decision-making to sensemaking==

The rise of the sensemaking perspective marks a shift of focus in organization studies from how decisions shape organizations to how meaning drives organizing ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]). The aim was to focus attention on the largely cognitive activity of framing experienced situations as meaningful. It is a collaborative process of creating shared awareness and understanding out of different individuals' perspectives and varied interests.

==From planning to action==

Sensemaking scholars are less interested in the intricacies of planning than in the details of action ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995, p. 55]]).

==Uncertainty, ambiguity, and crisis==
The sensemaking approach is often used to provide insight into factors that surface as organizations address either uncertain or ambiguous situations ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1988|Weick 1988]], [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|1993]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick et al., 2005]]). Beginning in the 1980s with an influential re-analysis of the Bhopal disaster, Weick's name has come to be associated with the study of the situated sensemaking that influences the outcomes of disasters ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick 1993]]).

== Categories and related concepts ==

A 2014 review of the literature on sensemaking in organizations identified a dozen different categories of sensemaking and a half-dozen sensemaking related concepts ([[#Reference-Maitlis, S. &amp; Christianson, M. 2014|Maitlis &amp; Christianson, 2014]]). The categories of sensemaking included: constituent-minded, cultural, ecological, environmental, future-oriented, intercultural, interpersonal, market, political, prosocial, prospective, and resourceful. The sensemaking-related concepts included: sensebreaking, sensedemanding, sense-exchanging, sensegiving, sensehiding, and sense specification.

==Other applications==

Sensemaking is central to the conceptual framework for military [[network-centric operations]] (NCO) espoused by the [[United States Department of Defense]] ([[#Reference-Garstka, J. and Alberts, D. 2004|Garstka and Alberts, 2004]]). In a joint/coalition military environment, sensemaking is complicated by numerous technical, social, organizational, cultural, and operational factors. A central hypothesis of NCO is that the quality of shared sensemaking and collaboration will be better in a "robustly networked" force than in a platform-centric force, empowering people to make better decisions. According to NCO theory, there is a mutually-reinforcing relationship among and between individual sensemaking, shared sensemaking, and collaboration.

In defense applications, sensemaking theorists have primarily focused on how shared awareness and understanding are developed within [[command and control]] organizations at the operational level. At the tactical level, individuals monitor and assess their immediate physical environment in order to predict where different elements will be in the next moment. At the operational level, where the situation is far broader, more complex and more uncertain, and evolves over hours and days, the organization must collectively make sense of enemy dispositions, [[intention]]s and capabilities, as well as anticipate the (often unintended) effects of own-force actions on a complex [[system of systems]].

Sensemaking has been studied in the patient safety literature ([[#Reference-Battles, et al. 2006|Battles, et al. 2006]]). It has been used as a conceptual framework for identifying and detecting high risk patient situations. For example, [[#Reference-Rhodes, et al. 2015|Rhodes, et al. (2015)]] examined sensemaking and the co-production of safety of primary medical care patients. A [[Configurational analysis|configurational approach]] in the form of [[Qualitative comparative analysis|QCA]] has been proposed by Sukhov et al. (2018) for studying sensemaking in individual's decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SUKHOV|first=ALEXANDRE|last2=SIHVONEN|first2=ANTTI|last3=OLSSON|first3=LARS E.|last4=MAGNUSSON|first4=PETER R.|date=2018-11-28|title=THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME: OPENNESS TO CHANGE AND SENSEMAKING IN IDEA SCREENING|url=https://doi.org/10.1142/S1363919618400091|journal=International Journal of Innovation Management|language=en|pages=1840009|doi=10.1142/s1363919618400091|issn=1363-9196}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to explain how different individuals combine together different cues to make sense of and decide on the goodness of ideas.

'''[[Sexual assault]] of [[LGBT]] persons''' is a form of violence that occurs within the LGBT community. While sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence can occur in all forms of relationships, it is found that sexual minorities experience it at rates that are equal to or higher than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of research on this specific problem for the LGBT population as a whole, but there does exist a substantial amount of research on college LGBT students who have experienced sexual assault. 

== Definition ==
There are varying definitions as to what sexual assault is defined as. According to the [[United States Department of Justice]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term 'sexual assault' means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|title=Sexual Assault {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Definitions and laws of sexual assault vary from state to state. The website [https://statelaws.findlaw.com/criminal-laws/sexual-assault.html FindLaw] allows users to click on their corresponding to state to read about how their state defines what sexual assault is, as well as what laws and limitations exist. Sexual assault of LGBT individuals refers to the act of sexual violence against persons who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender amongst other sexualities and sexual minorities. 

== Statistics ==
The [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]], also known as RAINN, puts out general statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence|title=Victims of Sexual Violence: Statistics {{!}} RAINN|website=www.rainn.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sexual assault, including:

* Every 98 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted.
* 21% of TGQN (transgender, genderqueer, nonconforming) college students have been sexually assaulted.

According to a 2010 findings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf|title=NISVS: An Overview of 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey], put out by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], it concluded that:

* For Lesbian women: 
** 44% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** Approximately 1 in 8 (13%) have been raped in their lifetime.
* For Gay men:
** 26% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 4 in 10 (40%) have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Women:
** 61% experienced rap, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime.
** 1 in 5 (22%) have been raped by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 46% have been raped in their lifetime.
* Bisexual Men:
** 37% experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
** 47% have experienced sexual violence other than rape in their lifetime.

In a paper done by Emily Rothman, Deinera Exner, and Allyson Baughman, it was found that, in regard to lifetime sexual assault victimization, the estimated prevalence for lesbian and bisexual women was approximately 12.6 - 85%. For gay and bisexual men, it was 11.8-54.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Emily F.|last2=Exner|first2=Deinera|last3=Baughman|first3=Allyson | date = April 2011 |title=The prevalence of sexual assault against people who identify as Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual in the United States: A systematic review |journal=Trauma, violence &amp; abuse|volume=12|issue=2|pages=55–66|doi=10.1177/1524838010390707 |pmc=3118668|pmid=21247983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying issues, myths, and misconceptions ==
{{or-section|date=May 2018}}
The underlying issues of sexual assault against LGBT persons includes homophobia and transphobia among other forms of prejudice against sexual minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcar.org/about-sexual-violence/lgbtq|title=LGBTQ {{!}} Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape (PCAR)|website=www.pcar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forms of prejudice end up creating unsafe spaces for LGBT persons where they do not feel comfortable expressing themselves or do not feel safe living as their authentic self. 

According to the [https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/ Pride Resource Center] at Colorado State University, homophobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Homophobia is a pervasive, irrational fear of homosexuality. Homophobia includes the fear heterosexuals have of any homosexual feelings within themselves, any overt mannerisms or actions that would suggest homosexuality, and the resulting desire to suppress or stamp out homosexuality. And it also includes the self-hatred and self-denial of homosexuals who know what they are but have been taught all their lives by a heterosexual society that people like themselves are sick, sinful and criminal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu/resources/homophobia/|title=Homophobia {{!}} Pride Resource Center|website=prideresourcecenter.colostate.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to [[Planned Parenthood]], transphobia is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Transphobia is the fear, hatred, disbelief, or mistrust of people who are transgender, thought to be transgender, or whose gender expression doesn’t conform to traditional gender roles. Transphobia can prevent transgender and gender nonconforming people from living full lives free from harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/sexual-orientation-gender/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-identities/whats-transphobia|title=What's Transphobia? {{!}} Facts About Transphobic Discrimination|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;These phobias, as well as myths centered around LGBT individuals, influence a culture that holds back persons from identifying how they choose and places them into a binary that doesn't encompass all possible ways of identifying. One of the main myths that can harm LGBT individuals is the idea that they have not met the right guy/girl yet. This perpetuates heterosexism and denies the possibility of one having attraction to the same gender. 

One of the biggest misconceptions that comes out of transphobia centers around the use of bathrooms. Made popular by North Carolina's "[[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|Bathroom Bill]]", it brought up the concern that by allowing individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender they identify as, predators could easily enter bathrooms and take advantage of individuals claiming that they identify as the gender the bathroom is. Legislation, such as House Bill 2, only perpetuate the discrimination of transgender individuals, rather than give them support to live their lives as the gender by which they identify. Laws have always existed that prohibit individuals from entering bathrooms with the purpose of harming others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.glaad.org/sites/default/files/Debunking_the_Bathroom_Bill_Myth_2017.pdf|title=Debunking the "Bathroom Bill" Myth|last=|first=|date=|work=GLAAD Transgender Media Program|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social status''' is the relative respect, competence, and deference accorded to people, groups, and organizations in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sauder|first1=Michael|last2=Lynn|first2=Freda|last3=Podolny|first3=Joel|title=Status: Insights from Organizational Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2012|volume=38|pages=267–283|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145503|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-071811-145503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Cameron|last2=Hildreth|first2=John|last3=Howland|first3=Laura|title=Is the Desire for Status a Fundamental Human Motive?

At its core, status is about who members of a society consider to hold more social value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sedikides | first1 = C. | last2 = Guinote | first2 = A. | year = 2018 | title = "How Status Shapes Social Cognition: Introduction to the Special Issue,"The Status of Status: Vistas from Social Cognition | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1521/soco.2018.36.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs about who is more or less valued (e.g., honorable, respectable, smart) are broadly shared among members of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

&lt;/ref&gt; As such, people use status hierarchies to decide who gets to "call the shots," who is worthy, and who deserves access to valuable resources. In so doing, these shared cultural beliefs make unequal distributions of resources and [[Power (social and political)|power]] appear natural and fair, supporting systems of [[social stratification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley|title=Consensus and the Creation of Status Beliefs.|journal=Social Forces|date=2006|volume=85|pages=431–453|url=https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/85/1/431/2235134|doi=10.1353/sof.2006.0139|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022095315/https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/85/1/431/2235134|archivedate=2017-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Status hierarchies appear to be universal across human societies, affording valued benefits to those who occupy the higher rungs, such as better health, social approval, resources, influence, and freedom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Determination==

Some perspectives on status emphasize its relatively fixed and fluid aspects. Ascribed statuses are fixed for an individual at birth, while achieved status is determined by social rewards an individual acquires during his or her lifetime as a result of the exercise of ability and/or perseverance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linton|first1=Ralph|title=The Study of Man|date=1936|publisher=Appleton Century Crofts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of ascribed status include [[caste]]s, [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and beauty among others. Meanwhile, achieved statuses are akin to one's educational credentials or occupation: these things require a person to exercise effort and often undergo years of training. The term [[master status]] has been used to describe the status most important for determining a person's position in a given context.&lt;ref name="BrymLie2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Brym|author2=John Lie|title=Sociology: Your Compass for a New World, Brief Edition: Enhanced Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vje_Pl5JmkcC&amp;pg=PA88|date=11 June 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-59893-3|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, Kelly, and Jill Stein.

== In different societies ==
Status refers to the relative rank that an individual holds; this includes attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle, in a [[social hierarchy]] based upon honor or [[wikt:prestige|prestige]].  Status has two different types that come along with it: achieved, and ascribed.  The word status refers to social stratification on a vertical scale.

In modern societies, [[profession|occupation]] is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as [[ethnic group]], [[religion]], [[gender]], voluntary associations, [[fandom]], [[hobby]]) can have an influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027083043/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |archivedate=2007-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/298 |title=The Effect of Middle School Extra Curricular Activities on Adolescents' Popularity and Peer Status – EDER and KINNEY 26 (3): 298 – Youth &amp; Society |publisher=Yas.sagepub.com |date=1995-03-01 |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703215724/http://yas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/298 |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Achieved status]] is when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements. This status can be achieved through education, occupation, and marital status. Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society's bar, which often judges them on success, success being financial, academic, political and so on.  America most commonly uses this form of status with jobs. The higher you are in rank the better off you are and the more control you have over your co-workers.

In pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid and class based, such as with the [[India]]n [[caste]] system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some [[Hunter-Gatherer]] societies such as the [[Khoisan]], and some [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a [[Khoisan]] man is expected to take his wife's mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special "status" over anyone except her son-in-law—and only then in specific contexts. All societies have a form of social status.

Status is an important idea in [[social stratification]]. [[Max Weber]] distinguishes status from [[social class]],&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max. 1946. "Class, Status, Party." pp. 180–95 in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, H. H. Gerth and C. Wright Mills (eds.). New York: Oxford University.&lt;/ref&gt; though some contemporary empirical sociologists combine the two ideas to create [[socioeconomic status]] or SES, usually operationalised as a simple [[Index (economics)|index]] of [[income]], [[education]] and occupational prestige.

Social [[dominance hierarchy]] emerges from individual survival-seeking behaviors.

== Status inconsistency ==
{{Main|Status inconsistency}}
Status inconsistency is a situation where an individual's [[social position]]s have both positive and negative influences on his or her social status. For example, a [[teacher]] may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little [[money]], which simultaneously decreases their status.

== Inborn and acquired ==
[[File:Inquilinos.gif|thumb|right|250px|Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the [[inquilino]] in picture. Image from 19th century rural Chile.]]
Statuses based on inborn characteristics, such as ethnicity, are called [[ascribed status]]es, while statuses that individuals gained through their own efforts are called [[achieved status]]es. Specific behaviors are associated with [[social stigma]]s, which can affect status.

Ascribed status is when one's position is inherited through family.  [[Monarchy]] is a widely recognized use of this method, to keep the rulers in one family.  This usually occurs at birth without any reference as to how that person may turn out to be a good or bad leader.

== Social mobility ==
Status can be changed through a process of [[social mobility]]. Social mobility is change of position within the stratification system. A move in status can be upward (upward mobility), or downward (downward mobility). Social mobility allows a person to move to another social status other than the one he or she was born in. Social mobility is more frequent in societies where achievement rather than ascription is the primary basis for social status.

Social mobility is especially prominent in the United States in the late 20th century, with an ever-increasing number of women entering into the workplace as well as a steady increase in the number of full-time college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582 |title=OLMIS – Women in the Labor Force |publisher=Qualityinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506101718/http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00003582 |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/ |title=Digest of Education Statistics, 2007 - Introduction |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506100227/http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/ |archivedate=2014-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increased education as well as the massive increase in multiple household incomes has greatly contributed to the rise in social mobility obtained by so many today. With this upward mobility; however, comes the philosophy of "[[Keeping up with the Joneses]]" that so many Americans obtain.  Although this sounds good on the surface, it actually poses a problem because millions of Americans are in credit card debt due to [[conspicuous consumption]] and purchasing goods that they do not have the money to pay for.

== Social stratification ==
{{Main|Social stratification}}
Social stratification describes the way people are placed or "stratified" in society.  It is associated with the ability of individuals to live up to some set of ideals or principles regarded as important by the society or some social group within it. The members of a social group interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification.  Such ties between people are often fluid and amorphous.  Some of the more common bases for such ranking include:

Groups:
* [[Wealth]]/[[Income]] (most common): Ties between persons with the same personal income
* [[Gender]]: Ties between persons of the same sex and sexuality
* Political status: Ties between persons of the same political views/status
* [[Religion]]: Ties between persons of the same religion
* [[Race (human classification)|Race]]/[[Ethnicity]]: Ties between persons of the same ethnic/racial group
* [[Social class]]: Ties between persons born into the same economic group
* [[Coolness]]: Ties between persons who have similar levels of [[popularity]]

== Max Weber's three dimensions of stratification ==
{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] developed a theory proposing that stratification is based on three factors that have become known as "the three p's of stratification": [[property]], prestige and [[Power (sociology)|power]]. He claimed that [[social stratification]] is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German ''Stand'') and power (party).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, translators and eds., (2015).  Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Reputation|Prestige]] is a significant factor in determining one's place in the stratification system. The ownership of property is not always going to assure power, but there are frequently people with prestige and little property.
* [[Property]] refers to one's material possessions and their life chances. If someone has control of property, that person has power over others and can use the property to his or her own benefit.
* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] is the ability to do what one wants, regardless of the will of others. (Domination, a closely related concept, is the power to make others' behavior conform to one's commands). This refers to two different types of power, which are possession of power and exercising power. For example, some people in charge of the government have an immense amount of power, and yet they do not make much money.
Max Weber developed various ways that societies are organized in hierarchical systems of power. These ways are social status, class power and political power.
* Class Power: This refers to unequal access to resources. If you have access to something that someone else needs, that can make you more powerful than the person in need. The person with the resource thus has bargaining power over the other.
* Social Status (Social Power): If you view someone as a social superior, that person will have power over you because you believe that person has a higher status than you do.
* Political Power: Political power can influence the hierarchical system of power because those that can influence what laws are passed and how they are applied can exercise power over others.
There has been discussion about how Weber's three dimensions of stratification are more useful for specifying social inequality than more traditional terms like [[Socioeconomic Status]].&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Tony and Dagmar Waters 2016 Are the terms "socio-economic status" and "social status" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?" Palgrave Communications 2, Article number: 16002 (2016) {{cite web |url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms20162 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405132923/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms20162 |archivedate=2016-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status group ===
{{Main|Status group}}
[[Max Weber]] developed the idea of "status group" which is a translation of the German ''Stand'' (pl. ''Stände''). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged.  Status groups can include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and other groups for which pattern association.&lt;ref&gt;Weber 48-56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pierre Bourdieu's theory on class distinction ==
The French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] developed theories of [[social stratification]] based on aesthetic taste in his work ''[[La Distinction|Distinction]]''. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social space to the world, one's aesthetic dispositions, depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that these dispositions are internalized at an early age and guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and an aversion towards other lifestyles.

Bourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and [[cultural capital]]. Society incorporates "symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence, […as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 66"&gt;Bourdieu 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that "differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 69"&gt;Bourdieu 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic dispositions are the result of social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time.  The acquisition of [[cultural capital]] depends heavily on "[t]otal, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 66" /&gt;  Bourdieu hypothetically guarantees that the opinions of the young are those that they are born into, the accepted "definitions that their elders offer them".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 477"&gt;Bourdieu 477&lt;/ref&gt;

He asserts the primacy of social origin and [[cultural capital]] by claiming that [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]], though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that "one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 177"&gt;Bourdieu 177&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation, are indicators of class, because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual's fit in society.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 144"&gt;Bourdieu 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. A multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction "has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator or tailor."&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 231"&gt;Bourdieu 231–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu does not wholly disregard the importance of [[social capital]] and [[economic capital]] in the formation of [[cultural capital]]. In fact, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument "presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means…and spare time".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 75"&gt;Bourdieu 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of one's ability to act upon one's preferences, Bourdieu specifies that "respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate... culture".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 63"&gt;Bourdieu 63&lt;/ref&gt;

"[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a 'sense of one's place', guiding the occupants of a given... social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 466"&gt;Bourdieu 466&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 65"&gt;Bourdieu 65&lt;/ref&gt;

These "cognitive structures…are internalized, 'embodied' social structures", becoming a natural entity to the individual.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 468"&gt;Bourdieu 468&lt;/ref&gt;  Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in "disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance ('sick-making') of the tastes of others."&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 56"&gt;Bourdieu 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are "most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 77"&gt;Bourdieu 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, Bordieu believes that "the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning" would probably be in the tastes of food.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79"&gt;Bourdieu 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are "an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in 'showing off' a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part)".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79" /&gt;  The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their class fractions.

Children from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose "heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap" in their dinner layouts, opting for "plentiful and good" meals as opposed to foods that are "original and exotic".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 177" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 79" /&gt;  These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu's "ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy," that contrasts the "convivial indulgence" characteristic of the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 179"&gt;Bourdieu 179&lt;/ref&gt;  Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the [[social class]]es.

The degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. In fact, at equivalent levels of [[educational capital]], social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 63" /&gt;  How one describes one's social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development.&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 78"&gt;Bourdieu 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, across the divisions of labor "economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending".&lt;ref name="Bourdieu 185"&gt;Bourdieu 185&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability consumption patterns remain stable.

In [[mathematics]], progress often consists of recognising the same '''structure''' in different contexts, so that one method exploiting it has multiple applications. In fact this is a normal way of proceeding; in the absence of recognisable structure (which might be hidden) problems tend to fall into the [[combinatorics]] classification of matters requiring special arguments.

In [[category theory]] ''structure'' is discussed ''implicitly'' — as opposed to the ''explicit'' discussion typical with the many [[algebraic structure]]s. Starting with a given class of algebraic structure, such as [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, one can build the category in which the objects are groups and the [[morphism]]s are [[group homomorphism]]s: that is, of structures on one type, and mappings respecting that structure. Starting with a category ''C'' given abstractly, the challenge is to infer what structure it is on the objects that the morphisms 'preserve'. 

The term ''structure'' was much used in connection with the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group's approach. There is even a definition. Structure must definitely include [[topological space]] as well as the standard [[abstract algebra]] notions. Structure in this sense is probably commensurate with the idea of [[concrete category]] that can be presented in a definite way — the topological case means that infinitary operations will be needed. ''Presentation of a category'' (analogously to [[presentation of a group]]) can in fact be approached in a number of ways, the ''category'' structure not being (quite) an algebraic structure in its own right.

The term ''transport of structure'' is the 'French' way of expressing ''covariance'' or ''equivariance'' as a constraint: transfer structure by a [[surjection]] and then (if there is an existing structure) compare.

Since any group is a one-object category, a special case of the question about ''what the morphisms preserve'' is this: how to consider any group G as a [[symmetry group]]? That is answered, as best we can by [[Cayley's theorem]]. The analogue in category theory is the [[Yoneda lemma]]. One concludes that knowledge on the 'structure' is bound up with what we can say about the [[representable functor]]s on ''C''. Characterisations of them, in interesting cases, were sought in the 1960s, for application in particular in the [[moduli problem]]s of [[algebraic geometry]]; showing in fact that these are very subtle matters.

'''SuperWrite''' is an English [[shorthand]] system based largely on previous shorthand systems and largely intended for people who need to increase their writing speed without devoting months to learning more complicated systems.  It is a [[writing system]], as it uses cursive forms of the letters of the spoken [[alphabet]] to represent sounds.  Aside from assigning special [[Abbreviation|abbreviations]] to [[common words]], the system functions largely by omitting short [[Vowel|vowels]] from within words.  Hence, SuperWrite could be considered an impure [[abjad]].  Its publishers claim it uses only the 26 letters of the [[longhand]] alphabet with no extra [[Symbol|symbols]], however, the [[Letter case|capital letters]] used (C, O, S, T, U, X) have different functions from their [[lowercase]] forms, and the uncrossed '''t''' — which would be considered a mistake in longhand — has a different function from the crossed '''t''', bringing the total number of symbols in SuperWrite to 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lemaster | first=A James | year=1990 | title=SuperWrite : alphabetic writing system.

'''Tadesse Meskela''' is the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]] of Ethiopia and was featured in the documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]''. He is a proponent of [[Fair trade|fair-trade]], and speaks publicly in support of it around the world. 

He grew up in the countryside outside Addis Ababa, Bishoftu. Tadesse Meskela studied his way out of poverty and eventually made it to university. By the early 1990s he was working for the state Agricultural Bureau. He attended a two-month co-operative training placement in Japan and was inspired to develop a cooperative union system to help Ethiopian coffee farmers attain a fairer recompense for their produce. The Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union was established in 1999. In the year 2004, the union has facilitated the constructed of four new schools, seventeen additional classrooms, four health centres, two clean water supply stations, and in terms of dividends, $2 million has been given back to the farmers.

For this reason, the tensor rank decomposition is sometimes historically referred to as PARAFAC&lt;ref name="h1970" /&gt; or CANDECOMP.&lt;ref name="cc1970" /&gt;

The tensor rank decomposition expresses a tensor as a minimum-length linear combination of '''rank-1 tensors'''. Such rank-1 tensors are also called '''simple''' or '''pure'''. A pure tensor is the [[tensor product]] of a collection of vectors.

== Definition ==

Consider a tensor space &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1 \times \cdots \times n_d} \cong F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is either the real field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or the complex field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Every (order-&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) tensor in this space may then be represented with a suitably large &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; rank-1 tensors:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} \lambda_i \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \in F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_i^k \in F^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;; note that the superscript &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; should not be interpreted as an exponent, it is merely another index. When the number of terms &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is minimal in the above expression, then &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''rank''' of the tensor, and the decomposition is often referred to as a ''(tensor) rank decomposition'', ''minimal CP decomposition'', or ''Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD)''. Contrariwise, if the number of terms is not minimal, then the above decomposition is often referred to as ''&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-term decomposition'', ''CANDECOMP/PARAFAC'' or ''Polyadic decomposition''.

== Tensor rank ==

Contrary to the case of matrices, the rank of a tensor is presently not understood well. It is known that the problem of computing the rank of a tensor is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = C. J. | last1 = Hillar | authorlink1 = C. J. Hillar | first2 = L. | last2 = Lim | authorlink2 = L. Lim | title = Most tensor problems are NP-Hard | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 60 | year = 2013 | pages = 45 | doi=10.1145/2512329| arxiv = 0911.1393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only notable well-understood case consists of tensors in &lt;math&gt;F^{m} \otimes F^{n} \otimes F^2&lt;/math&gt;, whose rank can be obtained from the [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]]–[[Weierstrass]] normal form of the linear [[matrix pencil]] that the tensor represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = J. M. | last1 = Landsberg | authorlink1 = J. M. Landsberg | title = Tensors: Geometry and Applications | publisher = AMS | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple polynomial-time algorithm exists for certifying that a tensor is of rank 1, namely the [[higher-order singular value decomposition]].

The rank of the tensor of zeros is zero by convention. The rank of a tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_d &lt;/math&gt; is one, provided that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}_k \in F^{n_k}\setminus\{0\} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Field dependence ===
The rank of a tensor depends on the field over which the tensor is decomposed. It is known that some real tensors may admit a complex decomposition whose rank is strictly less than the rank of a real decomposition of the same tensor. As an example,&lt;ref name="dSL2008" /&gt; consider the following real tensor

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} = \mathbf{x}_1 \otimes \mathbf{x}_2 \otimes \mathbf{x}_3 + \mathbf{x}_1 \otimes \mathbf{y}_2 \otimes \mathbf{y}_3 - \mathbf{y}_1 \otimes \mathbf{x}_2 \otimes \mathbf{y}_3 + \mathbf{y}_1 \otimes \mathbf{y}_2 \otimes \mathbf{x}_3, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{y}_j \in \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. The rank of this tensor over the reals is known to be 3, while its complex rank is only 2 because it is the sum of a complex rank-1 tensor with its [[complex conjugate]], namely

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} = \frac{1}{2}( \bar{\mathbf{z}}_1 \otimes \mathbf{z}_2 \otimes \bar{\mathbf{z}}_3 + \mathbf{z}_1 \otimes \bar{\mathbf{z}}_2 \otimes \mathbf{z}_3),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{z}_k=\mathbf{x}_k + i\mathbf{y}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

In contrast, the rank of real matrices will never decrease under a [[field extension]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;: real matrix rank and complex matrix rank coincide for real matrices.

=== Generic rank ===
The '''generic rank''' &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the least rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that the closure in the [[Zariski topology]] of the set of tensors of rank at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the entire space &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of complex tensors, tensors of rank at most &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; form a [[dense set]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;: every tensor in the aforementioned space is either of rank less than the generic rank, or it is the limit in the [[Euclidean topology]] of a sequence of tensors from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of real tensors, the set of tensors of rank at most &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; only forms an open set of positive measure in the Euclidean topology. There may exist Euclidean-open sets of tensors of rank strictly higher than the generic rank. All ranks appearing on open sets in the Euclidean topology are called '''typical ranks'''. The smallest typical rank is called the generic rank; this definition applies to both complex and real tensors. The generic rank of tensor spaces was initially studied in 1983 by [[Volker Strassen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = V. | last1 = Strassen | authorlink1 = Volker Strassen | title = Rank and optimal computation of generic tensors | journal = [[Linear Algebra and its Applications]] | year = 1983 | volume = 52/53 | pages = 645–685 | doi=10.1016/0024-3795(83)80041-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an illustration of the above concepts, it is known that both 2 and 3 are typical ranks of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; while the generic rank of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; is 2. Practically, this means that a randomly sampled real tensor (from a continuous probability measure on the space of tensors) of size &lt;math&gt;2 \times 2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; will be a rank-1 tensor with probability zero, a rank-2 tensor with positive probability, and rank-3 with positive probability. On the other hand, a randomly sampled complex tensor of the same size will be a rank-1 tensor with probability zero, a rank-2 tensor with probability one, and a rank-3 tensor with probability zero. It is even known that the generic rank-3 real tensor in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2 \otimes \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; will be of complex rank equal to 2.

The generic rank of tensor spaces depends on the distinction between balanced and unbalanced tensor spaces. A tensor space &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_1 \ge n_2 \ge \cdots \ge n_d&lt;/math&gt;,
is called '''unbalanced''' whenever

: &lt;math&gt;n_1 &gt; 1 + \prod_{k=2}^d n_k - \sum_{k=2}^d (n_k-1), &lt;/math&gt;

and it is called '''balanced''' otherwise.

==== Unbalanced tensor spaces ====
When the first factor is very large with respect to the other factors in the tensor product, then the tensor space essentially behaves as a matrix space. The generic rank of tensors living in an unbalanced tensor spaces is known to equal

: &lt;math&gt; r(n_1,\ldots,n_d) = \min\left\{ n_1, \prod_{k=2}^d n_k \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

[[almost everywhere]]. More precisely, the rank of every tensor in an unbalanced tensor space &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1 \times \cdots \times n_d} \setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is some indeterminate closed set in the Zariski topology, equals the above value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Balanced tensor spaces ====
The generic rank of tensors living in a balanced tensor space  is '''expected''' to equal

: &lt;math&gt; r_E(n_1,\ldots,n_d) = \left\lceil \frac{\Pi}{\Sigma+1} \right\rceil &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi = \prod_{k=1}^{d} n_k \quad\text{and}\quad \Sigma = \sum_{k=1}^{d} (n_k - 1). &lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, the rank of every tensor in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{n_1 \times \cdots \times n_d} \setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is some indeterminate closed set in the [[Zariski topology]], is expected to equal the above value.&lt;ref name="aop2009"&gt;{{Cite journal

The value &lt;math&gt;r_E(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; is often referred to as the '''expected generic rank''' of the tensor space &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1 \times \cdots \times n_d}&lt;/math&gt; because it is only conjecturally correct. It is known that the true generic rank always satisfies

: &lt;math&gt; r(n_1, \ldots, n_d) \ge r_E(n_1, \ldots, n_d). &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Abo–Ottaviani–Peterson conjecture'''&lt;ref name="aop2009" /&gt; states that equality is expected, i.e., &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d) = r_E(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt;, with the following exceptional cases:

* &lt;math&gt; F^{4 \times 4 \times 3}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; F^{(2n+1) \times (2n+1) \times 3} \text{ with } n = 1, 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; F^{(n+1) \times (n+1) \times 2 \times 2} \text{ with } n = 1, 2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

In each of these exceptional cases, the generic rank is known to be &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d) = r_E(n_1,\ldots,n_d)+1&lt;/math&gt;. The conjecture has been proved completely in a number of special cases. Lickteig showed already in 1985 that &lt;math&gt;r(n,n,n) = r_E(n,n,n)&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;n \ne 3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Lickteig | authorlink1 = T.

=== Maximum rank ===

The '''maximum rank''' that can be admitted by any of the tensors in a tensor space is unknown in general; even a conjecture about this maximum rank is missing. Presently, the best general upper bound states that the maximum rank &lt;math&gt;r_M(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n_1 \ge n_2 \ge \cdots \ge n_d&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies

: &lt;math&gt;r_M(n_1,\ldots,n_d) \le \min\left\{ \prod_{k=2}^d n_k, 2 \cdot r(n_1,\ldots,n_d) \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r(n_1,\ldots,n_d)&lt;/math&gt; is the (least) ''generic rank'' of &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It is well-known that the foregoing inequality may be strict. For instance, the generic rank of tensors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; is two, so that the above bound yields &lt;math&gt;r_M(2,2,2) \le 4&lt;/math&gt;, while it is known that the maximum rank equals 3.&lt;ref name="dSL2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Border rank ===

A rank-&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''border tensor''' if there exists a sequence of tensors of rank at most &lt;math&gt;r &lt; s&lt;/math&gt; whose limit is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the least value for which such a convergent sequence exists, then it is called the '''border rank''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;. For order-2 tensors, i.e., matrices, rank and border rank ''always'' coincide, however, for tensors of order &lt;math&gt;\ge3&lt;/math&gt; they may differ. Border tensors were first studied in the context of fast ''approximate'' [[matrix multiplication algorithm]]s by Bini, Lotti, and Romani in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Approximate solutions for the bilinear form computational problem | journal = [[SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing]] | first1 = D. | last1 = Bini | authorlink1 = D.

A classic example of a border tensor is the rank-3 tensor

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}, \quad \text{with } \|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 1 \text{ and } \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle \ne 1.&lt;/math&gt;

It can be approximated arbitrarily well by the following sequence of rank-2 tensors

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\mathcal{A}_n 
&amp;= n (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v}) \otimes (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v}) \otimes (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v})  - n \mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u} \\
&amp;= \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} (\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}) + \frac{1}{n^2} \mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, its border rank is 2, which is strictly less than its rank. When the two vectors are orthogonal, this example is also known as a [[W state]].

== Properties ==

=== Identifiability ===
It follows from the definition of a pure tensor that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{a}^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}^d = \mathbf{b}^1 \otimes \mathbf{b}^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{b}^d&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_k = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}^k = \lambda_k \mathbf{b}^k&lt;/math&gt; for all ''k''. For this reason, the parameters &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf{a}^k \}_{k=1}^d&lt;/math&gt; of a rank-1 tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; are called identifiable or essentially unique. A rank-&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \in F^{n_1} \otimes F^{n_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''identifiable''' if every of its tensor rank decompositions is the sum of the same set of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; distinct tensors &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathcal{A}_1, \mathcal{A}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{A}_r \}&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are of rank 1. An identifiable rank-&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; thus has only one essentially unique decomposition &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathcal{A}_i,&lt;/math&gt;and all &lt;math&gt;r!&lt;/math&gt; tensor rank decompositions of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by permuting the order of the summands. Observe that in a tensor rank decomposition all the &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_i&lt;/math&gt;'s are distinct, for otherwise the rank of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; would be at most &lt;math&gt;r-1&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Generic identifiability ====
Order-2 tensors in &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes F^{n_2} \simeq F^{n_1 \times n_2}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., matrices, are not identifiable for &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. This follows essentially from the observation &lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i \otimes \mathbf{b}_i 
= \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}_i \mathbf{b}_i^T
= A B^T 
= (A X^{-1}) (B X^T)^T
= \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{c}_i \mathbf{d}_i^T = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{c}_i \otimes \mathbf{d}_i,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathrm{GL}_{r}(F)&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible &lt;math&gt;r \times r&lt;/math&gt; matrix, &lt;math&gt;A = [\mathbf{a}_i]_{i=1}^r&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;B = [\mathbf{b}_i]_{i=1}^r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A X^{-1} = [\mathbf{c}_i]_{i=1}^r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B X^T = [\mathbf{d}_i]_{i=1}^r&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4757-2189-8|title=Algebraic Geometry {{!}} SpringerLink|last=Harris|first=Joe|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-2189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for every &lt;math&gt;X \in \mathrm{GL}_n(F)\setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a closed set in the Zariski topology, the decomposition on the right-hand side is a sum of a different set of rank-1 tensors than the decomposition on the left-hand side, entailing that order-2 tensors of rank &lt;math&gt;r&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; are generically not identifiable.

The situation changes completely for higher-order tensors in &lt;math&gt;F^{n_1} \otimes F^{n_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 2&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;n_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. For simplicity in notation, assume without loss of generality that the factors are ordered such that &lt;math&gt;n_1 \ge n_2 \ge \cdots \ge n_d \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;S_r \subset F^{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes F^{n_d}&lt;/math&gt;denote the set of tensors of rank bounded by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Ill-posedness of the standard approximation problem ===
The rank approximation problem asks for the rank-&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; decomposition closest (in the usual Euclidean topology) to some rank-&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r &lt; s&lt;/math&gt;. That is, one seeks to solve

: &lt;math&gt; \min_{\mathbf{a}_i^k \in F^{n_k}} \| \mathcal{A} - \sum_{i=1}^{r} \mathbf{a}_i^1 \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^2 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}_i^d \|_F, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frobenius norm]].

It was shown in a 2008 paper by de Silva and Lim&lt;ref name="dSL2008" /&gt; that the above standard approximation problem may be ''ill-posed''. A solution to aforementioned problem may sometimes not exist because the set over which one optimizes is not closed. As such, a minimizer may not exist, even though an infimum would exist. In particular, it is known that certain so-called ''border tensors'' may be approximated arbitrarily well by a sequence of tensor of rank at most &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, even though the limit of the sequence converges to a tensor of rank strictly higher than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. The rank-3 tensor

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}, \quad \text{with } \|\mathbf{u}\| = \|\mathbf{v}\| = 1 \text{ and } \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\rangle \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;

can be approximated arbitrarily well by the following sequence of rank-2 tensors

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}_n = n (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v}) \otimes (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v}) \otimes (\mathbf{u} + \frac{1}{n} \mathbf{v})  - n \mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. This example neatly illustrates the general principle that a sequence of rank-&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; tensors that converges to a tensor of strictly higher rank needs to admit at least two individual rank-1 terms whose norms become unbounded. Stated formally, whenever a sequence

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A}_n = \sum_{i=1}^r \mathbf{a}^1_{i,n} \otimes \mathbf{a}^2_{i,n} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}^d_{i,n} &lt;/math&gt;

has the property that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}_n \to \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; (in the Euclidean topology) as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then there should exist at least &lt;math&gt;1 \le i \ne j \le r&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{a}^1_{i,n} \otimes \mathbf{a}^2_{i,n} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}^d_{i,n} \|_F \to \infty \text{  and  } \| \mathbf{a}^1_{j,n} \otimes \mathbf{a}^2_{j,n} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbf{a}^d_{j,n} \|_F \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This phenomenon is often encountered when attempting to approximate a tensor using numerical optimization algorithms. It is sometimes called the problem of ''diverging components''. It was, in addition, shown that a random low-rank tensor over the reals may not admit a rank-2 approximation with positive probability, leading to the understanding that the ill-posedness problem is an important consideration when employing the tensor rank decomposition.

A common partial solution to the ill-posedness problem consists of imposing an additional inequality constraint that bounds the norm of the individual rank-1 terms by some constant. Other constraints that result in a closed set, and, thus, well-posed optimization problem, include imposing positivity or a bounded [[inner product]] strictly less than unity between the rank-1 terms appearing in the sought decomposition.

== Applications ==
In machine learning, the CP-decomposition is the central ingredient in learning probabilistic latent variables models via the technique of moment-matching. For example, consider the multi-view model&lt;ref name="anandkumar2014tensor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anandkumar|first1=Animashree|last2=Ge|first2=Rong|last3=Hsu|first3=Daniel|last4=Kakade|first4=Sham M|last5=Telgarsky|first5=Matus|title=Tensor decompositions for learning latent variable models|journal=The Journal of Machine Learning Research|volume=15|number=1|pages=2773–2832|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a probabilistic latent variable model. In this model, the generation of samples are posited as follows: there exists a hidden random variable that is not observed directly, given which, there are several [[conditionally independent]] random variables known as the different "views" of the hidden variable. For simplicity, assume there are three symmetrical views &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-state categorical hidden variable &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. Then the empirical third moment of this latent variable model can be written as:
&lt;math&gt;T=\sum_{i=1}^{k}Pr(h=i) E[x|h=i]^{\otimes 3}&lt;/math&gt;.

In applications such as [[topic modeling]], this can be interpreted as the co-occurrence of words in a document. Then the eigenvalues of this empirical moment tensor can be interpreted as the probability of choosing a specific topic and each column of the factor matrix &lt;math&gt;E[x|h=k]&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to probabilities of words in the vocabulary in the corresponding topic.

Ancient [[Nahuatl]] people believed that it was located in the hair and the [[fontanel]] area of one’s skull, and that the tonalli provided the “vigor and energy for growth and development”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often overlaps with the force of teyolía which was often considered both an animating force ([[soul]]) and the physical heart in various [[Mesoamerican]] [[cultures]].

== Etymology ==
The root “tona” acts as a verb to mean "to irradiate or make warm with sun”.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
In the Ancient Nahuatl belief, the tonalli is bestowed upon a child in utero by the aged [[deities]] known as [[Ometecuhtli]] and [[Omecihuatl]], or the “Lord and Lady of Duality”.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of tonalli is conducted through a process known as Fire Drilling.
[[File:Fire Drilling.JPG|thumb|Drilling with a stick on an upright base to make smoke and fire. Post classic Mixtec, Oaxaca]]
It is believed that the old deities, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl transferred tonalli to human fetuses by “simultaneously breath[ing] the tonalli into the child and ignit[ing] a fire in its chest”.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Fire Drilling process involves an upright wooden piece being twirled rapidly on a flat base. It produces heat through friction, although this seemingly simple instrument requires considerable skill to make anything but smoke. The fire maker blows on an ignited spark to fan it into a vigorous flame, and the breathing (or blowing air) and friction in the chest animate an infant.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Franciscan friars connected this idea of Fire Drilling, namely, the conception of tonalli as breath, to [[Christianity]] as the infusion of breath into the body recalls the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], where God the Father breathes life into Adam.

== The human body ==
The Nahuatl people of Mesoamerica believed that the soul comprised three [[entities]]: Tonalli, Teyolía, and Ihíyotl, three souls in the body. Tonalli is located in fontanel area of the skull. Teyolía is located in the heart and Ihíyotl is in the liver. Each of these souls has its own functions and protective deities. But there are important differences. The Tonalli is the soul that enters and leaves the body. In [[Atla, Sierra de Puebla|Atla]] in the northern Sierra de Puebla, the inhabitants believe this is the soul that travels while you sleep at night, and then comes back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montoya Briones|first1=Jose de Jesus|title=Atla: Etnografia de un Pueblo Nahuatl|date=1964|publisher=Mexico City: INAH|location=Mexico City|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the soul that leaves and comes back every time you sneeze, or whenever you yawn, or even when you are startled. The Nahua believed that it was not good to sneeze and keep talking, because it causes your tonalli to leave and once your Tonalli leaves, you have to wait for a period of time before it returns. At that moment, anything can enter your body. However, the soul of the heart (Teyolía) and the soul of the liver (Ihiíyotl) only leave your body when you die; those two souls will exit only at the exact moment of your death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Diana|last2=Constantino|first2=Roselyn|title=Holy Terrors: Latin American Women Perform.''Nahuatlismo: The Aztec Method''|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tonalli in the blood ===
Along with the heart, the ancient [[Mexica]] took blood from sacrificed prisoners and offered its fructifying force to the gods. On public and private ritual occasions, people drew blood from their ears, tongues, or calves, splattered it on pieces of native paper, and gave it to the spirits as tokens of thanks for benefits received or as requests for future favors. The gods could be coaxed or rewarded, less by the physical fluid itself than by the tonalli (life force) it carried and transferred to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among most modern Nahuatl speakers, the state of the life force may even be determined from the movement of blood in the body, whether this movement is experienced as a tic, a pulse, or a muscular movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; When blood drains from its proper course, the person loses his/her life force, and, essentially, soul.

== Ritual ==
[[File:Warrior Grabbing Captive in Perceived Location of Tonalli.JPG|thumb|Warrior who has taken a captive by the hair. This is a symbolic representation of seizing the captive's tonalli. Early colonial Central Mexico.]]

=== War and human sacrifice ===
Tonalli was highly valued in society and sought after in warfare and ritual sacrifice. The hair that covered the head, especially the fontanel area, was a major receptacle of tonalli, and it was believed that hair prevented the tonalli from leaving the body. During times of war, when a warrior would take a prisoner captive, the warrior would often seize the captive by the hair (the fontanel area). It was believed that the fortitude and valor of a warrior resided, in part, in the hair, and there are many pictorial scenes showing Aztec warriors grabbing the hair of enemies. The hair of warriors captured in battle was kept by the captors in order to increase their tonalli. The severed heads of enemy warriors were a supreme prize for the city, which gained more tonalli through the ceremonial use of heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrasco|first1=David|title=Religions of Mesoamerica|date=2014|publisher=Waveland Press|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tonalli embedded within skulls of enemy warriors and captives were also offered as gifts to the gods in the temple complexes. This was believed to be an offering to the gods in the form of a type of debt repayment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Social practices ===
The [[essence]] of tonalli was a force that  could transcend the limits of the human body. Parts of the tonalli could reside outside the body in objects and animals. For example, tlacopatli beads were often left in the temple and represented a substitute for a child unable to go to the temple school, due to age restrictions. These beads served to contain the tonalli and do penitence for the underaged child.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the belief of the physicality of the soul and the embodiment of the tonalli. Stones were also used as repositories of the soul in a different sense. As tonalli was considered to be an indication of destiny or fate, the possession of [[gemstones]] served as direct evidence of those with positive [[fate]]s despite low births and the auspicious destinies of members of the elite class.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;
[[File:Figure with 20 Day Signs.JPG|thumb|Figure with 20 day signs of ancient Mexica attached to parts of the body in place of the astrological signs assigned to them in Europe.]]

== Tonalli co-essences ==
The tonalli operated within a complex that involved the god of the birth date and the human. The soul of the individuality of a person, resided inside; but the god of the tonalli resided outside&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-essence of tonalli in a human body is subject to the power of an external god/time that could lodge in a person’s body. The dynamics of this joint essence relationship made it necessary for humans to implore each god of birth dates for internal strength, health and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=López|first1=Austin Alfredo|title=Relationship of the Essences. ''Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist''|date=1997|publisher=Niwot, CO: U of Colorado|location=Colorado|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animating quality of tonalli ==
Tonalli, along with ''teyolia'' and ''ihiyotl'', was believed to direct the [[physiological]] process of the human body. It gave a person character, and was highly valued by the family and sought after in [[warfare]] and ritual [[sacrifice]]. It was believed that tonalli could be taken from a human body and either offered to the gods as a form of debt payment or acquired by the ritual person who touched the physical entity in which they resided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The concept of tonalli was not only limited to human beings. It infiltrated animals, gods, plants, and objects used in rituals.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Astrological signs ===
The tonalli also determines the sign under which a person is born and informs [[Luck|fortune]], character, and name. Tonalli conveyed [[astrological signs]] and names through birthdays, and in the [[Mexica]] [[divinatory]] system, a person’s birthday fell on one of the 260 name days in a special [[calendar]]. Individuals followed the path or code of conduct demanded by the tonalli and the day sign. This calendar was notable because it was used solely for divination and celebrating rituals in the deities’ honor. The calendrical name of a given person transmitted a character and fate to both men and women. A person born on the first day of the 260-day cycle, would be named One Crocodile and was given a positive character that would bring about authority, wealth, and fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furst|first1=Jill Leslie McKeever|title=The Natural History of the Soul in Ancient Mexico|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that inauspicious day signs could be ameliorated through rituals such as first baths, and life events.

== Free will ==
It was believed that individuals possess free will within the constraints imposed by their tonalli. One is born with either favorable or unfavorable tonalli and with a corresponding predetermined character. While this places certain constraints upon what one may accomplish, one freely chooses what to make of one's tonalli within these limits. Someone born with favorable tonalli may squander it through improper action; someone with unfavorable tonalli may neutralize its adverse effects through knowledge of the [[sacred]] calendar and careful selection of actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maffie|first1=James|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=iep.utm.edu/aztec/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soul loss ==
As an animating force within both the human and [[Supernatural|spiritual]] world, retaining tonalli provides consciousness and personality. The concept of soul loss was inherent to the ancient Central Mexican understanding of [[aging]] and [[death]]. The loss of tonalli, in its various stages, is known by states in which the person suffers slowed, impaired, or complete loss of consciousness. As the understanding of tonalli is reliant upon conceptions of warmth, heat, and the sun, the absence of tonalli is felt as fluctuations in internal temperature. The inability to re-implant the life force leads to a decline in health and ultimately death. The modern Nahua and the Mexica have identified the tonalli’s departure as the cause of illnesses with the same general and observable symptoms as death and dying.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

'''Trivialism''' ({{etymology|la|trivialis|found everywhere}}) is the [[logical theory]] that all [[Statement (logic)|statements]] (also known as [[propositions]]) are [[truth value|true]] and that all [[contradiction]]s of the form "p and not p" (e.g. the ball is red and not red) are true. In accordance with this, a '''trivialist''' is a person who believes everything is true.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Dov M.|editor1-last=Gabbay|editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Woods|title=The Many Valued and Nonmonotonic Turn in Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TNj1ZkP3qEC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2007|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|isbn=978-0-444-51623-7|page=131|first=Graham|last=Priest|chapter=Paraconsistency and Dialetheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kabay|title=On the Plenitude of Truth.  A Defense of Trivialism|year=2010|publisher=[[Lambert Academic Publishing]]|isbn=978-3-8383-5102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical logic]], trivialism is in direct violation of [[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]]. In [[philosophy]], trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of [[skepticism]]. [[Paraconsistent logic]]s may use "the law of non-triviality" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions.

Theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as [[modal realism]], [[dialetheism]] and paraconsistent logics.

==Overview==

===Etymology===
Trivialism, as a term, is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''trivialis,'' meaning something that can be found everywhere. From this, "[[wikt:trivial|trivial]]" was used to suggest something was introductory or simple. In [[logic]], from this meaning, a "trivial" theory is something regarded as defective in the face of a complex [[phenomenon]] that needs to be completely represented. Thus, literally, the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Theory===

In [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]], trivialism may be expressed as the following:&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=29|publisher=[[The University of Melbourne]], Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \forall pTp &lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as "given any proposition, it is a true proposition" through [[universal quantification]] (∀).

A claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth, otherwise known as a [[truth predicate]]:

: &lt;math&gt;p \leftrightarrow Tp&lt;/math&gt;

The above would be read as a "proposition [[if and only if]] a true proposition," meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true. Without consistent use of this concept, a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism; as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as probably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory.&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Taxonomy of trivialisms===

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists four types of trivialism through the concept of [[possible world]]s, with a "world" being a possibility and "the actual world" being reality. It is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true. This taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context:

: (T0) Minimal trivialism: At some world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T1) Pluralist trivialism: In some worlds, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T2) [[Actualism|Actualist]] trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions have a designated value.
: (T3) Absolute trivialism: In all worlds, all propositions have a designated value.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

==Arguments against trivialism==

The consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism, termed as non-trivialism or anti-trivialism.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estrada-González|first=Luis|title=Models of Possibilism and Trivialism|journal=Logic and Logical Philosophy|volume=21|pages=175–205|url=http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/LLP/article/view/791}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the [[principle of explosion]] and it being considered an [[absurdity]] ([[reductio ad absurdum]]).&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]]'s [[law of noncontradiction]] and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism. Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" has interpreted Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics Book IV]]'' as such: "...A family of arguments between 1008a26 and 1007b12 of the form 'If trivialism is right, then X is the case, but if X is the case then all things are one. But it is impossible that all things are one, so trivialism is impossible.'(...)these Aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism: Trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified, and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical, namely, truth and falsehood."&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

===Priest===

It is implicitly claimed by [[Graham Priest]], a professor of philosophy, that a position for trivialism is unsubstantial: "...a substantial case can be made for [dialetheism]; belief in [trivialism], though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Perceiving contradictions|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=77|issue=4|date=1999|page=Volume 77, Issue 4, p. 443|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00048409912349211?journalCode=rajp20#.U3wYzyg0rDc|doi=10.1080/00048409912349211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has coined his rejection of trivialism "the law of non-triviality" as a replacement for the [[law of non-contradiction]] in [[paraconsistent logic]] and [[dialetheism]].&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Arguments for trivialism==

There are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a [[devil's advocate]]:

===Argument from possibilism===
Paul Kabay has argued for trivialism in "On the Plenitude of Truth" from the following:

# "Possibilism is true [premise]
# If possibilism is true, then there is a world (either possible or impossible or both), ''w'', in which trivialism is true [premise]
# ''w'' is a possible world [premise]
# It is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to the actual world, A [2]
# If it is true that there is a world, ''w'', and ''w'' is a possible world, and it is true in ''w'' that ''w'' is identical to A, then trivialism is true [premise]
# Trivialism is true [1–5]"&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

Above, possibilism ([[modal realism]]; related to [[possible worlds]]) is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible. With this assumed to be true, trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to Kabay.

===Paradoxes===

The [[liar's paradox]], [[Curry's paradox]] alongside the [[principle of explosion]] all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism.&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;

==Philosophical implications==

===Comparison to skepticism===
In Paul Kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of [[philosophical skepticism]] (in "On the Plenitude of Truth")—such as [[Pyrrhonism]]—who seek to attain a form of [[ataraxia]], or state of imperturbability; it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state. This is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] being true, even in a state of anxiety. Once universally accepted as true, the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true.

Kabay compares the Pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a [[Epoché|suspension]] of [[belief]], the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief.

In this case—and according to independent claims by Graham Priest—trivialism is considered the complete opposite of [[skepticism]].&lt;ref name="On the Plenitude of Truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A defense of trivialism 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Could Everything Be True?"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Priest |first1=G. |title=Could everything be true? |doi=10.1080/00048400012349471 |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=189–195 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true, the Pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth (or falsity) of such affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Empiricus, S. (2000). ''Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. "Suspension of judgement is a standstill of intellect, owing to which we neither reject nor posit anything" (p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impossibility of action===
It is asserted by both Priest and Kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist [[Apraxia|to truly choose and thus act]]. Priest argues this by the following in ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar'': "One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, ''s'', if one believes ''s'' already to hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of bringing ''s'' about, one cannot believe that ''s'' already obtains."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Priest|first=Graham|title=Doubt truth to be a liar|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199238510|pages=69–71|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kevalin&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/KABITD|work=The Australasian Philosophy of Religion Association Conference|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims, the Pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges.&lt;ref&gt;Comesaña, J.

==Advocates==
Paul Kabay, an Australian philosopher, in his book ''A Defense of Trivialism'' has argued that various philosophers in history have held views resembling trivialism, although he stops short of calling them trivialists. He mentions various pre-Socratic Greek philosophers as philosophers holding views resembling trivialism. He mentions that Aristotle in his book ''Metaphysics'' appears to suggest that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras advocated trivialism. He quotes Anaxagoras as saying that all things are one. Kabay also suggests Heraclitus' ideas are similar to trivialism because Heraclitus believed in a union of opposites, shown in such quotes as "the way up and down is the same".&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, P.D. (2008) ''A Defense of Trivialism''. Phd Thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry, The University of Melbourne pages 32–35&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions a fifteen century Roman Catholic cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, stating that what Cusa wrote in ''De Docta Ignorantia'' is interpreted as stating that God contained every fact, which Kabay argues would result in trivialism, but Kabay admits that mainstream Cusa scholars would not agree with interpreting Cusa as a trivialist.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Spinoza as a philosopher whose views resemble trivialism. Kabay argues Spinoza was a trivialist because Spinoza believed everything was made of one substance which had infinite attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt; Kabay also mentions Hegel as a philosophers whose views resemble trivialism, quoting Hegel as stating in ''The Science of Logic'' "everything is inherently contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;Kabay, pages 40–41.

===Azzouni===
[[Jody Azzouni]] is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article ''The Strengthened Liar'' by claiming that [[natural language]] is [[Triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] and inconsistent through the existence of the [[liar paradox]] ("This sentence is false"), and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction. It is heavily implied by Azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kabay|first=Paul|title=A defense of trivialism|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/5734|work=PhD thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry|page=42|quote=...According to Azzouni, natural language is trivial, that is to say, every sentence in natural language is true...And, of course, trivialism follows straightforwardly from the triviality of natural language: after all, 'trivialism is true' is a sentence in natural language...|publisher=The University of Melbourne, Research Collections (UMER)|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Troubles with Trivialism"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bueno |first1=O.

===Anaxagoras===
The Greek philosopher [[Anaxagoras]] is suggested as a possible trivialist by [[Graham Priest]] in his 2005 book ''Doubt Truth to Be a Liar''. Priest writes, "He held that, at least at one time, everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate."&lt;ref name="Doubt truth" /&gt;

==Anti-trivialism==
[[File:Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in symbolic logic.svg|thumb|Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in [[First-order logic#Logical symbols|symbolic logic]]; Read as "given any proposition, it is neither a true or false proposition."]]

Luis Estrada-González in "Models of Possiblism and Trivialism" lists eight types of anti-trivialism (or non-trivialism) through the use of [[possible worlds]]:

: (AT0) [[Actualist]] minimal anti-trivialism: In the actual world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT1) Actualist absolute anti-trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT2) Minimal anti-trivialism: In some worlds, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT3) Pointed anti-trivialism (or minimal logical [[nihilism]]): In some worlds, every proposition does not have a value of true or false.
: (AT4) Distributed anti-trivialism: In every world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false.
: (AT5) Strong anti-trivialism: Some propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.
: (AT6) Super anti-trivialism (or moderate logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false at some world.
: (AT7) Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.&lt;ref name="Models of Possibilism and Trivialism" /&gt;

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Ujukatā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "rectitude", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the [[Theravada]] [[Abhidharma]] teachings:
* ''Kāya-ujukatā'' - rectitude of mental body 
* ''Citta-ujukatā'' - rectitude of consciousness

These two mental factors have the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2377-2380}}
:Rectitude is straightness. The twofold rectitude has the characteristic of uprightness of the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush tortuousness of the mental body and consciousness, and its manifestation is non-crookedness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to hypocrisy and fraudulence, etc., which create crookedness in the mental body and consciousness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=229}}
:According to the ''[[Dhammasangani]]'' (par 50, 51) this pair of cetasikas consists in straightness and rectitude, being without deflection, twist or crookedness.
:The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 131) explains that uprightness of cetasikas and of citta crush crookedness and that they are the opponents of the corruptions, such as deception and craftiness, which cause crookedness in mental factors and consciousness.
:Uprightness is the opponent of deception and craftiness.

{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
'''''Urdoxa''''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the German prefix ''ur-'' and the [[Ancient Greek]] δόξα (''doxa''), meaning "primary" or "first" doctrine. For [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], the notion of "doxa" meant "opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink1=Gilles Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last1=Deleuze|authorlink2=Félix Guattari|first2=Félix|last2=Guattari| title=What is Philosophy? |translator=Hugh Tomlinson |translator2=Graham Burchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grew in popular usage in the work of [[Edmund Husserl]] whose phenomenological project was indexed on attempting, via the descriptive method, to ground the notion of a proto-doxa or ''urdoxa'' of experience. The term has since paled in poststructuralist discourse, and usually carries a negative connotation insofar as it assumes a transcendental subjectivity which overly privileges a humanistic conception of Being (see [[Michel Foucault]], ''The Order of Things''). Against such anthropocentricity, the term has fallen into relative disuse.

Two other notable uses of the term have appeared insince the year 2000:{{when|date=November 2015}} a progressive musical ensemble by the name of [[Thork]] produced an album entitled ''Urdoxa'' (2000), and a novel by the Canadian author [[Kane X. Faucher]] also has this term as its title (2004).

==Utilization in engineering==
In [[engineering]] utilization or operational stage of a system or equipment [[System lifecycle|life-cycle]] is a period of time when their quality is realized in practical use to achieve intended objectives and supported by accomplishment of storage, [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance, repair]], etc. Subsequently, the term "utilization" may have two meaning depending on context: 1) a process of actual use of a system or equipment - in case of simple products and 2) a stage of a complex [[System lifecycle|product life-cycle]] - in case of use within the [[product life-cycle management]] processes. &lt;ref name="NATO_AAP48"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.fhi.nl/plot2012/archief/2010/images/aap-48e.pdf |title=NATO Standard AAP 48. System Life Cycle Stages and Processes |last= |first= |date=2007 |website= fhi.nl|language=EN |publisher=[[NATO]] |access-date=2018-01-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OxLD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/utilization |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |language=EN |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2018-01-11 |title=Utilization|quote=Utilization (British "utilisation"), noun. The action of making practical and effective use of something}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rental utilization==
In [[Rental management software|equipment and tool rental companies]], '''utilization''' is the primary method by which asset performance is measured and business success determined. In basic terms it is a measure of the actual revenue earned by assets against the potential revenue they could have earned.&lt;ref&gt;http://constructionequipmentdistribution.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10921486 Utilization is key to rental business&lt;/ref&gt; Rental utilization is divided into a number of different calculations, and not all companies work precisely the same way. In general terms however there are 2 key calculations: the '''physical utilization''' on the asset, which is measured based on the number of available days for rental against the number of days actually rented. (This may also be measured in hours for certain types of equipment), and the '''financial utilization''' on the asset (referred to in North America as $ Utilization) which is measured as the rental revenue achieved over a period of time against the potential revenue that could have been achieved based on a target or standard, non-discounted rate. Physical utilization is also sometimes referred to as '''spot utilization''', where a rental company looks at its current utilization of assets based on a single moment in time (e.g. now, 9 am today, etc.).

Utilization calculations may be varied based on many different factors. For example: 
* A company with equipment which requires [[Preventative Maintenance|preventative maintenance]] activities every 2 weeks, may decide that the number of available days in the month is decreased as it will unavailable due to maintenance for 2 days out of each month.
* Some rental businesses give "free days" on rental contract [[Invoicing|billing]] processes, for example on a national or public holiday, and therefore the equipment does not earn any money on those days, even though it is physically on rent.
* Some companies charge minimum rates, for example you may rent an excavator for 1 day, but be charged a three-day minimum. The Physical utilization will therefore be 100% on the day, but the financial utilization is actually 300% as you've earned 3 days revenue for 1 day's work.
* [[Rental management software|Rental Software]] is normally required to assist management teams in measuring and calculating utilization figures.
* [[Mobile asset management|Asset Tracking software]] may also be important in increasing or managing utilization figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Qualcomm|url=http://www.qualcomm.com/common/documents/white_papers/QUALCOMM-WP-EquipmentRental.pdf  |title= Using technology to improve utilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilization in this context is heavily linked to [[Accounting|profitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cedmag.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10922778 |title= How to improve results|work=CED Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low physical utilization may be mitigated by keeping rental rates high, high physical utilization normally justifies keeping rental rates lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rentalmanagementmag.com/newsart.asp?ARTID=1509  |title=Close correlation between utilization and rental rates|work=Rental Management Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of equipment may also alter the relationship between rates and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RentalPulse|url=http://www.rentalpulse.com/article.asp?ARTID=6519 |title=How utilization affects profitability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit utilization==
Credit utilization is defined as the ratio of an entity's [[credit card]] and [[revolving loan]] balances to their [[credit limit]]s; in other words, it represents the amount of their credit limit that is being used. Credit utilization is one of several factors typically used by [[Credit score|credit scoring]] models because it is often correlated with [[Credit risk|lending risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=August 30, 2018|title=Understanding Credit Utilization: Credit Utilization and How It Affects Your Credit Score|url=https://www.thebalance.com/understanding-credit-utilization-960451|website=The Balance|date=July 10, 2018|author=Irby, LaToya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Credit Karma|url=https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/credit-card-utilization-and-your-credit-score/ |title=Credit card utilization and your credit scores|date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Value-stream mapping''' is a [[lean product development|lean]]-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer with reduced lean wastes as compared to current map. A [[value stream]] focuses on areas of a firm that add value to a product or service, whereas a [[value chain]] refers to all of the activities within a company. At [[Toyota]], it is known as "material- and information-flow mapping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1999 | title = Learning to See: value-stream mapping to create value and eliminate muda | first1 = Mike  | last1 = Rother | first2 =  John | last2 = Shook | isbn = 0-9667843-0-8 | location = Brookline, Massachusetts | publisher = Lean Enterprise Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of value stream mapping ==
The purpose of value stream mapping is to identify and remove or reduce "waste" in value streams, thereby increasing the efficiency of a given value stream. Waste removal is intended to increase productivity by creating leaner operations which in turn make waste and quality problems easier to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/34-for-Quality-John-Bicheno/9780951382943|title=34 for Quality : John Bicheno : 9780951382943|last=Depository|first=Book|website=www.bookdepository.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying waste ==

=== Types of waste ===
Daniel T. Jones (1995) identifies seven commonly accepted types of waste. These terms are updated from the Toyota production system (TPS)'s original nomenclature:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235309659_The_seven_value_stream_mapping_tools|title=The seven value stream mapping tools|last=Hines|first=Peter|last2=Rich|first2=Nick|date=1997-01-01|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Faster-than-necessary pace''': creating too much of a good or service that damages production flow, quality, and productivity. Previously referred to as overproduction, and leads to storage and lead time waste. 
# '''Waiting''': any time goods are not being transported or worked on. 
# '''Conveyance''': the process by which goods are moved around. Previously referred to as transport, and includes double-handling and excessive movement. 
# '''Processing''': an overly complex solution for a simple procedure. Previously referred to as inappropriate processing, and includes unsafe production. This typically leads to poor layout and communication, and unnecessary motion. 
# '''Excess Stock''': an overabundance of inventory which results in greater lead times, increased difficulty identifying problems, and significant storage costs. Previously referred to as unnecessary inventory. 
# '''Unnecessary motion''': ergonomic waste that requires employees to use excess energy such as picking up objects, bending, or stretching. Previously referred to as unnecessary movements, and usually avoidable. 
# '''Correction of mistakes''': any cost associated with defects or the resources required to correct them. 

=== Waste removal operations ===
Monden (1994) identifies three types of operations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781461597162|title=Toyota Production System - An Integrated Approach to Just-In-Time {{!}} Y. Monden {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Non-value adding operations (NVA)''': actions that should be eliminated, such as waiting.
# '''Necessary but non-value adding (NNVA)''': actions that are wasteful but necessary under current operating procedures&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# '''Value-adding (VA)''': conversion of processing of raw materials via manual labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Value-stream mapping has supporting methods that are often used in  [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]] environments to analyze and design flows at the system level (across multiple processes).

Although value-stream mapping is often associated with manufacturing, it is also used in logistics, supply chain, service related industries, healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2011 | last = Graban | first = Mark | title = Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement | location = Boca Raton, Florida | publisher = CRC Press | isbn = 9781439870433 | url = http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439870433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{

Thus, the activities become easily separated into the value stream, which is the focus of one type of attention, and the 'waste' steps, another type. He calls the value stream the process and the non-value streams the operations. The thinking here is that the non–value-adding steps are often preparatory or tidying up to the value-adding step and are closely associated with the person or machine/workstation that executes that value-adding step. Therefore, each vertical line is the 'story' of a person or workstation whilst the horizontal line represents the 'story' of the product being created.

Value stream mapping is a recognised method used as part of [[Six Sigma]] methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;"Value Stream Mapping" Article Source: http://www.isixsigma.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=90&amp;Itemid=222#&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In software engineering ===
The success of Lean in manufacturing and production has led to an interest in its adoption in software development. However, it was noted that the current literature on adoption of Lean in software development had a disconnect between the high-level principles and the concrete practices related to lean and agile software development. The literature also had a limited focus on wastes that were literally mapped from the categories identified for manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Ali N.B., Operationalization of lean thinking through value stream mapping with simulation and FLOW [dissertation]. Karlskrona: Department of Software Engineering, Blekinge Institute of Technology; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was ignoring the transformation that lean thinking has itself undergone and moved away from the focus on "removal of waste" to "creating and delivering value".&lt;ref&gt;Hines P, Holweg M, Rich N. Learning to evolve: A review of contemporary lean thinking. International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management. 2004;24(10):994-1011.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of value stream mapping as suggested by the pioneer authors of the field Womack and Jones&lt;ref&gt;Womack JP, Jones DT. Lean thinking: banish waste and create wealth in your corporation. Rev. and updat [] ed. London: Free Press Business; 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; was identified as the missing link in the current literature on lean in software development.

Value-stream mapping analyzes both material (artifact) and information flow.&lt;ref&gt;Rother, Mike, and John Shook. Learning to see: value stream mapping to add value and eliminate muda. Lean Enterprise Institute, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The following two resources exemplify the use of VSM in the context of software process improvement in industrial settings:

Hines and Rich (1997) defined seven value stream mapping tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1997 | first1 = Nick | last1 =  Rich | first2 = Ann | last2 = Esain | first3 = Nicola   | last3 = Bateman | title = Lean Evolution: Lessons from the Workplace | location =  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are:

'''Zero Waste''' is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of [[natural resource|resource]] life cycles so that all products are [[reused]]. The goal is for no trash to be sent to [[landfills]], [[incinerators]], or the ocean. The process recommended is one [[biomimetics|similar]] to the way that resources are reused in nature. The definition adopted by the ''Zero Waste International Alliance'' (ZWIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zwia.org/|title=Zero Waste International Alliance|author=|date=|website=zwia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zero Waste: The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of all products, packaging, and materials, without burning them, and without discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zero Waste refers to waste management and planning approaches which emphasize waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management.&lt;ref name=Snow&gt;{{cite web|author1=Snow, W. |author2=Dickinson J. |date=2001 |title=The end of waste: Zero waste by 2020|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through [[recycling]] and [[reuse]], it focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web |author=Davidson, G. |date=2011 |title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review|url=https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target.&lt;ref name=Spiegelman&gt;{{cite web|author=Spiegelman, H. |date=2006 |title=Transitioning to Zero Waste - What can local governments do NOW?|url=http://www.rcbc.ca/files/u3/PPI_Zero_Waste_and_Local_Govt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

Advocates expect that government regulation is needed&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt; to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design, manufacturing processes, and material selection.&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;{{cite journal |author=Townsend, W. K. |date=2010 |title=Zero waste: an aspiration or an oxymoron? |journal=Waste Management &amp; Research |volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1177/0734242X09356145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution, and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials.

== Cradle-to-cradle / cradle-to-grave ==

Cradle-to-grave is a term used to describe a linear model for materials that begins with resource extraction, moves to product manufacturing, and, ends by a ‘grave’, where the product is disposed of in a [[landfill]].  Cradle-to-grave is in direct contrast to cradle-to-cradle. [[Cradle-to-cradle]] is a term used in life-cycle analysis to describe a material or product that is recycled into a new product at the end of its life, so that ultimately there is no waste.&lt;ref name=McDonough&gt;{{cite web |author1=McDonough, W. |author2=Braungart, M. |date=2003 |title=The cradle-to-cradle alternative.|url=http://www.mcdonough.com/speaking-writing/the-cradle-to-cradle-alternative/#.UzxdSUlzZAg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cradle-to-cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed loop cycles which mean fun that waste is minimized, and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle-to-cradle simply goes beyond dealing with issues of waste after it has been created, by addressing problems at the source and by re-defining problems by focusing on [[design]].&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;  The cradle-to-cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

The cradle-to-cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;  In the industrial sector, it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world, in which one organism’s ‘waste’, cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things, cradle-to-cradle materials circulate in closed-loop cycles, providing nutrients for nature or industry.&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

An example of a closed loop, cradle-to-cradle product design is DesignTex Fabric. It has designed an upholstery fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, which is a blend of [[pesticide]]- and residue-free wool and organically grown [[ramie]], dyed and processed entirely with [[nontoxic]] chemicals.

== Problems ==

=== Social and economic ===

The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In 2012 the World Bank stated that 1.3billion tonnes of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that that number will reach 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 (Global Solid Waste Management Market - Analysis and Forecast). The increase in solid waste production increase the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non-white populations.  Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance.  Additionally, within the last five years, more than 400 hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stretesky|first=P.|last2=McKie|first2=R.|date=2016|title=A perspective on the historical analysis of race and treatment storage and disposal facilities in the United States.|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001/meta|journal=Environmental. Research. Letters.|volume=11|issue=3|pages=|via=|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/031001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment.[[Zero waste#cite note-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste, waste management has to move from a linear system to being more cyclical so that materials, products and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that it may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling, but, more importantly, it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste designs strive for reduced materials use, use of recycled materials, use of more benign materials, longer product lives, reparability, and ease of disassembly at end of life.[[Zero waste#cite note-Davidson-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment, reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]] A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses, communities, industrial sectors, schools and homes.

Benefits proposed by advocates include:
* Saving money. Since waste is a sign of inefficiency, the reduction of waste can reduce costs.
* Faster Progress. A zero waste strategy improves upon production processes and improving environmental prevention strategies which can lead to take larger, more innovative steps.
* Supports sustainability. A zero waste strategy supports all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability - economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]
* Improved material flows. A zero waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.[[Zero waste#cite note-ZWA-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

=== Health ===

A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulfide, which is released during the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mataloni|first=F. |last2=Badaloni|first2=C. |last3=Golini|first3=M. |last4=Bolignano|first4=A. |last5=Bucci|first5=S. |last6=Sozzi|first6=R. |last7=Forastiere|first7=F.|last8=Davoli|first8=M.|last9=Ancona|first9=C.|date=2016|title=Morbidity and mortality of people who live close to municipal waste landfills: a multisite cohort study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=806–15 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyw052 |pmid=27222499 |pmc=5005946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials, and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the ground water and the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masoner|first=Jason R. |last2=Kolpin|first2=Dana W. |last3=Furlong|first3=Edward T. |last4=Cozzarelli|first4=Isabelle M. |last5=Gray|first5=James L. |date=2016-04-01 |title=Landfill leachate as a mirror of today's disposable society: Pharmaceuticals and other contaminants of emerging concern in final leachate from landfills in the conterminous United States |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |language=en |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=906–918 |doi=10.1002/etc.3219 |issn=1552-8618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over, reducing the need for landfill space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Song|first=Qingbin |last2=Li|first2=Jinhui |last3=Zeng|first3=Xianlai |date=2014 |title=Minimizing the Increasing Solid Waste Through Zero Waste Strategy |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=104 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.08.027 |pages=199–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process.

Health Issues related to landfills:
* Birth Defects and Low birth weight: Associated with close proximity to landfills, exposure to particle matter and Nitrogen dioxide
* Respiratory disease and Lung Cancer: Related to the release of Hydrogen Sulfide
Zero waste’s promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidences of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste also can help preserve local environments and drinking water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem.

== History ==

=== 2002–2003 ===

The movement gained publicity and reached a peak in 1998–2002, and since then has been moving from "theory into action" by focusing on how a "zero waste community" is structured and behaves. The website of the Zero Waste International Alliance has a listing of communities across the globe that have created public policy to promote zero-waste practices. See also the Eco-Cycle website for examples of how this large nonprofit is leading Boulder County, Colorado on a Zero-Waste path and watch a 6-minute video about the zero-waste big picture. Finally, there is a USA zero-waste organization named the GrassRoots Recycling Network that puts on workshops and conferences about zero-waste activities.

The [[California Integrated Waste Management Board]] established a zero waste goal in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waste360.com/mag/waste_california_adopts_zero |title=California Adopts Zero Waste Goal in Strategic Plan |author= |date=1 April 2002 |website=waste360.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [http://www.sfenvironment.org/ City and County of San Francisco’s Department of the Environment] established a goal of zero waste in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfenvironment.org/zero-waste/overview/legislation |title=Policies Related to Zero Waste |author= |date=15 October 2011 |website=SF Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the [[San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance|City's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfenvironment.org/article/recycling-and-composting/mandatory-recycling-and-composting-ordinance|title=Recycling &amp; Composting in San Francisco - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|author=|date=16 May 2013|website=sfenvironment.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its ambitious goal of zero waste and policies, San Francisco reached a record-breaking 80% diversion rate in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfmayor.org/index.aspx?recordid=113&amp;page=846|title=Mayor Lee Announces San Francisco Reaches 80 Percent Landfill Waste Diversion, Leads All Cities in North America - Office of the Mayor |author= |date= |website=sfmayor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest diversion rate in any North American city. San Francisco received a perfect score in the waste category in the Siemens US and Canada Green City Index, which named San Francisco the greenest city in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US and Canada Green City Index |date=2011 |url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf |author=Economist Intelligence Unit |publisher=Siemens AG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day ===

The tension between zero waste, viewed as post-discard total [[recycling]] of materials only, and zero waste as the reuse of all high level function remains a serious one today. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example is the difference between smashing a [[glass bottle]] (recovering cheap glass) and [[refill]]ing the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container).
	
The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non-natural (such as chemicals and [[plastics]] that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context.
	
[[Biodegradable plastic]] is the most prominent example. One side argues that [[biodegradation]] of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest.

[[File:Glass milk bottles.jpg|right|thumb|Returnable glass milk bottles]]
Milk can be shipped in many forms.  One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common:  one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way [[milk bag]]s, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the [[reuse of bottles]] is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is [[silica]]-[[sand]], which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with [[milk]] and distributed to the consumer. A [[reverse logistics]] system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually the heavy duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized.  The  material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a [[life cycle assessment]] can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Recycling and rotting (composting) ==
{{Main|Recycling}}
	
It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste.
	
Some{{who|date=January 2016}} claim that the key component to zero waste is [[recycling]] while others{{who|date=January 2016}} reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of [[soil]] and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the "recycled" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures.
	 
The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the [[computer industry]] where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as [[electronic waste]] each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of [[raw materials]] while most merely enter dumps through export to [[third world countries]]. Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably [[steel]]&lt;!-- not much steel in a computer--&gt;, [[copper]] and [[glass]], reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the [[refurbishment (electronics)|Computer Refurbishing]] industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair.
	
There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application.
	
The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as [[greenwashing]] i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in [[Alameda County, California]], garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling.

=== Reduce, reuse and recycle ===

Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the [[waste hierarchy|waste hierarchy of refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and rot (compost)]]. In practice, these laws invariably emphasize destruction and recycling, while the reuse component is marginalized.{{opinion|date=July 2016}}
	
A special feature of Zero Waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as "nuclear waste". All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard, both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling, on the other hand, deals only with simple materials.
	
Zero Waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth's rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources, however defined.

The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement.
	 
Zero waste on the other hand, is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero Waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired, refurbished, re-manufactured and generally reused.. ("What is Zero Waste?", para 2).

Online web services, like [[Freecycle Network|Free Cycle]] or the [http://www.regives.com/ reGives] Network have risen in popularity over the last decade where locals can give items that they no longer need to others locally in an effort to keep items out of landfills and work toward a zero waste lifestyle.

== Significance of dump capacity ==

Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the USA and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil, was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004 and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into "light Texas crude" by the application of high pressure steam.

=== Corporate initiatives ===
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}
An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is [[General Motors]] (GM). GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its 181 plants worldwide "landfill-free" by the end of 2010. Companies like [[Subaru]], [[Toyota]], and [[Xerox]] are also producing landfill-free plants. Furthermore, The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by: selling scrap materials, adopting [[reusable part]]s boxes to replace [[cardboard]], and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste.

=== Re-use or rot of waste ===

The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials, such as in the production of [[solar energy]] or [[natural fertilizer]] /[[de-composted]] [[manure]] for crops.

It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use.&lt;ref name="roper"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1504/IJETM.2006.009000| volume = 6 | issue = 3/4| pages = 313–345 | last = Roper | first = William E. | title = Strategies for building material reuse and recycle | journal = International Journal of Environmental Technology and Management | year = 2006 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The success of General Motors in creating zero-landfill facilities shows that zero-waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint," says Latisha Petteway, a spokesperson for the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/autos/environment/2008-09-04-gm-zero-landfill_N.htm|title=GM plans to dump use of landfills|last=Cary|first=S. S.|date=4 September 2008|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 is a goal, a process, a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re-designed, resource-efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. [[Deconstruction]] can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials, thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse but it is not a favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components, not their creation from rough materials such as lumber, cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms, entire walls, roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre-built and installed as completed components, that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling, deconstruction is a stop-gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now, the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements, windows, doors, and metals, many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley, California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring, brick walls, and structural timbers.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt; The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts, such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard (with partial recycling of rubble and steel), render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics, based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

Roper's comments in the paragraph above are either misquoted or wrong concerning wood flooring, structural wood and bricks needing to be crushed.  Brick, wood and stone are among the oldest truly recyclable materials used in construction.  A historic review of old buildings, barns and bridges clearly shows that brick, stones and timber are reused from older buildings.  Some of the oldest structures on the planet are built with materials that were recycled from previous structures.  One recent example is the [[Mayflower Barn]] at Jordans just north of High Wycombe, UK.  The barn is clearly built of reused timbers, possibly sourced from the salvage of the Mayflower ship.  It is simply a fact of life that historically materials that could be reused were reused.

In more recent construction, structural timber components, including large timbers, glued laminated beams, floor joists, studs and flooring are some of the most valuable structural components salvaged when a structure is demolished if there is an interest in salvaging.  If you need proof, go down to any local construction salvage yard and look at the value of trusses, wood beams, floor joists, studs and flooring.  Today they have value when someone saves them.

One of the barriers of reusing structural materials is the bias of building code officials and building departments that discriminate against reusing materials.  Codes and building departments require compliance to codes, including the source of materials.  Your average contractor cannot just use 100-year-old 2x8 (50x200) salvaged floor joists because the building department requires a graded joist.  The contractor then has to find an engineer or wood technologist to verify the material suitability for its use.  While the codes technically allow this under alternative method, modern attention to cost usually prevents that option.

==Market-based campaigns==

Market-based, legislation-mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Precautionary Principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they will ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald’s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign.&lt;ref name="roper"/&gt;

==How to achieve==

National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding, but on a practical level, waste management programs (e.g. pickup, dropoff, or containers for recycling and composting) are usually implemented by local governments, possibly with regionally shared facilities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Towards a Zero Waste Strategy for an English Local Authority |last = Cole|first = C| journal = Resources, Conservation and Recycling |volume=89 |year=2014 |pages=64–75|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.05.005|pmid = |access-date = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and [[industrial designer]]s to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product lifecycle.  Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain.  If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.&lt;ref name=Snow/&gt;

===Zero Waste Hierarchy===
The "Zero Waste Hierarchy" describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the Zero Waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials.  It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policy-makers to industry and the individual.  It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to Zero Waste.   It enhances the Zero Waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions.All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the 4th R (recovery)prior to disposal was good, many organizations focused on this 4th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this, along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades, Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle including Compost &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zerowastecanada.ca/zero-waste-hierarchy/ |title=Zero Waste Hierarchy |website=Zero Waste Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An example of [[network governance]] approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management (local authority representatives,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; waste industry, government offices etc.) on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davoudi|first=S|author2=Evans |title=The Challenge of governance in regional waste planning|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|year=2005|volume=23|pages=493–517|doi=10.1068/c42m}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open, so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geels|first=F|title=The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: A report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2008|publisher=DEFRA|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favour of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration.&lt;ref name="Davoudi 2005 493–517"/&gt; Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=C-Y |author2=Ni, S-P |author3=Fan, K-A|title=Working towards a zero waste environment in Taiwan|journal=[[Waste Management &amp; Research]]|year=2010|volume=28|pages=236–244|doi=10.1177/0734242x09337659}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Taiwan, public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business, who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work.&lt;ref name="Young 2010 236–244"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frosch|first=R|author2=Gallopoulos |title=Strategies for manufacturing|journal=Scientific American|year=1989|volume=261|pages=144–152|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest development in Zero Waste is the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi which promises to be a Zero Waste city. Innovation and technology is encouraged by government creating an innovation friendly environment without being prescriptive.&lt;ref name="Geels 2008"/&gt; To be a successful model of sustainable urban development it will also require the involvement and co-operation from all members of society emphasizing the importance of network governance.
