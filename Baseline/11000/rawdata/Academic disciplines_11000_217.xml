'''Active citizenship''' refers to a [[philosophy]] espoused by organizations and educational institutions which advocates that members of [[Charitable organization|charitable organizations]], companies or [[nation-state]]s have certain roles and responsibilities to [[society]] and the [[Natural environment|environment]], although those members may not have specific governing roles.

== Description ==

Active citizenship can be seen as an articulation of the debate over [[rights]] versus [[moral responsibility|responsibilities]]. If a body gives rights to the people under its remit, then those same people might have certain responsibilities to uphold. This would be most obvious at a [[country]] or nation-state level, but could also be of wider scope, such as the Internet ([[Netizen]]) or Earth ([[global citizenship]]). The implication is that an active citizen is one who fulfils both their rights and responsibilities in a balanced way.

A problem with this concept is that although rights are often written down as part of the law, responsibilities are not as well defined, and there may be disagreements amongst the citizens as to what the responsibilities are. For example, in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], citizens have the right to free health care, but [[voting]] in [[elections]] is not compulsory, even though many people would define this as a responsibility.

Writing a clear definition of responsibilities for an active citizen is much more problematic than writing a list of rights. For example, although voting might be considered a basic responsibility by many people, there are some who through [[disability]] or other issues are not able to [[Participation (decision making)|participate]] fully in the voting process.

An active citizen is someone who takes a role in the community; the term has been identified with volunteering by writers such as Jonathan Tisch, who wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in 2010 advocating that busy Americans should try to help others, particularly by offering high-level professional expertise in such areas as [[banking]], [[education]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] to help the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=twsJun16xxx&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= I introduced Citizen You, the movement I've spearheaded to encourage Americans to utilize their professional skills to help others. This new kind of volunteering, which has come to be known as "active citizenship," is a fresh, innovative solution to an old problem: Countless busy Americans would love to help others, but simply don't have the time to figure out the perfect way to be useful. What could be more useful than applying high-level professional expertise -- in banking, law, education, engineering, technology, and other fields -- toward problems faced by those who are less fortunate?

Active citizenship is considered an OoF by some due to its vague definition. Examples include volunteering, donating, and recycling.

== Examples of active citizenship in education ==
Due to concerns over such things as a lack of OoF in elections (reflected by low voter turnout), the British Government launched a [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] programme several years ago. Citizenship education is now compulsory in UK schools up to 14 and is often available as an option beyond that age.

In [[Scotland]], UK, active citizenship has been one of the three major themes of [[community]] [[policy]] since [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library/documents-w3/cctl-00.htm The Osler Report (section 6.6)] in 1998. The [[Scottish Government|Scottish Government's]] 2009 guidelines for [[Community learning and development]], [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/02/18793/32157 Working and Learning Together], has active citizenship as a target within other policy aims. Britain has a points-based [[immigration]] system, and in 2009 was Oofed a probationary period for newly admitted immigrants which would examine, in part, how well they were being so-called ''active citizens''.&lt;ref name=twsJun16yyy&gt;{{cite news

If the plan goes through, applicants would serve a term as "probationary citizens," winning or losing points on the path to the passport depending on how well they fit into British society. Critics have also attacked the ways points could be awarded. Some worry that the "active citizenship" fast track would coerce candidates into volunteering,

In [[Denmark]], "active citizenship" is part of the curriculum in ''Danish teacher's Education''. The course is defined as 36 lessons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emu.dk/sem/fag/klm/ Curriculum in Danish]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], there is an [http://activecit.mohawkcollege.ca/ Active Citizenship Course] being run at Mohawk College in Hamilton, Ontario. It is a compulsory course that is delivered by the Language Studies Department to all students at the college.
Organizations that cite active citizenship as part of their mission or vision statement include the following:

In the [[United States]], writer [[Catherine Crier]] wondered in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' about whether Americans had lost sight of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s sense of ''active citizenship''. Crier lamented how Americans have tended to neglect participating in voluntary associations, and tend to live as "strangers apart from the rest", quoting [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name=twsJun16zzz1&gt;{{cite news

So clearly did he see the strength of a democracy and the weakness of human character, his words might have been written today. He said, in summary, that our real power as a people came through voluntary associations. Our personal freedoms would be protected if we could voluntarily resolve the problems of society, rather than permit the heavy hand of government to do it for us. But he recognized our great weakness--the willingness to live 'as strangers apart from the rest'.... we Americans have failed to shoulder our responsibilities. The qualities of active citizenship that Jefferson ascribed to us have not been realized, nor have our appointed leaders lived up to their noble assignment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="824">'''Apical''' delta refers to the branching pattern of small accessory canals and minor foramina seen at the tip or apex of some [[tooth]] roots.
The pattern is said to be reminiscent of a [[river delta]] when sectioned and viewed using a [[microscope]]. Because the anatomy of this area is very small and complex with several portals of entry to the [[root canal]] i.e. more than one [[apical foramen]] this may make successful [[endodontic]] treatment less likely.

The root tip is removed during [[apicoectomy]] to eliminate the apical delta and maximise the chance of successful healing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24964">'''Biological value''' ('''BV''') is a measure of the proportion of absorbed [[protein]] from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body. It captures how readily the digested protein can be used in [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] in the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of the organism. Proteins are the major source of [[nitrogen]] in food. BV assumes protein is the only source of nitrogen and measures the proportion of this nitrogen absorbed by the body which is then excreted. The remainder must have been incorporated into the proteins of the organisms body. A [[ratio]] of nitrogen incorporated into the body over nitrogen absorbed gives a measure of protein "usability" â the BV.

Unlike some measures of protein usability, biological value does not take into account how readily the protein can be [[digestion|digested]] and absorbed (largely by the [[small intestine]]). This is reflected in the experimental methods used to determine BV.

BV uses two similar scales:
#The true percentage utilization (usually shown with a percent symbol).
#The percentage utilization relative to a readily utilizable protein source, often [[Egg (food)|egg]] (usually shown as unitless).
These two values will be similar but not identical.

The BV of a food varies greatly, and depends on a wide variety of factors. In particular the BV value of a food varies depending on its preparation and the recent diet of the organism. This makes reliable determination of BV difficult and of limited use â fasting prior to testing is universally required in order to ascertain reliable figures.

BV is commonly used in nutrition science in many [[Mammals|mammalian organisms]], and is a relevant measure in humans.&lt;ref name=Methodology&gt;Thomas, K. Ãber die biologische Wertigkeit der stickstoff-substanzen in 1909 verschiedenen Nahrungsmitteln. Arch. Physiol., 219.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a popular guideline in [[bodybuilding]] in protein choice.&lt;ref name=Researchers&gt;Optimum Sports Nutrition: Your Competitive Edge, A Complete Nutritional Guide For Optimizing Athletic Performance; Chapter 12. by Dr. Michael Colgan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpafitness.com/articles/articles-and-newletters/research-articles-index/nutrition-wellness/animal-vs-vegetable-protein-debate-what-is-the-best-protein-for-muscle-growth/ The Great Animal Versus Vegetable Protein Debate What Is The Best Protein For Muscle Growth?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determination of BV==
For accurate determination of BV:&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1923"&gt;Mitchell, H.H. (1923). ''"[http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/58/3/873.pdf A Method of Determining the Biological Value of Protein]"''. Journal of Biol. Chem. 58 (3): 873.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the test organism must only consume the protein or mixture of proteins of interest (the test diet).
#the test diet must contain no non-protein sources of nitrogen.
#the test diet must be of suitable content and quantity to avoid use of the protein primarily as an energy source.
These conditions mean the tests are typically carried out over the course of over one week with strict diet control. Fasting prior to testing helps produce consistency between subjects (it removes recent diet as a variable).

There are two scales on which BV is measured; percentage utilization and relative utilization. By convention percentage BV has a percent sign (%) suffix and relative BV has no unit.

===Percentage utilization===
Biological value is determined based on this formula.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1923" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chick H., Roscoe, M.H. (1930). ''"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1254795&amp;blobtype=pdf The biological values of proteins: A method for measuring the nitrogenous exchange of rats for the purpose of determining the biological value of proteins]"''. Biochem J. 24 (6): 1780-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:BV = ( ''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
Where:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen absorbed in proteins on the test diet
:''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen incorporated into the body on the test diet

However direct measurement of ''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is essentially impossible. It will typically be measured indirectly from nitrogen excretion in [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;Fixsen, M.A.B. ''"[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1254798&amp;blobtype=pdf The biological value of purified caseinogen and the influence of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon biological values, determined by the balance sheet method]"''. Biochem J. 1930; 24(6): 1794â1804.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faeces|Faecal]] excretion of nitrogen must also be taken into account - this part of the ingested protein is not absorbed by the body and so not included in the calculation of BV.  An estimate is used of the amount of the urinary and faecal nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen.  This may be done by substituting a protein-free diet and observing nitrogen excretion in urine or faeces, but the accuracy of this method of estimation of the amount of nitrogen excretion not coming from ingested nitrogen on a protein-containing diet has been questioned.
:BV = ( ( ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) / (''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'') ) * 100
Where:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = nitrogen intake in proteins on the test diet
:''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  (nitrogen excreted in faeces whilst on the test diet) - (nitrogen excreted in faeces not from ingested nitrogen)
:''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = (nitrogen excreted in urine whilst on the test diet) - (nitrogen excreted in urine not from ingested nitrogen)

Note:
:''N&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;''
:''N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''  = ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;''

This can take any value from 0 to 100, though reported BV could be out of this range if the estimates of nitrogen excretion from non-ingested sources are inaccurate, such as could happen if the endogenous secretion changes with protein intake. A BV of 100% indicates complete utilization of a dietary protein, i.e. 100% of the protein ingested and absorbed is incorporated into proteins into the body.  The value of 100% is an absolute maximum, no more than 100% of the protein ingested can be utilized (in the equation above ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(u)&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''N&lt;sub&gt;e(f)&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot go negative, setting 100% as the maximum BV).

===Relative utilization===

Due to experimental limitations BV is often measured ''relative'' to an easily utilizable protein. Normally [[Egg (food)|egg]] protein is assumed to be the most readily utilizable protein and given a BV of 100. For example:

Two tests of BV are carried out on the same person; one with the test protein source and one with a reference protein (egg protein).
:relative BV = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(test)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(egg)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
Where:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(test)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the test diet for that individual
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(egg)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the reference (egg) diet for that individual

This is not restricted to values of less than 100. The percentage BV of egg protein is only 93.7% which allows other proteins with true percentage BV between 93.7% and 100% to take a relative BV of over 100. For example, [[whey protein]] takes a relative BV of 104, while its percentage BV is under 100%.

The principal advantage of measuring BV relative to another protein diet is accuracy; it helps account for some of the metabolic variability between individuals. In a simplistic sense the egg diet is testing the maximum efficiency the individual can take up protein, the BV is then provided as a percentage taking this as the maximum.

===Conversion===

Providing it is known which protein measurements were made relative to it is simple to convert from relative BV to percentage BV:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) * 100
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ( ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' / 100 ) * ''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;''
Where:
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(relative)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = relative BV of the test protein
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(reference)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of reference protein (typically egg: 93.7%).
:''BV&lt;sub&gt;(percentage)&lt;/sub&gt;'' = percentage BV of the test protein

While this conversion is simple it is not strictly valid due to the differences between the experimental methods. It is, however, suitable for use as a guideline.

==Factors that affect BV==
The determination of BV is carefully designed to accurately measure some aspects of protein usage whilst eliminating variation from other aspects. When using the test (or considering BV values) care must be taken to ensure the variable of interest is quantified by BV. Factors which affect BV can be grouped into properties of the protein source and properties of the species or individual consuming the protein.

===Properties of the protein source===
Three major properties of a protein source affect its BV:
*Amino acid composition, and the limiting amino acid, which is usually lysine
*Preparation (cooking)
*Vitamin and mineral content

Amino acid composition is the principal effect. All proteins are made up of combinations of the 21 biological amino acids. Some of these can be synthesised or converted in the body, whereas others cannot and must be ingested in the diet. These are known as essential amino acids (EAAs), of which there are 9 in humans. The number of EAAs varies according to species (see below).

EAAs missing from the diet prevent the synthesis of proteins that require them. If a protein source is missing critical EAAs, then its biological value will be low as the missing EAAs form a bottleneck in protein synthesis. For example, if a hypothetical muscle protein requires [[phenylalanine]] (an essential amino acid), then this must be provided in the diet for the muscle protein to be produced. If the current protein source in the diet has no phenylalanine in it the muscle protein cannot be produced, giving a low usability and BV of the protein source.

In a related way if amino acids are missing from the protein source which are particularly slow or energy consuming to synthesise this can result in a low BV.

Methods of food preparation also affect the availability of amino acids in a food source. Some of food preparation may damage or destroy some EAAs, reducing the BV of the protein source.

Many vitamins and minerals are vital for the correct function of cells in the test organism. If critical minerals or vitamins are missing from the protein source this can result in a massively lowered BV. Many BV tests artificially add vitamins and minerals (for example in [[yeast]] extract) to prevent this.

===Properties of the test species or individual===

====Under test conditions====
Variations in BV under test conditions are dominated by the [[metabolism]] of the individuals or species being tested. In particular differences in the essential amino acids (EAAs) species to species has a significant effect, although even minor variations in amino acid metabolism individual to individual have a large effect.

The fine dependence on the individual's metabolism makes measurement of BV a vital tool in diagnosing some [[metabolic diseases]].

====In everyday life====
The principal effect on BV in everyday life is the organism's current diet, although many other factors such as age, health, weight, sex, etc. all have an effect. In short any condition which can affect the organism's metabolism will vary the BV of a protein source.

In particular, whilst on a high protein diet the BV of all foods consumed is reduced â the limiting rate at which the amino acids may be incorporated into the body is not the availability of amino acids but the rate of protein synthesis possible in cells. This is a major point of criticism of BV as a test; the test diet is artificially protein rich and may have unusual effects.

===Factors with no effect===
BV is designed to ignore variation in digestibility of a food â which in turn largely depends on the food preparation. For example, compare raw soy beans and extracted soy bean protein. The raw soy beans, with tough [[cell wall]]s protecting the protein, have a far lower digestibility than the purified, unprotected, soy bean protein extract. As a foodstuff far more protein can be absorbed from the extract than the raw beans, however the BV will be the same.

The exclusion of digestibility is a point of misunderstanding and leads to misrepresentation of the meaning of a high or low BV

==Advantages and disadvantages==
BV provides a good measure of the usability of proteins in a diet and also plays a valuable role in detection of some metabolic diseases. BV is, however, a scientific variable determined under very strict and unnatural conditions. It is not a test designed to evaluate the usability of proteins whilst an organism is in everyday life â indeed the BV of a diet will vary greatly depending on age, weight, health, sex, recent diet, current metabolism, etc. of the organism. In addition BV of the same food varies significantly species to species. Given these limitations BV is still relevant to everyday diet to some extent. No matter the individual or their conditions a protein source with high BV, such as egg, will always be more easily used than a protein source with low BV.

===In comparison to other methods known===
There are many other major methods of determining how readily used a protein is, including:
*[[Net protein utilization|Net protein Utilization]] (NPU)
*[[Protein efficiency ratio|Protein Efficiency Ratio]] (PER)
*[[Nitrogen balance|Nitrogen Balance]] (NB)
*[[Protein digestibility]] (PD)
*[[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS)
These all hold specific advantages and disadvantages over BV,&lt;ref name=Proteins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM |title=The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements| author=S.G.

==In animals==
The Biological Value method is also used for analysis in animals such as cattle, poultry, and various laboratory animals such as rats. It was used by the poultry industry to determine which mixtures of feed were utilized most efficiently by developing chicken.
Although the process remains the same, the biological values of particular proteins in humans differs from their biological values in animals due to physiological variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U5900t/u5900t07.htm Recent developments in protein quality evaluation by Dr E.

==Criticism==
Since the method measures only the amount that is retained in the body critics have pointed out what they perceive as a weakness of the biological value [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements, ''The use of biological value of protein in evaluatiing its quality for human requirements'', S.G. Srikantia, University of Mysore].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Critics have pointed to research that indicates that because whey protein isolate is digested so quickly it may in fact enter the bloodstream and be converted into carbohydrates through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]] much more rapidly than was previously thought possible, so while amino acid concentrations increased with whey it was discovered that oxidation rates also increased and a steady-state metabolism, a process where there is no change in overall protein balance, is created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.t-nation.com/readTopic.do?id=462192 Testosterone Nation, The ''Protein Roundtable'', August 24, 2000].&lt;/ref&gt;  They claim that when the human body consumes whey protein it is absorbed so rapidly that most of it is sent to the [[liver]] for [[oxidation]].  Hence they believe the reason so much is retained is that it is used for energy production, not [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]]. This would bring into question whether the method defines which [[protein]]s are more biologically utilizable.

A further critique published in the ''Journal of Sports Science and Medicine'' states that the BV of a protein does not take into consideration several key factors that influence the digestion and interaction of protein with other foods before absorption, and that it only measures a protein's maximal potential quality and not its estimate at requirement levels.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Sports Science and Medicine (2004) 3, 118-130&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the study by Poullain et al., which is often cited to demonstrate the superiority of whey protein hydrolysate by marketers, measured nitrogen balance in rats after three days of starvation, which corresponds to a longer period in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Poullain, MG et al. Effect of whey proteins, their oligopeptide hydrosylates and free amino acid mixtures on growth and nitrogen retention in fed and starved rats. J Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (1989) 13: 382-386&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that whey protein hydrolysate led to better nitrogen retention and growth than the other proteins studied. However the study's flaw is in the BV method used, as starvation affects how well the body will store incoming protein (as does a very high caloric intake), leading to falsely elevated BV measures.&lt;ref name=Pellett&gt;Pellett, PL and Young, VR. Nutritional evaluation of protein foods. United Nations University, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

So, the BV of a protein is related to the amount of protein given. BV is measured at levels below the maintenance level. This means that as protein intake goes up, the BV of that protein goes down. For example, milk protein shows a BV near 100 at intakes of 0.2 g/kg. As protein intake increases to roughly maintenance levels, 0.5 g/kg, BV drops only around 70.&lt;ref name="Pellett"/&gt;  Pellet et al., concluded that "biological measures of protein quality conducted at suboptimal levels in either experimental animals or human subjects may overestimate protein value at maintenance levels." As a result, while BV may be important for rating proteins where intake is below requirements, it has little bearing on individuals with protein intakes far above requirements.

This flaw is supported by the FAO/WHO/UNU, who state that BV and NPU are measured when the protein content of the diet is clearly below that of requirement, deliberately done to maximize existing differences in quality as inadequate energy intake lowers the efficiency of protein utilization and in most N balance studies, calorie adequacy is ensured. And because no population derives all of its protein exclusively from a single food, the determination of BV of a single protein is of limited use for application to human protein requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/MEETING/004/M2835E/M2835E00.HTM The Use Of Biological Value Of A Protein In Evaluating Its Quality For Human Requirements.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another limitation of the use of Biological Value as a measure of protein quality is that proteins which are completely devoid of one [[essential amino acids|essential amino acid]] (EAA) can still have a BV of up to 40.  This is because of the ability of organisms to conserve and recycle EAAs as an adaptation of inadequate intake of the amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;Said, A.K. and [[D. Mark Hegsted|Hegsted, D.M.]], J. Nutr., 99, 474, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the use of rats for the determination of protein quality is not ideal. Rats differ from humans in requirements of essential amino acids. This has led to a general criticism that experiments on rats lead to an over-estimation of the BV of high-quality proteins to man because human requirements of essential amino acids are much lower than those for rats (as rats grow at a much faster rate than humans). Also, because of their fur, rats are assumed to have relatively high
requirements of sulphur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine).

As a result, the analytical method that is universally recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), [[United Nations University]] (UNU) and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] when judging the quality of protein in the human is not PER or BV but the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score ([[PDCAAS]]), as it is viewed as accurately measuring the correct relative nutritional value of animal and vegetable sources of protein in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;FAO/WHO (1991) Protein Quality Evaluation Report of Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Consultation, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO Food
and Nutrition Paper No. 51, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaafsma, G. (2000) 'The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score. ''Journal of Nutrition'' 130, 1865S-1867S&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cell lineage''' denotes the developmental history of a tissue or organ from the fertilized embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition.|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers.|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cell+lineage|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell lineage can be studied by marking a cell (with fluorescent molecules or other traceable markers) and following its progeny after cell division. Some organisms as [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']] have a predetermined pattern of cell progeny and the adult male will always consist of 1031 cells, this is because cell division in ''C. elegans'' is genetically determined and known as [[eutely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes the cell lineage and cell fate to be highly correlated. Other organisms, such as humans, have variable lineages and somatic cell numbers.

== ''C. elegans'': Model Organism ==
As one of the first pioneers of cell lineage, in the 1960s [[Sydney Brenner|Dr. Sydney Brenner]] first began observing cell differentiation and succession in the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''. Dr. Brenner chose this organism due to its transparent body, quick reproduction, ease of access, and small size which made it ideal for following cell lineage under a microscope.

By 1976, Dr. Brenner and his associate, [[John Sulston|Dr. John Sulston]], had identified part of the cell lineage in the developing nervous system of ''C. elegans''. Recurring results showed that the nematode was [[Eutely|eutelic]] (each individual experiences the same differentiation pathways). This research led to the initial observations of programmed cell death, or apoptosis.

After mapping various sections of the ''C. elegans''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' cell lineage, Dr. Brenner and his associates were able to piece together the first complete and reproducible [[Fate mapping|fate map]] of cell lineage. They later received the 2002 Nobel prize for their work in genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2002 - Press Release|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/press.html|website = www.nobelprize.org|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Cell Lineage==
One of the first studies of cell lineages took place in the 1870s by Whitman who studied cleavage patterns in leeches and small invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chisholm|first1=A D|title=Cell Lineage|journal=Academic Press|year=2001|pages=10|doi=10.1006/rwgn.2001.0172|url=http://post.queensu.ca/~chinsang/a-worm-reader/chisholm-cell-linage.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that some groups, such as nematode worms and ascidians form a pattern of cell division which is identical between individuals and invariable. This high correlation between cell lineage and cell fate was thought to be determined by segregating factors within the dividing cells. Other organisms had stereotyped patterns of cell division and produced sublineages which were the progeny of particular precursor cells. These more variable cell fates are thought to be due to the cells' interaction with the environment.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt;

== Techniques of Fate Mapping ==
Cell lineage can be determined by two methods, either through direct observation or through clonal analysis. During the early 19th century direct observation was used however it was highly limiting as only small transparent samples could be studied. With the invention of the confocal microscope this allowed larger more complicated organisms to be studied.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"/&gt;

Perhaps the most popular method of cell [[fate mapping]] in the genetic era is through site-specific recombination mediated by the [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-Lox]] or [[FLP-FRT recombination|FLP-FRT]] systems. By utilizing the [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-Lox]] or [[FLP-FRT recombination|FLP-FRT]] recombination systems, a reporter gene (usually encoding a fluorescent protein) is activated and permanently labels the cell of interest and its offspring cells, thus the name cell lineage tracing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kretzschemar|first1=K|last2=Watt|first2=F.M.|title=Lineage tracing|journal=Cell|date=Jan 12, 2012|volume=148|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.002|pages=33â45}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With the system, researchers could investigate the function of their favorite gene in determining cell fate by designing a genetic model where within a cell one recombination event is designed for manipulating the gene of interest and the other recombination event is designed for activating a reporter gene. One minor issue is that the two recombination events may not occur simultaneously thus the results need to be interpreted with caution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1= J | last2 = Willet| first2 = SG| last3=Bankaitis| first3=ED| year =2013 | title = Non-parallel recombination limits Cre-LoxP-based reporters as precise indicators of conditional genetic manipulation | journal = Genesis | volume = 51 | issue = 6  | page = 436-42| doi=10.1002/dvg.22384 |pmid = 23441020 | pmc=3696028}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

More recently, researchers have begun using synthetic biology approaches and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer new genetic systems that enable cells to autonomously record lineage information in their own genome. These systems are based on engineered, targeted mutation of defined genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Aaron|last2=Findlay|first2=Gregory M.|last3=Gagnon|first3=James A.|last4=Horwitz|first4=Marshall S.|last5=Schier|first5=Alexander F.|last6=Shendure|first6=Jay|date=2016-07-29|title=Whole-organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6298/aaf7907|journal=Science|language=en|volume=353|issue=6298|pages=aaf7907|doi=10.1126/science.aaf7907|issn=0036-8075| pmc=4967023 |pmid=27229144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frieda|first=Kirsten L.|last2=Linton|first2=James M.|last3=Hormoz|first3=Sahand|last4=Choi|first4=Joonhyuk|last5=Chow|first5=Ke-Huan K.|last6=Singer|first6=Zakary S.|last7=Budde|first7=Mark W.|last8=Elowitz|first8=Michael B.|last9=Cai|first9=Long|title=Synthetic recording and in situ readout of lineage information in single cells|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature20777|journal=Nature|volume=541|issue=7635|pages=107â111|doi=10.1038/nature20777|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By generating new, random genomic alterations in each cell generation these approaches facilitate reconstruction of lineage trees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16087">The term '''contact resistance''' refers to the contribution to the total [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of [[Electrical contact|electrical leads and connections]] as opposed to the intrinsic resistance, which is an inherent property, independent of the measurement method. This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as [[Contact_resistance#Mechanisms|resistance creep]]. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by [[William Shockley]]&lt;ref name="Shockley_1964"/&gt; to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, "Interface resistance", "transitional resistance", or just simply "correction term" are also used. The term "parasitic resistance" has been used as a more general term, where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution.

[[File:Contact resistance example.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the contact resistance estimation by the transmission line method.]]

==Experimental characterization==
Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in two-electrode systems (e.g. diodes) and three-electrode systems (e.g. transistors).

For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the [[I-V curve]] at V=0:

:&lt;math&gt;r_c = \left\{ \frac{\partial V}{\partial J} \right\}_{V=0}&lt;/math&gt;

where J is the current density = current/area. The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cdot \text{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; stands for ohms. When the current is a linear function of the voltage, the device is said to have [[ohmic contact]]s.

The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a [[Four-terminal sensing|four terminal measurement]] to a simple two-lead measurement made with an ohmmeter. In a two-lead experiment, the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device, with which they are in series. In a four-point probe measurement, one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads, in parallel with the first, is used to measure the potential drop across the device. In the four-probe case, there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included. The difference between resistance derived from two-lead and four-lead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller. Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area. It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature.

[[Inductive coupling|Inductive]] and [[capacitive coupling|capacitive]] methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic [[electrical impedance|impedance]] without the complication of contact resistance. In practice, [[direct current]] methods are more typically used to determine resistance.

The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation. The most common approach is the [[transmission line measurement|transmission line model]] (TLM). Here, the total device resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot}&lt;/math&gt; is plotted as a function of the channel length:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{tot} = R_\text{c} + R_\text{ch} = R_\text{c} + \frac{L}{W C \mu \left(V_\text{gs} - V_\text{ds}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\text{ch}&lt;/math&gt; are contact and channel resistances, respectively, &lt;math&gt;L/W&lt;/math&gt; is the channel length/width, &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is gate insulator capacitance (per unit of area), &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is carrier mobility, and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{gs}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{ds}&lt;/math&gt; are gate-source and drain-source voltages. Therefore, the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance. The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the âcontact resistance-freeâ carrier mobility. The approximations used here (linear potential drop across the channel region, constant contact resistance,...) lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance.&lt;ref name="Weis_2010"/&gt;

Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated four-probe measurement&lt;ref name="Pesavento_2004"/&gt; and the modified [[time-of-flight]] method (TOF).&lt;ref name="Weis_2009"/&gt; The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KFM)&lt;ref name="BÃ¼rgi_2002"/&gt; and the electric-field induced second harmonic generation.&lt;ref name="Nakao_2009"/&gt;

==Mechanisms==
For given physical and mechanical material properties, parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance (ECR) and its variation at an interface relate primarily to [[surface structure]] and applied load ([[Contact mechanics]]).&lt;ref name="Zhai_2016"/&gt; Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and [[adsorbtion|adsorbed]] water molecules, which lead to capacitor-type junctions at weakly contacting [[Asperity_(materials_science)|asperities]] and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities. Over time, the contact resistance at an interface relaxes, particularly at weakly contacting surfaces, through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown, in a process also known as resistance creep.&lt;ref name="Zhai_2015"/&gt; The coupling of [[surface chemistry]], contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be accounted for in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena.

==Quantum limit==
When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to &lt;math&gt;2\pi/k_F&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_F&lt;/math&gt; is [[Fermi surface|Fermi wavevector]] of the conducting material, [[Ohm's law]] does not hold anymore. These small devices are called [[quantum point contact]]s. Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value &lt;math&gt;2e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge|electronic charge]] and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]]. Quantum point contacts behave more like [[waveguide]]s than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the [[Rolf Landauer|Landauer]] scattering formalism.&lt;ref name="Landauer_1976"/&gt; Point-contact [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]] is an important technique for characterizing [[superconductor]]s.

==Other forms of contact resistance==
Measurements of [[thermal conductivity]] are also subject to contact resistance, with particular significance in heat transport through granular media. Similarly, a drop in [[hydrostatic pressure]] (analogous to electrical [[voltage]]) occurs when [[fluid flow]] transitions from one channel to another.

==Significance==
Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices. For example, corroded [[jump start (vehicle)|jumper cable]] clamps can frustrate attempts to start a [[automobile|vehicle]] that has a low [[Lead-acid battery|battery]]. Dirty or [[corrosion|corroded]] contacts on a [[fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown. A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial [[Joule heating|heating]] in a high current device. Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment.

In [[ocean]]ic [[biogeochemistry]], the '''continental shelf pump''' is proposed to operate in the shallow waters of the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], acting as a mechanism to transport [[carbon]] (as either dissolved or particulate material) from surface waters to the interior of the adjacent deep ocean.&lt;ref name=tsun99&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0889.1999.t01-2-00010.x | last1 = Tsunogai | first1 = S. | last2 = Watanabe | first2 = S. | last3 = Sato | first3 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Is there a "continental shelf pump" for the absorption of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | url = | journal = Tellus, Ser. B | volume = 51 | issue = 3| pages = 701â712 |bibcode = 1999TellB..51..701T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originally formulated by Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999),&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; the pump is believed to occur where the [[solubility pump|solubility]] and [[biological pump|biological]] pumps interact with a local [[hydrography]] that feeds dense water from the shelf floor into sub-surface (at least [[thermocline|subthermocline]]) waters in the neighbouring deep ocean.  Tsunogai ''et al.'''s (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; original work focused on the [[East China Sea]], and the observation that, averaged over the year, its surface waters represented a sink for [[carbon dioxide]].  This observation was combined with others of the distribution of dissolved [[carbonate]] and [[alkalinity]] and explained as follows :

* the shallowness of the continental shelf restricts [[convection]] of cooling water
* as a consequence, cooling is greater for continental shelf waters than for neighbouring open ocean waters
* this leads to the production of relatively cool and dense water on the shelf
* the cooler waters promote the [[solubility pump]] and lead to an increased storage of dissolved inorganic carbon
* this extra carbon storage is augmented by the increased biological production characteristic of shelves&lt;ref name=woll98&gt;Wollast, R. (1998). Evaluation and comparison of the global carbon cycle in the coastal zone and in the open ocean, p. 213-252. In K. H. Brink and A. R. Robinson (eds.), ''The Global Coastal Ocean''. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the dense, carbon-rich shelf waters sink to the shelf floor and enter the sub-surface layer of the open ocean via [[isopycnal]] mixing

==Significance==
Based on their measurements of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flux over the East China Sea (35 g C m&lt;sup&gt;â2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;), Tsunogai ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;ref name=tsun99/&gt; estimated that the continental shelf pump could be responsible for an air-to-sea flux of approximately 1 Gt C y&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt; over the world's shelf areas.

One caveat to this calculation is that the original work was concerned with the hydrography of the East China Sea, where cooling plays the dominant role in the formation of dense shelf water, and that this mechanism may not apply in other regions.  However, it has been suggested&lt;ref name=yool01&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2000GB001359 | last1 = Yool | first1 = A. | last2 = Fasham | first2 = M. J.

For instance, in polar regions, the formation of [[sea ice|sea-ice]] results in the [[extrusion]] of salt that may increase seawater density.  Similarly, in tropical regions, [[evaporation]] may increase local salinity and seawater density.

However, the global sink of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in marginal seas could be almost fully compensated by the emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (+11.1&amp;nbsp;mol C m&lt;sup&gt;â2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;; +0.40 Gt C y&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;) from the ensemble of near-shore coastal ecosystems, mostly related to the emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from estuaries (0.34 Gt C y&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;).

An interesting application of this work has been examining the impact of sea level rise over the last de-glacial transition on the global carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Rippeth | first1=T.

As sea level rose the surface area of the shelf seas grew and in consequence the strength of the shelf sea pump should increase.

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], '''crumpling''' is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional [[manifold]] undergoes disordered [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of [[Face_(geometry)#Ridge_or_.28n-2.29-face|ridge]]s and [[facet]]s with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is the subject of some interest the mathematical community within the discipline of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cerda | first1=Enrique | last2=Chaieb |first2=Sahraoui |last3=Melo | first3=Francisco| last4=Mahadevan| first4=L |title=Conical dislocations in crumpling | journal= nature | year= 1999| volume=401| doi=10.1038/43395| bibcode=1999Natur.401...46C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with [[compressive strength]] resulting from [[friction]]al interactions at [[Local property|locally]] flat facets between folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741â14745|arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of [[materials science]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== Significance of crumpling ==

The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibi| first1=M |last2=Bonn | first2=D| title=Effect of the material properties on the crumpling of a thin sheet.| journal= Soft matter |year=2017 | volume=3 |pages=4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed [[cellulose]] paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to [[Paper recycling|utilising waste paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Mechanical properties in crumple-formed paper derived materials subjected to compression| journal= Heilyon |year=2017 | volume=3 |issue=6| pages=e00329 | url= http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00329/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cryptozoology''' is a [[pseudoscience]] and [[subculture]] that aims to prove the existence of entities from the [[folklore]] record, such as [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], or [[Mokele-mbembe]]. Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].

Originally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].

==Terminology, history, and approach==
As a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des BÃªtes IgnorÃ©es'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"&gt;Regal, Brian (2011) "Cryptozoology", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011). ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art''. 2nd edition. [[ABC-CLIO]]. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cryptozoology'' dates from cryptozoologist circles from 1959 or before&amp;nbsp;â Heuvelmans attributes the coinage of the term ''cryptozoology'' ('the study of hidden animals') to Sanderson.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTOZOOLOGY"&gt;Additionally, see discussion at "cryptozoology, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E. Wall in the Summer issue of the [[International Society of Cryptozoology]] newsletter.&lt;ref name="Regal2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Regal|first=B.|title=Searching for Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads, and Cryptozoology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a7GAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197|date=11 April 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-11829-4|pages=197â198}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wall "[It has been] suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like 'monster'. My suggestion is 'cryptid', meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Wall |first=J.E. |title=The ISC Newsletter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSfXAAAAMAAJ |date=Summer 1982 |publisher=International Society of Cryptozoology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=10 |quote=The Spring, 1983, issue featured an interview with Paul LeBlond and Forrest Wood, in which it was suggested that new terms be coined to replace sensational and often misleading terms like "monster." My suggestion is "cryptid," meaning a living thing having the quality of being hidden or unknown. As far as I know, this would be an entirely new word , describing those creatures which are (or may be) subjects of cryptozoological investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the noun ''cryptid'' as "an animal whose existence or survival to the present day is disputed or unsubstantiated; any animal of interest to a cryptozoologist".&lt;ref name="OED-CRYPTID"&gt;"cryptid, n." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While used by most cryptozoologists, the term ''cryptid'' is not used by academic zoologists.&lt;ref name="PAXTON-2011"&gt;Paxton, C.G.M.  (2011). "Putting the âologyâ into cryptozoology." . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

While biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other "imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, "there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids".&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt; Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="REGAL-326-329"/&gt;

Few cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], "Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration." Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].&lt;ref name="LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305"&gt;Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013. ''Abominable Science: Origins of the Yeti, Nessie, and other Famous Cryptids'', p. 304-305. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52681-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young Earth creationism===
A subset of cryptozoology promotes the pseudoscience of [[Young Earth creationism]], rejecting conventional science in favor of a Biblical interpretation and promoting concepts such as "[[Young Earth creationism#Flood geology, the fossil record, and dinosaurs|living dinosaur]]s". [[Science journalism|Science writer]] [[Sharon A. Hill]] observes that the Young Earth creationist segment of cryptozoology is "well-funded and able to conduct expeditions with a goal of finding a living dinosaur that they think would invalidate evolution."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 66. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] Jeb J. Card says that "Creationists have embraced cryptozoology and some cryptozoological expeditions are funded by and conducted by creationists hoping to disprove evolution."&lt;ref name="CARD-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] notes an uptick in creationist cryptozoologists. He observes that "[p]eople who actively search for Loch Ness monsters or Mokele Mbembe do it entirely as creationist ministers. They think that if they found a dinosaur in the Congo it would overturn all of evolution. It wouldn't. It would just be a late-occurring dinosaur, but that's their mistaken notion of evolution."&lt;ref name="NAT-GEO-PROTHERO"&gt;Shea, Rachel Hartigan. 2013. "The Science Behind Bigfoot and Other Monsters".''[[National Geographic]]'', September 9, 2013. [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/09/130907-cryptid-crytozoology-bigfoot-loch-yeti-monster-abominable-science/ Online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and pseudoscience==
The 2003 discovery of the [[fossil]] remains of ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' was cited by paleontologist [[Henry Gee]], a senior editor at the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', as possible evidence that "in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as yetis are founded on grains of truth." "Cryptozoology," Gee says, "can come in from the cold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henry Gee |year=2004 |journal=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=1329 |title=Flores, God and Cryptozoology: The discovery poses thorny questions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens | doi = 10.1038/news041025-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, cryptozoology is widely criticised for an array of reasons and is rejected by the academic world. There is a broad consensus from academics that cryptozoology is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jeffrey A. (2000). ''The Scientific Endeavor: A Primer on Scientific Principles and Practice''. [[Benjamin Cummings]]. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0805345964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roesch, Ben S; Moore, John L. (2002). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[Michael Shermer]]. ''The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: Volume One''. ABC-CLIO. pp. 71-78. {{ISBN|1-57607-653-9}} "Pointing to this rampant speculation and ignorance of established scientific theories in cryptozoology, as well as the field's poor record of success and its reliance on unsystematic, anecdotal evidence, many scientists and skeptics classify cryptozoology as a pseudoscience."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church, Jill M. (2009). ''Cryptozoology''. In [[H. James Birx]]. ''Encyclopedia of Time: Science, Philosophy, Theology &amp; Culture, Volume 1''. [[SAGE Publications]]. pp. 251-252. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-4164-8}} "Cryptozoology has acquired a bad reputation as a pseudoscience... Until detailed, methodical research becomes standard practice among cryptozoologists, the field will remain disrespected by more traditional biologists and zoologists."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lack, Caleb W; Rousseau, Jacques. (2016). ''Unknown Animals and Cryptozoology''. In ''Critical Thinking, Science and Pseudoscience: Why We Can't Trust Our Brains.'' [[Springer Publishing]]. pp. 153-174. {{ISBN|978-0-8261-9419-0}} "Cryptids are the focus of study in cryptozoology, a field most scientists label as pseudoscientific."&lt;/ref&gt; The field is regularly criticized for reliance on anecdotal information&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Shermer | year=2003|title=Show Me the Body|work=[[Scientific American]]|issue=288 (5)|page=27|url=http://www.michaelshermer.com/2003/05/show-me-the-body}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because in the course of investigating animals that most scientists believe are unlikely to have existed, cryptozoologists do not follow the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="luumsh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown|publisher=[[Overlook Press]]|year=2000 |isbn=0-440-23656-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill notes that "there is no academic course of study in cryptozoology or no university degree program that will bestow the title 'cryptozoologist'."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-66"/&gt;

Anthropologist Jeb J. Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:

:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.&lt;ref name="CARD-23-32"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 23-32. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card notes that "cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early "rage against critics of cryptozoology". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, "Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious "[[Indian burial grounds]]" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|"Amityville" hoax]] ...".&lt;ref name="CARD-24-25"&gt;Card, Jeb J. 2016. "Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S. ''Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices'', p. 24-25. [[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 foreword for ''The American Biology Teacher'', then [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] president [[Dan Ward (educator)|Dan Ward]] uses cryptozoology as an example of "technological pseudoscience" that may confuse students about the scientific method. Ward says that "Cryptozoology â¦ is not valid science or even science at all. It is monster hunting."&lt;ref name="WARD-2011"&gt;Ward, Daniel. 2011. âFrom the Presidentâ. The American Biology Teacher 73.8 (2011): 440â440.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of science|Historian of science]] [[Brian Regal]] includes an entry for cryptozoology in his ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009). Regal says that "as an intellectual endeavor, cryptozoology has been studied as much as cryptozoologists have sought hidden animals".&lt;ref name="NAGEL-50"&gt;Nagel, Brian. 2009. ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'', p. 50. [[ABC-CLIO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 issue of ''[[The Folklore Society|Folklore]]'', [[folkloristics|folklorist]] VÃ©ronique Campion-Vincent says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Unexplained appearances of mystery animals are reported all over the world today. Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon."&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"&gt;Campion-Vincent, VÃ©ronique. 1992. âAppearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in Franceâ. ''Folklore'' 103.2 (1992): 160â183.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campion-Vincent says that "four currents can be distinguished in the study of mysterious animal appearances": "Forteans" ("compiler[s] of anomalies" such as via publications like the ''[[Fortean Times]]''), "occultists" (which she describes as related to "Forteans"), "folklorists", and "cryptozoologists". Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that "this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby".&lt;ref name="CAMPION-VINCENT-173"/&gt;

In her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that "folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry" and describes cryptozoology as an example of "American narrative traditions" that "feature many monsters".&lt;ref name="WATTS-271"&gt;Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that "cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2006-190-206"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2006. "Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds". ''Folklore'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (Aug., 2006), pp. 190-206. [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a paper published in 2013, Dendle refers to cryptozoologists as "contemporary monster hunters" that "keep alive a sense of wonder in a world that has been very thoroughly charted, mapped, and tracked, and that is largely available for close scrutiny on Google Earth and satellite imaging" and that "on the whole the devotion of substantial resources for this pursuit betrays a lack of awareness of the basis for scholarly consensus (largely ignoring, for instance, evidence of evolutionary biology and the fossil record)."&lt;ref name="DENDLE-2013-439"&gt;Dendle, Peter. 2013. "Monsters and the Twenty-First Century" as published in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. {{ISBN|9781472418012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Mike Dash]], few scientists doubt there are thousands of unknown animals, particularly invertebrates, awaiting discovery; however, cryptozoologists are largely uninterested in researching and cataloging newly discovered species of [[ant]]s or [[beetle]]s, instead focusing their efforts towards "more elusive" creatures that have often defied decades of work aimed at confirming their existence.&lt;ref name="luumsh"/&gt;

Paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1984) lists cryptozoology among examples of human gullibility, along with [[creationism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Humans are the most inventive, deceptive, and gullible of all animals. Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. â¦ In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.&lt;ref name="SIMPSON-1984-1-16"&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). "Mammals and Cryptozoology". ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society''. Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 30, 1984), pp. 1-19. [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paleontologist Donald Prothero (2007) cites cryptozoology as an example of pseudoscience, and categorizes it along with [[Holocaust denial]] and [[Ufology#As a pseudoscience|UFO abductions claims]] as aspects of American culture that are "clearly baloney".&lt;ref name="PROTHERO-2007"&gt;[[Donald R. Prothero|Prothero, Donald R.]]. 2007. ''Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters'', pp. 13-15. [[Columbia University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780231511421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'' (2017), Hill surveys the field and discusses aspects of the subculture, noting internal attempts at creating more scientific approaches and the involvement of [[Young Earth creationists]] and a prevalence of hoaxes. She concludes that many cryptozoologists are "passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning. As with the [[ghost hunting|ghost seekers]], cryptozoologists are convinced that they will be the ones to solve the mystery and make history. With the lure of mystery and money undermining diligent and ethical research, the field of cryptozoology has serious credibility problems."&lt;ref name="SCIENTIFICAL-AMERICANS-56-68"&gt;Hill, Sharon A. 2017. ''Scientifical Americans: The Culture of Amateur Paranormal Researchers'', pp. 56-68. [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. {{ISBN|9781476630823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5178">'''Decree on the Attempted Ordination of Some Catholic Women''' is a [[decree (canon law)|canonical decree]] issued by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], under Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], and approved by Pope [[John Paul II]] on December 21, 2002.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20021221_scomunica-donne_en.html Decree on the Attempted Ordination of Some Catholic Women]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] 95 (2003).&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The decree is in response to [[Romulo Antonio Braschi]] ordaining seven Catholic women to the priesthood of his movement on June 29, 2002,&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; and is a follow up to a decree of excommunication of Braschi and the women issued on August 5, 2002.&lt;ref name=Vatican85&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20020805_decreto-scomunica_en.html Decree of Excommunication]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

=Background=
In 1998, Braschi left the Catholic Church for the  [[Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King]] and became bishop of it.&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; On June 29, 2002, on a boat on the [[Danube River]], Austria,&lt;ref name=Vatican85 /&gt; Braschi ordained seven Catholic women, called the [[Danube Seven]], to the priesthood: Christine Mayr-Lumetzberger, Adelinde Roitinger, Gisela Forster, Iris MÃ¼ller, Ida Raming, Pia Brunner and Dagmar Braun Celeste (who called herself Angela White).&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Bishop of Linz and of the Austrian Episcopal Conference intervened, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On July 10, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith warned the eight persons that they would be excommunicated on July 22 if they did not repent.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 5, the Congregation issued a decree of excommunication of the eight persons.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The excommunicated people then published letters and granted interviews about the ordinations, explaining how it was valid, that the Catholic Church ought to allow women to be ordained, and how they had celebrated the sacraments.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On August 14 and September 27, the people requested the Congregation to revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The latter request made reference to canons regarding recourse against administrative decrees in the [[Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P6Y.HTM Vatican.Va: Code of Canon Law 1732-1739]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; On October 21, the Congregation replied that it would look into the matter.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

=Contents=
The decree explains the excommunicated party's background, then the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's response to the party's request for the revocation of their excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The response was prepared by fifteen members of the Congregation: Cardinals Joseph Ratzinger, Alfonso LÃ³pez Trujillo, Ignace Moussa I. Daoud, Giovanni Battista Re, Francis Arinze, Jozef Tomko, Achille Silvestrini, Jorge Medina EstÃ©vez, James Francis Stafford, Zenon Grocholewski, Walter Kasper, Crescenzio Sepe, Mario Francesco Pompedda and Bishops Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, and Rino Fisichella.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The fifteen members met multiple times to discuss the matter, and ultimately came to a "collegial decision" to not revoke the excommunication.&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt; The Congregation listed the reasons for why this was the case: the excommunication was not a [[latae sententiae]] penalty, but a [[ferendae sententiae]] penalty, as per Canons 1314, 1319, and 1347; the excommunication was issued by the [[Pope]] through the Congregation, as per Canon 360; the offense was grave and evident; the women, by choosing to be ordained by a schismatic, became schismatics themselves; the women rejected the [[magisterium]] of the Pope and the dogma on ordination that he definitively proposed in ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]''; the women, by inciting other Catholics to schism, were justly punished so as to protect the faith, communion and unity of the church and guide the consciences of the faithful; and the excommunication was intended to provoke the six persons to [[repentance]].&lt;ref name=Vatican1221 /&gt;

Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Ximena J.|last2=Jackson|first2=Robert R.|date=2007-09-01|title=Complex display behaviour during the intraspecific interactions of myrmecomorphic jumping spiders (Araneae, Salticidae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701450504|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=41|issue=25-28|pages=1659â1678|doi=10.1080/00222930701450504|issn=0022-2933|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. [[Evolution]] has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an [[ecosystem]].  It is connected to [[sexual selection]] and survival of the species in various ways. Typically, display behaviour is used for [[Courtship display|courtship]] between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loxton|first=R. G.|date=1979-01-01|title=On display behaviour and courtship in the praying mantis Ephestiasula amoena (Bolivar)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=65|issue=1|pages=103â110|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|issn=0024-4082|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a [[foraging]] or [[Predation|hunting]] territory for its family or group. A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed.Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours- from invertebrates such as the simple [[jumping spider]]&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; to the more complex vertebrates like the [[Harbor seal|harbour seal]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Parijs|first=Sofie M.|last2=Hastie|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Thompson|first3=Paul M.|date=2000-03-01|title=Individual and geographical variation in display behaviour of male harbour seals in Scotland|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=3|pages=559â568|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Â  

== In animals ==

=== Invertebrates ===

==== Insects ====
Communication is very important for animals all throughout the animal kingdom, even those with fairly simple nervous systems and body plans. For example, since female [[Mantidae|praying mantids]] are [[Sexual cannibalism|sexually cannibalistic]], the male will typically avail of a concealment form of display behaviour&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loxton|first=R. G.|date=1979-01-01|title=On display behaviour and courtship in the praying mantis Ephestiasula amoena (Bolivar)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=65|issue=1|pages=103â110|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1979.tb01083.x|issn=0024-4082|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is a series of creeping movements executed by the male as it approaches the female with freezing of the body whenever the female looks towards the male. However, according to laboratory studies conducted by Loxton in 1979, one type of [[Mantis|praying mantis]], ''Ephestiasula arnoena'', shows both male and female counterparts performing overt and ritualized behaviour before mating&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. Both displayed a semaphore behaviour, meaning both displayed their front legs in a boxing fashion before the slow approach of the male from behind &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. This semaphore display in ''E. arnoenais''key in communicating between both mantids that both are ready for copulation and, by extension, the continuance of their genetic line.

Along with the display behaviour shown by the praying mantid, flies belonging to the genus ''[[Megaselia]]'' also show such behaviour&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Brian|last2=Porras|first2=Wendy|date=2015-03-06|title=Extravagant female sexual display in a Megaselia Rondani species (Diptera: Phoridae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/bdj.3.e4368|journal=Biodiversity Data Journal|volume=3|pages=e4368|doi=10.3897/bdj.3.e4368|issn=1314-2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrary to the typically female-selected mating that occurs for most organisms, these flies have females that show the display behaviour and males that choose the mate. Females have a bright orange colouring that attracts the male and also perform a series of fluttering wing movements that make the insect appear to "dance" and make the openings on their abdomens to swell in order to attract a male &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. It is also interesting to note that there is experimental evidence that implies the female may also release pheromones that attract the male; this is an instance of chemical display behaviour that plays a large role in animal communication &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=R. HENRY L.|date=2003-09-12|title=The dorsal abdominal glands and the higher classification of the Phoridae (Diptera)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.293.1.1|journal=Zootaxa|volume=293|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.11646/zootaxa.293.1.1|issn=1175-5334}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Arachnids ====
Along with mantids, jumping spiders also show display behaviour. The family [[Jumping spider|Salticidae]] consists of jumping spiders with keen vision which results in very clear display behaviours for courting in particular &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Ximena J.|last2=Jackson|first2=Robert R.|date=2007-09-01|title=Complex display behaviour during the intraspecific interactions of myrmecomorphic jumping spiders (Araneae, Salticidae)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701450504|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=41|issue=25-28|pages=1659â1678|doi=10.1080/00222930701450504|issn=0022-2933|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Jumping spider|Salticids]] are very similar in appearance to ants that live in the same area and therefore use their appearance to avoid predators. Since this similarity in appearance is so obvious, salticid spiders can use display behaviours to communicate both with members of their own species and also with members of the ants that they mimic &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;.

=== Vertebrates ===

==== BirdsÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â ====
Birds also very commonly use display behaviours for courtship and communication. [[Manakin|Manakin birds]] (in the family Pipridae) in the Amazon undergo large demonstrations of display behaviour in order to court females in the population &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CÃ¡rdenas-Posada|first=Ghislaine|last2=Cadena|first2=Carlos Daniel|last3=Blake|first3=John G.|last4=Loiselle|first4=Bette A.|date=2017-11-13|title=Display behaviour, social organization and vocal repertoire of Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola napensis in northwest Amazonia|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12548|journal=Ibis|volume=160|issue=2|pages=269â282|doi=10.1111/ibi.12548|issn=0019-1019|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since males provide no other immediate benefit to females, they must undergo ritualized behaviours in order to show their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] to possible mates; the female then uses the information she gathers from this interaction to make a decision on who she will mate with &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This display behaviour consists of various flight patterns, wing and colour displays, and particular vocalizations Â &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. As a result of this performance, the males will be chosen by the female and reproduction will commence.

==== Mammals ====
Along with invertebrates and birds, vertebrates like the [[Harbor seal|harbour seal]] also show display behaviour. Since the harbour seal resides in an aquatic environment, the display behaviours expressed are slightly different from those seen in terrestrial mammal species . Male harbour seals show specific vocalization and diving behaviours while demonstrating such behaviours for possible mates &lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Parijs|first=Sofie M.|last2=Hastie|first2=Gordon D.|last3=Thompson|first3=Paul M.|date=2000-03-01|title=Individual and geographical variation in display behaviour of male harbour seals in Scotland|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=3|pages=559â568|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1307|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As seals are distributed over such a large area, these display behaviours can slightly change geographically as males try to appeal to the largest amount of females possible over a large geographical range. Dive displays, head flicks, and various vocalizations all work together in a display behaviour that signifies to the females in a colony that the males are ready to mate &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;.

== Factors influencing display behaviour in animals ==
Display behaviour is a set of very conspicuous behaviours that allows for the attraction of mates but also can result in the attraction of predators. As a result, animals have certain environmental and social cues that they can use to decide when is the most beneficial time to show such behaviours; they use these triggers to minimize cost ([[Anti-predator adaptation|predator avoidance]]) and maximize gain (mate attraction)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooke|first=P. N.|last2=Alford|first2=R. A.|last3=Schwarzkopf|first3=L.|date=2000-12-04|title=Environmental and social factors influence chorusing behaviour in a tropical frog: examining various temporal and spatial scales|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002650000256|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=49|issue=1|pages=79â87|doi=10.1007/s002650000256|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first factor is temporal. Depending on the time of the season, animals (more specifically, [[Micrixalus|tropical frogs]], in this study) show strong seasonal trends in display behaviour favouring times closer to the beginning of the mating season &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. This is plausible as this allows the most time for the attraction of a mate and the decline in calling to the end of the season is also valid because most organisms will have a mate by then and not have any need to continue such display behaviour. Depending upon the species and evolutionary histories, environmental factors such as temperature, elevation, and precipitation can affect the presence of these behaviours &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. Along with environmental cues, social cues can also play a role in the demonstration of display behaviour. For example, [[Aggression|aggressive]] display behaviour in the [[crayfish]] ''Orconectes virilistends'' to be triggered by impositions of other crayfish on previously established territory &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Daniel I.|last2=Hazlett|first2=Brian A.|date=1974-01-01|title=Examination of the Agonistic Behaviour of the Crayfish Orconectes Virilis By Character Analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853974x00453|journal=Behaviour|volume=50|issue=3|pages=193â215|doi=10.1163/156853974x00453|issn=0005-7959}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Such displays consist of a preliminary raising of claws between 4 to 5 times and if this is not sufficient to warn the other to not encroach on the territory then tactile engagement will occur. In this case, display behaviour is a preliminary step to the engagement of aggressive tactile behaviour whereas many cases of display behaviour result in the engagement of mating rituals.

==Among humans==
Humans typically advertise their suitability as mates in acquiring wealth or fame.  The [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] ''big men'' would stage elaborate [[meal|feasts]] to show the extent of their [[social influence|influence]] and [[power (sociology)|power]]. The [[potlatch]]es of the [[Pacific Northwest]] were held for much of the same effect.

==Tournament species==

Tournament species in [[zoology]] are those [[species]] in which members of one sex (usually [[male]]s) compete in order to mate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=J. C.|last2=Sapolsky|first2=R. M.|date=2003-08-01|title=Reproduction and Resistance to Stress: When and How|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.01033.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|language=en|volume=15|issue=8|pages=711â724|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2826.2003.01033.x|issn=1365-2826}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tournament species, the reproductive success of the small group of competition winners is predominantly higher than that of the large group of losers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tournament species are characterized by fierce same-sex fighting.  Significantly larger or better-armed individuals in these species have an advantage, but only to the competing sex.  Thus, most tournament species have high [[sexual dimorphism]].  Examples of tournament species include [[grouse]], [[peafowl]], [[lion]]s, [[mountain gorilla]]s and [[elephant seal]]s.

In some species, members of the competing sex come together in special display areas called [[Lek (animal behavior)|leks]]. In other species, competition is more direct, in the form of fighting between males.

In a small number of species, females compete for males; these include species of [[Jacanidae|jacana]], species of [[phalarope]], and the [[spotted hyena]]. In all these cases, the female of the species shows traits that help in same-sex battles: larger bodies, aggressiveness, territorialism.  Even maintenance of a multiple-male "harem" is sometimes seen in these animals.

Most species fall on a continuum between tournament species and [[pair-bonding]] species.

'''Electrical capacitance tomography''' ('''ECT''') is a method for determination of the dielectric [[permittivity]] distribution in the interior of an object from external capacitance measurements. It is a close relative of [[electrical impedance tomography]]&lt;ref&gt;M Soleimani, W R B Lionheart, Nonlinear image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography using experimental data, Meas. Sci. Technol., 16, 2005, pp 1987â1996 
&lt;/ref&gt; and is proposed as a method for industrial process monitoring, although it has yet to see widespread use. Potential applications include the measurement of flow of fluids in pipes&lt;ref&gt;Jaworski AJ and Dyakowski T, Application of electrical capacitance tomography for measurement of gasâsolid flow characteristics in a pneumatic conveying system, Measurement Science and Technology, 12, 2001, pp 1109â19
&lt;/ref&gt; and measurement of the concentration of one fluid in another, or the distribution of a solid in a fluid. 

Although capacitance sensing methods were in widespread use the idea of using capacitance measurement to form images is attributed to [[Maurice Beck]] and co-workers at [[UMIST]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;S M Huang, A Plaskowski, C G Xie and M S Beck, Capacitance-based tomographic flow imaging system, Electronics Letters, 24 (7), 1988, pp 418â19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually called [[tomography]], the technique differs from conventional tomographic methods, in which high resolution images are formed of slices of a material. The measurement electrodes, which are metallic plates, must be sufficiently large to give a measureable change in capacitance. This means that very few electrodes are used and eight or twelve electrodes is common. An N-electrode system can only provide N(N&amp;minus;1)/2 independent measurements. This means that the technique is limited to producing very low resolution images of approximate slices. However, ECT is fast, and relatively inexpensive.

'''Environmental chemistry''' is the [[science|scientific study]] of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places. It should not be confused with [[green chemistry]], which seeks to reduce potential pollution at its source. It can be defined as the study of the sources, reactions, transport, effects, and fates of chemical species in the [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[soil]], and [[water body|water]] environments; and the effect of human activity and biological activity on these. Environmental chemistry is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] science that includes [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric]], [[Aquatic chemistry|aquatic]] and [[soil chemistry]], as well as heavily relying on [[analytical chemistry]] and being related to [[Environmental science|environmental]] and other areas of science.

Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical processes occurring in the environment which are impacted by humankind's activities. These impacts may be felt on a local scale, through the presence of urban cities' air pollutants or toxic substances arising from a chemical waste site, or on a global scale, through depletion of stratospheric ozone or global warming. The focus in our courses and research activities is upon developing a fundamental understanding of the nature of these chemical processes, so that humankind's activities can be accurately evaluated.

Environmental chemistry involves first understanding how the un[[contamination|contaminated]] environment works, which chemicals in what concentrations are present naturally, and with what effects. Without this it would be impossible to accurately study the effects humans have on the [[Natural environment|environment]] through the release of [[chemicals]].

Environmental [[chemist]]s draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical species in the [[Ecosystem|environment]]. Important general concepts from chemistry include understanding [[chemical reaction]]s and [[Chemical equation|equations]], [[solution]]s, [[Units of measurement|units]], [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], and [[Analytical chemistry|analytical techniques]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, Ian. ''Environmental Chemistry, A Modular Approach''. Wiley. 2001. {{ISBN|0-471-48942-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contamination==
A [[contaminant]] is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] present in nature at a level higher than fixed levels or that would not otherwise be there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzardsbay.org/glossary.htm Glossary to the Buzzards Bay Watershed Management Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Meteorological Society. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=c&amp;p=84 Glossary of Meteorology]&lt;/ref&gt;   This may be due to human activity and bioactivity. The term contaminant is often used interchangeably with ''[[pollutant]]'', which is a substance that has a detrimental impact on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina State University. Department of Soil Science. [http://www.soil.ncsu.edu/publications/BMPs/glossary.html "Glossary."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Resource Action Center for the Environment (GRACE). New York, NY. [http://www.sustainabletable.org/intro/dictionary/ Sustainable Table: Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity, but without harmful effects, it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date.&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;Harrison, R.M (edited by). ''Understanding Our Environment, An Introduction to Environmental Chemistry and Pollution, Third Edition''. Royal Society of Chemistry. 1999. {{ISBN|0-85404-584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "medium" (e.g. soil) or organism (e.g. fish) affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a ''receptor'', whilst a ''sink'' is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant e.g. as carbon sink and its effects by microbes.

==Environmental indicators==

{{Main article|Freshwater environmental quality parameters}}
Chemical measures of [[water quality]] include [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen (DO)]], [[Chemical oxygen demand|chemical oxygen demand (COD)]], [[Biochemical oxygen demand|biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)]], [[Total dissolved solids|total dissolved solids (TDS)]], [[pH]], nutrients ([[nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]]), [[heavy metals]], soil chemicals (including [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]), and [[pesticide]]s.

==Applications==
Environmental chemistry is used by the [[Environment Agency]] (in [[England]] and [[Wales]]), the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the Association of [[Public Analyst]]s, and other [[List of environmental organizations|environmental agencies]] and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants. These can include:
*[[Heavy metals|Heavy metal]] contamination of land by industry. These can then be transported into water bodies and be taken up by living organisms.
*Nutrients leaching from [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land into water courses, which can lead to [[algal bloom]]s and [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC.
[http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/Ag_Runoff_Fact_Sheet.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Agricultural Runoff."] Document No. EPA 841-F-05-001. March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Urban runoff]] of pollutants washing off [[impervious surfaces]] ([[roads]], [[parking lots]], and [[roof]]tops) during rain storms. Typical pollutants include [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]] and other [[hydrocarbon]] compounds, metals, nutrients and [[sediment]] (soil).&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/nps_urban-facts_final.pdf "Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff."] Document No. EPA 841-F-03-003. February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

[[quantitative property|Quantitative]] chemical [[Analytical chemistry|analysis]] is a key part of environmental chemistry, since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies.&lt;ref name= vanLoonDuffyp7&gt;{{cite book

Common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry, such as [[gravimetric analysis|gravimetric]], [[titration|titrimetric]] and [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] methods. More sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds. Metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and [[mass spectrometry]]: [[Atomic absorption spectrophotometry|Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry]] (AAS) and [[Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy|Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission]] (ICP-AES) or [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometric]] (ICP-MS) techniques. Organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods, such as [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) and [[Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (LC/MS). Tandem Mass spectrometry [[MS/MS]] and High Resolution/Accurate Mass spectrometry [[HR/AM]] offer sub part per trillion detection. Non-MS methods using GCs and LCs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools.

Other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are [[Radiochemistry|radiochemical]]s. These are pollutants which emit radioactive materials, such as alpha and beta particles, posing danger to human health and the environment. Particle counters and Scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements. [[Bioassay]]s and [[immunoassay]]s are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms. Polymerase Chain Reaction [[PCR]] is able to identify species of bacteria and other organisms through specific DNA and RNA gene isolation and amplification and is showing promise as a valuable technique for identifying environmental microbial contamination.

'''Ernst Maurits Henricus Hirsch Ballin''' (born 15 December 1950) is a retired [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). 

Hirsch Ballin served as [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs]] from 7 November 1989 until 27 May 1994 in the [[Third Lubbers cabinet|Cabinet Lubbers III]]. And as acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior]] from 10 January 1994 until 18 January 1994 following the death of [[Ien Dales]]. He became a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] from 17 May 1994 until 1 June 1995 and served as a [[Senate (Netherlands)|Member of the Senate]] from 13 June 1995 until 1 November 2000 when he resigned to become a [[Council of State (Netherlands)|Member of the Council of State]] serving from 1 November 2000 until 22 September 2006 when he resigned to become [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] in the [[Third Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende III]] following the resignation of [[Piet Hein Donner]]. After the [[Dutch general election, 2006|Dutch general election of 2006]] and the inauguration of the [[Fourth Balkenende cabinet|Cabinet Balkenende IV]] he remained [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] serving from 22 September 2006 until 14 October 2010. He became again acting [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]] from 23 February 2010 until 14 October 2010 following the resignation of [[Guusje Ter Horst]].

After the [[Dutch general election, 2010|Dutch general election of 2010]], he made an appeal to his party not to work with [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) to begin a [[2010 Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]] for a new cabinet. After the success of the formation he was not offered a new position in the new [[First Rutte cabinet|Cabinet Rutte]], and returned as a [[Professor]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Tilburg University]] as a legal scholar.

Hirsch Ballin is also an active member of the Justice Leadership Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justiceleaders.org/leaders/ernst-hirsch-ballin/|title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin - Justice Leadership|publisher=justiceleaders.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hirsch Ballin was born to a [[Jewish]] father Prof. Dr. Ernst Danny Hirsch Ballin, and a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] mother. After completing his secondary education, he studied law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and became a practicing [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].

He graduated in 1974, and he received a [[Master of Laws]] degree. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1979 for his dissertation on public law and policy, which focussed on fundamental issues surrounding the work of the Advisory Council on Government Policy (WRR).

Hirsch Ballin was a research assistant in constitutional law at the [[University of Amsterdam]] from 1974 to 1977. He was subsequently employed as a legal officer at the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Ministry of Justice]]. In 1981 he was appointed [[professor]] of constitutional and administrative law at [[Tilburg University]].

===Politics===
[[Image:Ernst Hirsch Ballin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Hirsch Ballin in 2009.]]

From 7 November 1989 to 27 May 1994 Hirsch Ballin served as [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Minister of Justice]] and [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations|Minister for Suriname and Netherlands Antilles Affairs]] in the [[Netherlands cabinet Lubbers-3|Cabinet Lubbers III]]. In 1994 he offered his resignation, after turmoil about the Dutch Criminal Investigation Department.

After the [[Netherlands cabinet Kok-1|Cabinet Kok I]] with a coalition of the [[Dutch Labour Party]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Democrats 66]] came to power the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] was pushed to the opposition and Hirsch Ballin became a [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Member of the House of Representatives]] a post he held until 1995.

During this period he was also [[professor]] of legislative issues at the [[Tilburg University]]. In 1995 he was appointed [[professor]] of [[international law]] at the same university and later became [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/6715 |title=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Hirsch Ballin was appointed to the [[Dutch Council of State]] and he resigned as a [[Senate of the Netherlands|Member of the Senate]].

Hirsch Ballin has held numerous other positions, among them government commissioner for the review of legislation, member of the Board of the [[Netherlands Atlantic Association]], member of Committee 2004 (for the relationship between the [[Netherlands]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba]]) and deputy justice on the Central Appeals Tribunal and the ''Administrative Court for Trade and Industry''. He has been editor of the Dutch administrative law journal "Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Bestuursrecht" and the book series European and [[International Law]].

On 23 May 2008 satirical cartoonist [[Gregorius Nekschot]] was arrested which caused (inter)national controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2008/05_mei/15/binnenland/0515_2315_gregorius_nekschot_cartoonist_opgepakt.xml/ Cartoonist Gregorius Nekschot opgepakt], [[RTL Nederland|RTL Nieuws]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsch Ballin wanted to pass a bill on blasphemy, but failed. He was accused of causing the cartoonist to be brought to court for blasphemy to get a verdict to bypass the parliament.

The '''hyponastic response''' is an upward bending of [[leaf|leaves]] or other [[plant]] parts, resulting from growth of the lower side. This can be observed in many terrestrial plants and is thought to be linked to the [[plant hormone]] [[auxin]].

Submerged plants often show the hyponastic response, where the upward bending of the leaves and the elongation of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s might help the plant to restore normal gas exchange with the atmosphere.

Plants produce ethylene, and normally this dissolves in the air quite easily. But when the plant is submerged ethylene is trapped in the plant. Plants that are exposed to elevated ethylene levels in experimental set-ups also show the hyponastic response.

An '''Information School''' (sometimes abbreviated '''I-school''' or '''iSchool''') is a [[university]]-level institution committed to understanding the role of [[information]] in nature and human endeavors. Synonyms include "School of Information", "Department of Information Studies", or "Information Department". Information Schools [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] conduct research into the fundamental aspects of information and [[Information technology|related technologies]].  In addition to granting [[academic degree]]s, information schools educate information professionals, researchers, and scholars for an [[Information revolution|increasingly information-driven world]]. 

Information school can also refer, in a more restricted sense, to the [[List of Information Schools|members of the iSchools organization]] (formerly the "iSchools Project"), as governed by the iCaucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ About the iCaucus, governing body of the iSchools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928172227/http://www.ischools.org/site/about_icaucus/ |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ The iSchools Welcome Nanjing and Tampere as New Additions; Now Boast 33 Members Worldwide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204074445/http://www.ischools.org/site/ischoolsnews_article/the_ischools_welcome_nanjing_and_tampere_as_new_additions_now_boast_33_memb/ |date=2011-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this group share a fundamental interest in the relationships between people, information, technology, and science.  These schools, colleges, and departments have been either newly established or have evolved from programs focused on [[information systems]], [[library science]], [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]], [[library and information science]] and [[information science]].
 
Information schools promote an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of [[information management]], with a core commitment to concepts like [[Universal design|universal access]] and [[User-centered design|user-centered]] organization of information. The field is concerned broadly with questions of design and preservation across information spaces, from digital and virtual spaces like online communities, the World Wide Web, and databases to physical spaces such as libraries, museums, archives, and other repositories. Information school degree programs include course offerings in areas such as  [[information architecture]], [[Information design|design]],  [[Information economics|economics]], [[Information policy|policy]], [[Information retrieval|retrieval]], [[Information security|security]], and [[telecommunication]]s; [[knowledge management]], [[user experience design]], and [[usability]]; [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], including [[digital preservation]]; librarianship and [[Library management|library administration]]; the [[Information society|sociology of information]]; and [[humanâcomputer interaction]].

The '''Institute of Professional Sound''', previously the '''Institute of Broadcast Sound''', is an organisation for audio professionals. The organisation provides opportunities for training and conferencing to assist in maintaining high standards in all areas of [[professional audio]] operations. The organisation is based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

The organisation was founded in 1977 by sound balancers in [[BBC Television|BBC Television and Radio]] and [[ITV Network|Independent TV]], when its membership comprised audio practitioners working in all areas of broadcast audio including radio, location, and [[post-production]] sound. On 1 January 2012 the Institute of Professional Sound was adopted as the new name of the organisation, in order to attract a wider membership which is not exclusively from broadcasting.&lt;ref name=prosound&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundnewseurope.com/broadcastnews-content/full/ibs-changes-name-to-institute-of-professional-sound;jsessionid=022C388740727A42398954D209C87F06 |title=IBS changes name to Institute of Professional Sound - PSNE Magazine Online &amp; In Print |publisher=Prosoundnewseurope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute of Professional Sound was established in 1977 as the Institute of Broadcast Sound, by individuals working in radio and television, who recognised a need for a coordinated means for the exchange of innovative ideas between practitioners in the field of broadcast audio.&lt;ref name=prosound/&gt; The organisation serves as a catalyst to promote collaborative initiatives between manufacturers of digital audio recording and editing equipment. Listed among the successes of the organisation is the File Exchange Initiative, from which the [[iXML]] specification was established, setting an [[open standard]] for the inclusion of location sound metadata in [[Broadcast Wave Format|Broadcast Wave]] audio files.

== Projects ==

=== Mentoring ===
The Institute of Professional Sound offers mentoring and career enhancement opportunities for entry-level employees, college graduates, and seasoned professionals. The mentoring program is designed to coordinate members who desire to assist their colleagues progress and succeed in their career with individuals seeking the advice and support of more experienced practitioners in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/mentoring |title=IPS Mentoring |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Training ===
The organisation provides training forums and conferences for its members which introduce members to emerging technologies, along with seminars on microphone placement and other operational issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/training |title=Training |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date=2006-04-08 |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ofcom radio frequency spectrum ===
The Institute contributes to the ongoing discussions with [[Ofcom]], regarding the changes to the management and use of the radio frequency spectrum, where it represents several hundred members who are independent users of radio microphone and associated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org.uk/project/ofcom |title=Ofcom RF spectrum |publisher=Ips.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Email conferencing ===
Started in June 1995 with just 10 participants, the IPS's Internet email conference IBSNET  has  over 500 participants (as of 2012). Members include individuals from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Germany, Austria, United States, [[Malaysia]], Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. The conference provides opportunities for comment and feedback regarding professional standards, working conditions, visa requirements, and radio microphone frequencies in other countries, in addition to putting location recordists in contact with one another and with the dubbing mixers, who may ultimately use their work.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used. American "[[modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberalism]]" happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]] and occupies the [[center-left politics|centre-left]] of the political spectrum, in contrast to many European countries where liberalism is often more associated with the [[centre-right politics|centre-right]] and [[social democracy]] makes up a substantial part of the centre-left. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, a divide between conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals persists. On the other hand, in those countries where liberal conservative movements have more recently entered the political mainstream, such as Italy and Spain, the terms "liberal" and "conservative" may be understood as synonymous. Often this involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to traditional [[centre-right politics]], such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" â now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] â advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65â66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435â464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] â without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106â108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

'''[[Microwave sounding unit]] temperature measurements''' have been obtained from the [[troposphere]] since 1979, when they were included within NOAA [[weather satellite]]s.  By comparison, the usable balloon ([[radiosonde]]) record begins in 1958 but has less geographic coverage and is less uniform.

[[Satellite]]s do not measure [[temperature]].  They measure [[radiance]]s in various [[wavelength]] bands, which must then be mathematically [[Inverse problem|inverted]] to obtain [[Remote sensing#Data processing|indirect inferences]] of temperature.&lt;ref name="NRC2000"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I.

As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have obtained different temperature trends. Among these groups are [[Remote Sensing Systems]] (RSS) and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The satellite series is not fully homogeneous - the record is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation. The sensors deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for satellite drift in orbit. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

To compare to the trend from the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperature record]] (approximately +0.07&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade over the past century and +0.15-0.16&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade since 1979) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface, i.e., the lower [[troposphere]].  Doing this, through January 2012:
* RSS v3.3 finds a trend of +0.137&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade.&lt;ref name="RSS"/&gt;
* UAH v5.4 finds a trend of +0.136&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade.&lt;ref name="UAH TLT"/&gt;

There have been complaints of data problems with both records, and difficulty reconciling climate model predictions with the observed data.

==Creation of the satellite temperature record==
[[File:Weighting Function.png|thumb|MSU weighting function.]]
{{Main|Satellite temperature measurements}}
Since 1979, [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) on [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric [[oxygen]]. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere, as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061135/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png |date=2013-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel 2 is broadly representative of the troposphere, albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the stratospheric influence, Spencer and Christy developed the synthetic "2LT" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However this amplifies noise,&lt;ref name="Christy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=John R. |authorlink= |author2=Spencer, Roy W. |author3=Lobl, Elena S.  |year=1998 |title=Analysis of the Merging Procedure for the MSU Daily Temperature Time Series |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2016&amp;ndash;2041 |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011&lt;2016:AOTMPF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1998JCli...11.2016.}}&lt;/ref&gt; increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination.&lt;ref name="Fu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fu |first=Qiang |authorlink= |author2=Johanson, Celeste M. |year=2005 |title=Satellite-Derived Vertical Dependence Of Tropical Tropospheric Temperature Trends |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=L10703 |doi=10.1029/2004GL022266 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210703F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.

Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs and AMSU data, each with peculiarities  that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/960521SM.html The Satellite Temperature Records: Parts 1 and 2] May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult and some of the required corrections are as large as the trend itself:&lt;ref name="CCSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|title=CCSP sap 1.1|accessdate=2011-01-15|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224094945/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap2.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Diurnal sampling

All the MSU instruments and to a lesser extent AMSU drift slowly from the sun-synchronous equatorial crossing time changing the local time observed by the instrument, therefore the natural diurnal cycle may be aliased into the long term trend. 
The diurnal sampling correction is in the order of a few hundredths Â°C/decade for TLT and TMT.

; Orbit decay

All Polar orbiting satellite lose height after launch, the orbital decay is stronger during period of elevated solar activity when the enhanced ultraviolet radiation warm the upper atmosphere and increase the frictional drag over the spacecraft.

The orbital decay change the instrument view angle relative to the surface and thus the observed microwave emissivity, furthermore the long term time-series is constructed by sequential merging of the inter-calibrated satellite data so that the error is summed up over time, the required correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade for TLT.

; Calibration changes

Once every earth scan MSU instrument use the deep space (2.7K) and on-board warm targets to make calibration measures, however as the spacecraft drifts through the diurnal cycle the calibration target temperature may change due to varying solar shadowing effect, the correction is in the order of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade for TLT and TMT.

One widely reported satellite temperature record, developed by [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] and [[John Christy]] at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH), is current version  corrects previous errors in their analysis for orbital drift and other factors.

==History of satellite temperature data interpretation==
In the late 1990s the disagreement between the surface temperature record and the satellite records was a subject of research and debate. The lack of warming then seen in the records was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |title=Christy and Spencer Respond to Critics; Water Vapor Still Not Resolved |accessdate= |work=Cooler Heads Coalition |date=October 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911190509/http://www.globalwarming.org/article.php?uid=167 |archivedate=2007-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] that reviewed upper air temperature trends stated:
                                                             
:"Data collected by satellites and balloon-borne instruments since 1979 indicate little if any warming of the low- to mid-troposphereâthe atmospheric layer extending up to about 5 miles from the Earth's surface. Climate models generally predict that temperatures should increase in the upper air as well as at the surface if increased concentrations of greenhouse gases are causing the warming."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/catalog/9755/reconciling-observations-of-global-temperature-change?onpi_newsdoc011200= The National Academies], "Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change", 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The same panel then concluded that

:"the warming trend in global-mean surface temperature observations during the past 20 years is undoubtedly real and is substantially greater than the average rate of warming during the twentieth century. The disparity between surface and upper air trends in no way invalidates the conclusion that surface temperature has been rising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reconciling Observations of Global Temperature Change |author=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate |year=2000 |publisher=National Academy Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-06891-6 |pages=1&amp;ndash;4 |chapter=Executive Summary |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/books/0309068916/html/2.html#pagetop }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Llanos2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Miguel |last=Llanos |title=Panel weighs in on global warming: Earthâs surface is warmer, they say, even if upper air isnât |url=http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |work=MSNBC |publisher= |date=2000-01-13 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427072934/http://www.msnbc.com/news/356875.asp?cp1=1 |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the UAH data showed a ''cooling'' of 0.05K per decade (at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km - mid to low troposphere). Wentz &amp; Schabel at RSS in their 1998 paper showed this (along with other discrepancies) was due to the orbital decay of the NOAA satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115152656/http://www.remss.com/papers/MSU_Nature_Article.pdf# |archive-date=2010-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the orbital changes had been allowed for the data showed a 0.07K per decade ''increase'' in temperature at this level of the atmosphere.

In April 2002, for example, an analysis of the satellite temperature data showed warming of only 0.04&amp;nbsp;Â°C per decade, compared with surface measurements showing 0.17 Â±  0.06&amp;nbsp;Â°C per decade.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Doubts had been raised as early as 2000 about the UAH analysis by the work of Prabhakara et al.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2000/2000GL011719.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; which minimised errors due to satellite drift. They found a trend of 0.13&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade, in reasonable agreement with surface trends.

Christy ''et al.'' (2007) find that the tropical temperature trends from [[radiosondes]] matches closest with his v5.2 UAH dataset.&lt;ref name="Christy2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christy |first=J. R. |authorlink= |author2=Norris, W. B. |author3=Spencer, R. W. |author4= Hnilo, J.

Another important critique of the satellite record is its shortness&amp;mdash;adding a few years on to the record or picking a particular time frame can change the trends considerably.

Likewise, even though they began with the same data, each of the major research groups has interpreted it with different results. Most notably, Mears et al. at RSS find 0.193&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade for lower troposphere up to July 2005, compared to +0.123&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade found by UAH for the same period.

There are ongoing efforts to resolve these differences.  Some believe that much of the disparity may have been resolved by the three papers in Science, 11 August 2005, which pointed out errors in the UAH 5.1 record and the radiosonde record in the tropics.

==Stratospheric temperature trends==
The satellites also measure the lower stratospheric temperature{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and show a decline in stratospheric temperatures, interspersed by warmings related to volcanic eruptions. [[Global Warming]] theory suggests that the [[stratosphere]] should cool while the [[troposphere]] warms &lt;ref name="Clough 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clough |first=S.A. |authorlink= |author2=M.

However, the lower stratospheric cooling is mainly caused by the effects of [[ozone depletion]] with a possible contribution from increased stratospheric water vapor and greenhouse gases increase.&lt;ref name="Shine 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shine |first=Keith |author2=M.S.

The long term cooling in the lower stratosphere occurred in two downward steps in temperature both after the transient warming related to explosive volcanic eruptions of [[El ChichÃ³n]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], this behavior of the global stratospheric temperature has been attributed to global ozone concentration variation in the two years following volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=David W.

==Reconciliation of data with climate models==
[[General circulation model|Climate model]]s predict that as the surface warms, so should the global troposphere. Globally, the troposphere should warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface. For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing [[algorithm]]) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm United Nations Environment Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112044011/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis produced by dozens of scientists as part of the US [[Climate Change Science Program]] (CCSP) identified and corrected errors in a variety of temperature observations, including the satellite data.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423150153/http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf CCSP SAP 1.1 Executive Summary] states:
:"Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human induced global warming. Specifically, surface data showed substantial global-average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."

The [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers] states:
:"New analyses of balloon-borne and satellite measurements of lower- and mid-tropospheric temperature show warming rates that are similar to those of the surface temperature record and are consistent within their respective uncertainties, largely reconciling a discrepancy noted in the TAR."

However, as detailed in [https://web.archive.org/web/20101224095341/http://climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap5.pdf CCSP SAP 5.1 Understanding and Reconciling Differences], neither Regression models or other related techniques were reconcilable with observed data.  The use of fingerprinting techniques on data yielded that "Volcanic and human-caused fingerprints were not consistently identifiable in observed patterns of lapse rate change."  As such, issues with reconciling data and models remain.

A potentially serious inconsistency has been identified in the tropics, the area in which tropospheric amplification should be seen. Section 1.1 of the CCSP report says:

: "In the tropics, the agreement between models and observations depends on the time scale considered. For month-to-month and year-to-year variations, models and observations both show amplification (i.e., the month-to-month and year-to-year variations are larger aloft than at the surface). This is a consequence of relatively simple physics, the effects of the release of latent heat as air rises and condenses in clouds. The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations. On decadal and longer time scales, however, while almost all model simulations show greater warming aloft (reflecting the same physical processes that operate on the monthly and annual time scales), most observations show greater warming at the surface.

: "These results could arise either because âreal worldâ amplification effects on short and long time scales are controlled by different physical mechanisms, and models fail to capture such behavior; or because non-climatic influences remaining in some or all of the observed tropospheric data sets lead to biased long-term trends; or a combination of these factors. The new evidence in this Report favors the second explanation."

The lower troposphere trend derived from UAH satellites (+0.128&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade) is currently lower than both the GISS and Hadley Centre surface station network trends (+0.161 and +0.160&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade respectively), while the RSS trend (+0.158&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade) is similar. However, the expected trend in the lower troposphere, given the surface data, would be around 0.194&amp;nbsp;Â°C/decade, making the UAH and RSS trends 66% and 81% of the expected value respectively.

'''MilkyWay@home''' is a volunteer [[distributed computing]] project in [[astrophysics]] running on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) platform.  Using spare computing power from over 38,000 computers run by over 27,000 active volunteers {{As of|2011|11|lc=on}},&lt;ref name="BOINCstats_MilyWayOverview"&gt;{{cite web | title=MilkyWay@home: Credit overview | author=de Zutter W | url=https://boincstats.com/en/stats/61/project/detail/credit | publisher=boincstats.com|accessdate=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MilkyWay@home project aims to generate accurate three-dimensional dynamic models of [[stellar streams]] in the immediate vicinity of the [[Milky Way]]. With [[SETI@home]] and [[Einstein@home]], it is the third computing project of this type that has the investigation of phenomena in interstellar space as its primary purpose. Its secondary objective is to develop and optimize algorithms for distributed computing.

== Purpose and design ==
[[File:Sig07-008.jpg|thumb|Starstreams from three small galaxies circling the bigger galaxy (simulation)]]
MilkyWay@home is a collaboration between the [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]'s departments of [[Computer science|Computer Science]] and Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy and is supported by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]]. It is operated by a team that includes astrophysicist [[Heidi Jo Newberg]] and computer scientists  [[Malik Magdon-Ismail]], [[BolesÅaw SzymaÅski]] and [[Carlos A. Varela]].

By mid-2009 the project's main astrophysical interest is in the [[Sagittarius Stream]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpi.edu/~vickej2/boincPics/sgr.flyaround.mpg Static 3D rendering of the Sagittarius stream] [https://www.webcitation.org/5i9mVIIAi Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; a stellar stream emanating from the [[Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy]] which partially penetrates the space occupied by the Milky Way and is believed{{by whom|date=April 2013}} to be in an unstable orbit around it, probably after a close encounter or collision with the Milky Way&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpi.edu/~vickej2/boincPics/surf.mpg Simulation of the Sagittarius stream development] by Kathryn V. Johnston at Columbia University [https://www.webcitation.org/5i9mxwi36 Archived]&lt;/ref&gt; which subjected it to strong [[galactic tide]] forces. Mapping such interstellar streams and their dynamics with high accuracy is expected{{by whom|date=April 2013}} to provide crucial clues for understanding the structure, formation, evolution, and gravitational potential distribution of the Milky Way and similar galaxies. It could also provide insight on the [[dark matter]] issue. As the project evolves, it might turn its attention to other star streams.

Using data from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], MilkyWay@home divides starfields into wedges of about 2.5 deg. width and applies self-optimizing probabilistic separation techniques (i.e., [[evolutionary algorithm]]s) to extract the optimized tidal streams. The program then attempts to create a new, uniformly dense wedge of stars from the input wedge by removing streams of data. Each stream removed is characterized by six parameters: percent of stars in the stream; the angular position in the stripe; the three spatial components (two angles, plus the radial distance from Earth) defining the removed cylinder; and a measure of width. For each search, the server application keeps track of a population of individual stars, each of which is attached to a possible model of the Milky Way.

== Project details and statistics ==
MilkyWay@home has been active since 2007, and optimized client applications for [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] operating systems became available in 2008. Its screensaver capability is limited to a revolving display of users' [[BOINC]] statistics, with no graphical component. Instead, animations of the best computer simulations are shared through YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/MilkywayAtHomeRPI/playlists Videos of the best-discovered computer simulations of this project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work units that are sent out to clients used to require only 2â4 hours of computation on modern CPUs, however, they were scheduled for completion with a short deadline (typically, three days). By early 2010, the project routinely sent much larger units that take 15â20 hours of computation time on the average processor core, and are valid for about a week from a download. This made the project less suitable for computers that are not in operation for periods of several days, or for user accounts that do not allow BOINC to compute in the background. As of 2018, many GPU-based tasks only require less than a minute to complete on a high-end graphics card.

The project's data throughput progress has been very dynamic recently. In mid-June 2009, the project had about 24,000 registered users and about 1,100 participating teams in 149 countries and was operating at 31.7 Tera[[FLOPS]]. {{As of|2010|01|12}}, these figures were at 44,900 users and 1,590 teams in 170 countries, but average computing power had jumped to 1,382 TFlops,&lt;ref&gt;Data retrieved from [http://www.allprojectstats.com BOINC project statistics page]{{dead link|date=September 2017}} on June 22, 2009, and January 12, 2010, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; which would rank MilkyWay@home second among the [[TOP500]] list of [[supercomputer]]s.  MilkyWay@home is currently{{as of?|date=April 2013}} the 2nd largest distributed computing project behind [[Folding@Home]] which crossed 5,000 TFlops in 2009.

That data throughput massively outpaced new user acquisition is mostly due to the deployment of client software that uses commonly available medium and high performance [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) for numerical operations in Windows and Linux environments. MilkyWay@home [[CUDA]] code for a broad range of [[Nvidia]] GPUs was first released on the project's [https://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/download/code_release/ code release directory] on June 11, 2009 following experimental releases in the MilkyWay@home(GPU) fork of the project. An OpenCL application for AMD Radeon GPUs is also available and currently outperforming the CPU application.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} For example, a task that requires 10 minutes using a [[Radeon HD 2000 series|Radeon HD 3850]] GPU or 5 minutes using an [[Radeon HD 4000 series|Radeon HD 4850]] GPU, requires 6 hours using one core of an AMD [[Phenom II]] processor at 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

MilkyWay@home is a whitelisted [[gridcoin]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gridcoin.us/Guides/whitelist.htm |title=Gridcoin's Whitelist |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=  |publisher= |access-date=November 29, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the second largest manufacturer of gridcoins.

A '''mummy''' is a deceased [[human]] or an [[animal]] whose [[skin]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] have been preserved by either intentional or accidental exposure to [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], extreme cold, very low [[humidity]], or lack of air, so that the recovered body does not decay further if kept in cool and dry conditions. Some authorities restrict the use of the term to bodies deliberately [[embalming|embalmed]] with chemicals, but the use of the word to cover accidentally [[desiccation|desiccated]] bodies goes back to at least 1615 AD (See the section [[#Etymology and meaning|Etymology and meaning]]).

Mummies of humans and other animals have been found on every continent,&lt;ref name="Penn" /&gt; both as a result of natural preservation through unusual conditions, and as cultural artifacts. Over one million [[animal mummies]] have been found in Egypt, many of which are cats.&lt;ref name="pets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html|title=Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Egyptian animal mummies are [[sacred ibis]], and radiocarbon dating suggests  the Egyptian Ibis mummies that have been analyzed were from time frame that falls between approximately 450 and 250 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S. El|last4=Ikram|first4=S.|last5=Curtis|first5=C.|last6=Holland|first6=B.|last7=Willerslev|first7=E.|last8=Millar|first8=C.D.|last9=Lambert|first9=D.M.|title=Radiocarbon dating of Sacred Ibis mummies from ancient Egypt|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352409X15301243|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|volume=4|pages=355â361|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.09.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the well-known mummies of [[ancient Egypt]], deliberate mummification was a feature of several ancient cultures in areas of America and Asia with very dry climates. The [[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave mummies]] of Fallon, Nevada in North America were accurately dated at more than 9,400 years old. Before this discovery, the oldest known deliberate mummy was a child, one of the [[Chinchorro mummies]] found in the Camarones Valley, Chile, which dates around 5050 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartkusa |first=Luke |last2=Amarasiriwardena |first2=Dulasiri |last3=Arriaza |first3=Bernardo |last4=Bellis |first4=David |last5=YaÃ±ez |first5=Jorge |year=2011 |title=Exploring lead exposure in ancient Chilean mummies using a single strand of hair by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) |journal=Microchemical Journal |volume=98 |pages=267â274 |doi=10.1016/j.microc.2011.02.008 |issn=0026-265X |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known naturally mummified human corpse is a [[decapitation|severed head]] dated as 6,000 years old, found in 1936 AD at the site named Inca Cueva No. 4 in South America.&lt;ref name="head"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeometry.org/paleoamerican.htm|title=Andean Head Dated 6,000 Years Old|publisher=archaeometry.org|accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Etymology and meaning ==
&lt;!-- Do not change "Etymology" to "Egyptology" --&gt;
The English word ''mummy'' is derived from medieval Latin ''mumia'', a borrowing of the medieval Arabic word ''mÅ«miya'' (ÙÙÙÙØ§Ø¡) and from a Persian word ''mÅ«m'' (wax),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mummy |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: mummy |publisher=etymonline.com |accessdate= 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant an embalmed corpse, and as well as the bituminous embalming substance, and also meant "[[Asphalt|bitumen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mummy |title=origin of word "mummy" |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}} Also "mummy" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed6barch#page/763/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'']. Also "momie" in [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/momie CNRTL.fr (in French)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English|Medieval English]] term "mummy" was defined as "medical preparation of the substance of mummies", rather than the entire corpse, with [[Richard Hakluyt]] in 1599 AD complaining that "these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow".&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Mummy, 1", citing Hakluyr's "Voyages, II, 201"&lt;/ref&gt; These substances were defined as [[mummia]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] defines a mummy as "the body of a human being or animal embalmed (according to the ancient Egyptian or some analogous method) as a preparation for burial", citing sources from 1615 AD onward.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 1, 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[CyclopÃ¦dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chamber's ''CyclopÃ¦dia'']] and the Victorian zoologist [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland]]&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Mummy", 3c&lt;/ref&gt; define a mummy as follows: "A human or animal body desiccated by exposure to sun or air. Also applied to the frozen carcase of an animal imbedded in prehistoric snow".

Wasps of the genus ''[[Aleiodes]]'' are known as "mummy wasps" because they wrap their caterpillar prey as "mummies".

== History of mummy studies ==

[[File:Tuts Tomb Opened.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Howard Carter]] opens the innermost shrine of [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb]]

[[File:US Navy 110427-N-2531L-135 Tori Randall, Ph.D. prepares a 550-year old Peruvian child mummy for a CT scan.jpg|thumb|upright|A 550-year-old Peruvian child mummy being prepared for a CT scan]]

While interest in the study of mummies dates as far back as [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Greece]], most structured scientific study began at the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=1-2}} Prior to this, many rediscovered mummies were sold as curiosities or for use in [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] novelties such as [[mummia]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=1}} The first modern scientific examinations of mummies began in 1901, conducted by professors at the English-language Government School of Medicine in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The first [[X-ray]] of a mummy came in 1903, when professors [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] and [[Howard Carter]] used the only X-ray machine in Cairo at the time to examine the mummified body of [[Thutmose IV]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=3}} British chemist Alfred Lucas applied chemical analyses to Egyptian mummies during this same period, which returned many results about the types of substances used in embalming. Lucas also made significant contributions to the analysis of [[Tutankhamun]] in 1922.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=16}}

Pathological study of mummies saw varying levels of popularity throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=14-15}} In 1992, the First World Congress on Mummy Studies was held in [[Puerto de la Cruz]] on [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]].  More than 300 scientists attended the Congress to share nearly 100 years of collected data on mummies. The information presented at the meeting triggered a new surge of interest in the subject, with one of the major results being integration of [[Medical research|biomedical]] and [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] information on mummies with existing databases. This was not possible prior to the Congress due to the unique and highly specialized techniques required to gather such data.{{sfn| Aufderheide|2003|p=2}}

In more recent years, CT scanning has become an invaluable tool in the study of mummification by allowing researchers to digitally "unwrap" mummies without risking damage to the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldock |first1=C |last2=Hughes |first2=SW |last3=Whittaker |first3=DK |last4=Taylor |first4=J |last5=Davis |first5=R |last6=Spencer |first6=AJ |last7=Tonge |first7=K |last8=Sofat |first8=A |year=1994 |title=3-D reconstruction of an ancient Egyptian mummy using x-ray computer tomography |url= http://eprints.qut.edu.au/29982/|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue= |pages=806â808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of detail in such scans is so intricate that small linens used in tiny areas such as the nostrils can be digitally reconstructed in [[Stereoscopy|3-D]].&lt;ref name=Gewolb&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gewolb |first=Josh |title=Computer identifies mummy |journal=Science |date=28 September 2001 |volume=293 |issue=5539 |page=2383 |doi=10.1126/science.293.5539.2383a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such modelling has been utilized to perform digital autopsies on mummies to determine cause of death and lifestyle, such as in the case of [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=DeChant&gt;{{cite web |last=De Chant |first=Tim |title=Did King Tut Die in a Chariot Accident? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/ancient/did-king-tut-die-in-a-chariot-accident/ |work=Nova Next |publisher=PBS |accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Anthropogenic|Spontaneous|Natural}}Types ==

Mummies are typically divided into one of two distinct categories: anthropogenic or spontaneous. Anthropogenic mummies were deliberately created by the living for any number of reasons, the most common being for religious purposes. Spontaneous mummies, such as [[Ãtzi]], were created unintentionally due to natural conditions such as extremely dry heat or cold, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions such as those found in [[bog body|bogs]].{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=2}} While most individual mummies exclusively belong to one category or the other, there are examples of both types being connected to a single culture, such as those from the ancient Egyptian culture and the Andean cultures of South America.&lt;ref name=Dunn /&gt;

The earliest [[ancient Egypt]]ian mummies were created naturally due to the environment in which they were buried. In the era prior to 3500 BC,&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Egyptian Mummy |publisher=Penn Museum |url=http://www.penn.museum/long-term-exhibits/the-egyptian-mummy.html |accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Amandine [https://www.academia.edu/8963492/On_the_Origins_of_the_Egyptian_Mummification ON THE ORIGINS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIFICATION], Kmt 52, 2014, pp. 52-57&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians buried the dead in pit graves, without regard to [[social status]]. Pit graves were often shallow. This characteristic allowed for the hot, dry sand of the desert to [[dehydration|dehydrate]] the bodies, leading to natural mummification.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jimmy |title=An Overview of Mummification in Ancient Egypt |date=22 August 2011 |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/mummification.htm |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural preservation of the dead had a profound effect on [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. Deliberate mummification became an integral part of the rituals for the dead beginning as early as the [[Second Dynasty of Egypt|2nd dynasty]] (about 2800 BC).&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; New research of an 11-year study by [[University of York]], [[Macquarie University]] and [[University of Oxford]] suggests mummification occurred 1,500 years earlier than first thought.&lt;ref name="uyork"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2014/research/mummification/ | title=Embalming study ârewritesâ key chapter in Egyptian history | publisher=University of York | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians saw the preservation of the body after death as an important step to [[Coffin Texts|living well in the afterlife]]. As Egypt gained more prosperity, burial practices became a status symbol for the wealthy as well. This cultural hierarchy lead to the creation of elaborate [[tomb]]s, and more sophisticated methods of embalming.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher |first=Joann |title=Mummies Around the World |date=17 February 2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/mummies_01.shtml |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]] (about 2600 BC) Egyptian embalmers began to achieve "true mummification" through a process of [[Disembowelment|evisceration]], followed by preserving the body in various minerals and oils.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Much of this early experimentation with mummification in Egypt is unknown.

The few documents that directly describe the mummification process date to the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman period]]. The majority of the [[Papyrus|papyri]] that have survived only describe the ceremonial rituals involved in embalming, not the actual surgical processes involved. A text known as ''[[The Ritual of Embalming Papyrus|The Ritual of Embalming]]'' does describe some of the practical logistics of embalming, however, there are only two known copies and each is incomplete.&lt;ref name="Riggs"&gt;{{cite web |last=Riggs |first=Christina |title=Funerary Rituals (Ptolemaic and Roman Periods) |publisher=UCLA Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures |date=January 2010 |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1n10x347 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Wade |first2=Ronald S. |last=Brier |first=Bob |title=Surgical procedures during ancient Egyptian mummification |publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca |date=June 2001 |jstor=27802174 |volume=33 |pages=117â123}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to mummification shown in images, there are apparently also very few. The tomb of Tjay designated [[TT23]],  is one of only two known which show the wrapping of a mummy (Riggs 2014).&lt;ref name="Christina Riggs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Riggs |first=Christina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdtgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=The+Ritual+of+Embalming+Papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nh-TVd6yKsv8Ut30gaAD&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ritual%20of%20Embalming%20Papyrus&amp;f=false |title=Unwrapping Ancient Egypt: The Shroud, the Secret and the Sacred (p.82-83) |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing 5 Jun 2014, 336 pages, {{ISBN|0857855077}} |accessdate=2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text that describes the processes being used in latter periods is [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]. Written in Book 2 of the ''Histories'' is one of the most detailed descriptions of the Egyptian mummification process, including the mention of using [[natron]] in order to dehydrate corpses for preservation.&lt;ref name="Herodotus"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Greek historian Herodotus on the process of mummification -- and he has been proven accurate| publisher = utexas.edu| url = http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| accessdate = 9 November 2013| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023202442/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/medworld/herodotus_mummies.html| archivedate = 23 October 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these descriptions are short and fairly vague, leaving scholars to infer the majority of the techniques that were used by studying mummies that have been unearthed.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

By utilizing current advancements in technology, scientists have been able to uncover a plethora of new information about the techniques used in mummification. A series of [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]] performed on a 2,400-year-old mummy in 2008 revealed a tool that was left inside the [[cranial cavity]] of the skull.&lt;ref name="Jarus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jarus |first=Owen |title=Oops! Brain-Removal Tool Left in Mummy's Skull |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=14 December 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/oops-brain-removal-tool-left-mummys-skull-160456836.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool was a rod, made of an organic material, that was used to break apart the brain to allow it to drain out of the nose. This discovery helped to dispel the claim within Herodotus' works that the rod had been a hook made of iron.&lt;ref name="Herodotus" /&gt; Earlier experimentation in 1994 by researchers [[Bob Brier]] and Ronald Wade supported these findings. While attempting to replicate Egyptian mummification, Brier and Wade discovered that removal of the brain was much easier when the brain was liquefied and allowed to drain with the help of [[Gravitation|gravity]], as opposed to trying to pull the organ out piece-by-piece with a hook.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

Through various methods of study over many decades, modern [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologists]] now have an accurate understanding of how mummification was achieved in ancient Egypt. The first and most important step was to halt the process of decomposition, by removing the internal organs and washing out the body with a mix of spices and palm wine.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; The only organ left behind was the heart, as tradition held the heart was the seat of thought and feeling and would therefore still be needed in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; After cleansing, the body was then dried out with natron inside the empty body cavity as well as outside on the skin. The internal organs were also dried and either sealed in individual jars, or wrapped to be replaced within the body. This process typically took forty days.&lt;ref name="Brier&amp;Wade" /&gt;

After dehydration, the mummy was wrapped in many layers of [[linen]] cloth. Within the layers, Egyptian priests placed small [[amulet]]s to guard the decedent from evil.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; Once the mummy was completely wrapped, it was coated in a resin in order to keep the threat of moist air away. Resin was also applied to the coffin in order to seal it. The mummy was then sealed within its tomb, alongside the worldly goods that were believed to help aid it in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="Riggs" /&gt;

=== Mummification and rank ===
Mummification is one of the defining customs in [[ancient Egyptian society]] for people today. The practice of preserving the human body is believed to be a quintessential feature of Egyptian life. Yet even mummification has a history of development and was accessible to different ranks of society in different ways during different periods. There were at least three different processes of mummification according to [[Herodotus]]. They range from "the most perfect" to the method employed by the "poorer classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Most perfect" method ====

The most expensive process was to preserve the body by dehydration and protect against pests, such as insects. Almost all of the actions Herodotus described serve one of these two functions.
[[File:MÃ²mia Nesi BMVB 2964.jpg|alt=Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). Biblioteca Museu VÃ­ctor Balaguer. Vilanova i la GeltrÃº. Spain|thumb|Nesi mummy (dynasty XX). [[Biblioteca Museu VÃ­ctor Balaguer]]. Vilanova i la GeltrÃº. Spain]]
First, the [[brain]] was removed from the [[cranium]] through the nose; the gray matter was discarded. Modern mummy excavations have shown that instead of an iron hook inserted through the nose as Herodotus claims, a rod was used to [[wiktionary:liquefy|liquefy]] the brain via the cranium, which then drained out the nose by gravity. The embalmers then rinsed the skull with certain drugs that mostly cleared any residue of brain tissue and also had the effect of killing bacteria. Next, the embalmers made an incision along the [[Flank (anatomy)|flank]] with a sharp blade fashioned from an [[Ethiopia]]n stone and removed the contents of the abdomen. Herodotus does not discuss the separate preservation of these organs and their placement either in special jars or back in the cavity, a process that was part of the most expensive embalming, according to archaeological evidence.

The [[abdominal cavity]] was then rinsed with palm wine and an infusion of crushed, fragrant herbs and spices; the cavity was then filled with spices including [[myrrh]], [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]], and, Herodotus notes, "every other sort of spice except [[frankincense]]", also to preserve the person.

The body was further dehydrated by placing it in [[natron]], a naturally occurring salt, for seventy days. Herodotus insists that the body did not stay in the natron longer than seventy days. Any shorter time and the body is not completely dehydrated; any longer, and the body is too stiff to move into position for wrapping. The embalmers then wash the body again and wrapped it with linen bandages. The bandages were covered with a gum that modern research has shown is both waterproofing agent and an antimicrobial agent.

At this point, the body was given back to the family. These "perfect" mummies were then placed in wooden cases that were human-shaped. Richer people placed these wooden cases in stone sarcophagi that provided further protection. The family placed the sarcophagus in the tomb upright against the wall, according to Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |pages=50â51 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Avoiding expense ====

The second process that Herodotus describes was used by middle-class people or people who "wish to avoid expense". In this method, an oil derived from [[Cedrus|cedar trees]] was injected with a syringe into the abdomen. A rectal plug prevented the oil from escaping. This oil probably had the dual purpose of liquefying the internal organs but also of disinfecting the abdominal cavity. (By liquefying the organs, the family avoided the expense of [[canopic jar]]s and separate preservation.) The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days. At the end of this time, the body was removed and the cedar oil, now containing the liquefied organs, was drained through the [[rectum]]. With the body dehydrated, it could be returned to the family. Herodotus does not describe the process of burial of such mummies, but they were perhaps placed in a [[shaft tomb]]. Poorer people used coffins fashioned from [[terracotta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=To Live Forever" Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=50 |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inexpensive method ====

The third and least-expensive method the embalmers offered was to clear the [[intestines]] with an unnamed liquid, injected as an [[enema]]. The body was then placed in [[natron]] for seventy days and returned to the family. Herodotus gives no further details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]] |first1=Edward |title=ToLiveForever: Egyptian Treasures from the Brooklyn Museum |date=2008 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |page=52 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mummies of Egypt, there have been instances of mummies being discovered in other areas of the [[African continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steyn|first=Maryna|last2=Binneman|first2=Johan|last3=Loots|first3=Marius|date=2007|title=The Kouga Mummified Human Remains|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/5758/Steyn_Kouga(2007).pdf?sequence=1|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=62|pages=3-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosothwane|first=Morongwa|date=2011|title=The Tuli Mummy: A Preliminary Report from Northeastern Botswana|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/19039/Mosothwane_Tuli(2011).pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|journal=South African Archaeological Bulletin|volume=66|pages=157-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies show a mix of anthropogenic and spontaneous mummification, with some being thousands of years old.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==== Libya ====

The mummified remains of an infant were discovered during an expedition by archaeologist [[Fabrizio Mori]] to [[Libya]] during the winter of 1958â1959 in the natural cave structure of [[Uan Muhuggiag]].{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281}} After curious deposits and cave paintings were discovered on the surfaces of the cave, expedition leaders decided to excavate. Uncovered alongside fragmented animal bone tools was the mummified body of an infant, wrapped in animal skin and wearing a necklace made of ostrich egg shell beads. Professor Tongiorgi of the University of Pisa radiocarbon-dated the infant to between 5,000â8,000 years old. A long incision located on the right abdominal wall, and the absence of internal organs, indicated that the body had been eviscerated [[Autopsy|post-mortem]], possibly in an effort to preserve the remains.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=282}} A bundle of herbs found within the body cavity also supported this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|title=Science: Older than Egypt?|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,865145,00.html|accessdate=13 November 2013|newspaper=Time|date=21 December 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research revealed that the child had been around 30 months old at the time of death, though gender could not be determined due to poor preservation of the sex organs.{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=281-282}}&lt;ref name=Wan&gt;{{cite web|title=Wan Muhuggiag|url=http://www.temehu.com/wan-muhuggiag.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
[[File:Momie de Jingzhou.jpg|thumb|300px|Mummy in the history museum of [[Jingzhou]]]]

The mummies of Asia are usually considered to be accidental. The decedents were buried in just the right place where the environment could act as an agent for preservation. This is particularly common in the desert areas of the Tarim Basin and Iran. Mummies have been discovered in more humid Asian climates, however these are subject to rapid decay after being removed from the grave.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard" /&gt;

==== China ====
[[File:Xin Zhui 3.JPG|thumb|left|The mummy of [[Xin Zhui]].]]
Mummies from various [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]] throughout [[China]]'s history have been discovered in several locations across the country. They are almost exclusively considered to be unintentional mummifications. Many areas in which mummies have been uncovered are difficult for preservation, due to their warm, moist climates. This makes the recovery of mummies a challenge, as exposure to the outside world can cause the bodies to decay in a matter of hours.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zolfagharifard |first=Ellie |title=The Chinese mummy that aged 300 years in a day: Experts baffled by 'perfectly preserved' body that turned BLACK just hours after its coffin was opened |publisher=Mail Online |date=15 October 2013 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2460931/The-Chinese-mummy-aged-300-years-day-Experts-baffled-perfectly-preserved-body-turned-BLACK-just-hours-coffin-opened.html |accessdate=9 November 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a Chinese mummy that was preserved despite being buried in an environment not conducive to mummification is [[Xin Zhui]]. Also known as Lady Dai, she was discovered in the early 1970s at the [[Mawangdui]] archaeological site in [[Changsha]].&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonn-Muller |first=Eti |title=China's Sleeping Beauty |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=10 April 2009 |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/mawangdui/ |accessdate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the wife of the marquis of Dai during the [[Han dynasty]], who was also buried with her alongside another young man often considered to be a very close relative.&lt;ref name="K.Hirst"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirst |first=K.

Her corpse was so well-preserved that surgeons from the Hunan Provincial Medical Institute were able to perform an autopsy.&lt;ref name="Bonn-Muller" /&gt; The exact reason why her body was so completely preserved has yet to be determined.&lt;ref name="Orbit"&gt;{{cite web| title = Meet the Lady Dai . . .| publisher = redorbit.com| date = 4 November 2004| url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/100340/meet_the_lady_dai____of_145bc_/| accessdate = 9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more infamous mummies to be discovered in China are those termed [[Tarim mummies]] because of their discovery in the [[Tarim Basin]]. The dry desert climate of the basin proved to be an excellent agent for desiccation. For this reason, over 200 Tarim mummies, which are over 4,000 years old, were excavated from a cemetery in the present-day [[Xinjiang]] region.&lt;ref name="Wade"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |title=A Host of Mummies, a Forest of Secrets |publisher=New York Times |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16archeo.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies were found buried in upside-down boats with hundreds of 13-foot long wooden poles in the place of tombstones.&lt;ref name="Wade" /&gt; [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequence]] data&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert J. |last=Saiget |title=Caucasians preceded East Asians in basin |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |work=The Washington Times |publisher=News World Communications |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2007-08-20 |quote=A study last year by [[Jilin]] University also found that the mummies' DNA had Europoid genes. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050420224622/http://washingtontimes.com/world/20050419-101056-2135r.htm |archivedate=2005-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--a major newspaper as is legitimate a source as any other publication.--&gt;&lt;!-- Yes, but unpublished research is not.

As of 2012, at least eight mummified human remains have been recovered from the Douzlakh Salt Mine at Chehr Abad in northwestern [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="Aali"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Abar |first2=Aydin |last3=Boenke |first3=Nicole |last4=Pollard |first4=Mark |last5=RÃ¼hli |first5=Frank |last=Aali |first=Abolfazl |last6=StÃ¶llne |first6=Thomas |title=Ancient salt mining and salt men: the interdisciplinary Chehrabad Douzlakh project in north-western Iran |journal=Antiquity |volume=086 |issue=333 |publisher=Department of Archaeology, Durham University |location=Durham, UK |date=September 2012 |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/aali333/ |accessdate=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their salt preservation, these bodies are collectively known as [[Saltmen]].&lt;ref name="Chehr Abad"&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Chehr Abad "Salt men" and the isotopic ecology of humans in ancient Iran| journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology| date = November 2010| pmid = 20949607| doi = 10.1002/ajpa.21314| volume=143| issue=3| pages=343â54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon-14]] testing conducted in 2008 dated three of the bodies to around 400 BC. Later [[isotope|isotopic]] research on the other mummies returned similar dates, however, many of these individuals were found to be from a region that is not closely associated with the mine. It was during this time that researchers determined the mine suffered a major collapse, which likely caused the death of the miners.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt; Since there is significant archaeological data that indicates the area was not actively inhabited during this time period, current consensus holds that the accident occurred during a brief period of temporary mining activity.&lt;ref name="Aali" /&gt;

==== Siberia ====
In 1993, a team of Russian archaeologists led by Dr. [[Natalia Polosmak]] discovered the [[Siberian Ice Maiden]], a [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Siberian woman, on the [[Ukok Plateau]] in the [[Altai Mountains]] near the Mongolian border.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes"&gt;{{cite web| title = Siberian Princess reveals her 2,500 year old tattoos| publisher = The Siberian Times| date = 14 August 2012| url = http://siberiantimes.com/culture/others/features/siberian-princess-reveals-her-2500-year-old-tattoos/| accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy was naturally frozen due to the severe climatic conditions of the Siberian steppe. Also known as Princess Ukok, the mummy was dressed in finely detailed clothing and wore an elaborate headdress and jewelry. Alongside her body were buried six decorated horses and a symbolic meal for her last journey.&lt;ref name="Adkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adkins |first=Jan |title=Unquiet Mummies |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/unquiet-mummies.html |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her left arm and hand were tattooed with [[animal style]] figures, including a highly stylized [[deer]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

The Ice Maiden has been a source of some recent controversy. The mummy's skin has suffered some slight decay, and the tattoos have faded since the excavation. Some residents of the [[Altai Republic]], formed after the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]], have requested the return of the Ice Maiden, who is currently stored in [[Novosibirsk]] in [[Siberia]].&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polosmak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polosmak |first=Natalya |title=A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven |journal=[[National Geographic Magazine]] |pages=80â103 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Siberian mummy, a man, was discovered much earlier in 1929. His skin was also marked with tattoos of two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s, which decorated his chest, and three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat on his left arm.&lt;ref name="SiberianTimes" /&gt;

==== Philippines ====
Philippine mummies are called [[Kabayan Mummies]]. They are common in [[Igorot]] culture and their heritage. The mummies are found in some areas named [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Sagada, Mountain Province|Sagada]] and among others. The mummies are dated between the 14th and 19th centuries.

=== Europe ===
The European continent is home to a diverse spectrum of spontaneous and anthropogenic mummies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/solved-the-mystery-of-britains-bronze-age-mummies-48475 |title=Solved: the mystery of Britainâs Bronze Age mummies |last=Booth |first=Tom |date=24 Nov 2015 |website=The Conversation |access-date=3 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best-preserved mummies have come from bogs located across the region. The Capuchin monks that inhabited the area left behind hundreds of intentionally-preserved bodies that have provided insight into the customs and cultures of people from various eras. One of the oldest, and most infamous, mummies (nicknamed [[Ãtzi]]) was discovered on this continent. New mummies continue to be uncovered in Europe well into the 21st Century.

==== Bog bodies ====
{{Main article|Bog body}}
The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]], and [[Denmark]] have produced a number of [[Bog body|bog bodies]], mummies of people deposited in [[bog|sphagnum bogs]], apparently as a result of murder or ritual sacrifices. In such cases, the acidity of the water, low temperature and lack of oxygen combined to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] the body's skin and soft tissues. The skeleton typically disintegrates over time. Such mummies are remarkably well preserved on emerging from the bog, with skin and internal organs intact; it is even possible to determine the decedent's last meal by examining [[stomach]] contents. A famous case is that of the [[HaraldskÃ¦r Woman]], who was discovered by labourers in a bog in [[Jutland]] in 1835. She was erroneously identified as an early medieval Danish queen, and for that reason was placed in a royal [[sarcophagus]] at the Saint Nicolai Church, [[Vejle]], where she currently remains. Another famous bog body, also from Denmark, known as the [[Tollund Man]] was discovered in 1950. The corpse was noted for its excellent preservation of the face and feet, which appeared as if the man had recently died. To this day, only the head of Tollund Man remains, due to the decomposition of the rest of his body, which was not preserved along with the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Library |first1=Silkeborg Public |last2=Museum |first2=Silkeborg |url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp |title=A Body Appears |work=The Tollund Man â A Face from Prehistoric Denmark |accessdate=22 September 2007 |publisher=Silkeborg Public Library |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canary Islands ====

{{Main article|Guanche mummies}}
The mummies of the [[Canary Islands]] belong to the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Guanches|Guanche]] people and date to the time before 14th Century Spanish explorers settled in the area. All deceased people within the Guanche culture were mummified during this time, though the level of care taken with embalming and burial varied depending on individual social status. Embalming was carried out by specialized groups, organized according to gender, who were considered unclean by the rest of the community. The techniques for embalming were similar to those of the ancient Egyptians; involving evisceration, preservation, and stuffing of the evacuated bodily cavities, then wrapping of the body in animal skins. Despite the successful techniques utilized by the Guanche, very few mummies remain due to looting and desecration.&lt;ref name="Horne"&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Ireland |first2=Robert |last=Horne |first=Patrick |title=Moss and a Guanche Mummy: An Unusual Utilization |journal=The Bryologist |year=1991 |volume=94 |issue=4 |page=407 |jstor=3243832 |publisher=American Bryological and Lichenological Society |doi=10.2307/3243832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockburn"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cockburn |editor1-first=Aidan |editor2-last=Cockburn |editor2-first=Eve |editor3-last=Reyman |editor3-first=Theodore A. |title=Mummies, Disease and Ancient Cultures |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=University Press, Cambridge, UK |page=284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZHa5vHOS0C&amp;pg=PA263&amp;dq=Guanche+mummies |edition=2nd |accessdate=11 November 2013 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic ====
[[File:Brno CZ Crypt at the Capuchin Monastery 02.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Mummies in the [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]]]]
The majority of mummies recovered in the [[Czech Republic]] come from underground crypts. While there is some evidence of deliberate mummification, most sources state that desiccation occurred naturally due to unique conditions within the crypts.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=192}}&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu /&gt;

The [[Capuchin Crypt in Brno]] contains three hundred years of mummified remains directly below the main altar.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES and MUMMIFIED REMAINS|url=http://www.orchestrion.cz/mummy.htm|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 18th Century when the crypt was opened, and continuing until the practice was discontinued in 1787, the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin monks]] of the monastery would lay the deceased on a pillow of bricks on the ground. The unique air quality and topsoil within the crypt naturally preserved the bodies over time.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=AtlasCapu&gt;{{cite web|title=The Czech's Capuchin Crypt|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/czechs-capuchin-crypt|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately fifty mummies were discovered in an abandoned crypt beneath the [[Church of St. Procopius of SÃ¡zava]] in [[Vamberk]] in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=Agentura&gt;{{cite web|title=Monastery of Broumov|url=http://www.broumovsko.cz/en/monastery-of-broumov/monastery-of-broumov|publisher=Agentura pro rozvoj Broumovska|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers digging a trench accidentally broke into the crypt, which began to fill with waste water. The mummies quickly began to deteriorate, though thirty-four were able to be rescued and stored temporarily at the District Museum of the OrlickÃ© Mountains until they could be returned to the monastery in 2000.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The mummies range in age and social status at time of death, with at least two children and one priest.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt; The majority of the Vamberk mummies date from the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Agentura /&gt;

The [[Klatovy]] catacombs currently house an exhibition of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mummies, alongside some aristocrats, that were originally interred between 1674â1783. In the early 1930s, the mummies were accidentally damaged during repairs, resulting in the loss of 140 bodies. The newly updated airing system preserves the thirty-eight bodies that are currently on display.&lt;ref name=Orchestrion /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klatovy&gt;{{cite web|title=New exposition|url=http://www.katakomby.cz/klatovycatacombs/newexposition.aspx|publisher=KlatovskÃ© katakomby|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
[[File:Skrudstrupspigen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a grave mound in Denmark.]]
Apart from several bog bodies, Denmark has also yielded several other mummies, such as the three Borum EshÃ¸j mummies, the Skrydstrup Woman and the [[Egtved Girl]], who were all found inside burial mounds, or [[tumuli]].

In 1875, the Borum EshÃ¸j grave mound was uncovered, which had been built around three coffins, which belonged to a middle aged man and woman as well as a man in his early twenties.&lt;ref name=Natmus /&gt; Through examination, the woman was discovered to be around 50â60 years old. She was found with several artifacts made of bronze, consisting of buttons, a belt plate, and rings, showing she was of higher class. All of the hair had been removed from the skull later when farmers had dug through the casket. Her original hairstyle is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldtiden.natmus.dk/udstillingen/bronzealderen/familien_i_borum_eshoej/kvinden_fra_borum_eshoej/language/uk/ |title=The woman from Borum EshÃ¸j â Oldtiden |publisher=Oldtiden.natmus.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men wore kilts, and the younger man wore a sheath which contained a bronze dagger. All three mummies were dated to 1351â1345 BC.&lt;ref name=Natmus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/en/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-bronze-age/the-family-from-borum-eshoej/ |title= The family in Borum EshÃ¸j |publisher= http://natmus.dk/ |accessdate= 11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skrydstrup Woman was unearthed from a [[tumulus]] in Southern Jutland, in 1935. Carbon-14 dating showed that she had died around 1300 BC; examination also revealed that she was around 18â19 years old at the time of death, and that she had been buried in the summertime. Her hair had been drawn up in an elaborate hairstyle, which was then covered by a horse hair hairnet made by the [[sprang]] technique. She was wearing a blouse and a necklace as well as two golden earrings, showing she was of higher class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kaul |first=Flemming |url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/skrydstrup |title=Skrydstrup, We know where she lived â 1001 Stories of Denmark |publisher=Kulturarv.dk |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egtved Girl]], dated to 1370 BC, was also found inside a sealed coffin within a tumulus, in 1921. She was wearing a [[bodice]] and a skirt, including a belt and bronze bracelets. Found with the girl, at her feet, were the cremated remains of a child and, by her head, a box containing some bronze pins, a hairnet, and an [[Bradawl|awl]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C.

==== Hungary ====

In 1994, 265 mummified bodies were found in the crypt of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church in [[VÃ¡c]], Hungary from the 1729â1838 period. The discovery proved to be scientifically important, and by 2006 an exhibition was established in the Museum of Natural History in [[Budapest]]. Unique to the Hungarian mummies are their elaborately decorated coffins, with no two being exactly alike.&lt;ref name=AtlObs1&gt;{{cite web|title=MUMMIES OF VÃC, HUNGARY|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mummies-v-c-hungary|publisher=AtlasObscura|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
[[File:Monks' Corridor.jpg|thumb|right|Mummies in the Monks' Corridor of the [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]].]]
The varied geography and climatology of Italy has led to many cases of spontaneous mummification.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=193}} Italian mummies display the same diversity, with a conglomeration of natural and intentional mummification spread across many centuries and cultures.

The oldest natural mummy in Europe was discovered in 1991 in the [[Ãtztal Alps]] on the Austrian-Italian border. Nicknamed [[Ãtzi]], the mummy is a 5,300-year-old male believed to be a member of the [[Tamins-Carasso-Isera]] cultural group of [[South Tyrol]].&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite web |last=Owen |first=James |title=5 Surprising Facts About Otzi the Iceman |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131016-otzi-ice-man-mummy-five-facts/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=11 November 2013 |date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OtziCulture&gt;{{cite web|title=Which cultural group did Ãtzi belong to?|url=http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|publisher=South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology|accessdate=11 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111110719/http://www.iceman.it/en/node/295|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his age, a recent DNA study conducted by [[Walther Parson]] of [[Innsbruck Medical University]] revealed Ãtzi has 19 living genetic relatives.&lt;ref name=Owen /&gt;

The [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini|Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo]] were built in the 16th century by the monks of Palermoâs Capuchin monastery. Originally intended to hold the deliberately mummified remains of dead friars, interment in the catacombs became a status symbol for the local population in the following centuries. Burials continued until the 1920s, with one of the most famous final burials being that of [[Rosalia Lombardo]]. In all, the catacombs host nearly 8000 mummies. (See: [[Catacombe dei Cappuccini]])

The most recent discovery of mummies in Italy came in 2010, when sixty mummified human remains were found in the [[crypt]] of the Conversion of St Paul church in Roccapelago di [[Pievepelago]], Italy. Built in the 15th century as a cannon hold and later converted in the 16th century, the crypt had been sealed once it had reached capacity, leaving the bodies to be protected and preserved. The crypt was reopened during restoration work on the church, revealing the diverse array of mummies inside. The bodies were quickly moved to a museum for further study.&lt;ref name=Huddersfield&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Stefano Vaninâs forensic expertise is used to learn lessons from the extraordinary Mummies of Roccapelago|url=http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|publisher=University of Huddersfield|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=24 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111111205/http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/aaarg/projects/the-mummies-of-roccapelago/|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

The mummies of North America are often steeped in controversy, as many of these bodies have been linked to still-existing native cultures. While the mummies provide a wealth of historically-significant data, native cultures and tradition often demands the remains be returned to their original resting places. This has led to many legal actions by Native American councils, leading to most museums keeping mummified remains out of the public eye.&lt;ref name=Spirit /&gt;

In 1972, eight remarkably preserved mummies were discovered at an abandoned [[Inuit]] settlement called [[Qilakitsoq]], in Greenland. The "Greenland Mummies" consisted of a six-month-old baby, a four-year-old boy, and six women of various ages, who died around 500 years ago.

Intentional mummification in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]] was practiced by the [[Aztec]] culture. These bodies are collectively known as [[Aztec mummy|Aztec mummies]].

(See: [[Aztec mummy]])

Natural mummification has been known to occur in several places in Mexico, though the most famous are the [[mummies of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name=prof&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor unravels secrets of the Guanajuato mummies |newspaper=US Fed News Service, Including US State News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of these mummies, most of which date to the late 19th century, have been on display at ''El Museo de las Momias'' in the city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] since 1970. The museum claims to have the smallest mummy in the world on display (a mummified [[fetus]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guanajuato: Guia para descubrir los encantos del estado |editor1=Jimenez Gonzalez |editor2=Victor Manuel |isbn=978-607-400-177-8 |year=2009 |publisher=Solaris |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was thought that minerals in the soil had the preserving effect, however it may rather be due to the warm, arid climate.&lt;ref name=prof /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Detroit Science Center: The Accidental Mummies of Guanajuato Touring Exhibition to Make World Debut in Detroit |newspaper=Pediatrics Week.  |location=Atlanta |date=27 June 2009 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexican mummies are also on display in the small town of [[EncarnaciÃ³n de DÃ­az]], [[Jalisco]].

==== United States ====
[[Spirit Cave mummy|Spirit Cave Man]] was discovered in 1940 during salvage work prior to [[guano]] mining activity that was scheduled to begin in the area. The mummy is a middle-aged male, found completely dressed and lying on a blanket made of animal skin. Radiocarbon tests in the 1990s dated the mummy to being nearly 9,000 years old. The remains are currently held at the [[Nevada State Museum, Carson City|Nevada State Museum]]. There has been some controversy within the local Native American community, who began petitioning to have the remains returned and reburied in 1995.&lt;ref name=Spirit&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit Cave Man|url=http://museums.nevadaculture.org/new_exhibits/cc-UnderOneSky/spiritcave.htm|publisher=Nevada State Museum|accessdate=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112081148/http://museums.nevadaculture.org/new_exhibits/cc-UnderOneSky/spiritcave.htm|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Muska /&gt;&lt;ref name=Asher&gt;{{cite web |last=Asher |first=Laura |title=Oldest North American Mummy |url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/nevada.html |work=Archaeology |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |accessdate=12 November 2013 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oceania ===
[[File:Robley with mokomokai collection 2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Horatio Gordon Robley with his mokomokai collection.]]

Mummies from the [[Oceania]] are not limited only to [[Australia]]. Discoveries of mummified remains have also been located in [[New Zealand]], and the [[Torres Strait]],{{sfn|Cockburn|1998|p=289}} though these mummies have been historically harder to examine and classify.{{sfn|Aufderheide|2003|p=277}} Prior to the 20th Century, most literature on mummification in the region was either silent or anecdotal.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; However, the boom of interest generated by the scientific study of Egyptian mummification lead to more concentrated study of mummies in other cultures, including those of Oceania.

==== Australia ====

The aboriginal mummification traditions found in [[Australia]] are thought be related to those found in the [[Torres Strait]] islands,&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dawson |first=Warren |title=Mummification in Australia and in America |journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1928 |volume=58 |pages=115â138 |jstor=4619529}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inhabitants of which achieved a high level of sophisticated mummification techniques (See:[[Mummy#Torres Strait|Torres Strait]]). Australian mummies lack some of the technical ability of the Torres Strait mummies, however much of the ritual aspects of the mummification process are similar.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; Full-body mummification was achieved by these cultures, but not the level of artistic preservation as found on smaller islands. The reason for this seems to be for easier transport of bodies by more nomadic tribes.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;

==== Torres Strait ====

The mummies of the Torres Strait have a considerably higher level of preservation technique as well as creativity compared to those found on Australia.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt; The process began with removal of viscera, after which the bodies were set in a seated position on a platform and either left to dry in the sun or smoked over a fire in order to aid in desiccation. In the case of smoking, some tribes would collect the fat that drained from the body to mix with ocher to create red paint that would then be smeared back on the skin of the mummy.&lt;ref name=Melanesia&gt;{{cite web |last=Deem |first=James |title=Melanesia Mummies |url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |accessdate=15 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015193124/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/melanesia.htm |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mummies remained on the platforms, decorated with the clothing and jewelry they wore in life, before being buried.&lt;ref name=Dawson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Melanesia /&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main article|Mokomokai}}

Some [[MÄori people|MÄori]] tribes from New Zealand would keep mummified heads as trophies from tribal warfare.&lt;ref name=Maori1 /&gt; They are also known as [[Mokomokai]]. In the 19th Century, many of the trophies were acquired by Europeans who found the tattooed skin to be a phenomenal curiosity. Westerners began to offer valuable commodities in exchange for the uniquely tattooed mummified heads. The heads were later put on display in museums, 16 of which being housed across France alone. In 2010, the Rouen City Hall of France returned one of the heads to New Zealand, despite earlier protests by the Culture Ministry of France.&lt;ref name=Maori1&gt;{{cite web|title=Mummified Maori head returned to NZ|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|publisher=Australian Geographic|accessdate=13 November 2013|date=10 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204030056/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/mummified-maori-head-returned-to-nz-after-136-years.htm|archivedate=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that some Maori tribes may have practiced full-body mummification, though the practice is not thought to have been widespread.&lt;ref name=Orchiston&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orchiston |first=D. Wayne |title=THE PRACTICE OF MUMMIFICATION AMONG THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |year=1968 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=186â190 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_77_1968/Volume_77,_No._2/The_practice_of_mummification_among_the_New_Zealand_Maori,_by_Wayne_Orchiston,_p_186_-_190/p1 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of Maori mummification has been historically controversial, with some experts in past decades claiming that such mummies have never existed.&lt;ref name=Tregear&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tregear |first=Edward |title=Maori Mummies |journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |year=1916 |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=167â168 |url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1053 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary science does now acknowledge the existence of full-body mummification in the culture. There is still controversy, however, as to the nature of the mummification process. Some bodies appear to be spontaneously created by the natural environment, while others exhibit signs of deliberate practices. General modern consensus tends to agree that there could be a mixture of both types of mummification, similar to that of the ancient Egyptian mummies.&lt;ref name=Orchiston /&gt;

=== South America ===
The [[South America]]n continent contains some of the oldest mummies in the world, both deliberate and accidental.&lt;ref name="head" /&gt; The bodies were preserved by the best agent for mummification: the environment. The Pacific coastal desert in [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] is one of the driest areas in the world and the dryness facilitated mummification. Rather than developing elaborate processes such as later-dynasty ancient Egyptians, the early South Americans often left their dead in naturally dry or frozen areas, though some did perform surgical preparation when mummification was intentional.&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite web| title = The Earliest Mummies| publisher = The Field Museum| url = http://mummies.fieldmuseum.org/behind-the-scenes/south-american-mummies| accessdate = 9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for intentional mummification in South America include memorialization, immortalization, and religious offerings.&lt;ref name="Arriaza"&gt;{{cite web |last2=Hapke |first2=Russell A. |last3=Standen |first3=Vivien G. |last=Arriaza |first=Bernardo |title=Making the Dead Beautiful: Mummies as Art |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |date=16 December 1998|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/chinchorro/ |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of mummified bodies have been found in pre-Columbian cemeteries scattered around Peru.

==== Chinchorro mummies ====
[[File:Momia cultura chinchorro aÃ±o 3000 AC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chinchorro mummies are the oldest deliberate mummies.]]
{{Main article|Chinchorro mummies}}
The [[Chinchorro mummies]] are the oldest intentionally prepared mummified bodies ever found. Beginning in [[5th millennium BC]] and continuing for an estimated 3,500 years,&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; all human burials within the Chinchorro culture were prepared for mummification. The bodies were carefully prepared, beginning with removal of the internal organs and skin, before being left in the hot, dry climate of the [[Atacama Desert]], which aided in desiccation.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt; A large number of Chinchorro mummies were also prepared by skilled artisans to be preserved in a more artistic fashion, though the purpose of this practice is widely debated.&lt;ref name="Arriaza" /&gt;

==== Inca mummies ====
[[File:Llullaillaco mummies in Salta city, Argentina.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco]] mummy in [[Salta Province]] ([[Argentina]]).]]
Several naturally-preserved, unintentional mummies dating from the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] period (1438â1532 AD) have been found in the colder regions of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Peru]]. These are collectively known as "ice mummies".&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; The first Incan ice mummy was discovered in 1954 atop [[Cerro El Plomo|El Plomo Peak]] in Chile, after an eruption of the nearby volcano [[Sabancaya]] melted away ice that covered the body.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Ice Mummies of the Inca |publisher=NOVA |date=24 November 1998 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ice-mummies-inca.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plomo Mummy|Mummy of El Plomo]] was a male child who was presumed to be wealthy due to his well-fed bodily characteristics. He was considered to be the most well-preserved ice mummy in the world until the discovery of Mummy Juanita in 1995.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

[[Mummy Juanita]] was discovered near the summit of [[Ampato]] in the Peruvian section of the [[Andes]] mountains by archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]].&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; Her body had been so thoroughly frozen that it had not been desiccated; much of her skin, muscle tissue, and internal organs retained their original structure.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; She is believed to be a ritual sacrifice, due to the close proximity of her body to the Incan capital of [[Cusco]], as well as the fact she was wearing highly intricate clothing to indicate her special social status. Several Incan ceremonial artifacts and temporary shelters uncovered in the surrounding area seem to support this theory.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

More evidence that the Inca left sacrificial victims to die in the elements, and later be unintentionally preserved, came in 1999 with the discovery of the [[Children of Llullaillaco|Llullaillaco mummies]] on the border of Argentina and Chile.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Yancey |title=Interview: "Inca Mummy Man" Johan Reinhard |publisher=National Geographic |date=28 October 2010 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0621_050621_incamummy.html |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three mummies are children, two girls and one boy, who are thought to be sacrifices associated with the ancient ritual of ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''.&lt;ref name="Handwerk"&gt;{{cite web |last=Handwerk |first=Brian |title=Inca Child Sacrifice Victims Were Drugged |publisher=National Geographic |date=29 July 2013 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130729-inca-mummy-maiden-sacrifice-coca-alcohol-drug-mountain-andes-children/?rptregcta=reg_free_np&amp;rptregcampaign=20131016_rw_membership_r1p_us_se_w#finished |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[biochemistry|biochemical analysis]] of the mummies has revealed that the victims had consumed increasing quantities of [[alcohol]] and [[coca]], possibly in the form of [[chicha]], in the months leading up to sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt; The dominant theory for the drugging reasons that, alongside ritual uses, the substances probably made the children more docile. Chewed coca leaves found inside the eldest child's mouth upon her discovery in 1999 supports this theory.&lt;ref name="Handwerk" /&gt;

'''Inca emperors.''' The bodies of Inca emperors and wives were mummified after death.  In 1533, the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s of the Inca Empire viewed the mummies in the Inca capital of Cuzco. The mummies were displayed, often in lifelike positions, in the palaces of the deceased emperors and had a retinue of servants to care for them.  The Spanish were impressed with the quality of the mummification which involved removal of the organs, embalming, and freeze-drying.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney&lt;/ref&gt;

The population revered the mummies of the Inca emperors.  This reverence seemed idolatry to the [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish and in 1550 they confiscated the mummies. The mummies were taken to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] where they were displayed in the San Andres Hospital.  The mummies deteriorated in the humid climate of Lima and eventually they were either buried or destroyed by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;McCaa, Robert, Nimlos, Aleta, and Hampe Martinez, Teodoro (nd) "Why Blame Smallpox"; http://users.pop.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/why_blame_smallpox.pdf, accessed 27 Jan 2017; Pringle, Harriet (2011), "Inca Empire", ''National Geographic'', http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/inca-empire/pringle-text/2, accessed 27 Jan 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to find the mummies of the Inca emperors beneath the San Andres hospital in 2001 was unsuccessful.  The archaeologists found a crypt, but it was empty.  Possibly the mummies had been removed when the building was repaired after an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle &lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-mummification ==
{{Main article|Buddhist mummies|Sokushinbutsu}}
Monks whose bodies remain [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] without any traces of deliberate mummification are venerated by some Buddhists who believe they successfully were able to mortify their flesh to death. Self-mummification was practiced until the late 1800s in Japan and has been outlawed since the early 1900s.

Many Mahayana Buddhist monks were reported to know their time of death and left their last testaments and their students accordingly buried them sitting in [[lotus position]], put into a vessel with drying agents (such as wood, paper, or [[Calcium oxide|lime]]) and surrounded by bricks, to be exhumed later, usually after three years. The preserved bodies would then be decorated with paint and adorned with gold.

Bodies purported to be those of self-mummified monks are exhibited in several Japanese shrines, and it has been claimed that the monks, prior to their death, stuck to a sparse diet made up of salt, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s, [[root]]s, [[pine]] bark, and ''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum|urushi]]'' tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/~anomaly/japan/dbuddha.htm |title=The Buddhist Mummies of Japan |publisher=Sonic.net |date=24 August 1998 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mummies ==
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]] wished to be mummified after he died.]]

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
In the 1830s, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of [[utilitarianism]], left instructions to be followed upon his death which led to the creation of a sort of modern-day mummy. He asked that his body be displayed to illustrate how the "horror at dissection originates in ignorance"; once so displayed and lectured about, he asked that his body parts be preserved, including his skeleton (minus his skull, which despite being mis-preserved, was displayed beneath his feet until theft required it to be stored elsewhere),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miss Cellania |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |title=6 Restless Corpses |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate=9 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119161451/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/12653 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were to be dressed in the clothes he usually wore and "seated in a Chair usually occupied by me when living in the attitude in which I am sitting when engaged in thought". His body, outfitted with a wax head created because of problems preparing it as Bentham requested, is on open display in the [[University College London]].

=== Vladimir Lenin ===
During the early 20th century, the Russian movement of [[Russian cosmism|Cosmism]], as represented by [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov]], envisioned scientific resurrection of dead people. The idea was so popular that, after [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s death, [[Leonid Krasin]] and [[Alexander Bogdanov]] suggested to [[Cryonics|cryonically preserve]] his body and brain in order to revive him in the future.&lt;ref name="azbuka"&gt;See the article: Ð.Ð.

The mausoleum itself was modeled by [[Alexey Shchusev]] on the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Tomb of Cyrus]].

===Gottfried Knoche===
In late 19th-century Venezuela, a German-born doctor named [[Gottfried Knoche]] conducted experiments in mummification at his laboratory in the forest near [[La Guaira]]. He developed an [[embalming fluid]] (based on an [[aluminum chloride]] compound) that mummified corpses without having to remove the internal organs. The formula for his fluid was never revealed and has not been discovered. Most of the several dozen mummies created with the fluid (including himself and his immediate family) have been lost or were severely damaged by vandals and looters.

=== Summum ===
In 1975, an [[Esotericism|esoteric]] organization by the name of [[Summum]] introduced "Modern Mummification", a service that utilizes modern techniques along with aspects of ancient methods of mummification. The first person to formally undergo Summum's process of modern mummification was the founder of Summum, [[Claude Nowell|Summum Bonum Amen Ra]], who died in January 2008.&lt;ref name="CNNBeliefBlog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravitz |first=Jessica |title=Summum: Homegrown spiritual group, in news and in a pyramid |publisher=CNN |date=11 June 2010 |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/11/summum-a-belief-system-in-the-news-%E2%80%93-and-unlike-any-other/ |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summum is currently considered to be the only "commercial mummification business" in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Grant |title=Summum: Religious group performs mummification rituals in Utah pyramid |publisher=KSL.com |date=30 October 2010 |url=http://www.ksl.com/?sid=22660276 |accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alan Billis ===
In 2010, a team led by forensic archaeologist Stephen Buckley mummified Alan Billis using techniques based on 19 years of research of 18th-dynasty Egyptian mummification.

=== Plastination ===
{{Main article|Plastination}}
[[Plastination]] is a technique used in [[anatomy]] to conserve bodies or body parts. The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most microscopic properties of the original sample.

The technique was invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] when working at the anatomical institute of the [[Heidelberg University]] in 1978. Von Hagens has patented the technique in several countries and is heavily involved in its promotion, especially as the creator and director of the [[Body Worlds]] traveling exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com |title=Body Worlds Official Web Site |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibiting plastinated human bodies internationally. He also founded and directs the Institute for Plastination in [[Heidelberg]].

More than 40 institutions worldwide have facilities for plastination, mainly for medical research and study, and most affiliated to the International Society for Plastination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.plastination.org/ |title=International Society for Plastination |publisher=Isp.plastination.org |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment of ancient mummies in modern times ==
In the [[Middle Ages]], based on a mistranslation from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term for bitumen, it was thought that mummies possessed healing properties. As a result, it became common practice to grind Egyptian mummies into a powder to be sold and used as medicine. When actual mummies became unavailable, the [[Desiccation|sun-desiccated]] corpses of criminals, slaves and [[Suicide|suicidal]] people were substituted by mendacious merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/bodies/cases/case18.html | title = What was mummy medicine? | accessdate =8 February 2008 | publisher = [[Channel 4]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business that flourished until the late 16th century. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties to stop bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]] in powdered form as in [[mellified man]].&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Daly |first=N. |year=1994 |title=That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=24â51 |doi=10.2307/1345912 |jstor=1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists also made use of Egyptian mummies; a brownish pigment known as [[mummy brown]], based on ''[[mummia]]'' (sometimes called alternatively ''[[caput mortuum]]'', Latin for ''death's head''), which was originally obtained by grinding human and animal Egyptian mummies. It was most popular in the 17th century, but was discontinued in the early 19th century when its composition became generally known to artists who replaced the said pigment by a totally different blend -but keeping the original name, mummia or mummy brown-yielding a similar tint and based on ground minerals (oxides and fired earths) and or blends of powdered gums and oleoresins (such as myrrh and frankincense) as well as ground bitumen. These blends appeared on the market as forgeries of powdered mummy pigment but were ultimately considered as acceptable replacements, once antique mummies were no longer permitted to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm Mumie - nicht lieferbar!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215033915/http://www.kremer-pigmente.de/mumie.htm |date=15 February 2012 }} article by Kremer Pigmente GmbH &amp; Co NYC,  (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;   Many thousands of mummified cats were also sent from Egypt to England to be processed for use in [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wake |first=Jehanne |author-link=Jehanne Wake |title=Kleinwort, Benson: the history of two families in banking |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-828299-0 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm1fHrcgZuoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA118&amp;dq=mummified+cats+fertilizer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, following the discovery of the first tombs and artifacts in Egypt, Egyptology was a huge fad in Europe, especially in [[Victorian era|Victorian England]]. European aristocrats would occasionally entertain themselves by purchasing mummies, having them unwrapped, and holding observation sessions.&lt;ref name="Daly unwrapping" /&gt; These sessions destroyed hundreds of mummies, because the exposure to the air caused them to disintegrate.

The use of mummies as [[fuel]] for [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] was documented by [[Mark Twain]] (likely as a joke or humor),&lt;ref name="Straight"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/020222.html | publisher = [[The Straight Dope]] |  title = Do Egyptians burn mummies as fuel? | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate =16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the truth of the story remains debatable. During the [[American Civil War]], mummy-wrapping linens were said to have been used to manufacture paper.&lt;ref name="Straight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Capital Weekly"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pronovost |first=Michelle |url=http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106183429/http://www.mainecoastnow.com/articles/2005/03/17/capitalweekly/local_news/n6mummy.txt |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 November 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2008 |date=17 March 2005 |publisher=[[Capital Weekly]] |title=Necessity of paper was the 'mummy' of invention}} &lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the reality of these claims is still equivocal.&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Nicholson |authorlink=Nicholson Baker |title=''[[Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper]]'' |year=2001 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-375-50444-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dane"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dane |first=Joseph A. |year=1995 |title=The Curse of the Mummy Paper |journal=Printing History |volume=17 |pages=18â25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is able to be measured using [[electromyography]] (EMG) from the contractions that occur. The general mechanism of it is still widely unknown. It is believed to be important in joint stabilization, as well as general [[motor control]].&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;

[[Image:EMGCOACTIVATION.JPG|thumb|Coactivation of [[biceps]] and [[triceps]]. The bicepsâ EMG is on top, while the tricepsâ EMG is on the bottom.]]

== Function ==
Muscle coactivation allows muscle groups surrounding a joint to become more stable. This is due to both muscles (or sets of muscles) contracting at the same time, which produces compression on the joint. The joint is able to become stiffer and more stable due to this action.&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riemann|first=Bryan L.|last2=Lephart|first2=Scott M.|date=2002-01-01|title=The Sensorimotor System, Part II: The Role of Proprioception in Motor Control and Functional Joint Stability|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=37|issue=1|pages=80â84|issn=1062-6050|pmc=164312|pmid=16558671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LongstaffBook2005&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezI2xyVwmgsC&amp;pg=PA234|title=BIOS Instant Notes in Neuroscience|last=Longstaff|first=Alan|date=2005-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=041535188X|language=en|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when the bicep and the triceps coactivate, the elbow becomes more stable. This stabilization mechanism is also important for unexpected loads impeded on the joint, allowing the muscles to coactivate and provide stability to the joint in a quick fashion.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev/&gt; This mechanism is controlled [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscularly]], which allows the muscle(s) to contract.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev /&gt; This occurs through a [[motor neuron]] sending a signal (through creating [[action potential]]s) to the [[Myocyte|muscle fiber]] to contract by releasing [[Acetylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5YXRAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9780878936953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwismv6h2MPTAhXqhFQKHbafBmkQ6AEIJzAA|title=Neuroscience|last=Purves|first=Dale|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=9780878936953|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When signals are sent to all muscle fibers in a muscle group, the muscle group will contract as a whole.

In the upper limbs, the stability of muscle coactivation allows for precise low-level physical tasks.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;  An example of this would be picking up a small object. By protecting the muscles at the end of their range of motion, the direction of the fine movements is able to be changed.&lt;ref name=Riemann2002rev/&gt; In the lower limbs, stability is important in upright standing balance. The coactivation of different muscle groups allows for proper balance and the ability to adjust weight and to stay upright on uneven ground.&lt;ref name=RehabBook2013&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eVOAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|title=Neuroscience - E-Book: Fundamentals for Rehabilitation|last=Lundy-Ekman|first=Laurie|date=2013-08-07|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=|isbn=9780323266482|edition=4th|pages=190â220|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed to be important for [https://starfishtherapies.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/postural-control-how-the-systems-work-together/ postural control] by stabilizing the spine.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt; Muscle coactivation is absolutely necessary for learning a fine motor skill or for any activity involving stability.&lt;ref name=RehabBook2013/&gt; In order for muscle coactivation to occur, it must inhibit [[reciprocal innervation]], which occurs when a muscle contracts and the synergist muscle relaxes.&lt;ref name=LongstaffBook2005/&gt; For muscle coactivation to occur, both the muscle and synergist muscle need to contract.

== Testing ==
Muscle coactivation is measured using a technique called [[electromyography]](EMG).&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt; This is performed by using surface EMG that responds to electrical activity of the muscle through the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dotan|first=Raffy|last2=Mitchell|first2=Cameron|last3=Cohen|first3=Rotem|last4=Klentrou|first4=Panagiota|last5=Gabriel|first5=David|last6=Falk|first6=Bareket|date=2017-04-27|title=ChildâAdult Differences in Muscle Activation â A Review|journal=Pediatric exercise science|volume=24|issue=1|pages=2â21|issn=0899-8493|pmc=3804466|pmid=22433260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical activity is only present in the muscle when the muscle voluntarily contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klass|first=Malgorzata|last2=Baudry|first2=StÃ©phane|last3=Duchateau|first3=Jacques|date=2007-07-01|title=Voluntary activation during maximal contraction with advancing age: a brief review|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=100|issue=5|pages=543â551|doi=10.1007/s00421-006-0205-x|pmid=16763836}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the muscle is contracted, the EMG is able to display the force of the contraction or how the nerves can respond to stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/electromyography_emg_92,P07656|title=Before, During and After Your EMG Test|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An EMG of coactivation would display the agonist and antagonist muscle contracting simultaneously. Although it is believed many muscles are involved in the mechanism of coactivation, methods to measure coactivation are finite to specific instances or two muscle systems. Because of this, little is understood about the role of coactivation in a multiple muscle system.&lt;ref name=Le2017rev/&gt;

'''Museology''' or '''museum studies''' is the study of [[museum]]s. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including [[Curator|curating]], [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation]], public programming, and [[Museum education|education]].

== Terminology ==
The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while âmuseologyâ is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (musÃ©ologie), Spanish (museologÃ­a), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) â while English speakers more often use the term âmuseum studiesâ to refer to that same field of study. When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the [[Latin]] âmuseographiaâ (French: musÃ©ographie, Spanish: museografÃ­a, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term âmuseum practiceâ or âoperational museologyâ&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|title=Key Concepts of Museology|last=International Council of Museums|first=|date=2009|website=icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the field ==
The development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early [[Collecting#History|collectors]] and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during [[Age of Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]] anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed [[Natural history museum|natural history]]  and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powersâ [[colonization]] of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in [[Western Europe]]an [[Western European colonialism and colonization|colonial projects]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecomuseums: A Sense of Place|last=Davis|first=Peter|publisher=Continuum International Publishing: London.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and âcivilizeâ the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though [[World's fair|Worldâs Fairs]], such as [[The Great Exhibition|The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London or the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago Worldâs Fair]], were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization in the West|last=Kishlansky|first=M.|last2=Geary|first2=P.|last3=OâBrien|first3=P.|publisher=Pearson Education.|year=2008|isbn=|edition=7|volume=C|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums. For instance, The Field Museum in Chicago grew out of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/history|website=The Field Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Museums Association]], the first professional membership organization for those working in the museum field, was established in London in 1889. In 1901, they developed [[Museums Journal]], the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museumâs]] Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association|last=Lewis|first=G.|publisher=Quiller Press.|year=1989|isbn=1-870948-37-8|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto.|last=Shelton|first=A.|publisher=Museum Worlds|year=2013|isbn=|volume=5 |issue=1|location=|pages=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Mensch|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Magpies on Mount Helicon. Museum and Community|url=|journal=ICOFOM Study Series|volume=25|pages=133â138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One attempt to re-envision museumsâ role was the concept of [[Ecomuseum]]s, first proposed publicly at ICOMâs 9th International Conference in France (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory.|last=SÃ¡nchez Laws|first=Ana Luisa|publisher=Berghahn Books.|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecomuseum]]s proliferated in Europe â and still exist around the world today â challenging traditional museums and dominant museum narratives, with an explicit focus on community control and the development of both heritage and sustainability. In 1988, Robert Lumleyâs book The Museum Time Machine âexpressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operationsâ.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or âoldâ field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by [[The Sunday Times]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Museology|last=Vergo|first=Peter|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies.&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Lavine|first2=Steven D.|title=Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|date=1991|publisher=Smithsonian Press|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kreamer|first2=Christine Mullen|last3=Lavine|first3=Steven|title=Museums and Communities: The Politics of Public Culture|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who are engaged in various ânewâ museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend âofficiallyâ began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of âradical reassessment of the roles of museums within societyâ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Critical theorists like [[Michel Foucault]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed â often adding the term âcriticalâ to their new titles (i.e. [[critical race theory]]) â a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features â so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stam|first=D.|date=1983|title=The Informed Muse: The Implications of 'The New Museology' for Museum Practice|url=|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=12|pages=267â283|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some of which are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others that are more traditional and less critical.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Operational museology ==
Operational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]]), and its [[Exhibit design|exhibitions]] and programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Critical museology==

=== Overview of the field ===
Critical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology. It is a broad field of study that engages critically with museums, calling into question the foundation assumptions of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=Anthony|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto|journal=Museum Worlds|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7â23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curatorial Dreams: Critics Imagine Exhibition|last=Lehrer|first=Erica|last2=Butler|first2=Shelley Ruth|publisher=McGill-Queenâs University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates critical museologyâs close connection to New Museology, which also challenges foundational assumptions in museology. Critical museology may also extend beyond the traditional [[museum]] to include [[Cultural center|cultural centres]], [[Historic site|heritage sites]], [[memorial]]s, [[Art museum|art galleries]], and so on.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics|last=Bennett|first=Tony|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity|last=Canclini|first=Nestor Garcia|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the field ===
Given that museums are historically linked to [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and European [[missionary]] work, they have a morally and politically problematic past. While some of the objects museums hold were purchased â though not always fairly and often to the exclusive benefit of the collector â a large proportion of museum collections were taken as spoils of war, or otherwise removed without the consent of the people or community that owned them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=Steven|date=1991|title=Resonance and Wonder|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures: Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|volume=|pages=44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums, along with their collections â and collectors â played a key role in establishing and reiterating the dominance of colonial Europe and narratives of cultural superiority. Critical museology was developed through questioning the foundational assumptions of museum studies and museums, including their history, architecture, display, programming, and the provenance of their objects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Carol|date=|title=Art Museums and the Ritual of Citizenship|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures. Smithsonian Institution|volume=|pages=88â103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also analyzed exhibition design to show how the diverse media combined in exhibitions communicate and shape visitors' interpretations and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne A.|title=The Ones That Are Wanted: Communication and the Politics of Representation in a Photographic Exhibition|date=2002|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne|title=Rhetorics of Value: Constituting Worth and Meaning through Cultural Display|journal=Visual Anthropology|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=21â48}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[anthropologist]]s and the field of [[anthropology]] were actively engaged in problematic collecting practices for two centuries, anthropologists have also been central to the emergence of critical museology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorente|first=J.

=== Decolonizing and indigenizing museums ===
In North America, Australia, and New Zealand in particular, critical museology attempts to address the problematic colonial pasts of museums through the decolonization and Indigenization of museums.

Once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, decolonizing is now recognized â particularly in Canada â as a long-term process that involves dismantling the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological legacies of colonial power &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huygens|first=Ingrid|date=2011|title=Developing a Decolonisation Practice for Settler Colonisers: A Case Study from Aotearoa New Zealand|url=|journal=Settler Colonial Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=53â81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Honouring_the_Truth_Reconciling_for_the_Future_July_23_2015.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Final Report â Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no agreed upon end-goal of decolonization, the process of decolonizing the museum is aimed at âassist[ing] communities in their efforts to address the legacies of historical unresolved grief by speaking the hard truths of colonialism and thereby creating spaces for healing and understandingâ.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Collaboration, consultation, and [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriation]] are key components of decolonizing museums. Australian museums have been leaders in developing repatriation processes, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities, beginning in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Des|last2=Paroissien, eds.|first2=Leon|title=Understanding Museums:  Australian museums and museology|url=http://nma.gov.au/research/understanding-museums/_lib/pdf/Understanding-Museums_Indigenous_people_and_museums.pdf|website=National Museum Australia|publisher=National Museum Australia|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects involving collaboration and consultation with source communities have taken many forms, ranging from developing traveling exhibits, revising collection catalogues, to establishing community cultural centers and working with photographic collections together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luo Visual History Project|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/Luo/luo/page/home/|website=Pitt Rivers Museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverman, ed.|first1=Raymond|title=Museum as Process: Translating Local and Global Knowledges|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, collaboration and consultation were first formally suggested by the 1994 Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, and are now seen by many museums as being an essential practice for any institution that holds collections belonging to [[Indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|title=Task Force Report on Museums and First People|last=Assembly of First Nations &amp; Canadian Museums Association|first=|date=1994|website=museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, and around the world, some of the objects in those collections â particularly sacred objects or human remains â have been [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] or returned to their communities of origin. [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)]] formalized the process of [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriating]] Indigenous cultural objects in the United States. While Canada does not have a formal policy around repatriation, many museums have their own internal policies and many objects have been returned to Indigenous communities that way. Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success.

A newer concept, the I[[Indigenization|ndigenization]] of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s 2016 appointing of [[Wanda Nanibush]] as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2016/07/22/wanda-nanibush-named-agos-first-curator-of-indigenous-art.html|title=Wanda Nanibush Named AGOâs First Curator of Indigenous Art|last=Whyte|first=Murray|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood Land Schoolâs takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2b2fa6_8f2b4b9eece24189920c7ab3031744f0.pdf|title=Inside a Year-Long Experiment in Indigenous Institutional Critique.|last=Hampton|first=John|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=An Indigenous curator for Indigenous artefacts: South Australia breaks new ground|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/sep/03/an-indigenous-curator-for-indigenous-artefacts-south-australia-breaks-new-ground|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djon Mundine|url=https://www.boomerangfestival.com.au/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=113|website=Boomerang Festival|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laura McBride|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/staff/laura-mcbride|website=Australian Museum|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWO FIRST NATIONS CURATORS FROM MCA AUSTRALIA CHOSEN FOR VENICE BIENNALE|url=https://www.mca.com.au/press/2017/05/04/two-first-nations-curators-mca-australia-chosen-venice-biennale/|website=Museum of Contemporary Art Australia|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the [[Musqueam Indian Band]], the [[Sto:lo Nation|Sto:lo Nation Tribal Council]], the Uâmista Cultural Centre, and the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrncommunity.org/pages/about|title=Reciprocal Research Network|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the [[Indians of Canada Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]]â; The [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation|Lubicon Cree]]âs boycott of [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games#Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.2C AB|The Spirit Sings]], a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] sponsored exhibition at the [[Glenbow Museum]] [[Glenbow Museum|i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n 1[[Glenbow Museum|9]]8[[Glenbow Museum|8]], and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]]â[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|s]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|2]]0[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|1]]5 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|date=2012|title="No History of Colonialism": Decolonizing Practices in Indigenous Arts|url=|journal=Decolonize Me|publisher=ABC Art Books Canada.|volume=|pages=19â27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museology (Lecture)|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=International Field School in Critical Museology Lecture, Concordia University.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsford|first=Stephen|last2=MacDonald|first2=George|date=1995|title=Canadian Museums and the Representation of Culture in a Multicultural Nation|url=|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=15â36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== New methodologies ==

=== Museum interventions ===
Interventions in museums were [[Art intervention|first employed by artists]] like [[Marcel Duchamp]], who were looking to challenge both established elite art traditions and the expectations of museum visitors. By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups â including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves â as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.

==== Artist interventions ====
A central aspect of [[Institutional Critique]], some artistâs interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves â like [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]âs Mining the Museum (1992) at the [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas|Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas]]â Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBCâs [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]], or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists' Interventions|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/artists|website=Pitt Rivers museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; â while others have been done without explicit permission, like [[Andrea Fraser]]âs Museum Highlights (1989) at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Fred|last2=Halle|first2=Howard|date=1993|title=Mining the Museum|jstor=25007622|journal=Grand Street|issue=44|pages=151â172|doi=10.2307/25007622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmoreart.com/2017/05/how-mining-the-museum-changed-the-art-world.html|title=How Mining the Museum Changed the Art World â BmoreArt  {{!}}  Baltimore Contemporary Art|website=www.bmoreart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fred Wilson: Objects and Installations 1979-2000.|last=Berger|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland: Center for Art and Visual Culture.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levell|first=N.|date=2013|title=Site-Specificity and Dislocation: Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas and His Haida Manga Meddling|url=|journal=Journal of Material Culture|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=93â116.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/kbunn/Manga.pdf|title=Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas: Meddling in the Museum.|last=UBC MOA|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Andrea Fraser â Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fraser-museum-highlights-a-gallery-talk-t13715|journal=Tate: Art &amp; Artists.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/30/fraser-art-institutional/|title=Spotlight: Andrea Fraser {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known artist interventions in a museum is [[James Luna]]âs ''Artifact Piece'', which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at ''The Decade Show'' in New York in 1990. Luna, a [[LuiseÃ±o]] artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/james-luna-30545878/|title=James Luna. Smithsonian Magazine.|last=K. R.|first=Fletcher|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists â Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a and Coco Fusco â developed a traveling performance art piece called [[Couple in The Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West|The ''Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West'']] that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including [[Covent Gardens]], the [[Walker Art Center]], the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[Australian Museum|Australia Museum]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannheim|first=Bruce|last2=Behar|first2=Ruth|date=1995|title=In Dialogue: The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odessy|url=|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=118â127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activist interventions ====
While there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements â through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections â to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guerrillagirls.com|title=Guerrilla Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] cancelled [[Corcoran Gallery of Art#Mapplethorpe scandal|''The Perfect Moment'']], an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpeâs explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpeâs photos on the exterior of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html|title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|date=1989-07-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protests occurred when [[David Wojnarowicz]]âs film [[David Wojnarowicz#.22A Fire in My Belly.22 controversy|''A Fire in My Belly'']] was removed from the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)#Hide.2FSeek controversy|''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'']] exhibit at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/09/AR2010120905895.html|title='Fire' man: Wojnarowicz, censored by Smithsonian, sounded an alarm in dire times|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Museum hack ====
Museum interventions have also become increasingly popular through companies such as Museum Hack, which offers unconventional tours of large museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] or the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. These tours depart from traditional methods of museum interpretation by using humor and technology to appeal to younger generations or non-typical museum audiences. Museum Hack functions with permission from the institutions in which they work, rather than providing unsolicited tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museumhack.com/|title=Museum Hack - Team Building Activities &amp; Museum Tours|website=Museum Hack|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal institutional interventions ====

While most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called ''Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 â Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/804-messing-with-moma-critical-interventions-at-the-museum-of-modern-art-1939-now|title=Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, 1939âNow|last=Tobias|first=Jennifer|date=May 26, 2016|website=post.at.moma.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/messingwithmoma/|title=Moma.org {{!}} Interactives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Messing With MoMA|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geismar|first1=Haidy|title=he Art of Anthropology: Questioning Contemporary Art in Ethnographic Display|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=2|issue=10|pages=183â210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curatorial dreaming ===
Curatorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions. It is intended as âan alternative mode of critical, intellectual practice â a form of âtheorizing in the concreteââ.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Curating workshops, courses and labs ===
{{external links|section|date=January 2018}}
Over the last three decades there has been a proliferation of curating workshops, courses, and labs that engage with New Museology and critical museology in museum spaces, in universities, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Radar|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2014/08/22/14-curatorial-training-programmes-in-north-america/|website=14 Curatorial Training Programmes|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/ Bard Center for Curatorial Studies] in New York was founded in 1990 and began offering a graduate program in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CSS|url=http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/|website=CSS Bard|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the [http://www.carmah.berlin/ Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage] is engaging with the social, cultural, and political issues facing contemporary museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmah.berlin/our-centre/|title=CARMAH â Our Centre|website=www.carmah.berlin|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, two of the most innovative curating labs are the [http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/ Making Culture Lab] at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Vancouver and the [http://capsl.cerev.ca/ Curating and Public Scholarship Lab] at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, which offered its inaugural [https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html International Field School in Critical Museology] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/|title=Making Culture Lab|website=hennessy.iat.sfu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capsl.cerev.ca/|title=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|website=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html|title=Curatorial Dreams|website=www.concordia.ca|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies] in Cape Town includes a curatorial module within a comprehensive diploma and M.A. program that engages critically with museum and heritage studies, the leading program on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies|url=https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx|website=UWC APMHS|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Research, Innovation, and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics''' ('''RIDC NeuroMat''', or simply '''NeuroMat''') is a Brazilian research center established in 2013 at the [[University of SÃ£o Paulo]] that is dedicated to integrating [[mathematical modeling]] and [[theoretical neuroscience]]. Among the core missions of NeuroMat are the creation of a new mathematical system to understanding neural data and the development of neuroscientific open-source computational tools, keeping an active role under the context of open knowledge, open science and scientific dissemination. The research center is headed by Prof. [[Antonio Galves]], from USP's Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, and is funded by the [[SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation]] (FAPESP). Other names related to NeuroMat are the co-principal investigators [[Pablo Ferrari]] and [[Yoshiharu Kohayakawa]]; [[BÃ©la BollobÃ¡s]], [[Michael Merzenich]] and [[Wojciech Szpankowski]] as members of the International Advisory Board and also [[Ernst W. Hamburger]], the former director of scientific dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bv.fapesp.br/pt/auxilios/58573/centro-de-pesquisa-inovacao-e-difusao-em-neuromatematica-neuromat/|title=Centro de Pesquisa, InovaÃ§Ã£o e DifusÃ£o em NeuromatemÃ¡tica - NeuroMat|last=|first=|date=|website=Biblioteca Virtual da FAPESP|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
NeuroMat has been involved in the development of what has been called the [[Galves-LÃ¶cherbach model]], a model with intrinsic stochasticity for biological neural nets, in which the probability of a future spike depends on the evolution of the complete system since the last spike.[1] This model of spiking neurons was developed by mathematicians Antonio Galves and Eva LÃ¶cherbach. In the first article on the model, in 2013, they called it a model of a "system with interacting stochastic chains with memory of variable length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14858">'''Nitrogen assimilation''' is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like [[amino acid]]s from  inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment. Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot [[nitrogen fixation|fix]] nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) depend on the ability to assimilate [[nitrate]] or [[ammonia]] for their needs. Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food.

==Nitrogen assimilation in plants==
Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;) and ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). In aerobic soils where [[nitrification]] can occur, nitrate is usually the predominant form of available nitrogen that is absorbed.&lt;ref name=Xu2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = G. | last2 = Fan | first2 = X. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.

===pH and Ionic balance during nitrogen assimilation===
[[File:Nitrate ion balance-variants.svg| thumb|upright=0.9 |Different plants use different pathways to different levels. Tomatoes take in a lot of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and accumulate salts in their vacuoles, castor reduces nitrate in the roots to a large extent and excretes the resulting alkali. Soy bean plants moves a large amount of malate to the roots where they convert it to alkali while the potassium is recirculated.]]
Every nitrate ion reduced to ammonia produces one OH&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; ion. To maintain a pH balance, the plant must either excrete it into the surrounding medium or neutralize it with organic acids. This results in the medium around the plants roots becoming alkaline when they take up nitrate.

To maintain ionic balance, every NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; taken into the root must be accompanied by either the uptake of a cation or the excretion of an anion. Plants like tomatoes take up metal ions like K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to exactly match every nitrate taken up and store these as the salts of organic acids like [[malate]] and [[oxalate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Plants that reduce nitrates in the shoots and excrete alkali from their roots need to transport the alkali in an inert form from the shoots to the roots. To achieve this they synthesize malic acid in the leaves from neutral precursors like carbohydrates. The potassium ions brought to the leaves along with the nitrate in the xylem are then sent along with the malate to the roots via the phloem. In the roots, the malate is consumed. When malate is converted back to malic acid prior to use, an OH&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; is released and excreted. (RCOO&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O -&gt; RCOOH +OH&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;) The potassium ions are then recirculated up the xylem with fresh nitrate. Thus the plants avoid having to absorb and store excess salts and also transport the OH&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1104/pp.99.3.1118| issn = 0032-0889| volume = 99| issue = 3| pages = 1118â1123| last = Touraine| first = Bruno|author2=Bertrand Muller |author3=Claude Grignon | title = Effect of Phloem-Translocated Malate on NO3â Uptake by Roots of Intact Soybean Plants| journal = Plant Physiology| accessdate = 2013-02-19| date = 1992-07-01| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/99/3/1118| pmc = 1080591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants like castor reduce a lot of nitrate in the root itself, and excrete the resulting base. Some of the base produced in the shoots is transported to the roots as salts of organic acids while a small amount of the carboxylates are just stored in the shoot itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/jxb/38.4.580| issn = 0022-0957| volume = 38| issue = 4| pages = 580â596| last = Allen| first = Susan|author2=J.

The term '''Norman architecture''' is used to categorise styles of [[Romanesque architecture]] developed by the [[Normans]] in the various lands under their dominion or influence in the 11th and 12th centuries. In particular the term is traditionally used for English Romanesque architecture.  The Normans introduced large numbers of [[castle]]s and [[fortification]]s  including Norman [[keep]]s, and at the same time [[monastery|monasteries]], [[abbey]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[cathedral]]s, in a style characterised by the usual Romanesque rounded [[arch]]es (particularly over windows and doorways) and especially massive proportions compared to other regional variations of the style.

==Origins==
These [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] styles originated in [[Normandy]] and became widespread in north western [[Europe]], particularly in [[England]], which contributed considerable development and has the largest number of surviving examples. At about the same time [[Hauteville family|a Norman dynasty]] ruled in [[Sicily]], producing a distinctive variation incorporating [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Saracen]] influences which is also known as Norman architecture, or alternatively as Sicilian Romanesque. Ancient Rome's invention of the arch is the basis of all Norman architecture.

The term may have originated with eighteenth-century [[antiquarian]]s, but its usage in a sequence of styles has been attributed to [[Thomas Rickman]] in his 1817 work ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' which used the labels "Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular". The more inclusive term ''romanesque'' was used of the [[Romance languages]] in English by 1715,&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "Romanesque": in French a letter of 1818 by [[Charles-Alexis-Adrien DuhÃ©rissier de Gerville]] seems to be the first&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries from 1819.&lt;ref&gt;OED same entry; in French by Gerville's friend [[Arcisse de Caumont]] in his ''Essaie sur l'architecture du moyen Ã¢ge, particuliÃ¨rement en Normandie,'' 1824.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[Edward the Confessor]] built [[Westminster Abbey]] in Romanesque style (now all replaced by later rebuildings) just before the Conquest, which is still believed to be the earliest major Romanesque building in England, no significant remaining Romanesque architecture in Britain can clearly be shown to predate the Conquest, although historians believe that many surviving "Norman" elements in buildings, nearly all churches, may well in fact be Anglo-Saxon.

==Norman arch==

The Norman arch is a defining point of Norman architecture. Grand [[arch]]ways are designed to evoke feelings of [[awe]] and are very commonly seen as the entrance to large [[religious]] buildings such as [[cathedral]]s.

==Normandy==
[[Viking]] invaders arrived at the mouth of the [[river Seine]] in 911, at a time when [[Franks]] were fighting on horseback and Frankish lords were building castles. Over the next century the population of the territory ceded to the Vikings, now called [[Normans]], adopted these customs as well as Christianity and the ''[[langue d'oÃ¯l]]''. Norman barons built timber castles on earthen mounds, beginning the development of [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, and great stone churches in the Romanesque style of the Franks. By 950, they were building stone [[keep]]s. The Normans were among the most travelled peoples of Europe, exposing them to a wide variety of cultural influences which became incorporated in their art and architecture.  They elaborated on the early Christian basilica plan. Originally longitudinal with side aisles and an apse they began to add in towers, as at the Church of Saint-Ãtienne]] at Caen, in 1067. This would eventually form a model for the larger English [[cathedral]]s some 20 years later.

==England==

[[File:Norman arch.jpg|thumb |A Norman arch with zig-zag mouldings above the church doorway at [[Guiting Power]], [[Gloucestershire]]]]
In [[England]], Norman nobles and bishops had influence before the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, and Norman influences affected late [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]]. [[Edward the Confessor]] was brought up in Normandy and in 1042 brought masons to work on the first Romanesque building in England, [[Westminster Abbey]]. In 1051 he brought in Norman [[knight]]s who built "motte" castles as a defence against the [[Wales|Welsh]]. Following the invasion, Normans rapidly constructed [[motte-and-bailey]] castles along with  [[Church (building)|churches]], [[abbey]]s, and more elaborate [[fortification]]s such as Norman stone [[keep]]s.

The buildings show massive proportions in simple geometries using small bands of [[sculpture]]. Paying attention to the concentrated spaces of [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s and round doorways as well as the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] under an arch. The "Norman arch" is the rounded, often with mouldings carved or incised onto it for decoration. [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron patterns]], frequently termed "zig-zag [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]]", were a frequent signature of the Normans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Edward |title=ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROMANESQUE AND GOTHIC |journal=The Archaeological Review |date=December 1888 |volume=2 |issue=4 |page=237-251 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/44245200 |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]]es often had deep [[chancel]]s and a square [[crossing tower]] which has remained a feature of English [[ecclesiastical architecture]]. Hundreds of [[parish]] churches were built and the great English [[cathedral]]s were founded from 1083.

After a fire damaged [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1174 Norman masons introduced the new [[Gothic architecture]]. Around 1191 [[Wells Cathedral]] and [[Lincoln Cathedral]] brought in the English Gothic style, and Norman became increasingly a modest style of provincial building.

==Scotland==
[[Scotland]] also came under early Norman influence with Norman nobles at the court of King [[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]] around 1050. His successor [[Malcolm III of Scotland|MÃ¡el Coluim III]] overthrew him with English and Norman assistance, and his queen, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], encouraged the church. The [[Benedictine]] order founded a monastery at [[Dunfermline]]. Her sixth and youngest son, who became [[David I of Scotland|King David]], built [[St. Margaret's Chapel]] at the start of the 12th century.

==Ireland==
The Normans first landed in Ireland in 1169. Within five years earthwork castles were springing up, and in a further five, work was beginning on some of the earliest of the great stone castles. For example, [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]] built a [[Motte-and-bailey]] castle on the site of the present day [[Trim Castle]], [[County Meath]], which was attacked and burned in 1173 by the Irish king [[RuaidrÃ­ Ua Conchobair]]. De Lacy, however, then constructed a stone castle in its place, which enclosed over three acres within its walls, and this could not be burned down by the Irish. The years between 1177 and 1310 saw the construction of some of the greatest of the Norman castles in Ireland. The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and among other buildings they constructed were [[Swords Castle]] in [[Fingal]] (North County Dublin), [[Dublin Castle]] and [[Carrickfergus Castle]] in [[County Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Castles in Ireland Feudal Power in a Gaelic World. by Tom McNeill. (London, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-415-22853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

===Mezzogiorno===
The Normans began constructing castles, their trademark architectural piece, in Italy from an early date. [[William Iron Arm]] built one at an unidentified location (Stridula) in [[Calabria]] in 1045. After the death of [[Robert Guiscard]] in 1085, the [[Mezzogiorno]] (peninsular southern Italy) experienced a series of civil wars and fell under the control of increasingly weaker princes. Revolts characterised the region until well into the twelfth century and minor lords sought to resist ducal or royal power from within their own castles. In the [[Molise]], the Normans embarked on their most extensive castle-building programme and introduced the ''[[opus gallicum]]'' technique to Italy. Their clever use of the local stone artisans, together with the vast riches amassed from their enslaved population, made such tremendous feats possible. Some as majestic as those of the ancient Roman structures they tried to emulate.

Besides the [[encastellation]] of the countryside, the Normans erected several religious buildings which still survive. They edified the shrine at [[Monte Sant'Angelo]] and built a [[mausoleum]] to the [[Hauteville family]] at [[Venosa]]. They also built many new Latin monasteries, including the famous foundation of {{ill|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|lt=Sant'Eufemia|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlante.beniculturalicalabria.it/schede.php?id=178 |title=Abbazia Benedettina di Santâ Eufemia |accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of great importance are the portal of the [[Shrine of Mary Queen of Anglona]] and the ambulatory and radiating chapels of the [[Aversa Cathedral]]. In [[Salerno]], however, remember Fruscione Palace.

Here is a list of Norman architecture in the Mezzogiorno : 
* Castle of Circello. 
* Castle Monforte (Campobasso).

===Sicily===

[[File:Cefalucathedralnight.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Cefalu]]]]
[[Sicily]]'s Norman period lasted from circa 1070 until about 1200.  The architecture was decorated in [[gilding|gild]]ed mosaics such as that at the cathedral at [[Monreale]].  The Palatine Chapel in [[Palermo]] built in 1130 is perhaps the strongest example of this. The interior of the [[dome]], (itself a Byzantine feature), is decorated in a [[mosaic]] depicting Christ Pantocrator accompanied by his [[angel]]s.

During Sicily's later Norman era early Gothic influences can be detected such as those in the [[Messina Cathedral|cathedral]] at Messina consecrated in 1197.  However, here the high Gothic [[campanile]] is of a later date and should not be confused with the early Gothic built during the Norman period; which featured pointed arches and windows rather than the [[flying buttress]]es and [[pinnacle]]s later to manifest themselves in the Gothic era.

===Malta===
After its Norman conquest in 1091, Malta saw the construction of several Norman pieces of architecture. Many have been demolished and rebuilt over the years (especially after the [[1693 Sicily earthquake]] which destroyed many old Norman buildings), however some fortresses and houses still exist in [[Mdina]] and [[Vittoriosa]].

==Transitional style==
As [[stone mason|master mason]]s developed the style and experimented with ways of overcoming the geometric difficulties of [[groin vault]]ed ceilings, they introduced features such as the pointed arch that were later characterised as being [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. Architectural historians and scholars consider that a style must be assessed as an integral whole rather than an aggregate of features, and while some include these developments within the Norman or Romanesque styles, others describe them as transitional or "NormanâGothic Transitional". A few websites use the term "Norman Gothic", but it is unclear whether they refer to the transitional style or to the Norman style as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Gothic-architecture.htm |title=Gothic Architecture in England |publisher=Britainexpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racine.ra.it/ungaretti/gothic/norman_gothic.htm |title=Norman Gothic |publisher=Racine.ra.it |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Norman==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Neo-Norman architecture is a type of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]] based on Norman Romanesque architecture. There is sometimes confusion, especially in North America, between this style and revivalist versions of vernacular or later [[architecture of Normandy]], such as the "Norman farmhouse style" popular for larger houses.

Romanesque Revival versions focus on the arch and capitals, and decorated doorways.  There are two examples in Manchester: the former Stock Exchange building and a synagogue in [[Fallowfield]].

'''Offshore construction''' is the installation of structures and facilities in a marine environment, usually for the production and transmission of electricity, oil, gas and other resources. It is also called '''maritime engineering'''. 

Construction and pre-commissioning is typically performed as much as possible onshore. To optimize the costs and risks of installing large offshore platforms, different construction strategies have been developed.

One strategy is to fully construct the offshore facility onshore, and tow the installation to site floating on its own buoyancy. Bottom founded structure are lowered to the seabed by de-ballasting (see for instance [[Condeep]] or [[Cranefree]]), whilst [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading|floating structures]] are held in position with substantial [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] systems.

The size of offshore lifts can be reduced by making the construction modular, with each module being constructed [[:wikt:onshore|onshore]] and then lifted using a [[crane vessel]] into place onto the platform. A number of very large crane vessels were built in the 1970s which allow very large single modules weighing up to 14,000 tonnes to be fabricated and then lifted into place.

Specialist floating hotel vessels known as [[flotel]]s are used to accommodate workers during the construction and hook-up phases. This is a high cost activity due to the limited space and access to materials.

[[Oil platform]]s are key fixed installations from which drilling and production activity is carried out. [[Drilling rig]]s are either floating vessels for deeper water or [[jack-up]] designs which are a barge with liftable legs.&lt;ref name="P D Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bevan, John|title=The Professional Divers's Handbook|edition=second|year=2005|publisher=Submex Ltd|location=5 Nepean Close, Alverstoke, GOSPORT, Hampshire PO12 2BH |language=English|isbn= 978-0950824260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these types of vessel are constructed in marine yards but are often involved during the construction phase to pre-drill some production wells. 
Other key factors in offshore construction are the [[weather window]] which defines periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place. [[Safety]] is another key construction parameter, the main hazard obviously being a fall into the sea from which speedy recovery in cold waters is essential.

The main types of vessels used for pipe laying are the "[[Derrick Barge]] (DB)", the "[[Pipelay Barge]] (LB)" and the "Derrick/Lay barge (DLB)" combination. Diving bells in offshore construction are mainly used in water depths greater than {{convert|120|ft|-1}}, less than that, the divers use a metal basket driven from an "A" frame from the deck. The basket is lowered to the water level, then the divers enter the water from it to a maximum of {{convert|120|ft|-1}}. Bells can go to {{convert|1500|ft}}, but are normally used at {{convert|400|to|800|ft}}.

[[File:codex ephremi.jpg|thumb|350px|The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a Greek manuscript of the Bible from the 5th century, is a palimpsest.]]

In [[textual studies]], a '''palimpsest''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|p|Ã¦|l|Éª|m|p|s|É|s|t}}) is a [[manuscript]] page, either from a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or a [[book]], from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parchment#History|Pergamene]] (now known as [[parchment]]) was made of lamb, calf, or goat kid skin (best made in ancient [[Pergamon]]) and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term ''palimpsest'' is also used in [[architecture]], [[archaeology]], and [[geomorphology]] to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a [[monumental brass]] the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.

== Etymology ==

The word "palimpsest" derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:palimpsestus#Latin|palimpsestus]]'', which derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:en:ÏÎ±Î»Î¯Î¼ÏÎ·ÏÏÎ¿Ï#Ancient Greek|ÏÎ±Î»Î¯Î¼ÏÎ·ÏÏÎ¿Ï]] (''palÃ­mpsÄstos'', "again scraped"), a compound word that literally means "scraped clean and ready to be used again". The Ancient Greeks used wax-coated tablets, like scratch-pads, to write on with a stylus, and to erase the writing by smoothing the wax surface and writing again. This practice was adopted by [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], who wrote (literally scratched on letters) on [[Wax tablet|wax-coated tablets]], which were reuseable; [[Cicero]]'s use of the term "palimpsest" confirms such a practice.

== Development ==
[[File:Georgian paliphsest V-VI cc.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Georgian language|Georgian]] palimpsest from the 5th or 6th century]]

Because [[parchment]] prepared from animal hides is far more durable than [[paper]] or [[papyrus]], most palimpsests known to modern scholars are parchment, which rose in popularity in [[Western Europe]] after the 6th century. Where papyrus was in common use, reuse of writing media was less common because papyrus was cheaper and more expendable than costly parchment. Some papyrus palimpsests do survive, and Romans referred to this custom of washing papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Suetonius]], [[Augustus]], "though he began a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the style, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, What is your Ajax doing? He answered, My Ajax met with a sponge." (''Augustus'', 85). Cf. a letter of the future emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to his friend and teacher [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] (''ad M. Caesarem'', 4.5), in which the former, dissatisfied with a piece of his own writing, facetiously exclaims that he will "consecrate it to water (''lymphis'') or fire (''Volcano'')," i.e. that he will rub out or burn what he has written.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing was washed from parchment or [[vellum]] using milk and [[oat bran]]. With the passing of time, the faint remains of the former writing would reappear enough so that scholars can discern the text (called the ''scriptio inferior'', the "underwriting") and decipher it. In the later [[Middle Ages]] the surface of the vellum was usually scraped away with powdered [[pumice]], irretrievably losing the writing, hence the most valuable palimpsests are those that were overwritten in the early Middle Ages.

Medieval [[codex|codices]] are constructed in "gathers" which are folded (compare "[[wikt:folio|folio]]", "leaf, page" [[ablative case]] of [[Latin]] folium), then stacked together like a newspaper and sewn together at the fold. Prepared parchment sheets retained their original central fold, so each was ordinarily cut in half, making a [[quarto]] volume of the original folio, with the overwritten text running perpendicular to the effaced text.

== Modern decipherment ==
Faint legible remains were read by eye before 20th-century techniques helped make lost texts readable. To read palimpsests, scholars of the 19th century used chemical means that were sometimes very destructive, using [[tincture]] of [[gall]] or, later, [[ammonium bisulfate]]. Modern methods of reading palimpsests using [[ultraviolet]] light and photography are less damaging.

Innovative [[Digitization|digitized images]] aid scholars in deciphering unreadable palimpsests. Superexposed photographs exposed in various light spectra, a technique called "multispectral filming", can increase the contrast of faded ink on parchment that is too indistinct to be read by eye in normal light. For example, [[multispectral imaging]] undertaken by researchers at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] recovered much of the undertext (estimated to be more than 80%) from the ''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''. At the [[Walters Art Museum]] where the palimpsest is now conserved, the project has focused on experimental techniques to retrieve the remaining text, some of which was obscured by overpainted icons. One of the most successful techniques for reading through the paint proved to be [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] imaging, through which the iron in the ink is revealed. A team of imaging scientists and scholars from the United States and Europe is currently using spectral imaging techniques developed for imaging the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' to study more than one hundred palimpsests in the library of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="imaging"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-the-sinai-a-global-team-is-revolutionizing-the-preservation-of-ancient-manuscripts/2012/08/30/1c203ef4-ca1f-11e1-aea8-34e2e47d1571_story.html|title=In the Sinai, a global team is revolutionizing the preservation of ancient manuscripts|publisher=Washington POST Magazine|date= September 8, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==

A number of ancient works have survived only as palimpsests.&lt;ref&gt;The most accessible overviews of the transmission of texts through the cultural bottleneck are Leighton D. Reynolds (editor), in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'', where the texts that survived, fortuitously, ''only'' in palimpsest may be enumerated, and in his general introduction to textual transmission, ''Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature'' (with N.G. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt; Vellum manuscripts were over-written on purpose mostly due to the dearth or cost of the material. In the case of Greek manuscripts, the consumption of old [[codex|codices]] for the sake of the material was so great that a synodal decree of the year 691 forbade the destruction of manuscripts of the [[Scriptures]] or the [[church father]]s, except for imperfect or injured volumes. Such a decree put added pressure on retrieving the vellum on which secular manuscripts were written. The decline of the vellum trade with the introduction of paper exacerbated the scarcity, increasing pressure to reuse material.

Cultural considerations also motivated the creation of palimpsests. The demand for new texts might outstrip the availability of parchment in some centers, yet the existence of cleaned parchment that was never overwritten suggests that there was also a spiritual motivation, to sanctify pagan text by overlaying it with the word of God, somewhat as pagan sites were overlaid with Christian churches to hallow pagan ground. Or the pagan texts may have merely appeared irrelevant.

Texts most susceptible to being overwritten included obsolete legal and liturgical ones, sometimes of intense interest to the historian. Early Latin translations of Scripture were rendered obsolete by Jerome's [[Vulgate]]. Texts might be in foreign languages or written in unfamiliar scripts that had become illegible over time. The codices themselves might be already damaged or incomplete. [[Christian heresy|Heretical]] texts were dangerous to harborâthere were compelling political and religious reasons to destroy texts viewed as heresy, and to reuse the media was less wasteful than simply to burn the books.

Vast destruction of the broad [[quarto]]s of the early centuries took place in the period which followed the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], but palimpsests were also created as new texts were required during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The most valuable [[Latin]] palimpsests are found in the codices which were remade from the early large folios in the 7th to the 9th centuries. It has been noticed that no entire work is generally found in any instance in the original text of a palimpsest, but that portions of many works have been taken to make up a single volume. An exception is the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' (see below). On the whole, early medieval scribes were thus not indiscriminate in supplying themselves with material from any old volumes that happened to be at hand.

* The best-known palimpsest in the legal world was discovered in 1816 by Niebuhr and Savigny in the [[Chapter Library of Verona|library of Verona cathedral]]. Underneath letters by St. Jerome and Gennadius was the almost complete text of the [[Gaius (jurist)|Institutes of Gaius]], probably the first student's textbook on Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;The Institutes of Gaius, ed W.M.

* The [[Sana'a palimpsest]] is one of the oldest Qur'anic manuscripts in existence. Carbon dating indicates that the undertext (the scriptio inferior) was written probably within 15 years before the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. The undertext differs from the standard Qur'anic text and is therefore the most important documentary evidence for the existence of variant Qur'anic readings.&lt;ref name=Sadeghi2&gt;{{cite journal |last = Sadeghi |first = Behnam |author2=Goudarzi, Mohsen | title = á¹¢an'Ä' 1 and the Origins of the Qur'Än |journal = Der Islam |date = March 2012 |url = http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fislm.2010.87.issue-1-2$002fislam-2011-0025$002fislam-2011-0025.xml;jsessionid=82FA69F0EB77BCCC0BC1E1A6AC19B933 |accessdate = 2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palynology''' is the "study of dust" (from {{lang-grc-gre|ÏÎ±Î»ÏÎ½Ï|palunÅ}}, "strew, sprinkle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpalu%2Fnw ÏÎ±Î»ÏÎ½Ï], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[-logy]]'') or "particles that are strewn". A classic palynologist analyses [[particulate]] samples collected from the air, from water, or from deposits including sediments of any age. The condition and identification of those particles, organic and inorganic, give the palynologist clues to the life, environment, and energetic conditions that produced them.

The term is sometimes narrowly used to refer to a subset of the discipline, which is defined as "the study of microscopic objects of macromolecular organic composition (i.e., compounds of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen), not capable of dissolution in hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.A.S.

Palynology does not include [[diatoms]], [[foraminiferans]] or other organisms with [[siliceous]] or [[calcareous]] [[exoskeletons]].

Palynology is an interdisciplinary science and is a branch of [[earth science]] ([[geology]] or geological science) and [[biological science]] ([[biology]]), particularly [[plant science]] ([[botany]]). [[stratigraphy|Stratigraphical]] palynology is a branch of [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontology]] and [[paleobotany]], which studies [[fossil]] palynomorphs from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Holocene]].

===Early history===
The earliest reported observations of pollen under a microscope are likely to have been in the 1640s by the English [[botanist]] [[Nehemiah Grew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bradbury| first=S.| date=1967| title=The Evolution of the Microscope| publisher=Pergamon Press| place=New York| pages=375 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described pollen and the stamen, and concluded that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.

By the late 1870s, as optical microscopes improved and the principles of [[stratigraphy]] were worked out, [[Robert Kidston]] and [[P. Reinsch]] were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jansonius| first=J.| author2=D.C.

=== 1890s to 1940s===
Quantitative analysis of pollen began with [[Lennart von Post]]'s published work.&lt;ref&gt;Traverse, Alfred and Sullivan, Herbert J. "The Background, Origin, and Early History of the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists" Palynology 7: 7-18 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Although he published in the Swedish language, his methodology gained a wide audience through his lectures. In particular, his [[Kristiania]] lecture of 1916 was important in gaining a wider audience.&lt;ref name="FIPol"&gt;{{cite book| last=FÃ¦gri| first=Knut| authorlink=Knut FÃ¦gri| author2=Johs.

Gunnar E. Erdtman| journal=Pollen et Spores| date=1973| volume=15| pages=5â12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation ended with the German publication of [[Gunnar Erdtman]]'s 1921 thesis. The methodology of pollen analysis became widespread throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] and revolutionized [[Quaternary]] vegetation and climate change research.&lt;ref name="FIPol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Post, L (1918) "SkogstrÃ¤dpollen i sydsvenska torvmosslagerfÃ¶ljder", Forhandlinger ved de Skandinaviske naturforskeres 16. mÃ¸te i Kristiania 1916: p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier pollen researchers include FrÃ¼h (1885),&lt;ref&gt;FrÃ¼h, J (1885) "Kritische BeitrÃ¤ge zur Kenntnis des Torfes", Jahrb.k.k.Geol.Reichsanstalt 35&lt;/ref&gt; who enumerated many common tree pollen types, and a considerable number of [[spore]]s and [[herb]] pollen grains. There is a study of pollen samples taken from sediments of Swedish lakes by Trybom (1888);&lt;ref&gt;Trybom, F (1888) "Bottenprof fran svenska insjÃ¶ar", Geol.Foren.Forhandl.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] pollen was found in such profusion that he considered them to be serviceable as "[[index fossils]]". [[Georg F. L. Sarauw]] studied fossil pollen of middle Pleistocene age ([[Cromerian]]) from the harbour of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarauw | first=G. F. L. | date= 1897 | title = Cromer-skovlaget i Frihavnen og trÃ¦levningerne i de ravfÃ¸rende sandlag ved KÃ¸benhavn | language = Danish |trans-title= The Cromer Forest layer in the Free Harbour and Wood Remains in the Amber containing strata near Copenhagen | journal = Meddelelser fra Dansk Geologisk Forening / Bulletin of the Geological Society of Denmark | volume=1 | issue=4 | pages= 17â44 | url = http://2dgf.dk/xpdf/bull-1897-1-4-17-44.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagerheim (in Witte 1905) and C.&amp;nbsp;A.Weber (in H.&amp;nbsp;A. Weber 1918) appear to be among the first to undertake 'percentage frequency' calculations.

=== 1940s to 1989===

The term ''palynology'' was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish [[geologist]] [[Ernst Antevs]], in the pages of the ''[[Pollen Analysis Circular]]'' (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by [[Paul Sears]] in North America). Hyde and Williams chose ''palynology'' on the basis of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''paluno'' meaning 'to sprinkle' and ''pale'' meaning 'dust' (and thus similar to the [[Latin]] word ''pollen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hyde| first=H.A.| author2=D.A. Williams| url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| title=The Right Word| journal=Pollen Analysis Circular| volume=8| pages=6| date=1944| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618031355/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| archivedate=2007-06-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen analysis in North America stemmed from [[Phyllis Draper]], an MS student under Sears at the University of Oklahoma. During her time as a student, she developed the first pollen diagram from a sample that depicted the percentage of several species at different depths at Curtis Bog. This was the introduction of pollen analysis in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Draper|first=Phyllis|date=|title=A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE OF POLLEN ANALYSIS|url=http://ojs.library.okstate.edu/osu/index.php/OAS/article/viewFile/2553/2251|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; pollen diagrams today still often remain in the same format with depth on the y-axis and abundances of species on the x-axis.

=== 1990s to the 21st century ===
Pollen analysis advanced rapidly in this period due to advances in optics and computers. Much of the science was revised by [[Johannes Iversen]] and [[Knut FÃ¦gri]] in their textbook on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;FÃ¦gri, K. &amp; Iversen, J. (1989) ''Textbook of pollen analysis''. 4th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester. 328 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of studying palynomorphs ==

===Palynomorphs===
Palynomorphs are broadly defined as organic-walled [[microfossil]]s between 5 and 500 [[micrometre]]s in size.  They are extracted from [[sedimentary rock]]s and [[pollen core|sediment cores]] both physically, by ultrasonic treatment and [[sieve analysis|wet sieving]], and chemically, by chemical digestion to remove the non-organic fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as [[chitin]], [[pseudochitin]] and [[sporopollenin]]. Palynomorphs that have a taxonomy description are sometimes referred to as palynotaxa.

Palynomorphs form a [[geological]] record of importance in determining the type of [[prehistoric life]] that existed at the time the sedimentary formation was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing [[paleogeography|climatic conditions]] of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not [[fossiliferous]]. Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or recrystallized rocks.

Typically, palynomorphs are [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[acritarch]]s, [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[fungi]], [[scolecodonts]] (scleroprotein teeth, jaws and associated features of [[polychaeta|polychaete]] [[annelid]] worms), [[arthropod]] organs (such as [[insect]] mouthparts), [[chitinozoa]]ns and [[foram|microforam]]s. Palynomorph microscopic structures that are abundant in most sediments are resistant to routine pollen extraction including strong acids and bases, and acetolysis, or density separation.&lt;!--Check this sentence, before I copy/edit-ted it. It had GROSS errors.--&gt;

==Palynofacies==
A '''palynofacies''' is the complete assemblage of [[organic matter]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in a fossil deposit. The study of the palynofacies of a  [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of sediments can be used to learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]]. The term ''palynofacies'' was introduced by the French [[geologist]] [[AndrÃ© Combaz]] in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the palynology and organic [[geochemistry]] of [[sedimentary rock]]s.

Palynofacies can be used in two ways:
* [[Organic matter|Organic]] palynofacies considers all the acid insoluble [[particulate organic matter]] (POM), including [[kerogen]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using [[strew mount]]s on microscope slides that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or [[ultraviolet]] (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.
* Palynomorph palynofacies considers the abundance, composition and diversity of palynomorphs in a sieved palynological preparation of sediments or palynological preparation of [[sedimentary rock]]s. The ratio of [[ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] [[phytoplankton]] ([[acritarchs]] and [[dinoflagellate]] cysts), together with [[chitinozoa]]ns, to terrestrial palynomorphs ([[pollen]] and [[spores]]) can be used to derive a terrestrial input index in marine sediments.

Both types of palynofacies studies are used for [[geology|geological interpretation]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] basins in exploration geology, often in conjunction with palynological analysis and [[vitrinite]] reflectance.

===Chemical preparation===
Chemical digestion follows a number of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) to remove [[Humic acid|humic]] substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture.&lt;ref name="InMem" /&gt; The use of [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to digest [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly reducing the amount of time required to scan slides for palynomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge because of the presence of well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. [[Acetolysis]] was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last=Erdtman
| first= O.G.E.
| title=Uber die Verwendung von Essigsaureanhydrid bei Pollenuntersuchungen
| journal= Sven. Bot. Tidskr.
| volume=28
| pages=354â358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In acetolysis the specimen is treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and [[sulfuric acid]], dissolving [[cellulose|cellulistic]] materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.

Some steps of the chemical treatments require special care for safety reasons, in particular the use of HF which diffuses very fast through the skin and, causes severe chemical burns, and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2011-12-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treatment includes kerosene flotation for [[chitin]]ous materials.

===Analysis===
Once samples have been prepared chemically, they are mounted on [[microscope]] slides using silicon oil, glycerol or glycerol-jelly and examined using light [[microscopy]] or mounted on a stub for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]].

Researchers will often study either modern samples from a number of unique sites within a given area, or samples from a single site with a record through time, such as samples obtained from [[peat]] or lake sediments. More recent studies have used the modern analog technique in which paleo-samples are compared to modern samples for which the parent vegetation is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When the slides are observed under a microscope, the researcher counts the number of grains of each pollen taxon.  This record is next used to produce a [[pollen diagram]]. These data can be used to detect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] effects, such as logging,&lt;ref&gt;

Palynology can be applied to problems in many fields including [[geology]], [[botany]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], [[pedology (soil study)]], and [[physical geography]].

== Applications ==
Palynology is used for a diverse range of applications, related to many scientific disciplines:

* [[Biostratigraphy]] and [[geochronology]]. Geologists use palynological studies in biostratigraphy to correlate [[stratum|strata]] and determine the relative age of a given bed, horizon, formation or [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical]] sequence.
* [[paleoecology|Palaeoecology]] and [[climate change]]. Palynology can be used to reconstruct past [[vegetation]] (land plants) and [[ocean|marine]] and [[Freshwater phytoplankton]] communities, and so infer past [[natural environment|environmental]] ([[paleoenvironment|palaeoenvironment]]al) and [[paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatic]] conditions.
* [[organic compound|Organic]] [[palynofacies]] studies, which examine the preservation of the particulate organic matter and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s provides information on the depositional environment of sediments and depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]].
* [[Geothermal]] alteration studies examine the [[color|colour]] of palynomorphs extracted from rocks to give the thermal alteration and [[hydrocarbon|maturation]] of [[sedimentary]] sequences, which provides estimates of maximum [[paleotemperatures|palaeotemperatures]].
* [[Limnology]] studies. Freshwater palynomorphs and animal and plant fragments, including the [[prasinophyte]]s and [[desmid]]s ([[green alga]]e) can be used to study past lake levels and long term [[climate change]].
* [[scientific classification|Taxonomy]] and [[evolution|evolutionary studies]]. Involving the use of pollen morphological characters as source of taxonomic data to delimit plant species under same family or genus. Pollen apertural status is frequently used for differential sorting or finding similarities between species of the same taxa. This is also called Palynotaxonomy.
* [[Forensic palynology]]: the study of [[pollen]] and other palynomorphs for evidence at a crime scene.
* [[Allergy]] studies. Studies of the geographic distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can help sufferers of allergies such as [[hay fever]].
* [[Melissopalynology]]: the study of pollen and spores found in honey.
* [[Archaeological]] palynology examines human uses of plants in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, presence or absence of agricultural practices or products, and 'plant-related activity areas' within an archaeological context.  [[Bonfire Shelter]] is one such example of this application.

Because the distribution of [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s provides evidence of [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical correlation]] through [[biostratigraphy]] and [[palaeoenvironment]]al reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of palynology is in [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] exploration.

Palynology also allows scientists to infer the climatic conditions from the vegetation present in an area [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years]] ago. This is a fundamental part of research into [[climate change]].

The word '''Persianism''' is used to describe any process of forming or transforming a phenomenon into something which has [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] (Iranian) traits and peculiarities.

Persianism can also mean a school of thought which emphasises the study of Persian culture and informing others about it. It is said by the scholar Ofira Seliktar that Shi'ism and Persianism overlap in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;P. 138 ''Failing the crystal ball test the Carter administration and the fundamentalist revolution in Iran'' by Ofira Seliktar;  NetLibrary, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Muhammad Iqbal]] wrote, "''The conquest of Persia meant not the conversion of Persia to Islam, but the conversion of Islam to Persianism!''"&lt;ref&gt;P. 82 ''Thoughts and Reflections of Iqbal.'' By Muhammad Iqbal&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of how the Persians regained governance of their country, the scholar [[Philip Khuri Hitti]] writes, "Arabianism fell, but Islam under a new guise, that of Persianism, marched on triumphantly."&lt;ref&gt;P. 536 ''History of Syria, Including Lebanon and Palestine'' By Phillip K. Hitti&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of linguistics, Persianism is the [[Persian language|Persian]] pronunciation of a word.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Phoslock''' is the commercial name for a [[bentonite]] clay in which the sodium and/or calcium ions are exchanged for [[lanthanum]]. The addition of this element allows it to bind with phosphates to form rhabdophane (&lt;chem&gt;LaPO4.\mathit{n}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;) and thereby remove them from the water column. It is used in lake restoration projects as a tool to manage [[eutrophication]] and manage [[algal blooms]] (specifically [[cyanobacteria]] or blue green algae) by reducing [[phosphorus]], one of the major contributing factors to algal growth.

It was developed in Australia by the [[CSIRO]] in the late 1990s by Dr Grant Douglas (US Patent 6350383) as a way of utilising the ability of lanthanum to bind phosphate in freshwater natural aquatic systems. The first large-scale trial took place in January 2000 in the [[Canning River]], Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoslock.com.au/irm/ShowStaticCategory.aspx?CategoryID=172&amp;masterpage=5 About Phoslock], Phoslock Water Solutions&lt;/ref&gt; More recent [[CSIRO]] research has involved the development of a nanoclay hybrid with a demonstrated ability to remove dissolved phosphorus from both natural and wastewaters.  
  
During its development, patenting and commercialisation by CSIRO and subsequent commercial production, Phoslock has been a subject in academic research (,&lt;ref&gt;Egemose et al, Chemical lake restoration products: sediment stability and phosphorus dynamics, Environment Science &amp; Technology 44 (3), 985-991 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lurling et al, Effects of lanthanum and lanthanum-modified clay on growth, survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna, Water Research 44 (3), 309-319 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robb et al, Application of Phoslockâ¢, an innovative phosphorus binding clay, to two Western Australian waterways - preliminary findings, Hydrological Processes, 494, 237-243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, et al, Phoslockâ¢ - A new technique to reduce internal phosphorus loads in aquatic systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">[[File:Phosphomimetics.svg|thumb|Example of a phosphomimetic substitution: aspartic acid compared to phospho-serine]]

'''Phosphomimetics''' are [[amino acid]] substitutions that mimic a [[Chemical Biology#Protein Phosphorylation|phosphorylated protein]], thereby activating (or deactivating) the protein. Within cells, proteins are commonly modified at [[serine]], [[tyrosine]] and [[threonine]] amino acids by adding a [[phosphate]] group. [[Phosphorylation]] is a common mode of activating or deactivating a protein as a form of regulation. However some non-phosphorylated amino acids appear chemically similar to phosphorylated amino acids. Therefore, by replacing an amino acid, the protein may maintain a higher level of activity. For example, [[aspartic acid]] is chemically similar to phospho-serine. Therefore, when an aspartic acid replaces a serine, it is a phosphomimetic of phospho-serine and can make the protein always in its phosphorylated form.

== Applications ==

This chemical similarity can be exploited in cancer, where a protein may mutate into an "always on" (constitutively active) state. A mutation may occur to replace a tyrosine (which needs to be phosphorylated in order to activate the protein) with an aspartic acid (which would not need to be phosphorylated). In a laboratory setting, the use of recombinant proteins to artificially introduce phosphomimetics is a common tool for studying phosphorylation and protein activation. For example, the [[IRF3]] protein must be phosphorylated for its normal activity (transcription of its target genes, like [[Interferon#IFN-Î²|IFNÎ²]]), but when serine amino acid residues were mutated to aspartic acid, the activity increased 90-fold.&lt;ref name="pmid10048763"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiscott J, Pitha P, Genin P, Nguyen H, Heylbroeck C, Mamane Y, Algarte M, Lin R | title = Triggering the interferon response: the role of IRF-3 transcription factor. | journal = J Interferon Cytokine Res| volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 1â13 |date=Jan 1999 | pmid = 10048763 | doi = 10.1089/107999099314360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that using phosphomimetic amino acids in [[PEDF]] prevented tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis and inducing cell death in tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid21059648"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Konson A, Pradeep S, D'Acunto CW, Seger R | title = Pigment epithelium-derived factor and its phosphomimetic mutant induce JNK-dependent apoptosis and p38-mediated migration arrest | journal = J Biol Chem| volume = 286 | issue = 5 | pages = 3540â51 |date=Feb 2011 | pmid = 21059648 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M110.151548 | pmc = 3030359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphomimetics are commonly used in a [[genetic engineering|gain of function]] experiment with respect to phosphorylation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10033">'''Political socialization''' is the "process by which individuals learn and frequently [[Internalization|internalize]] a [[Politics|political]] lens framing their perceptions of how [[Power (social and political)|power]] is arranged and how the world around them is (and should be) [[Organization|organized]]; those perceptions, in turn, shape and define individuals' definitions of who they are and how they should behave in the political and economic institutions in which they live."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political sociology: Oppression, resistance, and the state.|last=Glasberg|first=Davita Silfen|last2=Shannon|first2=Deric|publisher=Thousand Oaks: Pine Forge Press.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political socialization also encompasses the way in which people acquire values and opinions that shape their political stance and [[ideology]]: it is a "study of the developmental processes by which people of all ages and adolescents acquire political cognition, attitudes, and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Campaign Communication: Inside and Out|last=Powell|first=L.|last2=Cowart|first2=J.|publisher=Boston MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a learning process by which norms and behaviors acceptable to a well running political system are transmitted from one generation to another. It is through the performance of this function that individuals are inducted into the political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed.&lt;ref&gt;Varkey, K. (2003). Political Theory A Philosophycal Perspective. Indian Publishers Distributors.&lt;/ref&gt; Schools, media, and the state have a major influence in this process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Agents of socialization==
Agents of socialization, sometimes referred to as [[institution]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, work together to influence and shape people's political and economic norms and values. Such institutions include, but are not limited to: [[Family|families]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[Peer group|peers]], [[School|schools,]] [[religion]]s, work and [[legal systems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Agents===
# '''Family''': Families perpetuate values that support political authorities and can heavily contribute to children's initial political ideological views, or party affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VENTURA|first=RAPHAEL|date=2016|title=Family Political Socialization in Multiparty Systems|url=|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume= 34| issue = 6|pages=666â691|doi=10.1177/0010414001034006004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Families have an effect on "political knowledge, identification, efficacy, and participation", depending on variables such as "family demographics, life cycle, parenting style, parental level of political cynicism and frequency of political discussions."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kononova|first=A.|last2=Saleem|first2=A.|date=2011|title=The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students.|url=|journal=International Communication Gazette|volume= 73| issue = 4|pages=302â321|doi=10.1177/1748048511398592}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# '''Schools''': Spending numerous years in school, children in the United States are taught and reinforced a view of the world that "privileges capitalism and ownership, competitive individualism, and democracy."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through primary, secondary and high schools, students are taught key principles such as individual rights and property, personal responsibility and duty to their nation. 
# '''Media:''' Mass media is not only a source of political information; it is an influence on political values and beliefs. Various media outlets, through news coverage and late-night programs, provide different partisan policy stances that are associated with political participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Religion''': Religions beliefs and practices play a role in political opinion formation and political participation. The theological and moral perspectives offered by religious institutions shape judgement regarding public policy, and ultimately, translates to direct "political decision making on governmental matters such as the redistribution of wealth, equality, tolerance for deviance and the limits on individual freedom, the severity of criminal punishment, policies relating to family structure, gender roles, and the value of human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195326529-e-6|title=Religion and Political Socialization|last=PearsonâMerkowitz|first=Shanna|last2=Gimpel|first2=James G.|date=2009-08-19|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195326529.003.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Political parties]]''': Scholars such as Campbell (1960) note that political parties have very little direct influence on a child due to a contrast of social factors such as age, context, power, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. M. (1960). The American Voter. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''The state''': The state is a key source of information for media outlets, and has the ability to "inform, misinform, or disinform the press and thus the public", a strategy which may be referred to as [[propaganda]], in order to serve a political or economic agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Media's effect ==

=== In children ===
Political socialization begins in childhood. Some research suggests that family and school teachers are the most influential factors in socializing children, but recent research designs have more accurately estimated the high influence of the media in the process of political socialization. On average, both young children and teenagers in the United States spend more time a week consuming television and digital media than they spend in school. Young children consume an average of thirty-one hours a week, while teenagers consume forty-eight hours of media a week. High school students attribute the information that forms their opinions and attitudes about race, war, economics, and patriotism to mass media much more than their friends, family, or teachers. Research has also shown that children who consume more media than others show greater support for and understanding of American values, such as free speech. This may be because eighty percent of the media content children consume is intended for an adult audience. In addition, the impact of the messages is more powerful because children's brains are "prime for learning", thus more likely to take messages and representations of the world at face value.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris|publisher = CQ Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-8728-7|location = |pages = |last2 = Dunaway|first2 = Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In adulthood ===
Media's role into political socialization continues in adulthood through both fictional and factual media sources. Adults have increased exposure to news and political information embedded in entertainment; fictional entertainment (mostly television) is the most common source for political information. The culmination of information gained from entertainment becomes the values and standards by which people judge.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

While political socialization by the media is lifelong process, after adolescence, people's basic values generally do not change. Most people choose what media they are exposed to based on their already existing values, and they use information from the media to reaffirm what they already believe. Studies show two-thirds of newspaper readers do not know their newspaper's position on specific issues- and most media stories are quickly forgotten. Studies on public opinion of the Bush administration's energy policies show that the public pays more attention to issues that receive a lot of media coverage, and forms collective opinions about these issues. This demonstrates that the mass media attention to an issue affects public opinion. More so, extensive exposure to television has led to "mainstreaming", aligning people's perception of political life and society with television's portrayal of it.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

=== Patterns ===
There are different patterns in socialization based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, education, geographic region, and city size. For example, generally, African Americans and Hispanics rely on television for their information more than white people. More women than men watch daytime television, and more men than women follow sports programs. Older people read more newspapers than younger people, and people from the ages of twelve to seventeen (although they consume the most media) consume the least amount of news. Northerners listen to radio programs more than Southerners do. News outlets on the East Coast tend to cover international affairs in Europe and the Middle East the most, while West Coast news outlets are more likely to cover Asian affairs; this demonstrates that region affects patterns in media socialization. Income level is also an important factor; high-income families rely more on print media than television, and consume less television than most of the population.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

Ultimately, however, the common core of information, and the interpretation the media applies to it, leads to a shared knowledge and basic values throughout the United States. Most media entertainment and information does not vary much throughout the country, and it is consumed by all types of audiences. Although there are still disagreements and different political beliefs and party affiliations, generally there are not huge ideological disparities among the population because the media helps create a broad consensus on basic US democratic principles.&lt;ref name="Graber 2014" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14695">'''Polysyndeton''' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ÏÎ¿Î»Ï ''poly'', meaning "many", and ÏÏÎ½Î´ÎµÏÏÎ½ ''[[syndeton]]'', meaning "bound together with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/P/polysyndeton.htm|work=Rhetoric.byu.edu|publisher=Silva Rhetoricae|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stylistic scheme, polysyndeton is the deliberate insertion of [[Conjunction (grammar)| conjunction]]s into a sentence for the purpose of "slow[ing] up the rhythm of the prose" so as to produce "an impressively solemn note."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[grammar]], a '''polysyndetic coordination''' is a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] in which all conjuncts are linked by coordinating conjunctions (usually ''and'', ''but'', ''or'', ''nor'' in English).

==Examples==

A passage from [[The Book of Genesis]], 1:24-25 exemplifies the stately effect of polysyndeton: 

{{quote |''And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind."  And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps upon the earth to its kind. And God saw that it was good.''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Author [[Ernest Hemingway]] employs the conjunction "and" to convey "a flow and continuity of experience" in a passage from his short story "[[Winner Take Nothing |After the Storm]]": 
{{quote| ''"I said, 'Who killed him?' and he said 'I don't know who killed him, but he's dead all right,' and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights or windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Key and she was right only she was full of water."''&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The poet [[John Keats |Keats]] used conjunctions in a verse from [[Endymion (poem)| Endymion]]:  
{{quote| ''And soon it lightly dipped, and rose, and sank,
''And dipped again...''&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, 2008. P. 264&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the King James Bible==
Polysyndeton is used extensively in the [[King James Version of the Bible]], where ''and'' is used as a literal translation of the Hebrew [[waw-consecutive]] and the Ancient Greek particle [[wikt:Î´Î­|Î´Î­]]. For example:

* "And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and [[Noah]] only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:22â24)
* "Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty." ([[Leviticus]] 5:2)
* "And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had." ([[Joshua]] 7.24)

== In Shakespeare ==
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is known for using various rhetorical devices in his works, including polysyndeton.
* "When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too" (''[[King Lear]]'' 5.3.11â5)
* "Why, this is not a boon! 'Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.85â9)
* "If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.443â5)
* "Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.42â5)
* "Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.59â61)

==Modern usage==
Writers of modern times have also used the scheme:

* "There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway. Little tumuli of oyster shells in the oyster season, and of lobster shells in the lobster season, and of broken crockery and faded cabbage leaves in all seasons, encroached upon its high places." ([[Charles Dickens]], ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', 1848)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Kenzie|title=Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/t6wdyb7-gco8/polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Papa O. never knocked. He kicked the door in happily and shouted cheerfully, 'What you say, all peoples? How's t'ings, ever-body?' Papa O. pulled people out of bed and rattled pans and laughed at nothing and argued with unseen bartenders until somebody gave him sausage and eggs and coffee and bread and hung the accordion safely away." ([[Nelson Algren]], "How the Devil Came Down Division Street", 1944, in ''[[The Neon Wilderness]]'', 1947)
* "Let the whitefolks have their money and power and segregation and sarcasm and big houses and schools and lawns like carpets, and books, and mostlyâmostlyâlet them have their whiteness." ([[Maya Angelou]], ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'', 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gabriel|first=Jacob|title=Asyndeton and Polysyndeton|url=http://prezi.com/7rbdhtguue_r/asyndeton-and-polysyndeton/|publisher=Prezi|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cormac McCarthy==
[[Cormac McCarthy]] used polysyndeton extensively throughout his ten novels (1965â2006), especially "and" to replace an increasing number of commas. (By ''[[The Border Trilogy]]'', commas are mostly used between unquoted voices and narration, as in: "Bring it here, he said.") Examples from each novel:

* Then the barrel of the gun shortening and withdrawing in the cup of his shoulder and his face bent to the stock and him walking into it, the black plume of smoke forming soundlessly about the muzzle and the shot popping into his leg, audible and painless in his flesh and him taking another step with the same leg and pitching forward as if he had stepped in a hole and then he could hear the shot. [...] The first night he built his fire and was sitting by it with his shotgun leaning against a tree and was sipping coffee from a canteen cup [...] (''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', 1965)
* Now the entire herd had begun to wheel wider and faster along the bluff and the outermost ranks swung centrifugally over the escarpment row on row wailing and squealing and above this the howls and curses of the drovers that now up-reared in the moil of flesh they tended and swept with dust had begun to assume satanic looks with their staves and wild eyes as if they were no true swineherds but disciples of darkness got among these charges to herd them to their doom. [...] The hogs boiled past squealing and plunging and the chalky red smoke of their passage hung over the river and stained the sky with something of sunset.

It can be contrasted with [[asyndeton]], which is a coordination containing no conjunctions often manipulating the rhythm of a passage in the attempt to make a thought more memorable, and [[syndeton]], which is a coordination with one conjunction.

Two examples of asyndeton:

* "[[Veni, vidi, vici]]" ([[Julius Caesar]])&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web|title=A Glossary of Rhetorical Terms with Examples|url=http://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms#13|work=Modern &amp; Classical Languages, Literatures &amp; Culture|publisher=University of Kentucky|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Population density key.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Key]]
In biology, a '''population''' is all the [[organism]]s of the same group or [[species]], which live in a particular [[geographical area]], and have the capability of interbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Population |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Population|publisher=Biology Online |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of population (biology) |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/population?q=population |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=5 December 2012 |quote=a community of animals, plants, or humans among whose members interbreeding occurs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of a [[sex]]ual population is the area where [[interbreeding|inter-breeding]] is potentially possible between any pair within the area, and where the probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of [[Crossbreed|cross-breeding]] with individuals from other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartl | first=Daniel | title=Principles of Population Genetics | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | series=| year=2007 | isbn=978-0-87893-308-2 | page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''population''' refers to a collection of [[human]]s. [[Demography]] is a [[social science]] which entails the statistical study of human populations. 
Population in simpler terms is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data)

This article refers mainly to human population.

== Population genetics (ecology) ==
In [[population genetics]] a sex  population is a set of organisms in which any pair of members can [[Breeding in the wild|breed]] together. This means that they can regularly exchange gametes to produce normally-fertile offspring, and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a ''Gamo deme''. This also implies that all members belong to the same species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartl | first=Daniel | title=Principles of Population Genetics | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-87893-308-2 | page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the Gamo deme is very large (theoretically, approaching infinity), and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it, the Gamo deme is said to be panmictic. Under this state, [[allele]] ([[gamete]]) frequencies can be converted to genotype ([[zygote]]) frequencies by expanding an appropriate [[quadratic equation]], as shown by Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] in his establishment of quantitative genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fisher | first=R. A. | title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1999 | isbn=0-19-850440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This seldom occurs in Nature: localization of gamete exchange â through dispersal limitations, preferential mating, cataclysm, or other cause â may lead to small actual Gamo demes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighboring Gamo demes. However, there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbors. This may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population (panmictic) into smaller overlapping sexual populations. This failure of [[panmixia]] leads to two important changes in overall population structure: (1) the component Gamo demos vary (through gamete sampling) in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original (this is known as dispersion, and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate [[binomial equation]]); and (2) the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of Gamo demes. The overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient (''f'' or ''Ï''). Note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency â both the deleterious and the desirable. The mean phenotype of the Gamo demes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original â which is known as inbreeding depression. It is most important to note, however, that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original, while some will be about the same, and some will be inferior. The probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations. In [[plant breeding|plant]] and [[animal breeding]], procedures have been developed which deliberately utilize the effects of dispersion (such as line breeding, pure-line breeding, backcrossing). It can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance (''ÎG''=change in the phenotypic mean), and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion. This is so for both allogamous (random fertilization)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gordon  | first=Ian L. | title=Quantitative genetics of allogamous F2 : an origin of randomly fertilized populations | journal=Heredity   | year=2000  | volume=85  | pages=43â52  | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00716.x  | pmid=10971690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autogamous (self-fertilization) Gamo demes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gordon  | first=Ian L. | title=Quantitative genetics of autogamous F2 | journal=Hereditas | year=2001 | volume=134 | pages=255â262 | doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.2001.00255.x | pmid=11833289 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecology, the population of a certain species in a certain area can be estimated using the [[Lincoln Index]].

{{Main|World population}}

As of today's date, the world's population is [[Guesstimate|estimated]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]] to be {{#expr:({{data world|poptoday}}/1000000000) round 3}} [[1,000,000,000|billion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html U.S. Census Bureau â World Pop Clock Projection] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5VGxaVo5k?url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html |date=1 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Census Bureau estimates the 7 billion number was surpassed on 12 March 2012. According to a separate estimate by the United Nations, Earthâs population exceeded seven billion in October 2011, a milestone that offers unprecedented challenges and opportunities to all of humanity, according to [[UNFPA]], the United Nations Population Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/news/pid/8328Countdown to a World of Seven Billion People] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113192804/http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/news/pid/8328Countdown |date=13 January 2012 }} [[UNFPA]] 12 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to papers published by the United States Census Bureau, the world population hit 6.5 billion on 24 February 2006. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] designated 12 October 1999 as the approximate day on which world population reached 6 billion. This was about 12 years after world population reached 5 billion in 1987, and 6 years after world population reached 5.5 billion in 1993. The population of countries such as [[Nigeria]], is not even known to the nearest million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/2005_world_city_populations/Nigeria.html | title=Cities in Nigeria: 2005 Population Estimates&amp;nbsp;â MongaBay.com |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; so there is a considerable margin of error in such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1064557.stm |title=Country Profile: Nigeria |accessdate=1 July 2008 | work=BBC News | date=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===
{{Main|Human population control}}

Human population control is the practice of altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population control has been implemented with the goal of increasing the rate of population growth. In the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its effects on poverty, [[environmental degradation]], and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates. While population control can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's one-child per family policy, have resorted to coercive measures.

In the 1978s, tension grew between population control advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's [[reproductive rights]] as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |author2= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |author2= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=4â5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Primate Conservation''''' is a journal published by the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission|IUCN Species Survival Commission's]] [[IUCN Species Survival Commission#Primate Specialist Group|Primate Specialist Group]] about the world's primates. First published as a mimeographed newsletter in 1981, the journal today publishes [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] research and papers on primate species, particularly status surveys and studies on distribution and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.primate-sg.org/primate_conservation/|title=Primates-SG - Primate Conservation|website=www.primate-sg.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these regular papers, the journal has also been a significant place for [[Primatology|primatologists]] to publish descriptions of new primate species in ''Primate Conservation''.

'''''Quercus suber''''', commonly called the '''cork oak''',  is a medium-sized, [[evergreen]] [[oak]] tree in the section [[Quercus section Cerris|''Quercus'' sect. ''Cerris'']]. It is the primary source of [[cork (material)|cork]] for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of [[cricket ball]]s.  It is native to southwest Europe and northwest [[Africa]]. In the [[Mediterranean basin]] the tree is an ancient species with [[fossil]] remnants dating back to the [[Tertiary period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, E.|author2=Varela, M.C.|author3=Lumaret, R.|author4=Gil, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Genetic conservation of Quercus suber|publisher=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme ([[EUFORGEN]]), [[Bioversity International]]|date=2017|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/Quercus_TB_OpenSourceCR_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It grows to up to {{cvt|20|m}}, although it is typically more stunted in its native environment. The leaves are {{cvt|4|to|7|cm}} long, weakly lobed or coarsely toothed, dark green above, paler beneath, with the leaf margins often downcurved. The [[acorn]]s are {{cvt|2|to|3|cm}} long, in a deep cup fringed with elongated scales.

In the Portuguese town of [[Ãguas de Moura]] is located the Sobreiro Monumental (Monumental Cork Oak), a tree 234 years old, {{convert|16|m}} tall and with a trunk that requires at least five people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and the Guinness Book of Records states it as the largest and oldest in the world.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Ecology==
The cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1214 Mediterranean Woodland and Forest Ecoregion: Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.] World Wildlife Fund. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural stands of cork oak can support [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[ecosystems]]. For example, in parts of northwestern [[North Africa]], some cork oak forests are [[habitat]] to the [[endangered]] [[Barbary macaque]], ''Macaca sylvanus'', a species whose habitat is fragmented and whose range was prehistorically much wider.&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;Hogan, C.M.
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095518/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=31757 Barbary Macaque, ''Macaca sylvanus''.] GlobalTwitcher.com, Ed. N. Stromberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, particularly in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the cork oak forests are home to endangered species such as the [[Iberian lynx]], the most critically threatened feline in the world.&lt;ref name=santos&gt;Santos Pereira, J., Bugalho, M.N., and Caldeira, M.D. (2008). [http://www.apcor.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/From-the-Cork-Oak-to-Cork-a-sustainable-system.pdf ''From the Cork Oak to Cork: A Sustainable Ecosystem''.] APCOR: Portuguese Cork Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[pyrophyte]], this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to [[forest fire]]s. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the [[maritime pine]]) or resprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the [[holm oak]]). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean biome]].&lt;ref name=santos/&gt;

==Cultivation and use==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Cork oak trunk section.jpg|thumb|A cross section of the trunk of a cork oak]]
The tree forms a thick, rugged [[Bark (botany)|bark]] containing high levels of [[suberin]]. Over time the [[cork cambium]] layer of bark can develop considerable thickness and can be harvested every 7 to 10 years to produce [[Cork (material)|cork]]. The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree, in fact, no trees are cut down during the harvesting process. Only the bark is extracted, and a new layer of cork regrows, making it a [[renewable resource]]. The tree is cultivated in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Tunisia]]. Cork oaks are considered to be soil builders and their fruits have been shown to have useful insecticidal properties. Cork oak forests cover approximately 25,000 square kilometres in those countries (equivalent to {{convert|2,500,000|ha}}). Portugal accounts for around 50% of the world cork harvest. Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for [[forestry|forest management]] felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

''Q. suber'' is commonly grown in [[agroforestry]] systems, known as ''montado'' in [[Portugal]] and ''dehesa'' in Spain. These are open woods with low tree density (50â300 trees/ha). In these systems, [[forage]] species are commonly grown under the trees and grazed by [[cattle]] during the summer.&lt;ref name='gil08'&gt;{{citation |author=Gil, L. |author2=Varela, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Cork oak - ''Quercus suber'': Technical guidelines for genetic conservation and use|date=2008 |pages=6 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin//bioversity/publications/pdfs/1323_Cork_oak__Quercus_suber_.pdf |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork oaks commonly live more than 200 years.&lt;ref name=santos/&gt; Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 9 to 12 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested about twelve times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labor. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree's bark, using a small axe. The process requires training due to the skill required to harvest bark without harming the tree. The European cork industry produces 300,000 [[tonne]]s of cork a year, with a value of [[Euro|â¬]]1.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and employing 30,000 people. [[Wine]] corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.

The cork left after stoppers have been made is used to make a wide range of products, including insulation panels, floor and wall tiles and [[sound-proofing]] in the car industry, as well as for [[handicrafts]] and artistic uses. This include ''cork paper'', used in printing, book covering, clothing manufacture, cork ''maroquinerie'' and other products. Cork is also used in making [[cricket ball]]s, Hurling Ball (Sliothars), badminton shuttlecocks, handles of fishing rods and special devices for the [[space industry]].&lt;ref name='gil08'/&gt;

Cork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]'') are regular, both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid is known as Lucombe oak ''Quercus'' Ã ''hispanica''. Some cork is also produced in eastern [[Asia]] from the related Chinese cork oak (''[[Quercus variabilis]]'')

==Pathogens==
Cork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. [[Leaf spot]] can be caused by the fungus ''[[Apiognomonia errabunda]]''. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, [[powdery mildew]], [[Rust (fungus)|rust]], and [[canker]]s.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moricca |first1=Salvatore |last2=Linaldeddu |first2=Benedetto T. |last3=Ginetti |first3=Beatrice |last4=Scanu |first4=Bruno |last5=Franceschini |first5=Antonio |last6=Ragazzi |first6=Alessandro |title=Endemic and Emerging Pathogens Threatening Cork Oak Trees: Management Options for Conserving a Unique Forest Ecosystem |journal=Plant Disease |date=2016 |volume=100 |issue=11 |pages=2184â2193 |doi=10.1094/PDIS-03-16-0408-FE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most virulent cork oak pathogen may be ''[[Diplodia corticola]]'', a [[Ascomycota|sac fungus]] which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus ''[[Biscogniauxia mediterranea]]'' is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the [[Platypus cylindrus|oak pinhole borer]] (''Platypus cylindrus''), a species of weevil.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

The common water mould ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

'''Salinity''' ({{IPAc-en|s|eÉª|Ë|l|Éª|n|É|t|i}}) is the saltiness or amount of [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] dissolved in a body of [[water]] (see also [[soil salinity]]). This is usually measured in &lt;math&gt;\frac{g \ \textrm{salt}}{kg \  \textrm{sea} \  \textrm{water}}&lt;/math&gt; (note that this is technically dimensionless). Salinity is an important factor in determining many aspects of the [[chemistry]]
of natural waters and of [[biological]] processes within it, and is a [[state function|thermodynamic state variable]] that, along with [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], governs physical characteristics like the [[density]] and [[heat capacity]] of the water.

A [[contour line]] of constant salinity is called an ''isohaline'', or sometimes ''isohale''.

==Definitions==
Salinity in rivers, lakes, and the ocean is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to define and measure precisely. Conceptually the salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like [[sodium chloride]], [[magnesium sulfate]], [[potassium nitrate]], and [[sodium bicarbonate]] which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity. Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 Î¼m, but nowadays usually 0.2 Î¼m).&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pawlowicz|first=R.|title=Key Physical Variables in the Ocean: Temperature, Salinity, and Density|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|year=2013|volume=4|issue=4|pages=13|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/key-physical-variables-in-the-ocean-temperature-102805293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity can be expressed in the form of a [[Mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]], i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution.

Seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35&amp;nbsp;g/kg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean. Rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities, from less than 0.01&amp;nbsp;g/kg&lt;ref name=dilute&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eilers|first1=J. M.|last2=Sullivan|first2=T. J.|last3=Hurley|first3=K. C.|title=The most dilute lake in the world?|journal=Hydrobiologia|year=1990|volume=199|pages=1â6|doi=10.1007/BF00007827}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a few g/kg, although there are many places where higher salinities are found. The [[Dead Sea]] has a salinity of more than 200&amp;nbsp;g/kg.&lt;ref name=anati&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anati|first=D. A.|title=The salinity of hypersaline brines: concepts and misconceptions|journal=Int. J. Salt Lake. Res.| year=1999|volume=8|pages=55â70|doi=10.1007/bf02442137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainwater before touching the ground typically has a TDS of 20 mg/L or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salinitymanagement.org/Salinity%20Management%20Guide/ls/ls_3d.html | title=Learn about salinity and water quality | accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever pore size is used in the definition, the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few [[percent]] (%). Physical oceanographers working in the [[Abyssal zone|abyssal ocean]], however, are often concerned with precision and intercomparability of measurements by different researchers, at different times, to almost five significant digits.&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt; A bottled seawater product known as IAPSO Standard Seawater is used by oceanographers to standardize their measurements with enough precision to meet this requirement.

===Composition===
Measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources (not all from dissolved salts) in different molecular forms. The chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure. Many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy, and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples. Different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems, to different levels of precision, while still remaining reasonably easy to use.

For practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of masses of a subset of these dissolved chemical constituents (so-called ''solution salinity''), rather  than to the unknown mass of salts that gave rise to this composition (an exception is when [[artificial seawater]] is created).  For many purposes this sum can be limited to a set of eight major ions in natural waters,&lt;ref name=wetzel&gt;{{cite book|last=Wetzel|first=R. G.|title=Limnology: Lake and River Ecosystems, 3rd ed.|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-744760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=limteos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pawlowicz|first1=R.|first2=R.|last2=Feistel|title=Limnological applications of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10)|journal=Limnology and Oceanography: Methods|year=2012|volume=10|issue=11|pages=853â867| doi=10.4319/lom.2012.10.853}}&lt;/ref&gt; although for seawater at highest precision an additional seven minor ions are also included.&lt;ref name=teos10&gt;{{cite book|last=IOC, SCOR, and IAPSO|title=The international thermodynamic equation of seawater â 2010: Calculation and use of thermodynamic properties |year=2010 |publisher=Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO (English) |pages=196pp |url=http://www.TEOS-10.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major ions dominate the inorganic composition of most (but by no means all) natural waters. Exceptions include some [[Cenote|pit lake]]s and waters from some [[hydrothermal spring]]s.

The concentrations of dissolved gases like [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] are not usually included in descriptions of salinity.&lt;ref name=key /&gt; However, [[carbon dioxide]] gas, which when dissolved is partially converted into [[carbonates]] and [[bicarbonates]], is often included. [[Silicon]] in the form of [[silicic acid]], which usually appears as a neutral molecule in the [[pH]] range of most natural waters, may also be included for some purposes (e.g., when salinity/density relationships are being investigated).

The term 'salinity' is, for oceanographers, usually associated with one of a set of specific measurement techniques. As the dominant techniques evolve, so do different descriptions of salinity. Salinities were largely measured using [[titration]]-based techniques before the 1980s. Titration with [[silver nitrate]] could be used to determine the concentration of [[halide]] ions (mainly [[chlorine]] and [[bromine]]) to give a [[chlorinity]]. The chlorinity was then multiplied by a factor to account for all other constituents. The resulting 'Knudsen salinities' are expressed in units of parts per thousand (ppt or [[Per mille|â°]]).

The use of [[electrical conductivity]] measurements to estimate the ionic content of seawater led to the development of the scale called the ''practical salinity scale 1978'' (PSS-78).&lt;ref name="pss78a"&gt;Unesco (1981). The Practical Salinity Scale 1978 and the International Equation of State of Seawater 1980. ''Tech. Pap. Mar. Sci.'', 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pss78b"&gt;Unesco (1981). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000479/047932eb.pdf Background papers and supporting data on the Practical Salinity Scale 1978]. ''Tech. Pap. Mar. Sci.'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; Salinities measured using PSS-78 do not have units. {{anchor|PSU}}The suffix '''psu''' or '''PSU''' (denoting ''practical salinity unit'') is sometimes added to PSS-78 measurement values.&lt;ref name=rant&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millero|first=F. J.|journal=Oceanography| year=1993|volume=6| issue=3| pages=67|title=What is PSU?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a new standard for the properties of seawater called the ''thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010'' (TEOS-10) was introduced, advocating absolute salinity as a replacement for practical salinity, and [[conservative temperature]] as a replacement for [[potential temperature]].&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt; This standard includes a new scale called the ''reference composition salinity scale''. Absolute salinities on this scale are expressed as a mass fraction, in grams per kilogram of solution. Salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that can account for regional changes in the composition of seawater. They can also be determined by making direct density measurements.

A sample of seawater from most locations with a chlorinity of 19.37&amp;nbsp;ppt will have a Knudsen salinity of 35.00&amp;nbsp;ppt, a PSS-78 practical salinity of about 35.0, and a TEOS-10 absolute salinity of about 35.2&amp;nbsp;g/kg. The electrical conductivity of this water at a temperature of 15&amp;nbsp;Â°C is 42.9 mS/cm.&lt;ref name="teos10"/&gt;&lt;ref name=culk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culkin|first1=F.|last2=Smith|first2=N. D.|title=Determination of the Concentration of Potassium Chloride Solution Having the Same Electrical Conductivity, at 15C and Infinite Frequency, as Standard Seawater of Salinity 35.0000â° (Chlorinity 19.37394â°)|journal=IEEE J. Oceanic Eng.|year=1980|volume=OE-5|issue=1|pages=22â23|doi=10.1109/JOE.1980.1145443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lakes and rivers===

[[Limnologist]]s and chemists often define salinity in terms of mass of salt per unit volume, expressed in units of mg per litre or g per litre.&lt;ref name=wetzel/&gt; It is implied, although often not stated, that this value applies accurately only at some reference temperature. Values presented in this way are typically accurate to the order of 1%. Limnologists also use [[electrical conductivity]], or "reference conductivity", as a proxy for salinity. This measurement may be corrected for temperature effects, and is usually expressed in units of Î¼S/cm.

A river or lake water with a salinity of around 70&amp;nbsp;mg/L will typically have a specific conductivity at 25&amp;nbsp;Â°C of between 80 and 130&amp;nbsp;Î¼S/cm. The actual ratio depends on the ions present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Niekerk|first1=Harold|last2=Silberbauer|first2=Michael|last3=Maluleke|first3=Mmaphefo|title=Geographical differences in the relationship between total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity in South African rivers|journal=Water SA|date=2014|volume=40|issue=1|pages=133|doi=10.4314/wsa.v40i1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual conductivity usually changes by about 2% per degree Celsius, so the measured conductivity at 5&amp;nbsp;Â°C might only be in the range of 50â80&amp;nbsp;Î¼S/cm.

Direct density measurements are also used to estimate salinities, particularly in highly [[saline lake]]s.&lt;ref name="anati"/&gt; Sometimes density at a specific temperature is used as a proxy for salinity. At other times an empirical salinity/density relationship developed for a particular body of water is used to estimate the salinity of samples from a measured density.

Marine waters are those of the ocean, another term for which is ''euhaline seas''. The salinity of euhaline seas is 30 to 35. ''Brackish seas'' or waters have salinity in the range of 0.5 to 29 and ''metahaline seas'' from 36 to 40. These waters are all regarded as ''thalassic'' because their salinity is derived from the ocean and defined as ''homoiohaline'' if salinity does not vary much over time (essentially constant). The table on the right, modified from Por (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF00373210|title=Hydrobiological notes on the high-salinity waters of the Sinai Peninsula|year=1972|last1=Por|first1=F. D.|journal=Marine Biology|volume=14|pages=111â119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows the "Venice system" (1959).&lt;ref&gt;Venice system (1959). The final resolution of the symposium on the classification of brackish waters. ''Archo Oceanogr. Limnol.'', 11 (suppl): 243â248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to homoiohaline environments are certain ''poikilohaline'' environments (which may also be ''thalassic'') in which the salinity variation is biologically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dahl, E. |year=1956|title=Ecological salinity boundaries in poikilohaline waters|journal=Oikos|volume=7|pages=1â21|doi=10.2307/3564981|issue=1|jstor=3564981}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poikilohaline'' water salinities may range anywhere from 0.5 to greater than 300. The important characteristic is that these waters tend to vary in salinity over some biologically meaningful range seasonally or on some other roughly comparable time scale. Put simply, these are bodies of water with quite variable salinity.

Highly saline water, from which salts crystallize (or are about to), is referred to as [[brine]].

===Environmental considerations===
Salinity is an ecological factor of considerable importance, influencing the types of organisms that live in a body of water. As well, salinity influences the kinds of [[plant]]s that will grow either in a water body, or on land fed by a water (or by a [[groundwater]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalcic, Maria|first=Turowski, Mark; Hall, Callie|title=Stennis Space Center Salinity Drifter Project. A Collaborative Project with Hancock High School, Kiln, MS|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110008620|work=Stennis Space Center Salinity Drifter Project|publisher=NTRS|accessdate=2011-06-16|date=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A plant adapted to saline conditions is called a [[halophyte]]. A halophyte which is tolerant to [[residual sodium carbonate index|residual sodium carbonate]] salinity are called  [[glasswort]] or [[saltwort]] or [[barilla]] plants. Organisms (mostly bacteria) that can live in very salty conditions are classified as [[extremophile]]s, or [[halophile]]s specifically. An organism that can withstand a wide range of salinities is [[euryhaline]].

Salt is expensive to remove from water, and salt content is an important factor in water use (such as [[drinking water|potability]]).  Increases in salinity have been observed in lakes and rivers in the United States, due to common [[road salt]] and [[De-ice#Chemical de-icers|other salt de-icers]] in runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/01/29/road-salt-environmental-dangers|title=Hopes To Hold The Salt, And Instead Break Out Beet Juice And Beer To Keep Roads Clear|website=www.wbur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of salinity in oceans is a driver of the [[Thermohaline circulation|world's ocean circulation]], where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at the surface of the ocean produce changes in buoyancy, which cause the sinking and rising of water masses. [[Paleosalinity|Changes in the salinity of the oceans]] are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide. In addition, during glacial periods, the [[hydrography]] is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans. Hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23746">'''Sensory stimulation therapy''' ('''SST''') is an experimental therapy that aims to utilize [[Brain plasticity|neural plasticity mechanisms]] to aid in the recovery of [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]] function after [[stroke]] or [[Aging brain|cognitive ageing]]. [[Stroke]] and [[Aging brain|cognitive ageing]] are well known sources of cognitive loss, the former by [[Programmed cell death|neuronal death]], the later by weakening of [[Synaptogenesis|neural connections]]. As SS implies a patient will have a desired sense stimulated in a predetermined fashion at a known frequency. It has been found that this technique can be used to reduce as much as 30 years of cognitive ageing, and can both improve [[Two-point discrimination|two point discrimination thresholds]] and also impair them.

==History and motivation==
By 2025, it is estimated that 34 million people in the United States will have dementia. It is extremely important, then, that we establish an effective treatment for people with such symptoms to either reduce, or diminish dementia altogether. In modern-day treatment not involving pharmacological treatment, psychosocial therapies are a great intervention. With psychosocial therapies such as massage, aromatherapy, multi-sensory stimulation, music therapy, and reality orientation, treatment of dementia and dementia related diseases has become possible in a less traditional yet non-pharmacological form.&lt;ref name="Boote Lewin 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Boote| first1=Jonathan| last2=Lewin| first2=Vincent| last3=Beverley| first3=Catherine| last4=Bates|first4=Jane|title=Psychosocial interventions for people with moderate to severe dementia: A systematic review|journal=Clinical Effectiveness in Nursing| volume=9| year=2006| pages=e1âe15| issn=1361-9004| doi=10.1016/j.cein.2006.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once believed that the brain was largely unchanging and that its function was decided at a young age.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Norman Doidge |title=The brain that changes itself: stories of personal triumph from the frontiers of brain science |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-670-03830-X |oclc=71189897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along this train of thought, cognitive loss from strokes and ageing were viewed as unrecoverable. [[Functional specialization (brain)|Functional Localization]] is a theory which suggests that each section of the brain has a specific function, and that loss of a section equates to permanent loss of function. [[Lateralization of brain function|Traditional models]] even specialize between hemispheres of the brain and describe "artistic and logical sections of the brain." This fatalistic outlook has been dramatically challenged by the recent paradigm of [[Neuroplasticity|Brain Plasticity]].

Brain plasticity refers to the ability of the brain to restructure itself, form new connections, or adjust the strength of existing connections.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhang X |author2=Poo MM |title=Progress in neural plasticity |journal=Science China Life Sciences |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=322â9 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20596926 |doi=10.1007/s11427-010-0062-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current paradigm allow for conceptualization of brain that is capable of change. Various researchers are using this concept to develop new therapies for conditions that were previously viewed as permanent; for example [[Paul Bach-y-Rita]] has worked on devices to give sight to blind individuals, and alleviate a feeling of falling in a patient that has lost function of the [[Vestibular system|vestibular apparatus]].

It has been found that many senses have some plastic nature about them. Even auditory cognition has been shown to have some potential for recovery after stroke. A recent study by Sarkamo ''et al.'' has shown that listening to music and audio books during early recovery from stroke can result in improved cognition.&lt;ref name="SÃ¤rkÃ¤mÃ¶ 2010"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=SÃ¤rkÃ¤mÃ¶ T, Pihko E, Laitinen S, etal |title=Music and speech listening enhance the recovery of early sensory processing after stroke |journal=J Cogn Neurosci |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=2716â27 |date=December 2010 |pmid=19925203 |doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21376 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This paradigm has opened doors into the previously believed to be impossible; recovery from strokes, reduced cognitive ageing.

==Stroke==
{{Main|Stroke}}
[[File:INFARCT.jpg|thumb|Right|[[CT scan]] slice of the brain showing a right-[[brain hemisphere|hemispheric]] [[ischemic]] stroke (left side of image).]]
A [[stroke]] can be caused by a few different situations, but the basic result is the same. Blood flow to a section of the brain is stopped, which results in rapid depletion of oxygen and other nutrients in the starved section. The starved section of brain tissue quickly begins to die, and results in a [[lesion]] in the brain. The resulting lesion can be traced loss of various cognitive functions depending on the location and area of damage.&lt;ref name="Hallett 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hallett M |title=Plasticity of the human motor cortex and recovery from stroke |journal=Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. |volume=36 |issue=2-3 |pages=169â74 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11690613 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0173(01)00092-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for stroke patients to suffer from [[Hemiparesis|muscle weakness and loss of muscle function]]. Some natural recovery has been observed, however training based in advances in neuroscience have shown the most dramatic improvements. These investigational therapies focus on repetition of basic tasks with limited appendages. It is generally found that more intensive remedial function therapies result in the greater restoration to function.&lt;ref name="Nelles 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nelles G |title=Cortical reorganization--effects of intensive therapy |journal=Restor. Neurol. Neurosci. |volume=22 |issue=3-5 |pages=239â44 |year=2004 |pmid=15502268 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan studies have shown that after as little as 3 weeks of the intensive training programs there are statistical differences between the experimental group and controls, with observable improvements in muscle control.&lt;ref name="Langhammer 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Langhammer B |author2=Stanghelle JK |title=Bobath or motor relearning programme?

It would be a powerful tool if one could find a system that does not have massive attention requirements.

==Cognitive aging==
{{Main|Aging brain}}
During [[ageing]] many brain functions decline and some are lost, this is referred to as cognitive aging. In the most extreme cases one might think about the catastrophic results of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimerâs Disease]]. Age is the largest risk factor for Alzheimerâs disease. However, due to lack of knowledge and successful research in this field, little is known about the rates of clinical decline and brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Boote Lewin 2006"/&gt;  This disease is associated with neuronal death. However more general ageing considers loss of synaptic strength over neuronal death.&lt;ref name="Hof 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hof PR |author2=Morrison JH |title=The aging brain: morphomolecular senescence of cortical circuits |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=607â13 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15374672 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.07.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When considering this situation the machinery for proper functioning of the brain is still present, but is in disarray. It has been shown that as much as a 46% decrease in [[Dendrite|dendrite spine]] number and density can occur in humans over 50 years old when compared to older participants.&lt;ref name="Jacobs 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs B |author2=Driscoll L |author3=Schall M |title=Life-span dendritic and spine changes in areas 10 and 18 of human cortex: a quantitative Golgi study |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |volume=386 |issue=4 |pages=661â80 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9378859 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19971006)386:4&lt;661::AID-CNE11&gt;3.0.CO;2-N |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somatosensory system==
[[File:Sensory Homunculus.png|thumb|right|The cortical homunculus, or the visual representation of how your brain sees your body, was discovered by Wilder Penfield]]The cortical homunculus, or the visual representation of how your brain sees your body, was discovered by [[Wilder Penfield]]. a world-famous brain surgeon. Upon ending his career as part of the McGill medical faculty, he served as the director of Neurological Institute.

The [[Somatosensory system]]is the part of our [[sensory system]] that deals with touch. We wouldnât be able to feel things like temperatures, pain, pressure, vibration, and skin rash without the unwavering help of our somatosensory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleveckas-Martens|first=N|title=Somatosensory system anatomy|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1948621-overview#aw2aab6b3|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system has the ability to understand touch, [[pressure]], [[vibration]], [[Proprioception|limb position]], [[heat]], [[Cold]], and [[Pain]]. This information is sent through the [[peripheral nervous system]], to the [[spinal cord]] where it is finally processed by the [[brain]]. One of the key structures in processing this information is the [[Postcentral gyrus|primary somatosensory cortex]], which is located in the [[parietal lobe]]. The primary somatosensory cortex is known to have subsections that process information from different sections, and the area of the cortex for each section is related to its acuity. This observation is often shown symbolically through a [[Cortical homunculus|Homunculus]].&lt;ref name="Purves 2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dale, Ed Purves |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-695-5 |oclc=794367770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensory stimulation therapies==
Sensory Stimulation utilizes rapid stimulation of nerves in a section of skin to drive neuronal changes in the participant. The nerves are electrically stimulated in a fashion referred to as coactivation.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dinse HR |author2=Kleibel N |author3=Kalisch T |author4=Ragert P |author5=Wilimzig C |author6=Tegenthoff M |title=Tactile coactivation resets age-related decline of human tactile discrimination |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=88â94 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16685697 |doi=10.1002/ana.20862 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2009"/&gt; In both cases the participant's limb, often hand, is constrained in a device that has a section that applies the stimulation. The participant is allowed to go about their daily activities, and many do not mind the presence of the device.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; These degree of reorganization is often measured through [[Two-point discrimination|two point discrimination thresholds]], which measure the smallest distance between two points that can be felt by the subject.

It has been shown that the use of this technique can rest as much as 30 years of sensory loss.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt;  In the study by Dinse ''et al.'', 28 patients between the ages of 66 to 86 tested similarly to participants 30 years younger than themselves after treatment. These participants had the device attached for 3 hours while undergoing stimulation. Other studies have used shorter periods of stimulation and achieved similar results.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sawaki L |author2=Wu CW |author3=Kaelin-Lang A |author4=Cohen LG |title=Effects of somatosensory stimulation on use-dependent plasticity in chronic stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=246â7 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16322491 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000195130.16843.ac |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coactivation===
A recent study published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation followed four patients recovering from strokes while undergoing electrical sensory stimulation therapy. Their progress was followed through several different tests; Touch Threshold, Tactile Acuity, [[Haptic perception|Haptic Object Recognition]], Pegs placed in peg board and motor tapping tests. It was found that all patients increased their performance during the study. Although this study utilizes a small sample group, and had no control group it is a first step study that suggests future studies.&lt;ref name="Smith 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith PS |author2=Dinse HR |author3=Kalisch T |author4=Johnson M |author5=Walker-Batson D |title=Effects of repetitive electrical stimulation to treat sensory loss in persons poststroke |journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil |volume=90 |issue=12 |pages=2108â11 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19969176 |doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2009.07.017 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future studies were developed around this study, in which participant's skin was electrically stimulated to induce signals sent to the brain.

===Frequency studies===
In January 2008 Ragert ''et al.'' explored the impact of [[frequency]] of stimulation on sensory stimulation techniques to induce plastic changes. The study investigated if varying the frequency could be used to induce either [[Long-Term Potentiation]] (LTP) or [[Long-term Depression]] (LTD). LTP refers to the processes by which neuronal connections are formed and strengthened through stimulation and activity. Conversely LTD is a process by which a neuronal pathway is decreased by low levels of stimulation or by disuse.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ragert P |author2=Kalisch T |author3=Bliem B |author4=Franzkowiak S |author5=Dinse HR |title=Differential effects of tactile high- and low-frequency stimulation on tactile discrimination in human subjects |journal=BMC Neurosci |volume=9 |issue= |pages=9 |year=2008 |pmid=18215277 |pmc=2244613 |doi=10.1186/1471-2202-9-9 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study Ragert ''et al.'' divided their participants into two groups, both of which underwent the SS therapy, but the frequency of stimulation was varied between the two groups. Their analysis showed a statistical improvement in two point discrimination tests for the high frequency group, and a statistical impairment of the same test on the low frequency group.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"/&gt;  This result brings an interesting possibility to light for the future of this technique; SS could be used to both recover lost sensory function, but also to dull [[chronic pain]].

===Activity-dependent plasticity and sensory stimulation therapy===
[[Activity-dependent plasticity]] refers the phenomenon by which neuronal connections changes via repetitive use. This form of plasticity has been utilized by neuro-rehabilitation clinics to help those recovering from strokes; for example The Taub Therapy Clinic uses a constraint induced therapy.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007"/&gt; This therapy focuses on stroke patients with limited function in a limb. The patient's good limb is constrained and the patient is directed through physical tasks of increasing difficulty to induce recovery of neural networks.

The [[American Heart Association|American Stroke Association]] published an article in 2005 by Sawaki ''et al.'' on the possible use of SS to supplement UDP therapies. They suspected that because of the importance of somatosensory information in movement, that enhancing [[sensory processing]] through SS could also improve UDP. Their experiment had two experimental groups; both groups were directed to complete voluntary movements with their thumb, and one group underwent 20 minutes of SS before the directed thumb movements. It was found that the paired participants had greater recovery of function.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"/&gt;

===Impact on cortical maps===
Cortical maps are the maps in which parts of our brain, such as the somatosensory system, are described. The cortical maps in our brains donât so much relate to our senses so much as it relates to our sense of physical touch. It has been found that the use of intensive training methods can be used to enlarge [[cortical map]]s for patients recovering from a stroke. Studies with that utilize fMRI and PET scans have shown that the degree of activation increases in the motor cortex of patients undergoing intensive therapies.&lt;ref name="Tegenthoff 2005"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tegenthoff M, Ragert P, Pleger B, etal |title=Improvement of tactile discrimination performance and enlargement of cortical somatosensory maps after 5 Hz rTMS |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=11 |pages=e362 |date=November 2005 | pmid=16218766 |pmc=1255742 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030362 |url=}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a strong support to the idea that plastic changes in the brain are a mechanism by which recovery can occur.

===Acupuncture and physiotherapy improving postural control===
Patients suffering from hemiparetic stroke&lt;ref name="Takahashi 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takahashi CD |author2=Reinkensmeyer DJ |title=Hemiparetic stroke impairs anticipatory control of arm movement |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=149 |issue=2 |pages=131â40 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12610680 |doi=10.1007/s00221-002-1340-1 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often lose their ability to stand upright and hold their posture on their own.. Without the ability to control our posture, we lose the ability to move freely and voluntarily, which is necessary for [[activities of daily living|activities of daily living (ADL)]]. Studies have been conducted to see if sensory stimulation could improve functionality after a stroke occurs.  The study compared two groups; a group undergoing standard physical therapy (group 1), and a group that was given sensory stimulation with [[acupuncture]], [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]], and ADL training (group 2). Both groups began the study within ten days of the initial stroke. Group 2 achieved stimulation via traditional Chinese acupuncture (10 needles), placed according to traditional Chinese acupuncture points and kept in place for 30 minutes. Alongside the manual stimulation, electric stimulation (2 to 5&amp;nbsp;Hz) was also given to four of the ten needles. The treatment continued for four to ten days, with an average of six and a half days. The twenty-one patients in group 2 had a mean age of 74.2 and the mean age of group 1 was 74.8. From the patients in group 2 which postural recordings could be made, 7 patients suffered from hemiparetic lesion on the left side and 10 had lesions on the right. Of the patients in group 1, 4 had lesion to the left side and 3 on the right. Upon testing, the subjects stood on a platform with their heels together and their arms crossed over their chests. The subjects were exposed to perturbations via vibratory stimulus on their calf muscles, which caused anteroposterior movement, or galvanic stimulation of the vestibular nerves, causing lateral movement. Three different tests were done, with patients eyes both open and closed.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Magnusson M |author2=Johansson K |author3=Johansson BB |title=Sensory stimulation promotes normalization of postural control after stroke |journal=Stroke |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=1176â80 |date=June 1994 |pmid=8202976 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.25.6.1176 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/25/6/1176.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of the study found that there were major differences in group 1, the control group, and group 2, the treatment group. More patients of the treatment group than the control group were able to maintain a healthy stance during perturbations. As both groups were being treated for post stroke symptoms, it was thought that these perturbations would enhance their posture and motor movements naturally. Among the subjects who survived 2 or more years after hemiparetic stroke, the treatment group (group 2), withheld better postural control. Furthermore, patients who had any additional sensory stimulation were comparable acquired values approaching the normal for age-matched healthy subjects when postural control was measured. The sensory stimulation tests enhanced at least partial recovery of postural function for up to 2 years after the stroke and treatment. After testing, it was deduced that improved recovery after sensory stimulation can be accomplished by patients regaining near normal dynamics of human postural control. Postural control is one of the most important issues in rehabilitation of stroke, thus concluding that sensory stimulation obtained from this study may enhance the functional plasticity of the brain.&lt;ref name="Magnusson 1994"/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Sensory Stimulation Therapy is a developing technique aimed at recovering sensory loss after strokes and restoring losses from ageing. It has not been proven that sensory stimulation therapy can actually improve brain plasticity, nor cognitive function. The paradigm of brain plasticity marked a fundamental change in the way that the brain is understood, and considered for future therapies.&lt;ref name="Doidge 2007" /&gt; SS takes advantage of this paradigm and the senses are presented with simple stimulation to cause changes inside the brain. In this particular situation a section of skin is stimulated either through electrical or physical means. Signals are sent through the peripheral nervous system to the somatosensory cortex.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2009" /&gt; These signals are then the impetus for changes inside the brain. It has been shown that the adjustment of frequency in this technique can be used to induce either Long Term Potentiation or Long Term Depression.&lt;ref name="Ragert 2008"/&gt; In the case of LTP as much as 30 years of sensory loss has been shown to be recoverable in relatively short time periods.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; SS has been paired with Use Dependant Plasticity training systems and it has been shown that enhanced recovery is produced from the combination.&lt;ref name="Sawaki 2006"/&gt; One of the striking advantages of this technique is that it is not necessary for the participant to pay attention to the stimulus in order to gain benefit from the therapy.&lt;ref name="Dinse 2006"/&gt; This technique opens many interesting doors for future therapies. A potential challenge for this technique is that there is little transfer of gains from one section of skin to another.

Many studies have been conducted, most with some kind of positive conclusion however, further studies need to be conducted sensory stimulation in dementia in order to prove or disprove any theories.&lt;ref name="Collier 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collier L |author2=McPherson K |author3=Ellis-Hill C |author4=Staal J |author5=Bucks R |title=Multisensory stimulation to improve functional performance in moderate to severe dementia--interim results |journal=Am J Alzheimers Dis Other Demen |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=698â703 |date=December 2010 |pmid=21131677 |doi=10.1177/1533317510387582 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''software metric''' is a standard of measure of a degree to which a [[software]] system or process possesses some property. Even if a metric is not a measurement (metrics are functions, while measurements are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics), often the two terms are used as synonyms. Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, there is a continuous effort by [[computer science]] practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development. The goal is obtaining objective, reproducible and quantifiable measurements, which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning, cost estimation, quality assurance, testing, software debugging, software performance optimization, and optimal personnel task assignments.

== Limitations ==
As software development is a complex process, with high variance on both methodologies and objectives, it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric, especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design. Another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter, and what they mean.&lt;ref name="integration_watch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="when_why_how"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolawa|first=Adam|title=When, Why, and How: Code Analysis|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/interviews/Code_Review.aspx|work=The Code Project|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The practical utility of software measurements has therefore been limited to the following domains:
* [[Schedule (project management)|Scheduling]]
* [[Software sizing]]
* [[Programming complexity]]
* [[Software development effort estimation]]
* [[Software quality]]

A specific measurement may target one or more of the above aspects, or the balance between them, for example as an indicator of team motivation or project performance.

== Acceptance and public opinion ==
Some software development practitioners point out that simplistic measurements can cause more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaner|first=Dr. Cem|title=Software Engineer Metrics: What do they measure and how do we know?|citeseerx=10.1.1.1.2542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have noted that metrics have become an integral part of the software development process.&lt;ref name="integration_watch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Binstock|first=Andrew|title=Integration Watch: Using metrics effectively|url=http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34157|work=SD Times|publisher=BZ Media |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Impact of measurement on programmer psychology have raised concerns for harmful effects to performance due to stress, performance anxiety, and attempts to cheat the metrics, while others find it to have positive impact on developers value towards their own work, and prevent them being undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectcodemeter.com/cost_estimation/images/files/PCMProManual.pdf |title=ProjectCodeMeter (2010) "ProjectCodeMeter Users Manual" page 65 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some argue that the definition of many measurement methodologies are imprecise, and consequently it is often unclear how tools for computing them arrive at a particular result,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=RÃ¼diger|last1=Lincke|first2=Jonas|last2=Lundberg|first3=Welf|last3=LÃ¶we|title=Comparing software metrics tools|year=2008|work=International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis 2008|pages=131â142|url=http://www.arisa.se/files/LLL-08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that imperfect quantification is better than none (âYou canât control what you can't measure.â).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = DeMarco | first = Tom | authorlink = Tom DeMarco | year = | title = Controlling Software Projects: Management, Measurement and Estimation | edition = | pages = | publisher = | isbn = 0-13-171711-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stereopsis recovery''', also '''recovery from stereoblindness''', is the phenomenon of a [[stereoblind]] person gaining partial or full ability of stereo vision ([[stereopsis]]).

Recovering stereo vision as far as possible has long been established as an approach to the therapeutic treatment of stereoblind patients. Treatment aims to recover stereo vision in very young children, as well as in patients who had acquired but lost their ability for stereopsis due to a medical condition. In contrast, this aim has normally not been present in the treatment of those who missed out on learning stereopsis during their first few years of life. In fact, the acquisition of binocular and stereo vision was long thought to be impossible unless the person acquired this skill during a [[critical period]] in infancy and early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite journal|author=Uri Polat|title=Restoration of underdeveloped cortical functions: Evidence from treatment of adult amblyopia|journal=Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience|volume=26|number=4-5|year=2008|pages=413â424}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis normally went unquestioned and has formed the basis for the therapeutic approaches to binocular disorders for decades. It has been put in doubt in recent years. In particular since studies on stereopsis recovery began to appear in scientific journals and it became publicly known that neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]] achieved stereopsis well into adulthood, that assumption is in retrospect considered to have held the status of a scientific [[dogma]].&lt;ref name="barry-2009"&gt;Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions''. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|978-0-465-02073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[â¦] The book's main contribution, however, is exposing the wrong-headed dogma that acuity and binocular vision can be restored only during a critical developmental period." â''New England Journal of Medicine''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[â¦] Part memoir and part science, ''Fixing My Gaze'' is a fitting tribute to the determination of a patient and her optometrist in challenging conventional wisdom and dogma." â''Journal of Behavioral Optometry''. (See introductory pages of: Susan R. Barry (2009) ''Fixing My Gaze.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrew T. Astle|author2=Paul V. McGraw|author3=Ben S. Webb|title=Myth exploded: Recovery of stereo acuity in adults with amblyopia|journal=BMJ Case Reports|year=2011|doi=10.1136/bcr.07.2010.3143|pmid=22707543|pmc=3062842|volume=2011|issue=feb21 2|pages=bcr0720103143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very recently, there has been a rise in scientific investigations into stereopsis recovery in adults and youths who have had no stereo vision before. While it has now been shown that an adult ''may'' gain stereopsis, it is currently not yet possible to predict how likely a stereoblind person is to do so, nor is there general agreement on the best therapeutic procedure. Also the possible implications for the treatment of children with [[infantile esotropia]] are still under study.

== Clinical management of strabismus and stereoblindness ==
In cases of acquired strabismus with [[double vision]] (diplopia), it is long-established state of the art to aim at curing the double vision and at the same time recovering a patient's earlier ability for stereo vision. For example, a patient may have had full stereo vision but later had diplopia due to a medical condition, losing stereo vision. In this case, medical interventions, including [[vision therapy]] and [[strabismus surgery]], may remove the double vision and recover the stereo vision which had temporarily been absent in the patient.

Also when children with congenital (infantile) strabismus (e.g. [[infantile esotropia]]) receive strabismus surgery within the first few years or two of their life, this goes along with the hope that they may yet develop their full potential for [[binocular vision]] including stereopsis.

In contrast, in a case where a child's eyes are straightened surgically after the age of about five or six years and the child had no opportunity to develop stereo vision in early childhood, normally the clinical expectation is that this intervention will lead to cosmetic improvements but not to stereo vision. Conventionally, no follow-up for stereopsis was performed in such cases.

For instance, one author summarized the accepted scientific view of the time with the words: "Stereopsis will never be obtained unless [[amblyopia]] is treated, the eyes are aligned, and binocular fusion and function are achieved before the critical period for stereopsis ends. Clinical data suggest that this occurs before 24 months of age,[â¦] but we do not know exactly when it occurs, because crucial pieces of basic science information are missing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nigel W. Daw|title=Critical Periods and Amblyopia|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology: Mechanisms of Ophthalmic Disease|date=April 1998|volume=116|number=4|pages=502â505|doi=10.1001/archopht.116.4.502}}&lt;/ref&gt; For purposes of illustration, reference is made to a book of doctors' handouts for patients, written for the general public and published in 2002, which summarizes the limitations in the terms in which they, at the time, were fully accepted as [[Medical consensus|medical state of the art]] as follows: "If an adult has a childhood strabismus that was never treated, it is too late to improve any amblyopia or [[depth perception]], so the goal may be simply cosmetic â to make the eyes appear to be properly aligned â though sometimes treatment does enlarge the extent of side vision."&lt;ref&gt;Melvin L. Rubin, Lawrence A. Winograd: ''Taking Care of Your Eyes: A Collection of the Patient Information Handouts Used by America's Leading Eye Doctors'', Triad Records (September 2002), {{ISBN|978-0937404614}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been accepted very recently that the therapeutic approach was based on an unquestioned notion that has, since, been referred to as "myth" or "dogma".&lt;ref name="astle-etal-2011a"/&gt;

Recently, however, stereopsis recovery is known to have occurred in a number of adults. While this has in some cases occurred after visual exercises or spontaneous visual experiences, recently also the medical community's view of strabismus surgery has become more optimistic with regard to outcomes in terms of binocular function and possibly stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Dickmann|author2=S. Aliberti|author3=M.T. Rebecchi|author4=I. Aprile|author5=A. Salerni|author6=S. Petroni|author7=R. Parrilla|author8=V. Perrotta|author9=E. Di Nardo|author10=E. Balestrazzi|title=Improved sensory status and quality-of-life measures in adult patients after strabismus surgery|journal=Journal of AAPOS|date=February 2013|volume=17|number=1|pages=25â28|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2012.09.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one author states:
:"The majority of adults will experience some improvement in binocular function after strabismus surgery even if the strabismus has been longstanding. Most commonly this takes the form of an expansion of binocular visual fields; however, some patients may also regain stereopsis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The efficacy of strabismus surgery in adults: a review for primary care physicians|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=April 2011|volume=87|number=1026|pages=269â273|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2010.108670}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific investigations on residual [[neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] in adulthood now also include studies on the recovery of stereopsis. Now it is a matter of active scientific investigation under which conditions and to which degree binocular fusion and stereo vision can be acquired in adulthood, especially if the person is not known to have had any preceding experience of stereo vision, and how outcomes may depend on the patient's history of therapeutic interventions.

== Examples and case studies ==
[[File:9.13.09OliverSacksByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|[[Oliver Sacks]] was the first to make the story of Susan Barry, whom he nicknamed "Stereo Sue", known to the general public.]]
Stereopsis recovery has been reported to have occurred in a few adults as a result of either medical treatments including [[strabismus surgery]] and [[vision therapy]], or spontaneously after a stereoscopic [[3D cinema]] experience.

=== Personal reports in ''Fixing my Gaze'' ===
The most renowned case of regained stereopsis is that of neuroscientist [[Susan R. Barry]], who had had alternating [[infantile esotropia]] with [[diplopia]], but no amblyopia, underwent three [[Strabismus surgery|surgical corrections]] in childhood without achieving binocular vision at the time, and recovered from stereoblindness in adult age after [[vision therapy]] with optometrist Theresa Ruggiero. Barry's case has been reported on by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]].&lt;ref name="sacks-2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Sacks|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/06/19/060619fa_fact_sacks |title=Stereo Sue: Why two eyes are better than one|journal=The New Yorker|date=19 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[David H. Hubel]], winner of the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Torsten Wiesel]] for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system, commented positively on her case.&lt;ref name="barry-2009-p138-140"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', 2009, pages 138-140&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Barry published a book ''Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey into Seeing in Three Dimensions'', reporting on her own and several other cases of stereopsis recovery.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;

In her book ''Fixing my Gaze'', Susan Barry gives a detailed description of her surprise, elation and subsequent experiences when her stereo vision suddenly set in.

Hubel wrote of her book:
{{Quote box|âIt has been widely thought that an adult, cross-eyed since infancy, could never acquire stereovision, but to everyone's surprise, Barry succeeded. In ''Fixing my Gaze'', she describes how wonderful it was to have, step-by-step, this new 3D world revealed to her. And as a neurobiologist she is able to discuss the science as an expert, in simple language.â|source=David H. Hubel, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine, John Franklin Enders Professor of Neurobiology, Emeritus, Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name="barry-2009"/&gt;}}

Her book includes reports of further persons who have had similar experiences with stereopsis recovery. Barry cites the personal experiences of several persons,&lt;!--Comment: the names ofpatients and their optometrists are purposely not listed here in Wikipedia out of respect of their privacy as ordinary people who may not wish to have their names retrieved by search engines, and the names make no difference to the message here--&gt; including a man who was an artist and described his experience of seeing with stereopsis as "that he could see one hundred more times [[negative space]]",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been amblyopic before seeing in 3D described how empty space now "looks and feels palpable, tangibleâalive!",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who had been strabismic since age two and saw in 3D after taking vision therapy and stated that "The coolest thing is the feeling you get being âin the dimensionâ",&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', page 124&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who felt quite alarmed at the experience of suddenly seeing roadside trees and signs [[looming]] towards her,&lt;ref&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; and two women who experienced an abrupt onset of stereo vision with a wide-angled view of the world, the first stating: "I was able to take in so much more of the room than I did before" and the second: "It was very dramatic as my [[peripheral vision]] suddenly filled in on both sides".&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"&gt;Susan R. Barry: ''Fixing my Gaze'', pages 129-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Common to Barry and at least one person on whom she had reported is the finding that also their [[Visual space|mental representation of space]] changed after having acquired stereo vision: that even with one eye closed the feeling is to see "more" than seeing with one eye closed before recovering stereopsis.&lt;ref name="barry-p129-131"/&gt;

=== Further cases in the media ===
Apart from Barry, another formerly stereoblind adult whose acquired ability for stereopsis has received media attention is neuroscientist Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]], who had grown up nearly stereoblind and acquired stereo vision spontaneously in 2012 at the age of 67, when watching the 3D movie [[Hugo (movie)|Hugo]] with polarizing 3D glasses. The scene suddenly appeared to him in depth, and the ability to see the world in stereo stayed with him also after leaving the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Morgen Peck: [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-awoken-from-a-2d-world/all How a movie changed one manâs vision forever], BBC Future, 19 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry B.

== Recent scientific investigations ==

=== Post-surgical stereopsis ===
Certain conditions are known to be a prerequisite for stereo vision, for instance, that the amount of horizontal deviation, if any is present, needs to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David A. Leske|author2=Jonathan M. Holmes|title=Maximum angle of horizontal strabismus consistent with true stereopsis|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=8|number=1|date=February 2004|pages=28â34|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2003.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several studies it has been recognized that surgery to correct strabismus can have the effect of improving binocular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John D.

Among the investigations into post-surgical stereopsis is a publication of 2005 that reported on a total of 43 adults over 18 years of age who had surgical correction after having lived with from constant-horizontal strabismus for more than 10 years with no previous surgery or stereopsis, with visual acuity of 20/40 or more also in the deviating eye; in this group, stereopsis was present in 80% of exotropes and 31% of esotropes, with the recovery of stereopsis and stereoacuity being uncorrelated to the number of years the deviation had persisted.&lt;ref name="kim-etal-2005"/&gt; A study that was published 2006 included, aside an extensive review of investigations on stereopsis recovery of the last decades, a re-evaluation of all those patients who had had congenital or early-onset strabismus with a large constant horizontal divergence and had undergone strabismus surgery in the years 1997â1999 in a given clinic, excluding those who had a history of neurologic or systemic diseases or with organic retinal diseases. Among the resulting 36 subjects aged 6â30 years, many had regained binocular vision (56% according to an evaluation with [[Bagolini Striated Glasses Test|Bagolini striated glasses]], 39% with Titmus test, 33% with [[Worth 4 dot test|Worth 4-dot]] test, and 22% with Random dot E test) and 57% had stereoacuity of 200 [[Second of arc|sec of arc]] of better, leading to the conclusion that some degrees of stereopsis can be achieved even in cases of infantile or early-childhood strabism.&lt;ref name="gharabaghi-azadeh-2006"/&gt; Another study âfound that some chronically strabismic adults with good vision could recover fusion and stereopsis by means of surgical alignment.&lt;ref name="fatima-etal-2009"/&gt;

In contrast, in a study in which a group of 17 adults and older children of at least 8 years of age, all of whom received strabismus surgery and post-operative evaluation after long-standing untreated [[infantile esotropia]], most showed binocular fusion when tested with Bagolini lenses and an increased [[visual field]], but none demonstrated stereo fusion or stereopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anthony David Neil Murray|author2=Jane Orpen|author3=Carolyn Calcutt|title=Changes in the functional binocular status of older children and adults with previously untreated infantile esotropia following late surgical realignment|journal=Journal of American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus|volume=11|number=2|date=April 2007|pages=125â130|doi=10.1016/j.jaapos.2006.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stereoacuity]] is limited by the [[visual acuity]] of the eyes, and in particular by the visual acuity of the weaker eye. That is, the more a patient's vision of any one of the two eyes is degraded compared to the 20/20 vision standard, the lower are the prospects of improving or re-gaining stereo vision, unless visual acuity itself were improved by other means. Strabismus surgery itself does not improve visual acuity.

=== Stereopsis following training procedures ===
[[Eye exercises|Orthoptic exercises]] have proven to be effective for reducing symptoms in patients with convergence insufficiency and decompensating [[exophoria]] by improving the near-point convergence of the eyes that is necessary for binocular fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Aziz|author2=M. Cleary|author3=H.K. Stewart|author4=C.R. Weir|title=Are orthoptic exercises an effective treatment for convergence and fusion deficiencies?|journal=Strabismus|date=December 2006|volume=14|number=|pages=183â189|pmid=17162439|doi=10.1080/09273970601026185|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments on monkeys, published 2007, revealed improvements in stereoacuity in monkeys who, after having been raised with binocular deptivation through prisms for the first two years, were exposed to extensive psychophysical training. Their stereo vision recovered in part, but remained far more limited than that of normally raised monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Nakatsuka|title=Effects of Perceptual Learning on Local Stereopsis and Neuronal Responses of V1 and V2 in Prism-Reared Monkeys|journal=AJP: Journal of Neurophysiology|date=April 2007|volume=97|number=4|pages=2612â2626|doi=10.1152/jn.01001.2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] have stated that [[perceptual learning]] appears to play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dennis M. Levi|title=Perceptual learning in adults with amblyopia: A reevaluation of critical periods in human vision|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume=46|number=3|pages=222â232|date=April 2005|doi=10.1002/dev.20050}}&lt;/ref&gt; One investigation, published 2011, reported on a study on human stereopsis recovery using [[perceptual learning]] which was inspired by Barry's work. In this study, a small number of stereoblind subjects who had initially been stereoblind or stereoanomalous recovered stereopsis using perceptual learning exercises. Alongside the scientific assessment of the extent of recovery, also the subjective outcomes are described: "After achieving stereopsis, our observers reported that the depth âpopped out,â which they found very helpful and joyful in their everyday life. The anisometropic observer GD noticed âa surge in depthâ one day when shopping in a supermarket. While playing table tennis, she feels that she is able to track a ping-pong ball more accurately and therefore can play better. Strabismic observer AB is more confident now when walking down stairs because she can judge the depth of the steps better. Strabismics AB, DP, and LR, are able to enjoy 3D movies for the first time, and strabismic GJ finds it easier to catch a fly ball while playing baseball."&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011a"/&gt; In a follow-up study, the authors of this study pointed out that the stereopsis that was recovered following perceptual learning was more limited in resolution and precision compared to normal subjects' stereopsis.&lt;ref name="ding-levi-2011b"/&gt; [[Dennis M.

[[File:Emacs Tetris vector based detail.svg|upright|thumb|[[Tetris]] is a popular video game from the 1980s. A modified version of the game (not shown here) has been used for dichoptic training.]]
There have been several attempts to make use of modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating [[amblyopia]] and [[Suppression (eye)|interocular suppression]]. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the [[cheiroscope]], which is a [[haploscope]] in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a drawing pad, and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on [[dichoptic presentation]] of the elements of a [[video game]] or [[virtual reality]] such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.

One of the earliest systems of this kind has been proposed by a research group in the [[University of Nottingham]] with the aim of treating amblyopia, using virtual reality masks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2003092482A1?hl=en Patent WO2003092482 A1 Ocular display apparatus for assessment and measurement of and for treatment of ocular disorders, and methods therefor], priority date 4 May 2002, publication date 13 November 2003, Isabel Ash et al.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eastgate-etal-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eastgate RM, Griffiths GD, Waddingham PE, Moody AD, Butler TK, Cobb SV, Comaish IF, Haworth SM, Gregson RM, Ash IM, Brown SM |title=Modified virtual reality technology for treatment of amblyopia |journal=Eye (London, England) |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=370â4 | date=March  2006 |pmid=15832182 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701882 |url= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|author=Gareth Mitchell|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4849244.stm|journal=BBC News|title=Video games tackle 'lazy eye'|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or commercially available [[Active shutter 3D system|3D shutter glasses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

Another system of dichoptic presentation for binocular vision therapy has been proposed by researchers of the Research Institute of the [[McGill University]] Health Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/WO2009053917A1?hl=en Patent WO 2009053917 A1 Binocular vision assessment and/or therapy], priority date 23 October 2007, publication date 30 April 2009, Robert F.

Clinical supervision of such procedures is required to ensure that double vision does not occur. Most of the patients who underwent this treatment gained improved visual acuity of the weaker eye, and some also showed increased stereoacuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Black JM, Hess RF, Cooperstock JR, To L, Thompson B |title=The measurement and treatment of suppression in amblyopia |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|volume= |issue=70 |pages=e3927 |year=2012 |pmid=23271400 |pmc=3575204 |doi=10.3791/3927 |url= |issn=}} (with video clip explaining the procedure)&lt;/ref&gt; Another study performed at the same institute showed that dichoptic training can be more effective in adults than the more conventional amblyopia treatment of an [[eye patch]]. For this investigation, 18 adults played the game Tetris for one hour each day, half of the group wearing eye patches and the other half playing a dichoptic version of the game. After two weeks, the group who played dichoptically showed a significant improvement of vision in the weaker eye and in stereopsis acuity; the eye patch group had moderate improvements, which increased substantially after they, too, were given the dichoptic training afterwards.&lt;ref name="li-etal-2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jinrong Li|author2=Benjamin Thompson|author3=Daming Deng|author4=Lily Y.L.

{{Statistical mechanics}}
'''Stochastic thermodynamics''' is an emergent field of research in [[statistical mechanics]] that uses [[stochastic process|stochastic variables]] to better understand the [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium dynamics]] present in microscopic systems such as [[Colloid|colloidal particles]], [[biopolymer]]s (e.g. [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]]s), [[enzymes]], [[molecular motors]] and many other types of systems.{{efn|See {{harvp|Seifert|2008}},{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=347}} {{harvp|Seifert|2012}}{{sfnm|1a1=Bertini et al.|1y=2015|1p=4|2a1=Bechinger et al.|2y=2016|2p=45}} and {{harvp|Jarzynski|2011}}{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Seifert|2y=2012|2p=10|3a1=Bechinger et al.|3y=2016|3p=45}} for academic review articles of stochastic thermodynamics.}}{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=7}}

==Overview==
When a microscopic machine (e.g. a [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEM]]) performs [[useful work]] it generates [[heat]] and [[entropy]] as a byproduct of the process, however it is also predicted that this machine will operate in "reverse" or "backwards" over appreciable short periods. That is, heat energy from the surroundings will be converted into useful work. For larger engines, this would be described as a violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], as entropy is consumed rather than generated. [[Loschmidt's paradox]]{{sfn|Loschmidt|1876}} states that in a time reversible system, for every trajectory there exists a time-reversed anti-trajectory. As the entropy production of a trajectory and its equal anti-trajectory are of identical magnitude but opposite sign, then, so the argument goes, one cannot prove that entropy production is positive.{{sfn|Wang et al.|2002|p=050601-1}}

For a long time, exact results in thermodynamics were only possible in linear systems capable of reaching equilibrium, leaving other questions like the Loschmidt paradox unsolved. During the last few decades fresh approaches have revealed general laws applicable to non-equilibrium system which are described by nonlinear equations, pushing the range of exact thermodynamic statements beyond the realm of traditional linear solutions. These exact results are particularly relevant for small systems where appreciable (typically non-Gaussian) fluctuations occur. Thanks to stochastic thermodynamics it is now possible to accurately predict distribution functions of thermodynamic quantities relating to exchanged heat, applied work or entropy production for these systems.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

===Fluctuation theorem===
{{main|Fluctuation theorem}}
The mathematical resolution to Loschmidt's paradox is called the (steady state) fluctuation theorem (FT), which is a generalisation of the second law of thermodynamics. The FT shows that as a system gets larger or the trajectory duration becomes longer, entropy-consuming trajectories become more unlikely, and the expected second law behaviour is recovered. The FT was first put forward by {{harvp|Evans et al.|1993}}{{sfnm|1a1=Gerstner|1y=2002|2a1=Wang et al.|2y=2002|2p=1|3a1=Seifert|3y=2008|3p=1|4a1=Seifert|4y=2012|4p=6|5a1=Jarzynski|5y=2011|5p=331|6a1=Campisi et al.|6y=2011|6p=3}} and much of the work done in developing and extending the theorem was accomplished by theoreticians and mathematicians interested in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.{{efn|Evan's original numerical analysis was shown heuristically and related to a thermostatted shear-driven fluid in contact with a heat bath. It was later mathematically proven for a large class of systems using concepts from [[Chaos theory|chaotic dynamics]] by {{harvp|Gallavotti|Cohen|1995}}, for driven [[Langevin dynamics]] by {{harvp|Kurchan|1998}} and for driven [[Diffusion|diffusive dynamic]]s by {{harvp|Lebowitz|Spohn|1999}}. A variant, a transient fluctuation theorem valid for relaxation towards the steady state was later found by {{harvp|Evans|Searles|1994}}.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}} }}{{sfn|Wang et al.|2002|p=050601-1}}

The first observation and experimental proof of Evan's fluctuation theorem (FT) was performed by {{harvp|Wang et al.|2002}}{{sfnm|2a1=Gerstner|2y=2002|1a1=Chalmers|1y=2002|3a1=Whitehouse|3y=2002}}

===Jarzynski equality===
{{main|Jarzynski equality}}
A recent review states that {{harvs|txt|last1=Jarzynski|year1=1997a|year2=1997b}} "proved a remarkable relation which allows to express the free energy difference between two equilibrium systems by a nonlinear average over the work required to drive the system in a non-equilibrium process from one state to the other. By comparing probability distributions for the work spent in the original process with the time-reversed one, Crooks found a ârefinementâ of the Jarzynski relation (JR), now called the Crooks fluctuation theorem. Both, this relation and another refinement of the JR, the Hummer-Szabo relation became particularly useful for determining free energy differences and landscapes of biomolecules. These relations are the most prominent ones within a class of exact results (some of which found even earlier and then rediscovered) valid for non-equilibrium systems driven by time-dependent forces. A close analogy to the JR, which relates different equilibrium states, is the Hatano-Sasa relation that applies to transitions between two different non-equilibrium steady states". {{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=2}}

This is shown to be a special case of a more general relation.

===Stochastic energetics===

==History==
Classical thermodynamics, at its heart, deals with general laws governing the transformations of a system, in particular, those involving the exchange of heat, work and matter with an environment. As a central result, total entropy production is identified that in any such process can never decrease, leading, inter alia, to fundamental limits on the efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

The thermodynamic characterisation of systems in equilibrium got its microscopic justification from equilibrium statistical mechanics which states that for a system in contact with a heat bath the probability to find it in any specific microstate is given by the Boltzmann factor. For small deviations from equilibrium, linear response theory allows to express transport properties caused by small external fields through equilibrium correlation functions. On a more phenomenological level, linear irreversible thermodynamics provides a relation between such transport coefficients and entropy production in terms of forces and fluxes. Beyond this linear response regime, for a long time, no universal exact results were available.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

During the last 20 years fresh approaches have revealed general laws applicable to non-equilibrium system thus pushing the range of validity of exact thermodynamic statements beyond the realm of linear response deep into the genuine non-equilibrium region. These exact results, which become particularly relevant for small systems with appreciable (typically non-Gaussian) fluctuations, generically refer to distribution functions of thermodynamic quantities like exchanged heat, applied work or entropy production.{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=6}}

Stochastic thermodynamics combines the stochastic energetics introduced by {{harvp|Sekimoto|1998}}{{sfn|Seifert|2008|p=1}} with the idea that entropy can consistently be assigned to a single fluctuating trajectory.{{sfn|Seifert|2008|p=1}}

==Open research==
===Quantum stochastic thermodynamics===
{{main|Quantum thermodynamics}}
&lt;!--[[File:Microreversibility for non autonomous quantum systems.png|thumb|right|286x286px|Using the mathematical definitions of non-equilibrium quantum mechanical work it is possible describe work fluctuation relations in certain quantum systems. The principle of micro-reversibility holds for quantum systems in much the same way for the classical case: but not only must the momenta be inverted (applying Î - the quantum mechanical time reversal operator) but also the temporal sequence of Hamiltonian values.{{sfn|Campisi et al.|2011|p=10}}]]--&gt;
Stochastic thermodynamics can be applied to driven (i.e. open) [[open quantum system|quantum systems]] whenever the effects of [[quantum coherence]] can be ignored. The dynamics of an open quantum system is then equivalent to a classical stochastic one.  However, this is sometimes at the cost of requiring unrealistic measurements at the beginning and end of a process.{{efn|name=quantum|See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=9}} }}{{sfn|Seifert|2012|p=9}}

Understanding non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics more broadly is an important and active area of research. The efficiency of some computing and information theory tasks can be greatly enhanced when using [[Quantum correlation|quantum correlated]] states; quantum correlations can be used not as a valuable resource in quantum computation, but also in the realm of quantum thermodynamics.{{sfn|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009|p=6}} New types of quantum devices in non-equilibrium states function very differently to their classical counterparts.  For example, it has been theoretically shown that non-equilibrium quantum ratchet systems function far more efficiently then that predicted by classical thermodynamics.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Yukawa et al.|1997}}, {{harvp|Reimann et al.|1997}}, {{harvp|Tatara et al.|1998}}{{sfn|Yukawa|2000|p=1}} }}{{sfn|Yukawa|2000|p=1}}  It has also been shown that [[quantum coherence]] can be used to enhance the efficiency of systems beyond the classical [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. This is because it could be possible to extract work, in the form of photons, from a single heat bath. Quantum coherence can be used in effect to play the role of [[Maxwell's demon]]{{sfn|Maruyama et al.|2009|p=20}} though it should be emphasized that the broader information theory based interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics is not violated.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Scully|2001}},{{sfnm|1a1=Horodecki et al.|1y=2009|1p=80|2a1=Maruyama et al.|2y=2009|2p=20}}
{{harvp|Scully et al.|2003}},{{sfn|Maruyama et al.|2009|p=20}} {{harvp|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009}},{{sfn|Modi et al.|2012|p=43}} {{harvp|RoÃnagel et al.|2014}},{{Sfnm|1a1=Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet Mainz|1y=2014|2a1=Zyga|2y=2014}} and {{harvp|RoÃnagel et al.|2016}}{{sfn|Cartlidge|2015}} }}{{sfn|Dillenschneider|Lutz|2009|pp=5-6}}

Quantum versions of stochastic thermodynamics have been studied for some time{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Yukawa|2000}}{{sfnm|1a1=Esposito et al.|1y=2009|1p=2|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348|3a1=Campisi et al.|3y=2011|3p=8}}  and {{harvp|Mukamel|2003}}{{sfnm|1a1=Esposito et al.|1y=2009|1p=2, 8|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348|3a1=Campisi et al.|3y=2011|3p=13}} }} and the past few years have seen a surge of interest in this topic.{{efn|name=quantum}} Quantum mechanics involves profound issues around the interpretation of reality (e.g. the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], [[many-worlds]], [[de Broglie-Bohm theory]] etc are all competing interpretations that try to explain the unintuitive results of quantum theory) . It is hoped that by trying to specify the quantum-mechanical definition of work, dealing with open quantum systems, analyzing exactly solvable models, or proposing and performing experiments to test non-equilibrium predictions,{{efn| See for example {{harvp|Huber et al.|2008}}{{sfnm|1a1=Campisi et al.|1y=2011|1p=16|2a1=Jarzynski|2y=2011|2p=348}} and {{harvp|An et al.|2014}}{{sfn|RoÃnagel et al.|2016|p=1}} }} important insights into the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the true nature of reality will be gained.{{sfn|Jarzynski|2011|p=348}}

Applications of non-equilibrium work relations, like the Jarzynski equality, have recently been proposed for the purposes of detectiing [[quantum entanglement]] {{harv|Hide|Vedral|2010}} and to improving optimization problems (minimize or maximize a function of multivariables called the [[Loss function|cost function]]) via [[quantum annealing]] {{harv|Ohzeki|Nishimori|2011}}.{{sfn|Jarzynski|2011|p=348}}

===Active baths===
&lt;!--[[File:Active particles herd the passive particles favouring the formation of metastable clusters.png|thumb|286x286px|left|An experiment by {{harvp|KÃ¼mmel et al.|2015}} demonstrating that the dynamics and properties of passive particles are strongly influenced by adding a very small number of active particles. Active particle herd around passive particles favouring the formation of metastable clusters.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=26}}]]--&gt;
Until recently thermodynamics has only considered systems coupled to a thermal bath and, therefore, satisfying [[Boltzmann statistics]]. However, systems satisfying these conditions do not include many systems that are far from equilibrium such as living matter, for which fluctuations are expected to be [[Gaussian function|non-Gaussian]].{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=45}}

Active particle systems are able to take energy from their environment and drive themselves far from equilibrium. An important example of active matter is constituted by objects capable of self propulsion. Thanks to this property, they feature a series of novel behaviours that are not attainable by matter at thermal equilibrium, including, for example, swarming and the emergence of other collective properties.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=2}} A passive particle is considered in an active bath when it is in an environment where a wealth of active particles are present. These particles will exert nonthermal forces on the passive object so that it will experience non-thermal fluctuations and will behave widely different from a passive Brownian particle in a thermal bath. The presence of an active bath can significantly influence the microscopic thermodynamics of a particle. Experiments have suggested that the Jarzynski equality does not hold in some cases due to the presence of non-Boltzmann statistics in active baths.{{efn|See for example {{harvp|Argun et al.|2016}}{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=12, 26, 45}} }} This observation points towards a new direction in the study of non-equilibrium statistical physics and stochastic thermodynamics, where also the environment itself is far from equilibrium.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=26}}

Active baths are a question of particular importance in biochemistry. For example, biomolecules within cells are coupled with an active bath due to the presence of molecular motors within the cytoplasm, which leads to striking and largely not yet understood phenomena such as the emergence of anomalous diffusion (Barkai et al., 2012). Also, protein folding might be facilitated by the presence of active fluctuations (Harder et al., 2014b) and active matter dynamics could play a central role in several biological functions (Mallory et al., 2015; Shin et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015). It is an open question to what degree stochastic thermodynamics can be applied to systems coupled to active baths.{{sfn|Bechinger et al.|2016|p=45}}

'''Thermal destratification''' is the process of mixing the internal air in a building to eliminate stratified layers and achieve [[temperature]] equalization throughout the [[building envelope]]. 

== Thermal stratification in buildings ==
Destratification is the reverse of the natural process of thermal stratification, which is the layering of differing (normally rising) air temperatures from floor to ceiling. Stratification is caused by hot air rising up to the ceiling or roof space because it is lighter than the surrounding cooler air. Conversely, cool air falls to the floor as it is heavier than the surrounding warmer air.

In a stratified building, temperature differentials of up to 1.5Â°C per vertical foot is common, and the higher a building's ceiling, the more extreme this temperature differential can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esta.org.uk/RESOURCES/PUBLICATIONS/documents/DRUMBEATWHITEPAPER-ThermalDestratificationInBuildings.pdf|title=Thermal Destratification in Buildings: The missing piece to the HVAC puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=www.esta.org.uk|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, temperature differentials of 10Â°C have been found over a height of 1 meter. Other variables that influence the level of thermal stratification include heat generated by people and processes present in the building, insulation of the space from outside weather conditions, solar gain, specification of the HVAC system, location of supply and return ducts, and vertical air movement inside the space, usually supplied by destratification fans. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] can be used to predict the level of stratification in a space.

=== Effects of thermal stratification ===
In a study conducted by the Building Scientific Research Information Association, the wasted energy due to stratification increased consistently based on temperature differential from floor to ceiling (ÎT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://p.airiusfans.com/bsria-study|title=Wasted Energy Due to Stratification|author=BSRIA|website=|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that stratified buildings tend to overheat or overcool based on the temperature at the thermostat, which tends to be lower than the overall heat energy present in the room. The study also showed that energy waste due to stratification was present at ceiling heights ranging from 20 ft. to 40 ft, and higher ceilings caused higher energy waste, even at the same ÎT. Since ÎT tends to be higher in taller ceilings, the effect of stratification is compounded, causing substantial energy waste in tall buildings.

=== Definition of destratification ===
Since stratification and the costs associated with it are linear, the definition of destratification will differ based on opinion and use case. Full destratification, or a 0Â° ÎT from floor to ceiling, is unlikely to occur in any building. Since the costs of stratification decrease linearly as ÎT approaches 5.4Â°F, and no study has yet looked at the effects of stratification below 5.4Â°F, it is not uncommon to consider any space with a ÎT below 5Â°F to be destratified. In the United States, [[ASHRAE]] Standard 55 prescribes 3Â°C as the limit for the vertical air temperature difference between head and ankle levels, but has no standard recommending an ideal ÎT between floor and ceiling.&lt;ref name="ashrae55"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard 55-2004 -- Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy ([[ANSI]] Approved)|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destratification technologies ==
Reducing thermal stratification can be accomplished by controlling the variables that are associated with increased stratification. Since many of the variables, including ceiling height, people and processes, solar gain, and outside weather conditions cannot be controlled, the most common technologies used are related to the building's [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|HVAC]] (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system. One of the cheapest, most effective, and easiest to install technologies are destratification fans, including both axial destratification fans and [[High-volume low-speed fan|HVLS]] (high-volume low-speed) fans.

=== Axial destratification fans ===
Axial destratification fans are self-contained units that are installed in an array at the ceiling with the goal of blowing conditioned air in the ceiling down to the floor, where people live and work. Because axial fans are designed to blow air straight down at the floor, they can be used in ceiling and roof structures over 100 ft. tall. Because axial destratification fans can achieve destratification with low CFMs, it is imperative that the air leaving the nozzle achieve an air speed at the floor of between 0.2 and 0.5 m/s. The result of this level of air movement is the integration of conditioned air from the ceiling with air at the floor level. Failing to impact the floor will result in destratification of medial layers of air but not achieve destratification at the floor. Since the area around the thermostat will not be destratified in this instance, it is hypothesized that there will be little or no cost savings, as the thermostat will continue to overheat or overcool the room.

An experiment in a room with a 21 ft. ceiling yielded a savings of 23.5% with the use of axial destratification fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://airiusfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Canada-Case-Study-Warm-Cold-Compiled.pdf|title=Cold Weather Destratification Energy Evaluation|publisher=Enbridge|date=June 2017|website=|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HVLS fans ===
Because of their size, HVLS fans are normally installed in new construction, rather than retrofits, as the roof structure may have to be redesigned to accommodate the increased weight and size. It's not uncommon to require the relocation of lights, due to strobing as large fan blades pass under them, and sprinkler systems, which typically require unobstructed access to the floor to meet fire code. When used in the summer to encourage [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative cooling]], HVLS fans are run forward, blowing air at the floor. When used for destratification in the winter, the fans are run in reverse, blowing air towards ceiling which then circulates around the room. The height at which HVLS fans can be effective is limited compared to axial destratification fans.

== Benefits of destratification ==

This method has the most benefits through its application in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) industry and in heating and cooling for buildings and it has been found that "stratification is the single biggest waste of energy in buildings today."&lt;ref name=uon&gt;{{cite web|title=Mansfield Anodisers|url=https://nottingham.ac.uk/etc/cs-mansfieldanodisers.php|work=Case studies|publisher=Environmental Technology Centre, [[University of Nottingham]]|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== For reducing energy consumption ===
By incorporating thermal destratification technology into buildings, energy requirements are reduced as heating systems are no longer over-delivering in order to constantly replace the heat that rises away from the floor area, by redistributing the already heated air from the unoccupied ceiling space back down to floor level, until temperature equalisation is achieved. With regards to cooling destratification systems ensure the cooled air supplied is circulated fully and distributed evenly throughout internal environments, eliminating hot and cold spots and satisfying thermostats for longer periods of time.  As a result, destratification technology has great potential for carbon emission reductions due to the reduced energy requirement, and is in turn capable of cutting costs for businesses, sometimes by up to 50%.&lt;ref name="airius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study - Lush Retail Ltd|url=http://www.airius.co.uk/case-studies/lush/|publisher=Airius|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by [[The Carbon Trust]] which recommends destratification in buildings as one of its top three methods to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficient heating|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/faqs/technology-and-energy-saving/energy-efficient-heating|publisher=Carbon trust|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For comfort ===
Destratification naturally increases air movement at the floor, reducing "hot spots" and "cold spots" in a room. It can be used in typically cold areas, like grocery store freezer cases, to warm patrons shopping nearby. In addition, air movement from destratification fans can be used to help meet ASHRAE Standard 62.1 by increasing the amount of air movement at the floor.

A '''toxidrome''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[toxic]]'' and ''[[syndrome]]'') is a syndrome caused by a dangerous level of [[toxin]]s in the body. The term was coined in 1970 by Mofenson and Greensher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the consequence of a drug [[overdose]].  Common [[symptom]]s include [[dizziness]], [[disorientation]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], and [[oscillopsia]].  A toxidrome may indicate a [[medical emergency]] requiring treatment at a [[poison control center]].  Aside from [[poison]]ing, a systemic [[infection]] may also lead to a toxidrome. "Classic" toxidromes are presented below, but they are often variable&lt;ref name = Goldfrank&gt;{{cite book

==Anticholinergic==&lt;!-- section is linked from [[Atropine]] --&gt;
The symptoms of an [[anticholinergic]] toxidrome include blurred vision, [[coma]], decreased [[bowel]] sounds, [[delirium]], dry [[skin]], [[fever]], [[Flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[hallucination]]s, [[ileus]], [[memory loss]], [[mydriasis]] (dilated [[pupils]]), [[myoclonus]], [[psychosis]], [[seizure]]s, and [[urinary retention]].  [[Complication (medicine)|Complication]]s include [[hypertension]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include  [[antihistamine]]s, [[antipsychotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[antiparkinsonian]] drugs, [[atropine]], [[benztropine]], [[datura]], and [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]].&lt;ref name="firstaid" /&gt;

==Cholinergic==
The symptoms of a cholinergic toxidrome include [[bronchorrhea]], [[confusion]], [[defecation]], [[diaphoresis]], [[diarrhea]], [[emesis]], [[lacrimation]], [[miosis]], [[muscle fasciculation]]s, [[salivation]], [[seizure]]s, [[urination]], and weakness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypothermia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[carbamate]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[organophosphate]]s.

==Hallucinogenic==
The symptoms of a hallucinogenic toxidrome include [[disorientation]], [[hallucination]]s, hyperactive bowel sounds, [[panic]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[tachypnea]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[substituted amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], and [[phencyclidine]].

==Opiate==
The symptoms of an opiate toxidrome include the classic triad of [[coma]], [[miosis|pinpoint pupils]], and [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]]&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt; as well as [[Altered state of consciousness|altered mental state]]s, [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[pulmonary edema]] and unresponsiveness.  Complications include [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], and [[hypothermia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome are [[opioids]].

==Sedative/hypnotic==
The symptoms of sedative/hypnotic toxidrome include [[ataxia]], blurred vision, [[coma]], [[confusion]], [[delirium]], deterioration of [[central nervous system]] functions, [[diplopia]], [[dysesthesias]], [[hallucination]]s, [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[paresthesias]], [[sedation]], slurred speech, and [[stupor]].  [[Apnea]] is a potential complication.  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[barbiturate]]s, [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid]], [[Methaqualone]], and [[ethanol]]. While most sedative-hypnotics are [[anticonvulsant]], some such as GHB and methaqualone instead lower the seizure threshold, and so can cause paradoxical [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]] in overdose.

==Sympathomimetic==
The symptoms of a sympathomimetic toxidrome include [[anxiety]], [[delusion]]s, [[diaphoresis]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[mydriasis]], [[paranoia]], [[piloerection]], and [[seizure]]s.  Complications include [[hypertension]], and [[tachycardia]].  Substances that may cause this toxidrome include [[salbutamol]], [[amphetamine]]s, [[cocaine]], [[ephedrine]] ([[Ma Huang]]), [[methamphetamine]], [[phenylpropanolamine]] (PPA's), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. It may appear very similar to the anticholinergic toxidrome, but is distinguished by hyperactive bowel sounds and sweating.&lt;ref name = firstaid/&gt;
