His family had previously had members in the legal and medical professions; one of the earliest of whom any special records exist having been John Dickson of [[Kilbucho]] and Hartree, a lawyer, who in 1649 was appointed a [[Senator of the College of Justice]], taking the title of [[Lord Hartree]].

==Early life==
[[File:6 Fettes Row, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|Dickson's house at 6 Fettes Row, Edinburgh]]
He was born at 6 Fettes Row&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1834-5: D Dickson advocate&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Edinburgh]] on 21 February 1836 the son of David Dickson of Hartree, an advocate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickson received his early education at home. In 1855, he entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] as a student of medicine; and soon engaged with enthusiasm in those preliminary scientific studies which have so frequently been the occasion of the first awakenings of latent scientific impulses. In him they appear to have served this purpose. He became an enthusiastic biologist; and a warm admirer and disciple of Goodsir, in whose philosophical tendencies he found, like many of his friends, the inspiring direction that soon became so marked and characteristic a feature of his scientific work and aims. Engrossed in natural science, he took, it would seem, comparatively little interest in the purely professional or technical departments of the medical curriculum. He, however, appreciated differentiation as a means of promoting advancement in the art as well as in the science of medicine. In his inaugural address, delivered in 1859, as a President of the [[Royal Medical Society]], he supposes the questions,

:"Of what use is it for a student of medicine to know that the cranium is composed of vertebral elements—that such and such bones of the face correspond to costal arches; and that certain bones and muscles of the upper extremities correspond to other bones and muscles in the lower?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why should" his "memory be burdened with apophysis and epiphysis, when" there is "so much else to be learned of more direct importance ?" And he goes on, —" To such objections it may be answered, that although morphological anatomy in its present state may be of little practical importance to the medical man, yet this is no reason why he should not study it. It must be at once apparent that, from the nature of homological anatomy, one of the great ends which it is destined to accomplish is a simplified teaching of descriptive anatomy, by a logical and intelligible arrangement and generalisation of the enormous mass of facts with which the anatomical student has to contend ; and this can only be attained to by the development and perfecting of homological anatomy, by which alone a philosophical classification of anatomical details can be rendered possible. Such being the case, all doubt as to the utility of homological anatomy must be thrown aside. Its study must surely be of importance, if it enables anyone to assist, however slightly, in promoting so good an end. The medical man, while he performs his duties to his suffering fellow-creatures, ought never to forget at the same time what he owes to medical science and to posterity."

Dickson graduated as doctor of medicine in August 1860, having previously, in accordance with his biological proclivities, studied under [[Albert von Kölliker]] in [[Würzburg]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] in Berlin. His career as a teacher of botany began in the summer of 1862, when he conducted the class of botany in the [[University of Aberdeen]] for Professor [[George Dickie (botanist)|George Dickie]], who was at the time incapacitated by bad health. He thus found an opportunity for displaying his merits as a teacher; and his success proved of much value in securing for him in 1866 the chair of Botany in the [[University of Dublin]]. Two years afterwards he was appointed Professor of Botany in the [[University of Glasgow]], where he confirmed his early reputation as a clear and painstaking teacher and an enthusiastic worker in structural and morphological botany.

==Career as botanist==
Dr Dickson remained in Glasgow from 1866 till 1879. In the latter year, the professorship of botany in the University of Edinburgh became vacant, on the resignation, caused by failing health, of the renowned and veteran Professor [[John Hutton Balfour]]; and to this great botanical position, Dr Dickson was promoted by the Curators. In the following year, he received from the Crown also the appointment of Regius Professor of Botany to the University of Edinburgh, as well as that of the 8th [[Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden]], a position he held until 1887. During this time he lived at 11 Royal Circus in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory, 1881-2: Alexander Dickson of Hartree&lt;/ref&gt;

It is with his work as a professor in Edinburgh that the members of this Society are most familiar. The recollection of that work is still so vividly present among us, that, but for the requirement of a historical record, it would be needless to dwell on it. We find him entering on his duties imbued with the same conception of the far-reaching affinities between science and art or practice as was recognised in the early developments of his biological career. In his inaugural address he adopted for his subject the consideration of some remarkable parallels between the animal and vegetable kingdoms as regards specialisation of form for the performance of different functions. For this purpose he compared a flowering plant with a zoophyte, and showed how unity of organisation is manifest throughout nature. The same lesson was indicated as, twenty years before, he had taught in his inaugural address to the Royal Medical Society, that the cultivation of every department of biological science increases the knowledge'of that human anatomy which is the foundation of the art of medicine and surgery.

His relations with the students of the university soon became of the most cordial description. His painstaking earnestness as a teacher, his obvious desire to further their botanical studies, the knowledge that soon spread of the hours spent in preparation for his class, and especially in the preparation of the wonderfully skilful and instructive illustrations that from day to day appeared on the blackboard, and the numberless evidences of his courteous and generous disposition, gained for him, not only respect, but also warm and grateful affection.

Professor Dickson's first botanical paper was published in 1857, while he was yet a student of medicine. During the following twenty-nine years his activity as a worker was shown by the publication of upwards of fifty papers. Many of them rank as masterpieces of accurate and elaborate description, and of philosophical conceptions of structure. A glance over the appended list shows his great partiality for subjects bearing on development and morphology, in which departments of botany he acquired the position of an eminent authority. In confirmation of these statements, it is sufficient to cite his graduation thesis, for which he was bestowed a [[gold medal]], " On the Development of the Flower, and especially the Pistil, in the [[Caryophyllocece]]," and his papers on the Morphology of the Reproductive Organs of the Ooniferce, on the Embryo and its Appendages in Tropceolum, on the Embryology and Development of the Flower of Pinguicula, on the Spiral Arrangements of the Cones of Pinus pinaster, and on the Morphology and Structure of the Pitchers in Cephalotus and Nepenthes.

On account of his eminence as a botanist and teacher, he was made honorary M.D. of the University of Dublin, LL.D. of the University of Glasgow, [[Fellow of the Linnaean Society]], and President of the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]].

Dickson took much interest in matters outside of his immediate professorial duties and scientific pursuits. He was a Conservative in State and Church politics. On various occasions he actively supported candidates for parliamentary representation. A consistent [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Churchman]], he remained true to the original position of that Church, and opposed publicly the policy which an influential majority had adopted, of reversing its traditions on the question of a State-recognised and supported Church. He strenuously opposed the legislative attempts, which fortunately proved abortive, to modify the special characters of medical education and graduation in the [[Scottish universities]], for the mere sake of bringing them into harmony with the systems prevailing in the southern division of the United Kingdom. He looked with much distrust on the schemes, embodied in the various Bills introduced into Parliament during the last seven years, for effecting fundamental changes in the constitution and character of the Scottish universities; considering them prompted more by political, social, and selfish aims, than by a real and disinterested desire for educational reform. If it were possible for one so charitable and generous to entertain any feeling of resentment, that feeling was approached in the indignation with which he regarded many of the statements of the extreme section of agitators for university legislation. Even when he found himself in a hopeless minority,—as occasionally happened in the discussions on this question,—few men could be more courageous in maintaining or expressing the views he had deliberately adopted.

Polemical discussion, however, was not congenial to his fair and candid disposition. When not engaged in teaching or in the botanical investigations to which he was so ardently attached, his occupations as proprietor of Hartree and Kilbucho, and social intercourse with his friends, were more in accordance with his tastes.

It has been well said that, as a country laird, "his one aim in life was to make others happy." And the same characteristics made him also a general favourite in society; where he used to delight his friends by the exquisite taste and feeling with which he played on the piano the works of Beethoven and Bach, and the national airs of Scotland.

==Death==
He was aware that he was suffering from an illness, but concealed all knowledge of the existence of this "thorn in the flesh," to avoid causing anxiety and pain to those around. He succeeded in his purpose; and when, on 30 December 1887, he suddenly expired on the [[curling]] pond, at Thriepland Pond, Hartree, Peeblesshire, no forebodings or anxieties had occurred to increase the bitter grief of his departure.

He was warmly he was attached to the [[Botanical Society of Edinburgh]]. He constantly attended its meetings, served it as President and in some of its other offices, and communicated to it the greater number of his botanical papers.

The '''Art Directors Club of New York''' is an organization for art directors in [[New York City]]. It was founded in 1920, and has grown as an industry group, promoting art directors' work through exhibitions and awards, including the annual DESI award for design excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History|url = http://adcglobal.org/about/history/|website = ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club|accessdate = 2016-01-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Art Directors Club of New York (sometimes referred to as  the "ADC") was founded in 1920 by Louis Pedlar and [[Earnest Elmo Calkins]]. With Fred Lamb, Calkins had organized the first advertising art exhibits in New York City in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Harry Lewis|title=This Fascinating Advertising Business|origyear=1947|year=2008|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill, reprinted by Wildside Press|isbn=9781434475541|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a need for an organization that would “dignify the field of business art in the eyes of artists”, emphasizing his belief that “artistic excellence is vitally necessary to successful advertising”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/adc/history/|publisher=Art Directors Club of New York|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1947, the Club's work was being credited with a gradual increase in advertising art standards throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Harry Lewis|title=This Fascinating Advertising Business|origyear=1947|year=2008|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill, reprinted by Wildside Press|isbn=9781434475541|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Graphic Design, Referenced: A Visual Guide to the Language, Applications, and History of Graphic Design|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EwPu8I6D5y4C|publisher = Rockport Publishers|date = 2011-12-01|isbn = 9781592537426|first = Bryony Gomez|last = Palacio|first2 = Armin|last2 = Vit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the club hosted their first juried exhibition with original work from over 250 contributors. The exhibition organized by Calkins and opened with an inaugural dinner on March 2, 1921. The awards that evening went to: Fred R. Cruger for black and white illustration; W.E. Hoitland for painting; and Rene Clark for poster design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising &amp; Selling with the Advertising News|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RtFBAQAAMAAJ|publisher = Advertising &amp; Selling Company|date = 1921-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE WORLD OF ART:; French Paintings and American Prints|url = http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/03/20/112676937.html?pageNumber=35|website = timesmachine.nytimes.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Directors Club was restrictive in its membership during its early years. Women were not admitted until 1942. George Olden, an art director with the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company]], was the first African-American member, having been elected to the Club in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=JET|date=3 April 1952|volume= 1|issue= 23|pages=37|publisher=Johnson Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Directors' Club includes art directors working in film and ''[[New media]]''. 

=== Logo ===
The first logo was an interpretation of [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer’s]] signature. In 2009, ADC rebranded with the help of [[Trollbäck + Company]]. The new logo moved away from a monogram and introducing a word mark in bold hues. In 2014, they updated their logo with a monogram created by [[Sid Lee]] that references historical ADC monograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brand New: New Logo and Identity for ADC by Sid Lee|url = http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_adc_by_sid_lee.php#.VogZFpMrLMU|website = www.underconsideration.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Art Directors Club Logo Comes in Colors, Primed for ‘Pimping’|url = http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/new-art-directors-club-logo-comes-in-colors-primed-for-pimping/278747|website = www.adweek.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

=== ADC Annual Awards ===
Earnest Elmo Calkins organized the first juried exhibition in 1921. The ADC evolved this exhibition into its ADC Annual Awards that receives up to 11,000 entries from around the world. Several awards are given out annually to recognize industry excellence internationally. The Award for Design Excellence is known as the "DESI" award. The main categories for the award, as of 2012, are: Advertising; Design; Illustration; Integrated; Interactive; Motion; Photography; and Special Awards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The ADC 95th Annual Awards are here!|url = http://adcglobal.org/awards/adc-annual-awards/|website = ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club|accessdate = 2016-01-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians''' ('''AACM''') is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1965 in Chicago by pianist [[Muhal Richard Abrams]], pianist [[Jodie Christian]], drummer [[Steve McCall (drummer)|Steve McCall]], and composer [[Phil Cohran]].&lt;ref name="RCJE"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cook| first = Richard| author-link =| year = 2005| title = Richard Cook's Jazz Encyclopedia| publisher = Penguin Books| location = London| isbn = 0-141-00646-3| page = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AACM is devoted "to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music," according to its charter. It supports and encourages [[jazz]] performers, composers and educators. Although founded in the jazz tradition, the group's outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, "touched nearly all corners of modern music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/free-at-first-the-audacious-journey-of-the-association-for-the-advancement-of-creative-musicians-review-1429654559|title='Free at First: The Audacious Journey of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians' Review|author=Blumenfeld, Larry |date=April 21, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the 1960s jazz music was losing ground to rock music and the founders of the AACM felt that a proactive group of musicians would add creativity and outlet for new music.&lt;ref name=Reich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/reich/ct-jazz-aacm-20150127-column.html|title=50th anniversary of AACM celebrated at DuSable Museum|author=Reich, Howard|date=January 27, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered on [[pianist]] [[Muhal Richard Abrams]] who had organized an Experimental Band since 1962. The musicians were generally steadfast in their commitment to their music, despite a lack of performance venues and sometimes indifferent audiences. From 1969 the AACM organised a music education program for inner-city youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Litweiler, John | title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 | publisher=Da Capo | year=1984|isbn=0-306-80377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s AACM members were among the most important and innovative in all of jazz, though the AACM's contemporary influence has waned some in recent years.  Many AACM members have recorded widely: in the early days on the [[Delmark Records]] Avant Garde Jazz series and later on the [[Black Saint/Soul Note]] and [[India Navigation]] labels, and to a lesser extent on the [[Arista Records]] and [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delmark.com/delmark.history.htm|title=Delmark History|work=delmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical endeavors of members of the AACM often include an adventurous mixing of avant-garde jazz, classical, and world music. The AACM also ran a school, The AACM School of Music, with classes in all areas taught by members of the AACM. The AACM also had a strong relationship with an influential sister organization, the [[Black Artists' Group]] (BAG) of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The AACM has received aid from the [[MacArthur Foundation]] and has a strong relationship with [[Columbia College Chicago|Columbia College]]. ''A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians'' by [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], has been published by the University of Chicago Press (May 2008).&lt;ref name="nyt_2008"&gt;{{Cite news | first = Nate | last=Chinen | title=Four Decades of Music That Redefined Free | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=May 2, 2008 | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/02/arts/music/02aacm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a 50-year retrospective exhibition of art, music and group-related artifacts, entitled, "Free at First", was held at the [[DuSable Museum of African American History]].&lt;ref name=Reich/&gt;

==Music==
The AACM has been on the forefront of the avant-garde since its inception in 1965. [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Henry Threadgill]], and the [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] pushed the boundaries of jazz and challenged the avant-garde classical movement led by [[John Cage]]. Concerts were heavily improvised, and many AACM members created scores that blended music, geometry, painting, and ciphers to be interpreted by the performers live. The AACM was part of an artistic movement on the South Side of Chicago that included AFRICobra (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) and other collectives.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, George E..

[[File:AubussonNaissanceMarieArles2.jpg|thumb|Detail of Naissance de Marie Aubusson tapestry in the cloister of [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]

The '''Aubusson tapestry manufacture''' of the 17th and 18th centuries managed to compete with the royal manufacture of  [[Gobelins tapestry]] and the privileged position of [[Beauvais tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Weigert, ''French Tapestry'' 1956: 135–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Tapestry manufacture at [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]], in the upper valley of the [[Creuse (river)|Creuse]] in central [[France]], may have developed from looms in isolated family workshops established by [[Flanders|Flemings]] that are noted in documents from the 16th century.

Typically, Aubusson tapestries depended on [[engraving]]s as a design source or the full-scale [[cartoon]]s from which the low-warp tapestry-weavers worked. As with Flemish and Parisian tapestries of the same time, figures were set against a conventional background of ''verdure'', stylized foliage and vignettes of plants on which birds perch and from which issue glimpses of towers and towns. 

The town of [[Felletin]] is identified as the source from which came the Aubusson tapestries in the inventory of [[Charlotte of Albret]], Duchess of Valentinois and widow of [[Cesare Borgia]] (1514).&lt;ref&gt;Weigert 1956:136.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernheim-Jeune gallery''' is one of the oldest art galleries in Paris. 

Opened on [[Rue Laffitte]] in 1863 by Alexandre Bernheim (1839-1915), friend of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot|Corot]] and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], it changed location a few times before settling on Avenue Matignon. It is still managed by members of the same family.  The gallery promoted [[Realism (art movement)|realists]], [[Barbizon school]]  paintings and, in 1874, the first [[impressionist]] and later [[post-impressionist]] painters.

==History==
In 1901, Alexandre Bernheim, with his sons, Josse (1870-1941), and Gaston (1870-1953), organized the first important exhibition of [[Vincent van Gogh]] paintings in Paris with the help of [[art critic]] [[Julien Leclercq (poet)|Julien Leclercq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095501260?rskey=hQFYWl&amp;result=1 Oxford Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, ''Bernheim-Jeune frères'' started  presenting works by [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Henri-Edmond Cross]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Le Douanier Rousseau]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Maurice Utrillo]] and [[Georges Dufrénoy]]. 

From 1906 to 1925, art critic [[Félix Fénéon]] was the director of the gallery and was instrumental in bringing in the art of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Umberto Boccioni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcgallery.com/list/2002aug01.html Abc. Gallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery became one of the centers of the artistic [[avant-garde]]. In 1906, the gallery also began [[publishing]] monographs; its first release was devoted to the paintings of [[Eugène Carrière]]. In 1919 it also launched a bimonthly bulletin about artistic life.

In 1922, an exhibition brought together works by [[Alice Halicka]], [[Auguste Herbin]], Pierre Hodé, [[Moïse Kisling]], [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Henri Lebasque]], [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=6043 The Frick Collection, Galerie Bernheim Jeune]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/transatlanticencounters/items/show/5161 Transatlantic Encounters]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]], its property was seized by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] or ERR.  In 1941 their gallery was sequestered, paintings confiscated and their buildings sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Masters: World War II and the Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses | first1=P | last1=Harclerode | first2=B | last2=Pittaway | publisher=Welcome Rain Publishers | location= | year=2000 | pages=90–91 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvVPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Bernheim-Jeune+Chateau+de+Rastignac&amp;dq=Bernheim-Jeune+Chateau+de+Rastignac&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jd-GTaunLo36swOf9JzyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other art dealers  such as [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Bernheim had to labor for several decades to recover some of the paintings, the task made more difficult as two record ledgers had disappeared from the gallery during the looting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4A50715 Looted art.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 sensing that they, of Jewish background, would be targeted by the Nazis, the Bernheim-Jeune family had sent 30 or so impressionist and post-impressionist paintings to the [[Château de Rastignac]] in [[Dordogne]] for safekeeping. On March 30, 1944 fleeing Nazi [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) forces set fire to the château,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecolumnists.com/johnson/johnson103.html Michael Johnson, ''Our Whitehouse in France''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704080203/http://www.thecolumnists.com/johnson/johnson103.html |date=2011-07-04 }} Retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; after five truckloads of items were removed;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.ww2-derniersecret.com/Aquitaine/24-2.html&amp;ei=3kWHTbudONSatwef4-nUBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ7gEwBzgK&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dch%25C3%25A2teau%2Bde%2Brastignac%2Bduring%2BWWII%26start%3D10%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DRVK%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divnsb ''Resistance and Liberation Maquis Dordogne (continued from page 1) Suite de la chronologie des combats (du 14 janvier 1944 au 23 août 1944) Following the chronology of the battle (14 January 1944 to August 23, 1944)''] Retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the paintings may have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The rape of Europa: the fate of Europe's treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War | author=Nicholas, L | publisher=Vintage eBooks | location= | year=1995 | page= | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fo7jn3WTDsC&amp;pg=PT354&amp;dq=Bernheim-Jeune+Chateau+de+Rastignac&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jd-GTaunLo36swOf9JzyAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death in 2012 of Michel Dauberville, descendant of  Bernheim, his cousin Guy-Patrice Dauberville, also an expert in [[modern art|modern painting]]s and a Bonnard and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] specialist, started heading Bernheim-Jeune.

The gallery now exhibits painters and sculptors in the tradition of the [[École de Paris]] and artists such as [[Jean Carzou]], [[Shelomo Selinger]] or [[Pollès]].

'''''Bundwerk''''' is a carpentry and rural architectural term from the 19th century for a method of  building with timber that was used especially in [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]] and [[Bavaria]]. After [[log construction]] and [[timber framing]], ''bundwerk'' is one of the most widespread forms of [[framing (construction)|timber building techniques]]. It involved used wooden beams that were arranged partly in a lattice or diagonally over a cross. It often decorated the front and gable sides of agricultural buildings, frequently the grain barn or ''Stadel'' of quadrangular farms (''Vierseithöfen'').

In northeastern [[Upper Bavaria]] ''bundwerk'' is especially varied and colourful. By contrast, in the [[Werdenfelser Land]] and the region around [[Innsbruck]] only a few places exhibit this type of timber building throughout.

''Bundwerk'' had its heyday between 1830 and 1860 when artists and woodcarvers, as well as carpenters, decorated the ''bundwerk'' with paintings and carvings, often with mythical creatures or Christian symbols.

'''''Christina's World''''' is a 1948 painting by American painter [[Andrew Wyeth]] and one of the best-known American paintings of the middle 20th century. It is a [[tempera]] work done in a realist style, depicting a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"/&gt; It is on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York as part of its permanent collection.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The woman in the painting is Anna Christina Olson (3 May 1893 – 27 January 1968). She probably suffered from [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]], a genetic [[polyneuropathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hold-ho-woman-famous-painting-christinas-world-suffered-charcot-marie-tooth-disease-1558609 |title=Christina's World: Mystery illness of Andrew Wyeth's most famous painting discovered|date=6 May 2016|accessdate= 6 May 2016|first=Léa |last=Surugue|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 23rd Historical Clinicopathological Conference, University of Maryland School of Medicine, May 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Wyeth was inspired to create the painting when he saw her crawling across a field while he was watching from a window in the house. He had a summer home in the area and was on friendly terms with Olson, using her and her younger brother as the subjects of paintings from 1940 to 1968.&lt;ref name="timemag"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,962060,00.html| title=Andrew Wyeth's Stunning Secret| last=Corliss| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Corliss| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=1986-08-18|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olson was the inspiration and subject of the painting but she was not the primary model; Wyeth's wife Betsy posed as the torso of the painting.&lt;ref name="timemag"/&gt; Olson was 55 at the time that Wyeth created the work.&lt;ref name="timemag"/&gt;

==Reception and history==
''Christina's World'' was first exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan in 1948.&lt;ref name=Kimmelman&gt;{{cite news|last=Kimmelman|first=Michael|title=Andrew Wyeth, Painter, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/arts/design/17wyeth.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=May 5, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received little attention from critics at the time, but [[Alfred Barr]], the founding director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), bought the painting for $1,800. He promoted it at MoMA and it gradually grew in popularity over the years. Today, it is considered an icon of American art and is rarely loaned out by the museum.&lt;ref name=Esaak&gt;{{cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/famous_paintings/ss/andrew_wyeth_christinas_world.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Christina's World is one of the two paintings hanging on the living room wall of "an elegant, anonymous hotel suite” to which the astronaut David Bowman is transported after passing through the Star Gate.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Arthur, C.

[[National Register of Historic Places]], Registration Form, Section 8, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not appear in the [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel.

The painting appears as a symbolic [[Theatrical property|prop]] in the film ''[[Oblivion (2013 film)|Oblivion]]'' starring [[Tom Cruise]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/trivia Oblivion Trivia]. [[IMDb]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of Olson and her encounter with Wyeth is portrayed in  the novel ''A Piece of the World'' by [[Christina Baker Kline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/books/review/piece-of-the-world-christina-baker-kline.html |title=Mystery Woman: A Novel Explores the Story of Andrew Wyeth’s ‘Christina’s World’ |last=Aikman |first=Becky |work=The New York Times|date=Feb 24, 2017 |access-date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting appears in the 2016 British film ''[[War on Everyone]]'' during a scene where Terry looks at a reproduction hanging on a wall in Jackie's house, and comments: "It's kinda creepy. It's like something bad's gonna happen but there's nothing she can do about it."

The painting also briefly appears in the 2018 American film ''[[The Kindergarten Teacher (2018 film)|The Kindergarten Teacher]]'' during a scene where Lisa and Jimmy are touring the Museum of Modern Art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n1NP6w5lXs YouTube at 1:55]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3319">In [[book publishing]], a '''commissioning editor''' is essentially a buyer. It is the job of the commissioning editor to advise the [[publishing house]] on which books to publish. Usually the actual decision of whether to contract a book is taken by a senior manager rather than the editor.

== Responsibilities ==
The other roles of commissioning editors vary between companies. Usually they are also responsible for ensuring that authors under contract deliver typescripts to specification and on time. They thus have an author management role. They usually have responsibility for ensuring that typescripts are of sufficient quality. In this, especially in textbook and reference publishing, commissioning editors may be assisted by development editors or assistant editors. Furthermore, in textbook companies, this role is responsible for managing title revisions, signing new authors, and ensuring products are profitable. 

In some (usually small) companies commissioning editors are also responsible for overseeing the [[Copy editing|copy-editing]], typesetting, proofreading, and design of books, although in other companies this responsibility is assumed by other staff e.g. Managing Editors, House Editors, and Production Editors.

Often commissioning editors are also responsible for managing books that have already been published, for example by ensuring that stock levels are adequate and advising on when a book needs to be reprinted.

== The commissioning process ==
Commissioning editors may commission in a number of ways:
# pro-actively: by thinking of ideas for books and then finding authors to write them
# reactively: by reacting to book proposals or manuscripts
# collaboratively: by formulating ideas in dialogue with authors
# by republishing previously published books
# by co-publishing ("buying in") books being published elsewhere or in other editions by other companies

== The role ==
Sometimes the phrase Acquisitions Editor is used. This is a near synonym for Commissioning Editor. Possibly the word "Acquisitions" implies more emphasis on types (4) and (5) above.

Commissioning has not been formulated into a profession. There is little formal training available. Recently there has been some attempt in the UK to articulate and establish professional standards. Most commissioning editors work up to the post through experience in other roles e.g. Editorial Assistant. Some editors see the post as a stepping stone to a [[senior management]] job (e.g. Publisher, Editorial Director, Publishing Director); others are content to remain in the post and to build a reputation as a star editor.

== Qualities ==
There is little consensus on what makes good commissioning editors, though most people in the industry would agree that the following are desirable and important:
* business acumen: understanding the market and the company's place in the market
* creativity
* linguistic sensitivity
* communicativeness
* [[project management]] skills

==References==
The standard work on the subject is Gill Davies' ''Book Commissioning and Acquisition'' (Routledge).

The '''''Desert Breath''''', located in the [[Egypt]]ian desert near [[Hurghada]] on the [[Red Sea]] coast, is a double-[[spiral]] work of [[land art]].

It was created by the D.A.ST. Arteam, a group made up of three Greek artists - [[Danae Stratou]], sculptor, [[Alexandra Stratou]], industrial designer, and [[Stella Constantinides]], architect. The work, completed on March 7, 1997, covers an area of about 10 hectares (25 acres).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 89 protruding cones of gradually increasing size set in a spiral and another 89 depressed (incised) cones set in spirals. The sand dug out from the depressed cones was used to create the protruding cones, resulting in the displacement of 8000 cubic meters (10500 cubic yards) of sand.  At the center of the art piece used to be a body of water 30 meters (98 feet) in diameter which has since evaporated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is this an alien landing site, ancient monument, or something else?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/14/world/africa/alien-landing-site-desert/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The artwork is subject to natural erosion and in due course the area will revert to original desert plain. It is viewable by satellite pictures via [[Google Earth]].

==Intention of the Project==
The artists have stated that the project was meant to suggest an experience of infinity with the desert as a landscape of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danaestratou.com/projects/exterior/desert-breath] Id.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though it is in a state of slow disintegration, Desert Breath is still viewable two decades after its creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/02/desert-breath-a-monumental-land-art-installation-in-the-sahara-desert/ Desert Breath: A Monumental Land Art Installation in the Sahara Desert]&lt;/ref&gt;  Through its slow disintegration, the installation has been seen as an instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archipedia.org/landscape/desertbreath Desert Breath — archipedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was co-founded in 1979 by [[Carl Djerassi]], the inventor of the [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], and [[Diane Middlebrook]]. The residency is competitive and held at no cost to the artists. The location was a former cattle ranch.

It is notable for its creation through two web-based [[Opinion poll|poll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html | title=Devon, England | work = Flags of the world | date =21 October 2011 | accessdate = 28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/community_life/features/devon_flag.shtml | date = January 2005 | title = Flag celebrates Devon's heritage | publisher = BBC Devon website | accessdate = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The subject of a Devonian flag was raised by the county's contingent of scouts to the [[20th World Scout Jamboree]] in an interview on BBC Radio Devon in 2002. The scouts were unaware of a Devon flag and wondered if any of the listeners knew of a flag for the county. BBC Radio Devon took up the search for a flag for Devon and asked the public to send in designs.

The flag was created in 2003 after a vote in two polls run by the BBC Devon website, the winning design taking 49% of the votes cast. The design was created by student Ryan Sealey.&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt;

The Devon Flag is made of three colours — green ([[Pantone]] 348), black and white.&lt;ref name=flag_inst/&gt; Although the flag is relatively young, its colours are those traditionally identified with Devon&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt; (e.g. the colours of its [[Rugby Union]] team, [[Exeter University]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]]). [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] flew a dark green flag with white circles at the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] (now on view at the Teign Valley Museum).{{cn|date=January 2014}} The green represents the colour of the rolling and lush Devon hills, the black represents the high and windswept moors ([[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]]) and the white represents both the salt spray of Devon's two coastlines and the [[Kaolinite|China Clay]] industry (and mining in general).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/neighbourhoods-villages/devonflag/devonflaggroup.htm | title = Devon Flag Group | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate = 4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its launch in 2003, the Devon Flag has gained popularity, and in October 2006 it gained "official" recognition when Devon County Council raised the flag outside County Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.devon.gov.uk/devonflag | title = Devon Flag | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate = 25 January 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203703/http://www.devon.gov.uk/devonflag | archivedate = 1 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2004, Rodney Lock of [[Ottery St Mary]] in [[East Devon]] was threatened with legal action for flying the Devon flag in his back garden, as he required planning permission to fly non-national flags. Since then the Minister for Housing, [[Keith Hill (politician)|Keith Hill]], has said local authorities can officially "turn a blind eye" to the practice of flying the county flag from poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2004/flag_blind_eye.shtml| title= Council's told they can "turn a blind eye" to flag flying | date = December 2004 | publisher = BBC Devon website | accessdate = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devon Ensign==

[[File:Devon Ensign.gif|thumb|Devon Ensign]]

First flown in 2003 the Devon Regatta Ensign ''(designed by Kevin Pyne)'' adds a [[Union Jack]] into the Canton of the Devon Flag - the flag is described as for use at Regatta, High Days &amp; Holidays, Weddings &amp; Burials at Sea. &lt;ref&gt;http://imperialflags.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/isle-of-man.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html&lt;/ref&gt;




==Flying the Devon Flag==
The Devon Flag Group have suggested the following dates as days when it is appropriate for the Devon flag to be flown. Most of them are either the days of local events or the feast days of Devon's saints. It is also flown outside of these days, especially in rural towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/neighbourhoods-villages/devonflag/whentoflytheflag.htm | title = When to fly the flag | work = Devon County Council website | accessdate= 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The creation of the flag drew criticism from [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish nationalists]], who accused it online of being an attempt to "hijack" their culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=New Flag Causes A Flap in South West| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news_features/2003/flap_over_flag.shtml | publisher = BBC Devon website|accessdate=13 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Burns, who started the discussion over a flag for Devon, cited the visibility of the [[Saint Piran's Flag|Cornish Flag]] as one of his reasons "Devonians are only too aware of the ubiquitous Cornish Flag, which can often be seen in the form of car bumper stickers, on vehicles entering Devon from Cornwall."&lt;ref name=bbc_devon_flag/&gt;

Dr Mark Stoyle, a Devon historian, noted that "People are quite aware in Devon that the Cornish make political capital by claiming to be different." He also suggested that the new-found sense of Devonian identity was a backlash against incoming "city-dwellers settling in the South West".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The decision to dedicate the flag to St Petroc was not without controversy as the saint is equally popular in neighbouring Cornwall. But it was decided that as Devon's 27 church dedications to Saint Petroc far outweighs the 6 dedications in Cornwall, also the Devon villages named after him such as [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]], that the county had a strong claim to the saint and Cornwall had already selected [[Saint Piran]] as their patron saint many years previously.

[[image:Mitsukuni defying the skeleton spectre invoked by princess Takiyasha.jpg|right|thumb|[[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], "{{nihongo|Souma no furudairi|相馬の古内裏}}" also known as "[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]".]]
{{nihongo|'''Gashadokuro'''|がしゃどくろ/ 餓者髑髏 ||literally "starving skeleton," also known as '''Odokuro'''}} are [[Yōkai|mythical creatures]] in [[Japanese mythology]].

==Description==
The Gashadokuro are spirits that take the form of giant [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]]s and are fifteen times taller than an average person, said to be created from the amassed bones of people who died of [[starvation]] or in battle, without being buried. These [[Yōkai]] roam after midnight, grabbing lone travelers and biting off their heads to drink their spraying blood. There is a way to know of their approach, as the victim would hear the sound of loud ringing in the ear. The Gashadokuro are said to possess the powers of invisibility and indestructibility; though Shinto charms are said to ward them off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Vampire_Universe.html?id=6h17h23zo1AC|author=Jonathan Maberry|title=Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings That Haunt Us, Hunt Us, and Hunger for Us|year=2006|isbn=9780806528137}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|reason=A religious text would be most preferred though any would suffice|date=April 2014}}

==In modern culture==
The Gashadokuro is a yōkai that first appeared in print in the later half of the 20th century. It was created by the authors of shonen magazines published from 1960 - 1970 and illustrated yōkai encyclopedias. Shigeaki Yamauchi's ''World's Bizarre Thriller Complete Works 2: Monsters of the World'' ([[Akita Shoten]], 1968) compiled articles about yōkai by [[Saitō Ryokuu]]. At the same time, it was also picked up by [[Shigeru Mizuki]] and [[Satō Aribumi]], and from their introduction the Gashadokuro became more widely known from 1980 on. 

The illustration in Arabumi's ''Illustrated Encyclopedia of Japanese Yōkai'' (1972) and the illustration by Mizuki both base the appearance of the Gashadokuro on the giant skeleton in [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] print, ''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]''. It has no direct connection to the Gashadokuro, but is said to have influenced modern depictions. Kuniyoshi's print was commissioned in the [[Edo period]] by [[Santō Kyōden]] for a [[yomihon]], depicting a scene in which [[Taira no Masakado]]'s daughter, Takiyasha-hime, summons a skeleton yōkai to attack the samurai Ooya Tarou Mitsukuni. Although originally described as many life-sized skeletons, Kuniyoshi depicted it as a single giant skeleton, as is characteristic of his work.

==Similar Yōkai==
In the entry for Gashadokuro in Mizuki's book, a related tale from the ''[[Nihon Ryōiki]]'' is introduced. It tells of a man in [[Bingo Province]] ([[Hiroshima Prefecture]]) who is in a field at night and, hearing an eerie voice moaning, "My eye hurts," finds a skeleton there with a bamboo shoot growing from its eye socket. He removes the bamboo shoot and offers the skeleton dried boiled rice, upon which the skeleton tells him the story of its murder and its personal history, and rewards him for his kindness. Though this tale has been conflated with that of the Gashadokuro, the two are in fact unrelated, the Gashadokuro having originated in the later half of the 20th century.

==In popular culture==
* In the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series, the Gashadokuro was adapted into its projects:
** In ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger]]'', Gasha Dokuro is one of the main villains who is described as cold, calm, ruthless and calculating. He appears in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'', and ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' as "Rito Revolto".
** Giant Gashadokuro, which can be summoned in lieu of the usual method of enlarging the defeated monster of the day, are recurring enemies in ''[[Shuriken Sentai Ninninger]]''. They are adapted as "Skullgators" in ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Steel]]''.
* In one of the DLC episodes of the ''[[PlayStation Vita]]'' re-release ''[[Muramasa: The Demon Blade]]'', one of the final bosses is a Gashadokuro.
* The Gashadokuro (usually referred to as "Giant Skeleton") is portrayed in varying roles of significance throughout the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series.
* In ''[[Hellboy: Sword of Storms]]'', a Gashadokuro rises from the ground of a cemetery and rakes the ground to unleash many undead monsters on Hellboy.
* In ''[[Goemon's Great Adventure]]'', a Gashadokuro is encountered in an early level while on a bridge.
* In the [[Studio Ghibli]] movie ''[[Pom Poko]]'', the monster parade scene features a Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[AdventureQuest Worlds]]'', the Gashadokuro is featured as the forbidden Beast of Chaos called the O-Dokuro. Kitsune uses the Hanzamune Blade to free it from a time rift and bring it to Yokai Island. The players fight it in two different forms; first as a complete skeleton, and later on as only a head.
* In ''[[Yo-kai Watch]]'', there is a Yo-kai called Gutsy Bones (Gashadokuro in the Japanese version). He has control over the [[gashapon]]s.
* In ''[[Okamiden]]'', there is a demon known as a Gashadokuro which resembles a humongous human skeleton with a fiery core and twin blades embedded in its stomach. There is also an armoured version which is much more powerful.
* In the manga/anime series, ''[[Inu x Boku SS]]'', Roromiya Karuta is a Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[Kubo and the Two Strings]]'', a Gashadokuro appears as an antagonist, guarding the Sword Unbreakable, which is one of many swords embedded in its skull. It is the largest [[stop motion]] puppet ever built, standing around 16 feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/laika-crazy-enough-animate-16-foot-tall-skeleton-kubo-two-strings-142544.html|title=Laika Was Crazy Enough To Animate A 16-Foot Tall Skeleton for 'Kubo and The Two Strings'|date=19 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the film, a [[Byōbu]] of the Gashadokuro appears in Hanzo's abandoned fortress that is very much based on the one from "[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]"
* In ''[[Nioh]]'', Gasha-Dokuro appears as the boss for the mission "The Source of Evil".
* In the ''[[Dark Souls]]'' series, there are frequent enemies later in the games which resemble the Gashadokuro and often that live in the deepest depths of the earth. The Giant Skeletons in the Tomb of the Giants from the first game may be inspired by the Gashadokuro.
* In ''[[Nurarihyon no Mago]]'' there is an antagonist named Gashadokuro, who is an enormous human-shaped skeleton with a single eyeball.

'''''Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief''''' is a 2013 [[non-fiction]] book about [[Scientology]] written by [[Lawrence Wright]].

The book contains interviews with current and former Scientologists, the histories of founder [[L.

In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' Wright said that "There are a lot of people out there who were very high up in the church and know a lot about it who have become outspoken...

The title of the book, ''Going Clear'', is in reference to a stage of spiritual development in Scientology. In [[Scientology terminology|Scientology parlance]], "[[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]" means a state of having freed oneself from "engrams", which members believe are "subconscious memories of past trauma". Scientologists go through therapy sessions called "auditing" as part of the process of becoming Clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NPR Staff | url = https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171096563/hollywood-hot-shots-scientology-and-a-story-worth-the-risk-in-going-clear | title = Hollywood Hot Shots, Scientology and a Story Worth the Risk in 'Going Clear' |work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=February 6, 2013 | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen Swartz reviewed the book for the Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, writing that Wright achieves his goal for the book, providing “a rich history that engages current questions,” while allowing for a “more nuanced discourse” of the meaning of religion, while perpetuating a “heavily Protestant understanding.” She also comments that the author recognizes the lack of information provided by the Church and encourages readers to research further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Contemporary Esotericism |journal=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions |year=2013 |last=Swartz |first=Karen |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=125-127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Science and Invention Nov 1928 Cover 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Cover of Science and Invention Magazine|'BUILD YOUR OWN TELEVISION RECEIVER.' ''[[Electrical Experimenter|Science and Invention]]'' magazine cover, November 1928]]

An '''invention''' is a unique or [[novelty (patent)|novel]] [[machine|device]], method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall [[engineering]] and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result.  An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.  Such works are novel and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|not obvious]] to [[person having ordinary skill in the art|others skilled in the same field]]. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.

Some inventions can be patented.  A [[patent]] legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.  The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.

Another meaning of invention is '''[[cultural invention]]''', which is an [[innovative]] set of useful [[social behaviour]]s adopted by people and passed on to others.&lt;ref&gt;Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention by Craig J. Saper (1997); Review of Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to cultural Invention, Kirsten Ostherr (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Social Inventions]] collected many such ideas in magazines and books.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Albery, Matthew Mezey, Mary McHugh and Marie Papworth (editors). "Best Ideas: A Compendium of Social Inventions". The Institute for Social Inventions, London, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Invention is also an important component of artistic and design [[creativity]]. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.

== Three areas of invention ==

Inventions are of three kinds: scientific-technological
(including medicine), sociopolitical (including economics and law), and humanistic, or cultural.

Scientific-technological inventions include railroads,
[[aviation]], [[vaccination]], hybridization, [[antibiotics]], astronautics, [[holography]], the atomic bomb, computing, the [[Internet]], and the smartphone.

Sociopolitical inventions comprise new laws, institutions, and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization. Examples include the British [[Parliament]], the US [[Constitution]], the Manchester (UK) General Union of Trades, the Boy Scouts, the [[Red Cross]], the [[Olympic Games]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as movements such as [[socialism]], [[Zionism]], [[suffragism]], [[feminism]], and animal-rights veganism.

Humanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences, although people tend to take them for granted. In the domain of linguistics, for example, many alphabets have been inventions, as are all [[neologism]]s ([[Shakespeare]] invented about 1,700 words). Literary inventions include the epic, [[tragedy]], comedy, the [[novel]], the [[sonnet]], the
[[Renaissance]], neoclassicism, [[Romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Aestheticism, [[Socialist Realism]], [[Surrealism]], [[postmodernism]], and (according to Freud) [[psychoanalysis]]. Among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting, printmaking, [[photography]], [[Film|cinema]], musical tonality, atonality, [[jazz]], rock, [[opera]], and the symphony orchestra. Philosophers have invented logic (several times), [[dialectics]], idealism, materialism, [[utopia]], [[anarchism]], [[semiotics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[behaviorism]], [[positivism]], [[pragmatism]], and [[deconstruction]]. Religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as [[monotheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Methodism]], [[Mormonism]], iconoclasm, [[puritanism]], [[deism]], secularism, ecumenism, and [[Baha’i]]. Some of these disciplines, genres, and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord, but most of them have had inventors.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process of invention ==
=== Practical means of invention ===
[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Alessandro Volta]] with the first [[electrical battery]]. Volta is recognized as one of the most influential inventors of all time.]]

Idea for an Invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by [[trial and error]], by making models, by [[experiment]]ing, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. [[Brainstorming]] also can spark new ideas for an invention.  Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.

In addition, many inventors keep [[inventor's notebook|records]] of their working process - [[inventor's notebook|notebooks]], photos, etc., including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Inventor's Notebook'' by Fred Grissom and David Pressman (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor'' by Simona Cremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/jefferson_papers/ |title=Jefferson's Papers at the Library of Congress |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alberteinstein.info/about/Information about Albert Einstein]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even ''morph'' into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0200_201_08.htm |title=Continuation Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

History shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct.  Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur.  For example, the [[parachute]] became more useful once powered [[flight]] was a reality.&lt;ref&gt;White, Lynn: The Invention of the Parachute, ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 9, Nremante (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conceptual means ===
[[Image:Edison and phonograph edit2.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Thomas Edison]] with [[phonograph]]. Edison was one of the most prolific inventors in history, holding [[List of Edison patents|1,093 U.S. patents in his name]].]]

Invention is often a [[creative process]]. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.

==== Play ====
Play may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one's play instinct. Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.&lt;ref name="inventionatplay1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html |title=Lemelson Centers Invention at Play : Inventors Stories |publisher=Inventionatplay.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020073009/http://inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html |archivedate=2013-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors (2004), p.14-15 by Evan I. Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while [[daydreaming]], especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Claxton, Guy. "Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: Why intelligence increases when you think less". Fourth Estate, London, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of [[Harry Potter]])&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sean. "J. K. Rowling: A Biography." Michael O'Mara Books Limited, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Frank Hornby (the inventor of [[Meccano]])&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Ian. "Before the Oil Ran Out: Britain 1977-87". Martin Secker &amp; Warburg Ltd, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; first had their ideas while on [[train]] journeys.

In contrast, the successful aerospace engineer [[Max Munk]] advocated "aimful thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Engines of our Ingenuity No. 1990: Max Munk |accessdate=2017-03-05 |url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1990.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Re-envision ====
To invent is to see anew.  Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their [[mind's eye]]. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventor's focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash—a [[Eureka effect|Eureka]]! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream "like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision".&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: A Life by Denis Brian p.159 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon).

==== Insight ====
Insight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insight may begin with questions, doubt or a [[Intuition (knowledge)|hunch]]. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-—an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see [[conductive polymer]], and [[organic light-emitting diode]] or [[OLED]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nobelprize.org, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html ''The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019144626/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html |date=October 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Exploration ====
[[File:Photographing Sound in 1884. A rare photograph taken at Volta Laboratory by J. Harris Rogers, a friend of Bell and Tainter (Smithsonian photo 44312-E) i009.jpg|thumb|300px|A rare 1884 photo showing the experimental recording of voice patterns by a photographic process at the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C.  Many of their experimental designs panned out in failure.]]

Invention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.

==== Improvement ====
Inventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer lasting, cheaper, more [[ecological]]ly friendly, or [[aesthetic]]ally different, lighter weight, more [[ergonomic]], structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.

=== Implementing Inventions ===
[[Image:Arabic Numerals.svg|thumb|left|400px|[[Western Arabic numerals]] - an example of non-material inventions.]]
[[Image:ZST Bratislava Petrzalka 3.jpg|thumb|Railways&amp;nbsp;— probably the most important invention in [[land transport]]. (Railway station in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]])]]
In [[economic theory]], inventions are one of the chief examples of "[[externality|positive externalities]]", a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity.  One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized—unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions.  The [[patent]] system captures those [[externality|positive externalities]] for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.

== Invention vs. innovation ==
{{Main|Innovation}}
In the social sciences, an innovation is something that is new, better and has been adopted and proven to create positive value. This is a key distinction from an invention which may not create positive value but furthers progress in a given area of development. The theory for adoption of an innovation, called ''[[diffusion of innovations]]'', considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by [[Everett Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett Rogers (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html |title=ciadvertising.org |publisher=ciadvertising.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Tarde]] also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his ''Laws of Imitation''.&lt;ref&gt;Les lois de l'imitation Gabriel Tarde (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purposes of invention ==
An invention can serve many purposes, and does not necessarily create positive value. These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time.  An invention or its development may serve purposes never envisioned by its inventors.  Plastic is a good example.&lt;ref name="inventionatplay1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/ |title=Explore invention at the Lemelson Center :: Smithsonian Lemelson Center |publisher=Invention.smithsonian.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005014353/http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/ |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Talk of the Nation |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4244179 |title=Exploring the Process of Inventing |publisher=NPR |date=2004-12-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105054635/http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php |date=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html#cip |title=Glossary |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2004-08-22 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1985/2/1985_2_18.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201145650/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1985/2/1985_2_18.shtml |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packagingtoday.com/introplasticexplosion.htm |title=at Directnic |publisher=Packagingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410040158/http://www.packagingtoday.com/introplasticexplosion.htm |archive-date=2013-04-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ides.com/plastics/A.htm |title=Plastic Materials (Aar - ACN) |publisher=Ides.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpf.co.uk/bpfindustry/process_plastics.cfm |title=Plastipedia: The Plastics Encyclopedia - Plastics Processes |publisher=Bpf.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/ |title=The Plastics Historical Society - Home |publisher=Plastiquarian.com|date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plasticsindustry.org/industry/history.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914121330/http://www.plasticsindustry.org/industry/history.htm |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invention as defined by patent law ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}
{{see also|Patentability}}
[[Image:US Patent cover.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States patent law|U.S. patent]]]]
The term ''invention'' is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word.  Additionally, the ''legal'' concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.

In Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, "Is this an invention?" If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive. The implication—counter-intuitively—is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries ''as such'' and software ''as such''. The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italians and German tradition. British courts don't agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision ("NRDC"), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a "...restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology."

In the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC § 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American "patentable subject matter" concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC § 101)&lt;ref name="USPTO"&gt;{{cite web |title=35 U.S.C. 1   Establishment. |url=https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep-9015-appx-l.html |website=United States Patent and Trademark Office |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark OFfice |accessdate=1 August 2018 |ref=USPTO}}&lt;/ref&gt; virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts were made to substantiate the "abstract idea" test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but eventually, none of them was successful. The last attempt so far was the "machine or transformation" test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.

== Invention in the arts ==
Invention has a long and important history in [[the arts]].  Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;''Creating Minds: An Anatomy of Creativity Seen Through the Lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi'' by Howard Gardner (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;  While some inventions in the arts are [[patentable]], others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them.  (see [[patent]]).

Some inventions in art include the:

* [[Collage]] and construction invented by Picasso
* [[Readymade]] invented by [[Marcel Duchamp]]
* [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] invented by [[Alexander Calder]]
* Combine invented by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]
* Shaped painting invented by [[Frank Stella]]
* Motion picture, the invention of which is attributed to [[Eadweard Muybridge]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Eadweard_Muybridge.aspx#1E1-Muybridg Encyclopedia.com and Muybridge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/399928/Eadweard-Muybridge |title=Eadweard Muybridge (British photographer) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1904-05-08 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Jackson Pollock]] invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.

Inventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity. [[Impressionist]] painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, i.e., Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs. Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work. [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]]'s 1879 [[design patent]] on the [[Statue of Liberty]] helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;1879, F. Auguste Bartholdi U.S. Patent D11,023&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
David Wolcott Kendall was a nationally known furniture designer, during Grand Rapids' heyday as "Furniture City". The David Wolcott Memorial School was established in 1928 by the will of Helen M. Kendall, his widow. The school opened in 1931, offering a two-year program in design, with 35 students. The school was located at 145 Fountain Street, at the western edge of what is now [[Heritage Hill Historic District (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Heritage Hill]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1947, growing from an influx of students following World War 2, the school's name was changed to Kendall School of Design. In 1961, having outgrown the Heritage Hill site, it relocated to 1110 College Avenue NE in the Highland Park neighborhood. In 1977, Kendall began offering baccalaureate degrees, and in 1981 was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. It moved again, to the seven-story Manufacturer's Building at 111 Division Avenue North (on the corner of Fountain Street, a short distance from the original site) in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The name of the school was changed in 1987 to Kendall College of Art and Design. As part of a merger with Ferris State University, the college bought the adjacent Interstate Building in the 1990s, constructing an atrium which became the combined structures' main entrance at 17 Fountain Street NW. In 2000 the school became formally Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University, and it continued renovating the new space for studio and classroom use. After the [[Grand Rapids Art Museum]] moved out of the Federal Building to the north, the university took ownership of it and reopened it as the Woodbridge N. Ferris Building in 2012 as part of the Kendall campus. In 2013, the college merged with the [[Urban Institute for Contemporary Art]], which had recently relocated to a new facility a few blocks to the south, and continues to operate as an arts organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Koppelpoort''' is a [[medieval]] [[City gate|gate]] in the Dutch city of [[Amersfoort]], [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Completed around 1425, it combines land and water-gates, and is part of the second city wall of Amersfoort, which was constructed between 1380 and 1450.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gildeamersfoort.nl/cmsms/rondleidingen-2/rondleidingen-op-aanvraag/bezoek-en-rondleiding-unieke-monumenten/koppelpoort |title=Koppelpoort |language=Dutch |publisher=Gilde Amersfoort |date= |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gate was built between 1380 and 1425 as part of the second city wall. The whole wall was completed around 1450. The gate was attacked in 1427 during the siege of the city. This attack was repelled.

The gate was opened and closed every day by the appointed ''raddraaiers'', "wheel-turners". A minimum of twelve wheel-turners were collected morning and evening by several guards. It was an extremely dangerous task; if they did not begin walking simultaneously, then one could fall, dragging the rest along with often fatal results. Before the gate could come down, it had to be raised, to pull out the iron pins that held it in place. Only then could it come down. While the gate was going down, walking in the wheel grew ever easier and faster, and many people stumbled and broke their limbs. The koppelpoort was also never breached.

The Koppelpoort was given its current appearance during the restoration by [[Pierre Cuypers]] in 1885 and 1886. Among other things, Cuypers removed a step between the two gates and replaced it with a slope.

From 1969 to 1993 a puppet theater was situated in the gate.

The latest restoration was completed in 1996. It was carried out very cautiously, and with respect for the old building materials. For this the town of Amersfoort received the [[Europa Nostra]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/article/detail/2477871/1999/01/29/Gerestaureerde-Koppelpoort-beloond-met-Europa-Nostra-prijs.dhtml |title=Gerestaureerde Koppelpoort beloond met Europa Nostra-prijs |language=Dutch |publisher=''[[Trouw]]'' |date=29 January 1999 |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knossos silver coin 400bc.jpg|thumb|Silver coin from [[Knossos]] representing the Labyrinth, 400 BC.]]

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Labyrinth''' ({{lang-grc|Λαβύρινθος}} ''labúrinthos'') was an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer [[Daedalus]] for King [[Minos]] of [[Crete]] at [[Knossos]]. Its function was to hold the [[Minotaur]], the monster eventually killed by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]]. Daedalus had so cunningly made the Labyrinth that he could barely escape it after he built it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doob|1992|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early Cretan coins occasionally exhibit branching (multicursal) patterns,&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 43, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the single-path (unicursal) seven-course "Classical" design without branching or dead ends became associated with the Labyrinth on coins as early as 430 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', 2000, item 50, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar non-branching patterns became widely used as visual representations of the Labyrinth – even though both logic and literary descriptions make it clear that the Minotaur was trapped in a complex branching maze.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth'', pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as the designs became more elaborate, visual depictions of the mythological Labyrinth from Roman times until the Renaissance are almost invariably unicursal.  Branching mazes were reintroduced only when [[hedge maze]]s became popular during the Renaissance.

In English, the term ''labyrinth'' is generally synonymous with ''[[maze]]''.  As a result of the long history of unicursal representation of the mythological Labyrinth, however, many contemporary scholars and enthusiasts observe a distinction between the two.  In this specialized usage ''maze'' refers to a complex branching multicursal puzzle with choices of path and direction, while a unicursal ''labyrinth'' has only a single path to the center. A labyrinth in this sense has an unambiguous route to the center and back and presents no navigational challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, ''Through the Labyrinth'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The usage restricting ''maze'' to patterns that involve choices of path is mentioned by Matthews (p. 2–3) as early as 1922, though he does not find the distinction useful and does not follow it himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labyrinthos.net/Labyrinth%20Typology.pdf |author=Jeff Saward |website=Labyrinthos |title=Mazes or Labyrinths? |access-date=28 Dec 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicursal labyrinths appeared as designs on [[pottery]] or [[basketry]], as [[body art]], and in etchings on walls of caves or churches.  The Romans created many primarily decorative unicursal designs on walls and floors in tile or mosaic.  Many labyrinths set in floors or on the ground are large enough that the path can be walked. Unicursal patterns have been used historically both in group ritual and for private [[meditation]], and are increasingly found for therapeutic use in hospitals and hospices.

==Etymology==
''Labyrinth'' is a word of [[pre-Greek]] origin, which the Greeks associated with the palace of [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]], excavated by [[Arthur Evans]] early in the 20th century. The word appears in a [[Linear B]] inscription as da-pu-ri-to.&lt;ref name= dapurito &gt;''The Oxford classical dictionary''. Oxford University Press p.116.

II. Zur mykenischen Tracht und Kultur |periodical=Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich deutschen archäologischen Instituts |date=1892 |volume=VII| page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ''labyrinthos'' might derive from ''labrys'', a [[Lydian language|Lydian]] word for "double-bladed axe".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Λυδοὶ γάρ ‘λάβρυν’ τὸν πέλεκυν ὀνομάζουσι}}, Plutarch, ''[[Moralia|Greek Questions]]'', 45 2.302a.&lt;/ref&gt;  Evans suggested that the palace at Knossos was the original labyrinth, and since the double axe motif appears in the palace ruins,
he asserted that ''labyrinth'' could be understood to mean "the house of the double axe".&lt;ref name= dapurito/&gt; This designation may not have been limited to Knossos, since the same symbols were discovered in other palaces in [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |last=Rouse |first=W. H. D. |date=1901 |title=The Double Axe and the Labyrinth |journal=Journal of Hellenic Studies |volume=21 |issue= |pages=268–274}} Rouse criticised the association, noting the reappearance of the same inscribed symbols at the newly discovered palace at [[Phaistos]] (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Martin P. Nilsson| Nlsson]] observes that in [[Crete]] the "double axe" is not a weapon and always accompanies goddesses or women and not a male god. &lt;ref&gt; Nilsson Vol I, p. 277 &lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Robert S.P. Beekes| Beekes]] finds the relation with ''labrys'' speculative, and suggests instead the relation with ''lavra'' (λαύρα), narrow street.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.P. Beekes]]. Greek Etymological dictionary, p.819 &lt;/ref&gt;  The original Minoan word appears to refer to labyrinthine underground grottoes, such as seen at [[Gortyn]].&lt;ref name="Sarullo"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this appears to have been the standard Classical understanding of the word. It is also possible that the word labyrinth is derived from the Egyptian ''loperohunt'', meaning palace or temple by the lake.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The Egyptian labyrinth near Lake Morris is described by Herodotus and Strabo. &lt;ref&gt; H.G.Wunderlich.

When the [[Bronze Age]] site at [[Knossos]] was excavated by explorer [[Arthur Evans]], the complexity of the architecture prompted him to suggest that the palace had been the Labyrinth of Daedalus.  Evans found various bull motifs, including an image of [[Bull-leaping|a man leaping over the horns of a bull]], as well as depictions of a [[labrys]] carved into the walls. On the strength of a passage in the ''Iliad'',&lt;ref name="dancingground"&gt;{{cite web

Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune."

where young men and women, of the age of those sent to Crete as prey for the Minotaur, would dance together. By extension, in popular legend the palace is associated with the myth of the Minotaur.

In the 2000s, archaeologists explored other potential sites of the labyrinth.&lt;ref name="skotinogortyn"&gt;{{cite web

Another contender is a series of underground tunnels at [[Gortyn]], accessed by a narrow crack but expanding into interlinking caverns. Unlike the Skotino cave, these caverns have smooth walls and columns, and appear to have been at least partially man-made. This site corresponds to an unusual labyrinth symbol on a 16th-century map of Crete contained in a book of maps in the library of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. A map of the caves themselves was produced by the [[France|French]] in 1821. The site was also used by German soldiers to store ammunition during the [[Second World War]]. Howarth's investigation was shown on a documentary&lt;ref name="natgeodocumentary"&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/the-holy-grail-5048/Overview National Geographic Channel: The Holy Grail (and the Minotaur)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101072958/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/the-holy-grail-5048/Overview |date=1 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; produced for the [[National Geographic Channel]].

===Herodotus' Egyptian labyrinth===
More generally, ''labyrinth'' might be applied to any extremely complicated maze-like structure. [[Herodotus]], in Book II of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)#Book II (Euterpe)|Histories]]'', describes as a "labyrinth" a building complex in Egypt, "near the place called the [[Crocodilopolis|City of Crocodiles]]," that he considered to surpass the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]:
{{blockquote|It has twelve covered courts — six in a row facing north, six south — the gates of the one range exactly fronting the gates of the other. Inside, the building is of two storeys and contains three thousand rooms, of which half are underground, and the other half directly above them. I was taken through the rooms in the upper storey, so what I shall say of them is from my own observation, but the underground ones I can speak of only from report, because the Egyptians in charge refused to let me see them, as they contain the tombs of the kings who built the labyrinth, and also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms, on the contrary, I did actually see, and it is hard to believe that they are the work of men; the baffling and intricate passages from room to room and from court to court were an endless wonder to me, as we passed from a courtyard into rooms, from rooms into galleries, from galleries into more rooms and thence into yet more courtyards. The roof of every chamber, courtyard, and gallery is, like the walls, of stone. The walls are covered with carved figures, and each court is exquisitely built of white marble and surrounded by a colonnade.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'', translated by [[Aubrey de Sélincourt]], Book II, pp. 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 19th century, the remains of this structure were discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] at the foot of the pyramid of [[Amenemhat III]] at [[Hawara]] in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical accounts of various authors (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder, among others) are not entirely consistent, perhaps due to degradation of the structure during Classical times.&lt;ref&gt;Kern 2000, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  In origin, the structure was likely a collection of funerary temples such as are commonly found near Egyptian pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Kern 2000, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'' described the structure as "the largest of all the temples of Egypt, the so-called Labyrinth, of which, however, only the foundation stones have been preserved."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Thurston Peck|Peck, Harry Thurston (chief editor)]].  "Hieratic Papyrus. (Twentieth Dynasty.)" in the ''[[Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]]'', published 1898, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus' description of the Egyptian Labyrinth inspired some central scenes in [[Bolesław Prus]]' 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)#Inspirations|Pharaoh]]''.

===Pliny's Lemnian labyrinth===
[[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' (36.90) lists the legendary [[Smilis]], reputed to be a contemporary of Daedalus, together with the historical mid-sixth-century BC architects and sculptors Rhoikos and Theodoros as two of the makers of the Lemnian labyrinth, which Andrew Stewart&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Stewart, ''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', "Smilis."&lt;/ref&gt; regards as "evidently a misunderstanding of the Samian temple's location ''en limnais'' ['in the marsh']."

===Pliny's Italian labyrinth===
According to Pliny, the tomb of the great Etruscan general [[Lars Porsena]] contained an underground maze. Pliny's description of the exposed portion of the tomb is intractable; Pliny, it seems clear, had not observed this structure himself, but is quoting the historian and Roman antiquarian [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]].

===Ancient labyrinths outside Europe===
[[File:Halebid2.JPG|thumb|right|Carving showing the warrior Abhimanyu entering the ''chakravyuha'' – [[Hoysaleswara temple]], [[Halebidu]], India]]
A design essentially identical to the 7-course "classical" pattern appeared in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture, the [[Tohono O'odham people]] labyrinth which features [[I'itoi]], the "Man in the Maze." The Tonoho O'odham pattern has two distinct differences from the classical: it is radial in design, and the entrance is at the top, where traditional labyrinths have the entrance at the bottom (see below).  The earliest appearances cannot be dated securely; the oldest is commonly dated to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Saward |first=Jeff |date=2003 |title=Labyrinths and Mazes |publisher=Gaia |page=70 |isbn=1579905390 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prehistoric petroglyph on a riverbank in [[Goa]] shows the same pattern and has been dated to circa 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url = https://sites.google.com/site/isiscrete/rationale 
| work = 9th ISIS Congress
| title= Festival on Labyrinth and Symmetry
| date = 9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples have been found among cave art in northern [[India]] and on a dolmen shrine in the [[Nilgiri Mountains]], but are difficult to date accurately. Early labyrinths in India typically follow the Classical pattern or a local variant of it; some have been described as plans of forts or cities.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, ''Labyrinths and Mazes'', p. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Labyrinths appear in Indian manuscripts and [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] texts from the 17th century onward. They are often called "[[Chakravyuha]]" in reference to an impregnable battle formation described in the ancient [[Mahabharata]] epic. Lanka, the capital city of mythic Rāvana, is described as a labyrinth in the 1910 translation of [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Al-Beruni]]'s ''India'' (c. 1030 AD) p.&amp;nbsp;306 (with a diagram on the following page).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000362.html [[Abu Rayhan Biruni|Al-Beruni]], ''India'', (c.1030&amp;nbsp;AD), Edward C. Sachau (translator), Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co, London, 1910] Online version from Columbia University Libraries (Retrieved 5 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[White Sea]], notably on the [[Solovetsky Islands]], there have been preserved more than 30 stone labyrinths. The most remarkable monument is the [[Stone labyrinths of Bolshoi Zayatsky Island]] - a group of 13–14 stone labyrinths on 0.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area of one small island. These labyrinths are thought to be 2,000–3,000 years old.

==Labyrinth as pattern==
In antiquity, the less complicated labyrinth pattern familiar from medieval examples was already developed. In Roman [[floor mosaic]]s, the simple classical labyrinth is framed in the meander border pattern, squared off as the medium requires, but still recognisable. Often an image of the [[Minotaur]] appears in the center of these mosaic labyrinths. Roman meander patterns gradually developed in complexity towards the fourfold shape that is now familiarly known as the [[medieval]] form. The labyrinth retains its connection with death and a triumphant return: at [[Hadrumetum|Hadrumentum]] in [[North Africa]] (now [[Sousse]]), a Roman family tomb has a fourfold labyrinth mosaic floor with a dying minotaur in the center and a mosaic inscription: &lt;small&gt;HICINCLUSUS.VITAMPERDIT&lt;/small&gt; "Enclosed here, he loses life" (Kern 169; Kerényi fig.31).

==Medieval labyrinths and turf mazes==
[[File:Inneres der Kathedrale.jpg|thumb|mimi|right|[[Chartres Cathedral]], about 1750, Jean Baptiste Rigaud]]
When the early humanist [[Benzo d'Alessandria]] visited [[Verona]] before 1310, he noted the "''Laberinthum'' which is now called the [[Arena of Verona|Arena]]";&lt;ref&gt;"quod nunc Harena dicitur": Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' 1969:25.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps he was seeing the ''cubiculi'' beneath the arena's missing floor.
The full flowering of the medieval labyrinth came about from the twelfth through fourteenth centuries with the grand pavement labyrinths of the gothic [[cathedral]]s, notably [[Cathedral of Chartres|Chartres]], [[Reims Cathedral|Reims]] and [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]] in northern [[France]]. These labyrinths may have originated as symbolic allusion to the [[Jerusalem|Holy City]]; and some modern thinkers have theorized that prayers and devotions may have accompanied the perambulation of their intricate paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Labyrinth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some books (in particular guidebooks) suggest that the mazes on cathedral floors served as substitutes for pilgrimage paths, the earliest attested use of the phrase "chemin de Jerusalem" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at [[Reims]] and [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; The accompanying ritual, supposedly involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; However, no contemporary evidence supports the idea that labyrinths had such a purpose for early Christians.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral labyrinths are thought to be the inspiration for the many [[turf maze]]s in the UK, such as survive at [[Wing, Rutland|Wing]], [[Hilton, Cambridgeshire|Hilton]], [[Alkborough Turf Maze|Alkborough]], and [[Saffron Walden]].

Over the same general period, some 500 or more non-ecclesiastical labyrinths were constructed in [[Scandinavia]]. These labyrinths, generally in coastal areas, are marked out with stones, most often in the simple 7- or 11-course classical forms. They often have names which translate as "[[Troy Town]]." They are thought to have been constructed by fishing communities:  trapping malevolent [[troll]]s or winds in the labyrinth's coils might ensure a safe fishing expedition. There are also stone labyrinths on the [[Isles of Scilly]], although none is known to date from before the nineteenth century.

There are examples of labyrinths in many disparate cultures. The symbol has appeared in various forms and media ([[petroglyph]]s, classic-form, medieval-form, pavement, turf, and basketry) at some time throughout most parts of the world, from Native [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] to [[Australia]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[India]], and [[Nepal]].

==Modern labyrinths==
{{original research|section|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Labyrinth.JPG|thumb|left|Labyrinth on floor of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco]].]]
In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in labyrinths and a revival in labyrinth building, of both unicursal and multicursal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Saward |first=Jeff |date=2003 |title=Labyrinths and Mazes |publisher=Gaia |chapter=Chapter 6: The Modern Revival |pages=179–208 |isbn=1579905390 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern imagery, the labyrinth of Daedalus is often represented by a multicursal maze, in which one may become lost.

The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] was entranced with the idea of the labyrinth, and used it extensively in his short stories (such as "The House of Asterion" in ''The Aleph'').  His use of it has inspired other authors (e.g. [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', Mark Z. Danielewski's ''[[House of Leaves]]''). Additionally, [[Roger Zelazny]]'s fantasy series, ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', features a labyrinth, called "the Pattern," which grants those who walk it the power to move between parallel worlds. The avant-garde multi-screen film, ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'', presents a search for meaning in a symbolic modern labyrinth. In [[Rick Riordan]]'s series [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]], the events of the fourth novel ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'' predominantly take place within the labyrinth of Daedalus, which has followed [[History of Western civilization|the heart of the West]] to settle beneath the [[United States]]. Australian author [[Sara Douglass]] incorporated some labyrinthine ideas in her series [[The Troy Game]], in which the Labyrinth on Crete is one of several in the ancient world, created with the cities as a source of magical power. [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''The Dark Labyrinth'' depicts travelers trapped underground in Crete. A magical labyrinth, based on the original myth, appears in the third episode of ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'' ("And The Horns of a Dilemma").

The labyrinth is also treated in contemporary [[fine arts]]. Examples include [[Piet Mondrian]]'s ''Dam and Ocean'' (1915), [[Joan Miró]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (1923), [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''Minotauromachia'' (1935), [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Relativity (M. C. Escher)|Relativity]]'' (1953), [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (1957), [[Jean Dubuffet]]'s ''Logological Cabinet'' (1970), [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]]'s ''[[Connemara]] sculpture'' (1971), [[Joe Tilson]]'s ''Earth Maze'' (1975), [[Richard Fleischner]]'s ''Chain Link Maze'' (1978), [[István Orosz]]'s ''Atlantis Anamorphosis'' (2000), [[Dmitry Rakov]]'s ''Labyrinth'' (2003), and drawings by contemporary American artist Mo Morales employing what the artist calls "Labyrinthine projection." The Italian painter Davide Tonato has dedicated many of his artistic works to the labyrinth theme.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Tonato, ''Labyrinth of Transformations'' (edited by Renzo Margonari), Grafiche Aurora, Verona 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Wallinger]] has created a set of 270 [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every tube station in the [[London Underground]], to mark the 150th anniversary of the Underground.  The plaques were installed over a 16-month period in 2013 and 2014, and each is numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 [[Guinness World Record]] [[Tube Challenge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Labyrinths and mazes have been embraced by the [[video game]] industry, and countless video games include such a feature.

=== Cultural meanings ===
[[Prehistoric]] labyrinths may have served as traps for malevolent spirits or as paths for ritual dances.{{cn|date=September 2013}} Many Roman and Christian labyrinths appear at the entrances of buildings, suggesting that they may have served a similar [[wikt:apotropaic|apotropaic]] purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Mellinkoff, ''Averting Demons'', 2004, Vol. 2, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In their cross-cultural study of signs and symbols, ''Patterns that Connect'', [[Carl Schuster]] and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter|Edmund Carpenter]] present various forms of the labyrinth and suggest various possible meanings, including not only a sacred path to the home of a sacred ancestor, but also, perhaps, a representation of the ancestor him/herself: ."..many [New World] Indians who make the labyrinth regard it as a sacred symbol, a beneficial ancestor, a deity. In this they may be preserving its original meaning: the ultimate ancestor, here evoked by two continuous lines joining its twelve primary joints."&lt;ref name="Schuster 1996 307"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Carl, &amp; Edmund Carpenter|title=Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art|year=1996|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|isbn=978-0-8109-6326-9|page=307}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Schuster also observes the common theme of the labyrinth being a refuge for a trickster; in India, the demon [[Ravana]] has dominion over labyrinths, the trickster Djonaha lives in a labyrinth according to Sumatran [[Batak|Bataks]], and Europeans say it is the home of a rogue.&lt;ref name="Schuster 1996 307"/&gt;

One can think of labyrinths as symbolic of [[pilgrimage]]; people can walk the path, ascending toward salvation or enlightenment. Author [[Ben Radford]] conducted an investigation into some of the claims of spiritual and healing effects of labyrinths, reporting on his findings in his book [[Mysterious New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Mysterious New Mexico|date=2014|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque, NM|isbn=978-0-8263-5450-1|pages=207–224|chapter=Chapter 10 Labyrinths: Sacred Symbols in the Sand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many labyrinths have been constructed recently in churches, hospitals, and parks. These are often used for contemplation; walking among the turnings, one loses track of direction and of the outside world, and thus quiets the mind. The Labyrinth Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwll.veriditas.labyrinthsociety.org/ Labyrinth.Society.org]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a locator for modern labyrinths all over the world.

In addition, the labyrinth can serve as a metaphor for situations that are difficult to be extricated from, as an image that suggests getting lost in a subterranean dungeon-like world. [[Octavio Paz]] titled his book on [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[National identity|identity]] ''[[The Labyrinth of Solitude]]'', describing the Mexican condition as orphaned and lost.

===Christian use===
[[File:Labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral.JPG|thumb|300px|Walking the labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral]]

Labyrinths have on various occasions been used in Christian tradition as a part of worship. The earliest known example is from a fourth-century pavement at the Basilica of St Reparatus, at Orleansville, Algeria, with the words "Sancta Eclesia" {{sic}} at the center, though it is unclear how it might have been used in worship.

In medieval times, labyrinths began to appear on church walls and floors around 1000 C.E.. The most famous medieval labyrinth, with great influence on later practice, was created in [[Chartres Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="kern_church"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the labyrinths is not clear, though there are surviving descriptions of French clerics performing a ritual Easter dance along the path on Easter Sunday.&lt;ref name="kern_church" /&gt;  Some books (guidebooks in particular) suggest that mazes on cathedral floors originated in the medieval period as alternatives to pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the earliest attested use of the phrase "chemin de Jerusalem" (path to Jerusalem) dates to the late 18th century when it was used to describe mazes at [[Reims]] and [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying ritual, depicted in Romantic illustrations as involving pilgrims following the maze on their knees while praying, may have been practiced at Chartres during the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

The use of labyrinths has recently been revived in some contexts of Christian worship. Many churches in Europe and North America have constructed permanent, typically unicursal, labyrinths, or employ temporary ones (e.g., painted on canvas or outlined with candles).  For example, a labyrinth was set up on the floor of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] for a week in March 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tarrant and Sally Dakin, ''Labyrinths and Prayer Stations'', p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative Christians disapprove of labyrinths, considering them pagan practices or "new age" fads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=3440 |title=Maze Craze |author=Mark Tooley |work=Touchstone Magazine |publisher=The Fellowship of St. James |date=September 2000 |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Last Words''''' is the [[autobiography]] of American [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] [[George Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120502583| title=Comedian George Carlin's 'Last Words'| publisher=National Public Radio| date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/28/entertainment/la-et-book28-2009nov28| author=Steve Appleford| title='Last Words' by George Carlin| publisher=Los Angeles Times| date=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published on November 10, [[2009 in literature|2009]]. ''Last Words'' tells the story of his life from his conception, literally, to his final years; he died on June 22, 2008 at the age of 71. He also wrote a special parting gift to the world. The book contains photos taken throughout Carlin's life.

In 1993, George Carlin asked his friend and bestselling author [[Tony Hendra]] to help him write his autobiography, although Carlin called it a "sortabiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-12-29/news/36846900_1_george-carlin-al-sleet-autobiography| author=Jeff Nussbaum| title=George Carlin, daring and delightful to the end| publisher=The Washington Post| date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two of them had scores of conversations, many were recorded, for almost fifteen years. During the conversations, they discussed Carlin's life, times, and evolution as a major comedian artist. After Carlin died, Hendra set out to assemble the book just as Carlin would have wanted.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

This book was also released twice in [[Audiobook]] format.  The first recording at unabridged length narrated by Johnny Heller and the second with George's brother Patrick reading an abridgment.

[[Shape note]]s are a system of music notation designed to facilitate choral singing. Shape notes of various kinds have been used for over two centuries in a variety of sacred choral music traditions practiced primarily in the Southern region of the United States.

"Shape-note singers used [[tune book]]s rather than [[hymnal]]s. Hymnals were pocket-size books with texts only. Tune books were large oblong-shaped books with hard covers (nine inches by six inches was a typical size), often running to over four hundred pages. They included both music and text and were introduced by an extended essay on the rudiments of singing. Each song was known by the name given to its tune rather than by a title drawn from the text."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Steve and Collins, Judy (2003). ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', p.118. {{ISBN|978-0-06-000219-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''partial list of the shape note tunebooks''' published over the last two centuries.  The list is divided according to the two main systems of shape notes—four-shape vs. seven-shape—and within these two categories is sorted chronologically.

'''Louisville Gardens''' is a multi-purpose, 6,000-seat [[arena]], in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], that opened in 1905, as the '''Jefferson County Armory'''. It celebrated its 100th anniversary as former city mayor [[Jerry Abramson]]'s official "Family-Friendly New Years Eve" celebration location. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.

==History==
The facility has served the city of Louisville and [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] in a variety of ways during the past century, from utilization as an actual armory to [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Kentucky Colonels]] basketball games, to various wrestling events, concerts, political rallies, and [[Hurricane Katrina]] flood relief have also been staged there. More recently, [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] used the 3,000-person capacity arena as a training ground for future stars in a minor-league [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] known as [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], until the organization moved to the [[Davis Arena]]. WWE also staged two [[pay-per-view]] events while the venue was known as '''Louisville Gardens''': ([[In Your House 6]] and [[Ground Zero: In Your House|In Your House 17: Ground Zero]]). TNA Wrestling held an event at the venue in 2007. [[Freedom Hall]] replaced the small, aging facility in 1956, as a more popular venue for city events. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (Tuesday, August 23, 1960)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/mlk-jefferson-county-armory&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harry Truman]] both spoke at the arena.

==Use as basketball arena==
Primary home of [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball]] starting in 1945 when [[Bernard Hickman|Bernard "Peck" Hickman]] was head coach until the 1957–58 season when they moved to Freedom Hall. They  played a few more games there up until their last on November 30, 1972. The Louisville Cardinals were 153-23 all time at the armory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20101010/SPORTS0203/310100032/Louisville-basketball-has-had-many-homes-before-KFC-Yum-Center&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]] when led by [[Adolph Rupp]] played 72 games at the armory going 61-11 there from 1937 to 1956&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/statistics/arenajeffersoncountyarmory.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Included in that was games played in the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]] which was held at the armory from 1941 to 1952. Additionally, the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament was held there from 1949 to 1955 and again from 1964 to 1967.

The [[Kentucky Colonels]], of the [[American Basketball Association]], played their home games at the facility, then known as the '''Louisville Convention Center''', from 1967 through 1970. [[Louie Dampier]] was the team's best player in the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522142515/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Kentucky-Colonels.html |archivedate=2015-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 1968, [[Penny Ann Earley]] became the first female to appear in a men's professional league, playing briefly in a home game for the Colonels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remembertheaba.com/OnlyintheABAMaterial/OnlyInTheABA/PAEarly/PAEarly.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Louisville Catbirds]], of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (1983–1985), the [[Louisville Shooters]], of the [[Global Basketball Association]] (1991–1992) and the [[Kentucky Colonels (ABA 2000)|Kentucky Colonels]], of the [[ABA 2000]] (2004–2006), all played their home basketball games at the Louisville Gardens. The [[Louisville Cardinals|University of Louisville]] women's basketball team used the Gardens for six home games in the 1997–98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guide.provations.com/louisville/womensbb2010#pg161 |title=Records: Home/Attendance |work=2010–11 Louisville Cardinals Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=University of Louisville Sports information |format=PDF |page=159 |accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice hockey]] teams to use the Gardens as home ice include the [[Louisville Blades]], [[Louisville Shooting Stars]] and the [[Louisville Rebels]].

==Other names==
The building was also known as the Convention Center or Louisville Convention Center, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. It was renamed Louisville Gardens in 1975 when the Commonwealth Convention Center (now called [[Kentucky International Convention Center]]) was being built.

==Current status==
In 2007, the [[Cordish Company]], manager of the nearby [[Fourth Street Live!]] entertainment complex, agreed to take over operation of "The Gardens" from the [[Louisville Metro Council|Metro Louisville Government]] as part of a $250 million development in [[downtown Louisville]]. In 2012, Cordish was released from its obligations to the Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdrb.com/story/19568501/cordish-obligation-to-revamp-louisville-gardens-optional Cordish obligation to revamp Louisville Gardens 'optional']&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Menippe''' and '''Metioche''' were daughters of [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]]. After Orion was killed they were brought up by their mother, and [[Athena]] taught them the art of weaving and [[Aphrodite]] gave them beauty. Once their homeland [[Aonia]] at the base of [[Mount Helicon|Mt. Helicon]] was struck by a plague, and the oracle of Apollo Gortynius, when consulted, ordered the inhabitants to propitiate the two Erinnyes by the sacrifice of two maidens, who were to offer themselves to death of their own accord. '''Menippe''' and '''Metioche''' offered themselves; they thrice invoked the infernal gods, and killed themselves with their shuttles. [[Persephone]] and [[Hades]] metamorphosed them into comets. The Aonians erected them a sanctuary near [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], where a propitiatory sacrifice was offered to them every year by youths and maidens. The [[Thessaly|Aeolians]] called these maidens Koronides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 13. 685 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'', 18. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Midwest Regional Conservation Guild (MRCG)'''  is a [[Conservation Associations and Professional Organizations|professional conservation association]] in the [[Midwestern United States]].

==History==
[[File:MRCG 25.JPG|thumb|left|Members of the MRCG attending the 25th Annual Meeting in 2005 at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art|IMA]]]]
The MRCG was formed in 1980 by [[art conservation]] and restoration professionals with the purpose of bringing together those individuals in the Midwest region (and beyond) interested in the preservation of [[History|historic]] and [[art]]istic works and to promote fellowship and exchange of ideas on a professional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MRCG By-Laws|url=http://mrcg.wik.is/Officers'_Manual/LEGALITIES_PERTAINING_TO_THE_GUILD/By-Laws|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting of the Guild was held at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA) on Saturday, October 25, 1980.  Art conservation experts specializing in archive, painting, paper, object, and textile conservation from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio met that day to discuss conservation treatment issues, conservation techniques, and the "formation of an information network and cooperative disaster policy for the Midwest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garmel|first=Marion|title=Art Conservators To Form Guild|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|date=October 24, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (IMA) paintings conservator David Miller was the Guild's first president and presided over the first meeting of approximately 40 participants.  The program consisted of an organizational meeting, museum tours, and two slide presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Chicago Area Conservation Group Newsletter|date=January 1981|volume=3|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guild was organized in recognition of the pressing concerns of "museum curators and private collectors alike to preserve great works of art against the ravages of time and the environment, as well as to uncover increasingly sophisticated forgeries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garmel|first=Marion|title=Art Conservators To Form Guild|newspaper=The Indianapolis News|date=October 24, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original purpose and character of the guild was defined by six principles:
# The Guild should provide a framework for knowing other conservators and laboratories in our region.
# The Guild should provide informal exchange of ideas with our colleagues.
# The Guild should serve as a "problem solving forum."
# The Guild could accurately represent our needs to national level agencies.
# Meetings could be held twice a year, rotating geographic location.

==Meeting locations==

'''Museum Island''' ({{lang-de|Museumsinsel}}) is the name of the northern half of an island in the [[Spree]] river in the central [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], the site of the old city of [[Cölln]]. It is so-called for the complex of internationally significant [[museum]]s, all part of the [[Berlin State Museums]], that occupy the island's northern part:
*The [[Altes Museum]] (Old Museum) named as the ''Königliches Museum'' when it was built on August 3, 1830, until it was renamed in 1841. The museum was completed on the orders of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].
*The [[Neues Museum]] (New Museum) finished in 1859 according to plans by [[Friedrich August Stüler]], a student of Schinkel. Destroyed in [[World War II]], it was rebuilt under the direction of [[David Chipperfield]] for the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]] and re-opened in 2009.
*The [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] (Old National Gallery) completed in 1876, also according to designs by [[Friedrich August Stüler]], to host a collection of 19th-century art donated by banker Joachim H. W. Wagener
*The [[Bode Museum]] on the island's northern tip, opened in 1904 and then called ''Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum''. It exhibits the sculpture collections and late Antique and Byzantine art.
*The [[Pergamon Museum]], constructed in 1930. It contains multiple reconstructed immense and historically significant buildings such as the [[Pergamon Altar]] and the [[Ishtar Gate]] of Babylon.
*The [[Humboldt Forum]] will open in 2019 in the [[Berlin Palace]] opposite the Lustgarten park, and will incorporate the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]]; both are successor institutions of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace and which was established in the mid 16th century.

In 1999, the museum complex was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]].

==History==
A first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist [[Aloys Hirt]]. In 1822, Schinkel designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal [[Antikensammlung Berlin|Antikensammlung]], the arrangement of the collection was overseen by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. The island, originally a residential area, was dedicated to "art and science" by King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] in 1841. Further extended under succeeding [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] kings, the museum's collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation after 1918. They are today maintained by the [[Berlin State Museums]] branch of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]].
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-12947-0003, Berlin, Bodemuseum, Pergamonmuseum.jpg|thumb|left|Museum Island with Pergamon and Bode Museum, 1951]]
Museum Island further comprises the [[Lustgarten]] park and the [[Berlin Cathedral]]. Between the Bode and Pergamon Museums it is crossed by the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] railway viaduct. The adjacent territory to the south is the site of the former royal and imperial [[Berlin Palace]] and the [[Palace of the Republic (Berlin)|Palace of the Republic]].

The Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited after [[German reunification]], except for some art and artefacts removed after World War II by [[Allies of World War II|Allied troops]].   These include the [[Priam's Treasure]], also called ''the gold of [[Troy]]'', excavated by [[Heinrich Schliemann]] in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to Moscow.  Today it is kept at the [[Pushkin Museum]] in [[Moscow]].

As for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's buildings should be restored and modernized, with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Peter-Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a ''Louvre on the Spree''.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (March 12, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/12/arts/berlin-banking-its-museums-seeking-new-identity-city-shakes-up-its-art-legacy.html Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government pledged $20 million a year through 2010 for projects to enhance Berlin's prestige and [[Unesco]] declaring the island a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Butler (December 2, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/world/berlin-museum-s-revival-bolsters-german-identity.html Berlin Museum's Revival Bolsters German Identity] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its name, retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of [[Queen Nefertiti]]. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum's paintings went from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (March 12, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/12/arts/berlin-banking-its-museums-seeking-new-identity-city-shakes-up-its-art-legacy.html Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Once this process is completed, perhaps by 2020, the Gemäldegalerie’s painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/design/27bode.html German Museums Move Closer to Reunification] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[James Simon Gallery]], a $94 million visitors’ center designed by the British architect [[David Chipperfield]], is being built beside the Neues Museum. It will in turn be linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated with archaeological objects.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/design/27bode.html German Museums Move Closer to Reunification] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums in the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross-total of the collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Parzinger (December 17, 2015), [http://scfh.ru/en/papers/museum-island-and-humboldt-forum/ Museum Island and Humboldt-Forum: A New Centre for Art and Culture in Berlin] ''[[SCIENCE First Hand]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum Island is referenced in the song "On the Museum Island" by folk artist [[Emmy the Great]].

The southern section of the island, south of Gertraudenstraße, is commonly referred to as [[Fischerinsel]] (Fisher Island) and is the site of a high-rise apartment development built when Mitte was part of [[East Berlin]].

The '''National Gugak Center''', located in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], is the primary institution of learning for Korean traditional music.

With a history dating back to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Eumseongseo|ko|3=음성서}} music institute of the [[Silla]] kingdom in the 7th century, The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts was founded under its present name in 1950.

It is dedicated to "preserving and promoting traditional Korean music."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170302033024/http://www.gugak.go.kr/eng/min/introduction.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;  Through academic courses, private study, ensembles, research, and performances, it preserves Korea's ancient musical traditions, including the ancient court ritual music called ''[[aak]]'' as well as the ritual music performed for the [[Jongmyo]] (royal ancestral shrine) and the [[Munmyo]] ([[Korean Confucianism|Confucian]] shrine).

==Exhibition history==
The painting was first shown at the World Exhibition in [[Vienna]] in 1873 where it won a gold medal.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; It was later displayed at an international exhibition of art at the [[Akademie der Künste|Academy of Art in Berlin]] in 1896 while Gude was a professor at the Academy, and yet later still it was shown in [[Dresden]] in 1904, the year after Gude's death.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt;

==Scene and style==
The painting shows a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] rendering of a storm hitting a Norwegian harbor, with a [[brig]] stranded in the distant breakers.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; The painting is divided into a foreground, where women and children watch the rescue effort; a middle ground, where various moored ships bob in the strong waves; and a background, where wavelike rocks enclose the refuge point and bring the eye down to the stranded brig.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; The colors used are predominantly the [[blue]]-[[grey]] of the sea and the [[beige]] of the reflections on the sea which serve to unify the piece.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; Various elements of the scene including the waterfront buildings, the groups of figures, and the departing [[rowboat]], would be reused by Gude in later works.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt;

==Ownership==
In 1875, the painting was purchased by the Bremen Art Society, although Gude incorrectly identifies them as the [[Stadtgalerie Bremen]] in his notes about the sale.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; In 1907 the painting was transferred to the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; In 1920 the painting was auctioned off due in part to changing tastes in art and the painting's large size ({{convert|4.78|m2|sqft|abbr=on|disp=or}}&lt;ref name="HFG" /&gt;) which made it difficult to store.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt; In 1932 the painting was auctioned off again in [[Oslo]] where it was purchased by its current owner.&lt;ref name="Realism" /&gt;

'''Orthographic projection''' (sometimes '''orthogonal projection'''), is a means of representing [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects in [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]. It is a form of [[parallel projection]], in which all the projection lines are [[orthogonal]] to the [[projection plane]],&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Maynard | first = Patric | title = Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 22 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic | isbn = 0-8014-7280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in every plane of the scene appearing in [[affine transformation]] on the viewing surface. The obverse of an orthographic projection is an [[oblique projection]], which is a parallel projection in which the projection lines are ''not'' orthogonal to the projection plane.

The term ''orthographic'' is sometimes reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes of the object are also parallel with the projection plane,&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt; but these are better known as ''[[multiview projection]]s''. Furthermore, when the principal planes or axes of an object in an orthographic projection are ''not'' parallel with the projection plane, but are rather tilted to reveal multiple sides of the object, the projection is called an ''[[axonometric projection]]''. Sub-types of ''multiview projection'' include ''plans'', ''elevations'' and ''sections''. Sub-types of ''axonometric projection'' include ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projections''.

A lens providing an orthographic projection is known as an [[Telecentric lens#Object-space telecentric lenses|object-space telecentric lens]].

== Geometry ==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]]]]
[[File:Various projections of cube above plane.svg|thumb|Various projections and how they are produced]]
A simple orthographic [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] onto the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] ''z'' = 0 can be defined by the following matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For each point ''v'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;), the transformed point would be
:&lt;math&gt;
Pv = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Often, it is more useful to use [[homogeneous coordinates]].  The transformation above can be represented for homogeneous coordinates as 
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

For each homogeneous vector ''v'' = (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1), the transformed vector would be
:&lt;math&gt;
Pv = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ v_z \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
v_x \\ v_y \\ 0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computer graphics]],  one of the most common matrices used for orthographic [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] can be defined by a [[n-tuple|6-tuple]], (''left'', ''right'', ''bottom'', ''top'', ''near'', ''far''), which defines the [[Clipping_(computer_graphics)|clipping]] planes.  These planes form a box with the minimum corner at (''left'', ''bottom'', -''near'') and the maximum corner at (''right'', ''top'', -''far'').

The box is translated so that its center is at the origin, then it is scaled to the unit cube which is defined by having a minimum corner at (-1,-1,-1) and a maximum corner at (1,1,1).

The orthographic transform can be given by the following matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{right-left} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{right+left}{right-left} \\
0 &amp; \frac{2}{top-bottom} &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{top+bottom}{top-bottom} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-2}{far-near} &amp; -\frac{far+near}{far-near} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be given as a [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] followed by a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
P = ST = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{right-left} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \frac{2}{top-bottom} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{2}{far-near} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{left+right}{2} \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -\frac{top+bottom}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; -\frac{far+near}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The inversion of the Projection Matrix, which can be used as the Unprojection Matrix is defined:

&lt;math&gt;
P^{-1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{right-left}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{left+right}{2} \\
0 &amp; \frac{top-bottom}{2} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{top+bottom}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{far-near}{-2} &amp;  -\frac{far+near}{2} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{main|Multiview projection|Axonometric projection}}
[[Image:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a ''multiview projection'' is either third-angle (right) or first-angle (left).]]
With ''multiview projections'', up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, usually three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. Other names for these views include ''plan'', ''elevation'' and ''section''.

The term ''axonometric projection'' (not to be confused with the related ''[[axonometry|principle of axonometry]]'', as described in [[Pohlke's theorem]]) is used to describe the type of orthographic projection where the plane or axis of the object depicted is ''not'' parallel to the projection plane, and where multiple sides of an object are visible in the same image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = William |author2=Malcolm McCullough | title = Digital design media | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | date = 1994 | pages = 169 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZoGgQEhKkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-471-28666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further subdivided into three groups: ''isometric'', ''dimetric'' and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.&lt;ref name="maynard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4eYq7-2YhYC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Advanced graphics programming using openGL|last=McReynolds|first=Tom|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-55860-659-9|pages=502|author2=David Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic of axonometric projection (and other pictorials) is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

== Cartography ==
{{main|Orthographic projection in cartography}}
[[File:Orthographic projection SW.jpg|thumb|right|Orthographic projection (equatorial aspect) of eastern hemisphere 30°W&amp;ndash;150°E]]
An orthographic projection map is a [[map projection]] of [[cartography]]. Like the [[stereographic projection]] and [[gnomonic projection]], orthographic projection is a [[perspective projection|perspective (or azimuthal) projection]], in which the [[sphere]] is projected onto a [[tangent plane]] or [[secant plane]].  The ''point of perspective'' for the orthographic projection is at [[Infinity|infinite]] distance.  It depicts a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] of the [[globe]] as it appears from [[outer space]], where the [[horizon]] is a [[great circle]].  The shapes and areas are [[Distortion#Map projections|distorted]], particularly near the edges.&lt;ref name="SnyderWorkingManual"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Snyder, J. P.| title=Map Projections—A Working Manual (US Geologic Survey Professional Paper 1395) | publisher=US Government Printing Office | location=Washington, D.C.| year=1987 | pages=145–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder16"&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections'' pp. 16–18. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-76746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The orthographic projection has been known since antiquity, with its cartographic uses being well documented. [[Hipparchus]] used the projection in the 2nd century BC to determine the places of star-rise and star-set. In about 14 BC, Roman engineer [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] used the projection to construct sundials and to compute sun positions.&lt;ref name="Snyder16"&gt;Snyder, John P. (1993). ''Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections'' pp. 16–18. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-76746-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitruvius also seems to have devised the term orthographic (from the Greek ''orthos'' (= “straight”) and graphē (= “drawing”) for the projection. However, the name ''[[analemma]]'', which also meant a sundial showing latitude and longitude, was the common name until [[François d'Aguilon]] of Antwerp promoted its present name in 1613.&lt;ref name="Snyder16"/&gt;

The earliest surviving maps on the projection appear as woodcut drawings of terrestrial globes of 1509 (anonymous), 1533 and 1551 (Johannes Schöner), and 1524 and 1551 (Apian).&lt;ref name="Snyder16"/&gt;

A '''paintings conservator''' is an individual responsible for protecting [[cultural heritage]] in the form of painted works of art. These individuals are most often under the employ of [[museums]], [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] centers, or other cultural institutions.  They oversee the physical care of collections, and are trained in chemistry and practical application of techniques for repairing and restoring paintings.

==Responsibilities and duties==

===Collaboration===
A paintings conservator works with a number of museum professionals to ensure painted works of art receive the best quality of care.  This individual may be called upon by a Registrar/Collections Manager (RCM) in the event of an emergency, such as accidental damage.  A paintings conservator may also be called upon to consult with the RCM and an [[exhibition]] design team to ensure a work is stable enough for display, and determine how much exposure to environmental factors, such as humidity or light, it can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Gilmore, J. A. (2010). MRM5: Museum registration methods (5th ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive care===
Preventive care is the abating of potential deterioration and damage to a painting through previously designated policies and procedures surrounding the object's storage and handling.

====Emergency preparedness====

Emergency preparedness and an emergency plan are crucial pieces to have in place for a museum.  It informs conservators, RCMs, and all other museum personnel how to respond to disasters that may strike their institution, and therefore its collections.  These plans can be expansive, detailing a number of procedures for different contingencies, such as fire, flooding, and even war.  Protective measures in an emergency plan should include prevention through risk management, preparedness and response training, and recovery arrangements.  An institution should know which staff member's are delegated to a project during a given circumstance, and be able to tell them how they will assess and move forward with the help of an emergency plan.&lt;ref&gt;Dorge, V., &amp; Jones, S. L. (1999). Building an emergency plan: A guide for museums and other cultural institutions. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated pest management (IPM)====
{{Main|Museum integrated pest management}}

Integrated pest management (IPM) is the strategy used by a museum to handle pests such as mold, insects, or mice.  An IPM program may address structural and environmental issues that contribute to the pest problem.  This could include preventing initial entry of pests into the structure through building maintenance, moderating the interior climate, and setting up an insect monitoring system.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. (n.d.). Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Retrieved from https://peabody.harvard.edu/node/275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like an emergency plan, IPM can be time-consuming and require a number of responsibilities from each staff member.  However, if pests do become an issue for a single painting or the entire museum, an IPM system will be helpful to have in place.  Prevention is a key part of IPM, as chemical pesticides and fumigants can also be harmful to collections.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins Arenstein, R., Duncan, N., Elkin, L., Monk, R., &amp; Norris, C. (2008).

AIC Objects Specialty Group Postprints, 15, 69-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storage, handling, and loan travel====

Inter-museum loans can put paintings at great risk, simply due to the fact that they are being moved.  The amount of stress a painting can withstand is determined by a number of pre-existing factors, such as canvas and painting technique.  Prior to the loan, a paintings conservator will assess the structure of the work for weaknesses and potential areas at risk.  This helps determine if a piece is suitable for a loan and how it will be packed and transported.  Preparation for a loaned painting generally involves padding the work's frame and ensuring it is properly mounted, determination as to whether it will need a backing board, and what repairs the frame may need prior to transport. The paintings conservator may also be called upon to collaborate with other personnel from the loaning museum to assess the environment of the institution that is borrowing the work.  He or she may also take into consideration the travel route between the loaning and the borrowing institutions.  The transit planner must consider environmental conditions on the route, how often the work will need to be handled, and security.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, M., Mecklenburg, M. F., &amp; Merrill, R. M. (1991). Art in transit: Handbook for packing and transporting paintings. Washington: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examination===
[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston]]
Examination is a series of scientific processes by which a paintings conservator collects information regarding the materials used, the technique of the painter, and what has contributed to the painting's current state.  Examination is a process that has evolved with the field of conservation.  Taking samples of materials in a painting has decreased in favor of less invasive techniques for analysis.  Examination has become a crucial part of the museum, conservation, and art historical worlds, helping to place paintings within a cultural and historical context.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. (2005). Scientific examination of art: Modern techniques in conservation and analysis. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
{{Main|Art restoration}}

A painting's natural aging process, as well as environmental factors, can require intervention by a paintings conservator to restore the work.  Reasons for restoration may include water damage, tearing, flaking, and a weakened canvas.  The primary goal of a paintings conservator conducting a restoration is to ensure the work is stable.  From there, they may integrate repairs that preserve the artist's original intent.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). What Does It Mean To Have A Painting Restored And How Do I Pick A Conservator? Retrieved from http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/conservation_meaning.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation and uses==

===Imaging methods===

'''Ultraviolet light'''

Ultraviolet light examinations are used to reveal varnishes and their ages, as well as previous treatments to a painting.  Varnishes fluoresce under UV light and dark spots reveal areas of retouching.  Brightness of the painting's glow also helps to reveal the type of varnish used.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. (2000, December). The use Of ultraviolet induced visible-fluorescence In the examination Of museum objects, Part II. Conserve O Gram, 1/10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The paintings conservation laboratory at the [[Lunder Conservation Center]]]]
'''Raking Light'''
{{Main|Raking light}}

Raking light is an oblique-angled light that can record condition problems of a painting, showing the extent of the damage to a particular work.  Raking light also aids in identifying the topography of brush strokes in paintings, sometimes revealing the underlying original intent of an artist.

'''Infrared light'''

The use of infrared lighting can reveal the working methods of an artist, such as initial sketches and perspective lines drawn on a canvas.  This method is effective on works that have a contrasting pale ground.&lt;ref&gt;Williamstown Art Conservation Center. (2008). Technical Imaging of Paintings [Brochure]. Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-radiography'''

X-radiographs of a painting allow conservators to see beneath the work's surface.  The use of this method also helps distinguish between materials that look similar under visible light, but have different x-ray absorption. For example, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] used x-radiography on a painting by [[Jean-Francois Millet]] entitled ''The Wood Sawyers.''  The image below showed a woman representing the French Republic, a submission to a competition that Millet would lose.  Without the means to pay for a new canvas, Millet painted over the existing image.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum. (n.d.). X-radiography of paintings. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/x/x-radiography-of-paintings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasers===
The use of lasers allows for control and accuracy in the removal of aged or deteriorated layers on painted works, as well as identifying materials and layers within a painting.  In 2012, Duke University scientists developed a laser for melanoma diagnoses.  Through work with the [[National Gallery]] and the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], the scientists have determined that this laser can also be used to identify the chemical signatures of pigments and three-dimensional structures in layers of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, A. (2012, August 20). Duke Research - Lasers ID ancient artists' intent. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821211051/http://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |archivedate=2012-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Duke University chemist also invented a useful laser for painting conservators that removes layers of old varnish.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. (2013, August 9). Art Under the Laser – New "Noninvasive" Conservation and Analysis Treatments. Retrieved from http://artwatchinternational.org/articles/art_under_the_laser&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varnishes===
Varnishes are applied to paintings to enhance the appearance of the image, as well as to protect it over time.  When dry, varnishes are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes.  Varnishes may be organic or synthetic.  Since natural varnishes tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Painting varnishes. Retrieved from http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/painting_varnish.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new varnish.  Varnishes often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.

==Education and training==
[[File:Бобров Ф.Ю со студентами. 2010 г..jpg|thumb|Paintings conservators at work]]
A paintings conservator will likely have acquired a master's degree, or higher.  There are several graduate programs throughout the United States, and the world, for arts [[conservation and restoration training]].  The education and training of a conservator will vary depending on the institution he or she is employed by, but paintings conservators will have knowledge of chemistry and the physical sciences as related to the deterioration and protection of cultural heritage in painted works.  Practical application of training may be applied in the form of internships or fellowships, depending on the level of education an individual has received.

==Controversies==

Conservation and the practice of restoration are controversial themselves, as they involve permanent changes made to an artist's work.  This is why it is important for a paintings conservator to examine a work closely before making restorative changes.  In doing so, they can often identify original varnishes and layers that contributed to the artist's intent for the appearance of the work.  However, even close examination and careful restoration does not protect a paintings conservator or a work from being the center of controversy.

===Sistine Chapel restoration===
{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}

Restoration of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has been ongoing during the latter part of the twentieth century.  Much of the criticism and controversy surrounding the restoration is that previous attempts to restore the frescoes have done more damage than good.  Critics of modern restoration have suggested a more conservative approach to prevent further deterioration, rather than contribute to its problems through restorative measures.

===''The Last Supper''===

Restoration on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Last Supper (da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' finished in 1999 after two decades of work.  Many believe the work done was clumsy, with some features being unrecognizably bright while others went missing altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Restored `Last Supper' Provokes Critics. (1999, May 28). Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905280144_1_restoration-masterpiece-grazie-church&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santuario de la Misericordia Fresco===
{{main|Ecce Homo (Martínez and Giménez, Borja)}}
In 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman without conservation training, attempted to restore an ''Ecce Homo'' fresco in a Spanish church.  The fresco had been flaking due to moisture on the walls, and this reportedly upset the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Minder, R. (2012, August 23). Despite Good Intentions, a Fresco in Spain Is Ruined. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/europe/botched-restoration-of-ecce-homo-fresco-shocks-spain.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her resulting restorative work left the portrait with what many have described as looking monkeyish, with cartoonish eyes and a smudged mouth.  The restoration attempt came to light after a family member of the original artist proposed a fund for conservation work.

The '''''Paradiesgärtlein''''' (''Garden of Paradise'') is a [[panel painting]] created around 1410 by an unknown painter referred to as ''[[Upper Rhenish Master]]''. It belongs to the ''Mary in the rose bower'' type. The ''Paradiesgärtlein'' is one of the earliest paintings to naturalistically depict flora and fauna
==Painting==
The panel painting is created about 1410. The painter is unknown, referred to as the ''Upper Rhenish Master'' or formerly  ''Master of the (Frankfurter) Paradiesgärtlein''.  The painting is executed in mixed techniques on wood; it measures about 26 by 33 centimetres. It is on display at the [[Städel]] Museum in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.
==Motif==
The painting belongs to the ''Maria im Rosenhag'' (''Mary in the rose bower'') type, but the painter adapted that style uniquely. In contrast to depictions current at the time, the [[Virgin Mary]] is not depicted in the centre of the image, but in the upper left corner, engrossed in a book. She is surrounded by Saints. To her right, [[Dorothea of Caesarea|Saint Dorothy]] is plucking a [[cherry]], [[Saint Barbara]] is drawing water from a [[Water well|well]], and [[Saint Cecilia]] holds a [[psaltery]], on which the [[Child Jesus]] is plucking the strings. At the feet of [[Saint George]], there is a small dead dragon, and at those of [[Archangel Michael]], a small black [[demon]]. [[Oswald of Northumbria|Saint Oswald]] is leaning against a tree trunk.

==Flora and fauna==
The ''Paradiesgärtlein'' is one of the earliest paintings to naturalistically depict plants; they are all clearly recognisable. Most are [[Marian symbol]]s. Near the wall, the birds are also realistic. The painting depicts:

;Plants
''[[Aquilegia]]'', ''[[Veronica (plant)|Veronica]]'', [[strawberry]], ''[[Alchemilla]]'', [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], [[wallflower]], ''[[Vinca]]'', [[cherry]], [[clover]], [[Lilium|lily]], [[snowflake (plant)|snowflake]], [[lily of the valley]], ''[[Malva]]'', [[Leucanthemum vulgare|oxeye daisy]], ''[[Dianthus]]'', ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]'', [[rose]], ''[[Primula veris]]'', [[iris (plant)|iris]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[red deadnettle]], [[Viola (plant)|violet]], ''[[Plantago]]'', ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'', ''[[Hypericum]]'', ''[[Matthiola]]''.

;Birds
[[Common kingfisher]], [[great tit]], [[Eurasian bullfinch]], [[golden oriole]], [[common chaffinch]], [[European robin]], [[great spotted woodpecker]], [[Bohemian waxwing]], [[European goldfinch]], [[long-tailed tit]], [[blue tit]], [[hoopoe]].

; Insects

[[File:New Living Pictures (8617836771).jpg|thumb|[[Dublin tramways]] running through Parnell Square and [[O'Connell Street]] in the [[Edwardian era]].]]

'''Parnell Square''' ({{Irish place name|Cearnóg Parnell|no_translate=yes}}) is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[town square|square]] sited at the northern end of [[O'Connell Street]], and west of [[Mountjoy Square]], in the city of [[Dublin]] (now Dublin 1), Ireland.

Formerly named ''Rutland Square'', it was renamed after [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846–1891), as was [[Parnell Street]], which forms the southern side of the square. Surrounded on three sides by terraces of original intact [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian houses]], much of the southern part of the square and its centre is taken up by extensions of the [[Rotunda Hospital]]. The [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] is located along the northern side of this area. Its main entrance is on the eastern side of the square, with a smaller entrance on the northern side of the square.

In the south easterly corner of the square, where it meets with O'Connell Street, is sited the [[Gate Theatre]], and the Ambassador and Pillar Room venues. Entertainments were originally developed here as part of the Rotunda Hospital scheme by [[Bartholomew Mosse]] as a revenue engine to pay for the running of what was Europe's first lying-in maternity hospital. Extensive pleasure gardens, subsequently forming the body of the square, were located to the rear of the hospital in the original development.

The [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery]] is on the north side of the square. It was erected in cut stone by [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] to a design by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] during the Georgian period. On this side also is the [[Dublin Writers Museum]] and the Irish Writers' Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writerscentre.ie Irish Writer's Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; The striking [[Gothic Revival]] Findlater's Church ([[Abbey Presbyterian Church, Dublin|Abbey Presbyterian Church]]) just up from the gallery on the same side was erected in the 1860s by Alexander Findlater, at his own expense, and which he presented to the [[Presbyterian]] congregation. One of Dublin's most acclaimed{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} restaurants, Michelin Star since 2007, ''Chapter One'', is located on the northern side of Parnell Square between the [[Hugh Lane Gallery]] and the Writers Museum. On the south side of the square is Conway's bar (now closed), outside of which [[Pearse]] surrendered to the [[British Army]] after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. The political party [[Sinn Féin]] has its Dublin head office and shop on the western side of the square.  The western side also is known for offices of a number of [[Irish Congress of Trades Unions|trades unions]] and other organisations.  Also on the western side is the St. Martin's Apostolate office, which includes a small basement chapel.  The St. Martin's Apostolate office is well known in Dublin for its moving [[Nativity scene|crib]] that is open to the public each Christmas.

==Famous historic residents and events==
[[File:Dublin September 2009 061 b pt.jpg|thumb|200px|Dublin Writers' Museum]]

No 5 – Birthplace of [[Oliver St John Gogarty]] (1878–1957); writer, surgeon, and senator. A friend of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and the writers [[WB Yeats]] and [[James Joyce]], Gogarty was unwillingly immortalised as [[Buck Mulligan]] in the ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. From the early 1920s until the early 1930s No 5 served as headquarters of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], the governing party.

No 9 Cavendish Row – Dr [[Bartholomew Mosse]] (1713–1759); Philanthropist and surgeon. Mosse lived here, having originally hailed from Portlaoise. He founded the Rotunda Hospital, located in the square and which was built to designs of [[Richard Cassels]] between 1751 and 1757. The emergence of Parnell Square as a square is largely attributable to the pleasure gardens him as he laid out pleasure gardens to pay for the hospital.

No. 14 Parnell Square was the headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge in the 1940s and 1950s and perhaps into the 1960s. The Ard-chraobh of the Gaelic League was in this building.

No 25 Parnell Square, Gaelic League building. This building is of great significance during the period surrounding the War of Independence as it was here on 9 September 1914 that a meeting held by Supreme Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) with selected others agreed to rise up against the British before the Great War, subsequently known as the [[First World War]], would be finished: In attendance were [[Eamonn Ceannt]], [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[James Connolly]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[John MacBride]], [[Sean MacDermott]], Sean McGarry, William "Bill" O'Brien, [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], [[Padraig Pearse]], [[Joseph Plunkett]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

No 29 – 30 Parnell Square – Formerly Vaughan's Hotel; a favourite hiding and meeting place for Michael Collins.

[[File:Let's Dance Memorial Parnell Square 1.jpg|thumb|right|Let's Dance memorial to the [[Miami Showband killings]] on Parnell Square North]] 
No 41 Parnell Square – this building was formerly the Irish National Forester's Hall. Prior to 1916 it was used for drilling both by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) and the Volunteers; on the eve of the outbreak of the [[Easter Rising]] [[Éamon de Valera]] assembled the 3rd Battalion here. In 1922, subsequent to the Treaty and prior to the Civil War, the IRB again met here in a failed attempt at achieving consensus on the Treaty; among the attendees were Michael Collins, [[Harry Boland]], [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] – all of whom, with the exception of O'Duffy, were dead by the end of the [[Irish Civil War]].

No 44 Parnell Square – The [[Kevin Barry]] memorial hall is the current headquarters of [[Sinn Féin]].

No 46 Parnell Square – Formerly the Headquarters of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], the Irish language league, this was the venue where [[Thomas MacDonagh]] assembled the 2nd Battalion the Sunday night on the eve of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. In August 1917, the meetings that led to the National Executive of the [[Irish Republican Army]] being established were also here, with persons present including Éamon de Valera, [[Thomas Ashe]], [[Cathal Brugha]], and Michael Collins. Subsequently on 19 September 1919, in the company of [[Richard Mulcahy]], Michael Collins set up his famous "Squad", composed of top-level operatives – men who would ultimately be involved with highest priority missions, such as the elimination of the British "G Men" agents in 1920.

No 58 Parnell Square – The Sinn Féin Bookshop and the offices of the ''[[An Phoblacht]]'' newspaper.

[[File:Parnell Square North.jpg|thumb|left|The northern side of Parnell Square, with the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] at left, [[Hugh Lane Gallery]] recessed at right, and former Coláiste Mhuire buildings at far end]]

In June 2015, plans were revealed for the development of the northern side of Parnell Square into a cultural district. The street will be turned into a pedestrian space, the city's main library will move to the former Coláiste Mhuire buildings, a new auditorium will be built, and the gardens attached to the Rotunda Hospital will be opened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/parnell-square-cultural-quarter-green-light-for-60m-project-1.2237898|title=Parnell Square cultural quarter?

The '''Providence Art Club''' is an art club founded in 1880, and located on Thomas Street in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]. The club has studios, galleries and a clubhouse in a "picturesque procession of historic houses," which are across the street from the [[First Baptist Church in America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://providenceartclub.org/about-us/|website=Providence Art Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of those buildings is the [[Fleur-de-lys Studios]].

'''''Red Pawn''''' is a [[screenplay]] written by [[Ayn Rand]]. It was the first screenplay that Rand sold. [[Universal Pictures]] purchased it in 1932.&lt;ref name=peikoff&gt;{{Harvnb|Peikoff|1984|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Red Pawn'' features the theme of the evil of dictatorship, specifically of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].

''Red Pawn'' is a [[spy thriller]] set on Strastnoy Island in an undisclosed location in northern [[USSR|Soviet Russia]] during the 1920s. On the island is a converted monastery used as an institution for [[political prisoner]]s. The screenplay follows Joan Harding, aka Frances Volkontzev, an American woman who infiltrates Strastnoy Island to free her imprisoned husband, Michael Volkontzev.

Joan enters the prison under the pretext of being the new wife of the prison head Commandant Kareyev given to him by the state. A [[love triangle]] develops between the three characters as Joan works to free her husband while fooling the prison staff and Kareyev as to her true intentions.

The rights to the screenplay belong to [[Paramount Pictures]], though the screenplay has never been adapted to film.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt;

== Plot ==

Joan Harding arrives by boat at Strastnoy Island and is presented to Commandant Kareyev as his new, state-granted wife. Kareyev greets Joan coldly, believing that she will leave when the next boat comes six months later. Kareyev takes Joan on a tour around the prison island during which she observes the prisoners. Joan's husband, Michael Volkontzev, recognizes her and calls out to her, but she pretends not to recognize him. It is only later in her room that Joan (real name Frances Volkontzeva) reunites with Michael and tells him of her plan to free him. She will sneak him onto the next boat and help him escape the country through the help of an English merchant in the nearby town of [[Nizhnekolymsk|Nijni Kolimsk]]. She asks that Michael trust her and keep his distance so Kareyev and others do not suspect that they know each other.

Months pass and Joan becomes friends with many of the [[political prisoner]]s on the island, and slowly Commandant Kareyev begins to feel affection for her. Michael is torn over how his wife seems to return that affection and begins to doubt his wife's intentions. Joan arranges for Michael to sneak onto the next boat while the guard is given leave by Kareyev at her insistence, but she will not be joining Michael on the boat. He is to go alone while she stays with Kareyev. Joan tells Michael to meet up with the merchant and that in order to avoid suspicion, she would follow in the coming months.

The night of his escape, Michael barges into Kareyev's room and tells the Commandant that he has attempted to escape and reveals that Joan is his wife. Kareyev has his assistant, Comrade Fedossitch, place Michael in detention and tell Joan that she will be taking the ferry the next day to leave Strastnoy Island. Joan confesses her love for Kareyev and begs him to leave his post and escape with her and Michael, so that she and Kareyev can live together. Kareyev considers her offer but refuses, saying that he cannot betray his Party and his comrades. He tells Joan to pack her things to depart alone in the morning.

Fedossitch confronts Kareyev, telling him Joan should be arrested for deceiving them and the Party. Kareyev puts Fedossitch under arrest and then goes to Joan's room and tells her to follow him to the detention tower to free Michael, so all three of them can escape. The three board the ferry and make their way to shore where they commandeer a horse sled from a local farmer. As the trio make their way to shore, it is discovered that Michael, Joan, and Kareyev are no longer on the island and Fedossitch is freed by a fellow officer. Fedossitch finds that the radio is destroyed, so he alerts the shore of the escape using the monastery's bell and light signals.

Kareyev, Michael, and Joan attempt to flee to the merchant's house and are forced to seek shelter in an empty barn. The two men begin fighting over who should be with Joan. They ask her who she loves, but before Joan has the chance to answer they are discovered and arrested. The commanding officer reveals that Joan and the traitorous commandant are to be taken to the [[State Political Directorate]] headquarters in Nijni Kolimsk, mentioning that it is across the street from an English merchant's house. Joan realizes there is still hope if they can escape their cells and go across the street. However, the commander reveals that Michael is to be taken away for immediate execution. The soldier, unable to distinguish the two male captives, asks Joan to identify which man is her husband. Joan points to Kareyev and tells soldiers he is the one; he makes no objections. The screenplay ends as Kareyev is taken away for execution while Joan and Michael are driven to Nijni Kolimsk with the hope of escape and a future together.

==History==
Rand began writing ''Red Pawn'' in 1931.&lt;ref name=t1&gt;{{harvnb|Trammell|2004|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had emigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to starting ''Red Pawn'', she had worked as a junior screenwriter for [[Cecil&amp;nbsp;B. DeMille]], but by 1931 she was working in the wardrobe department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been writing her debut novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', but took a break to write the screenplay in hopes of earning enough money to allow her to write full-time. She sold the screenplay and the synopsis to Universal Pictures in 1932 for $1,500, her first professional sale.&lt;ref name=peikoff/&gt; The studio postponed the filming of the screenplay several times, and with Hollywood entering its [[Red Decade]], the anti-Soviet themes of the film made it unattractive to filmmakers.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Universal later traded the property to Paramount, which has held onto the rights since, although ''Red Pawn'' has never been filmed.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

==Significance==
Professor of literature at [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson College]] Jena Trammell has cited ''Red Pawn'' as a crucial point in Rand's career and in the development of her aesthetic philosophy, [[romantic realism]].&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;

''We the Living'', finally published in 1936, shares some basic plotlines with ''Red Pawn''. Both feature a [[love triangle]] set against the background of the early [[Soviet Union]], with the woman protagonist having an anti-Communist lover and a Communist one, and with the Communist finally compromising or renouncing his ideological allegiance for love of her.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">[[File:Olofsborg från sjösidan.JPG|thumb|420px|St. Olaf's Castle, the venue for the Opera Festival in Savonlinna.]] 
'''Savonlinna Opera Festival''' ({{lang-fi|Savonlinnan oopperajuhlat}}) is held annually in the city of [[Savonlinna]] in [[Finland]]. The Festival takes place at the medieval [[Olavinlinna]] (St. Olaf's Castle), built in 1475. The [[castle]] is located amid spectacular lake scenery.

== Origin ==
The birth of the Savonlinna Opera Festival ties in closely with the emerging [[Finland|Finnish]] identity and striving for independence at the beginning of the 20th century. Attending a nationalist meeting in [[Olavinlinna]] Castle in 1907, the Finnish soprano [[Aino Ackté]], already famous at opera houses the world over and an ardent patriot, immediately spotted the potential of the [[castle]] as the venue for an [[opera]] festival.

The first opera festival was held in 1912.&lt;ref name="Symington2009"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=Lonely Planet
|isbn=978-1-74104-771-4
|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aino Ackté]] directed the festival for five summers, staging four [[Finland|Finnish]] [[opera]]s. The only [[opera]] by a non-Finnish composer was [[Charles Gounod]]’s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', with Ackté herself in the leading female role of Marguerite.

In 1917 the festival ran into difficulties because of [[First World War]], [[History of Finland|Finnish Declaration of Independence]] and the ensuing [[Finnish Civil War]].

For fifty years, the [[opera]] festival was dormant, but in 1967,  Savonlinna Music Days decided to organise an opera course for young singers. The high point of the course was a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' in the castle. Therefore, 1967 is nowadays regarded as the start of the present Festival; since then it has had steady growth of both audience and reputation.

== Present-day festival ==
[[File:Scenen på borggården, Olofsborg.JPG|thumb|275px|The stage at the courtyard of St. Olaf's Castle.]]
The Savonlinna Opera Festival has grown into an internationally recognised festival lasting a month. Each year it performs to a total audience of around 60,000, an estimated quarter of whom come from abroad. Each year the Festival has, in addition to staging leading works from classical operatic repertoire, staged its own productions.

=== Premieres ===
Six operas have been premiered at the Savonlinna Opera Festival since 1967: ''[[The Horseman (opera)|The Horseman]]'' (1975), ''[[The King Goes Forth to France]]'' (1984, commissioned jointly by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] and the BBC), and ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (1995) by [[Aulis Sallinen]], ''[[The Knife (opera)|The Knife]]'' (1989) by [[Paavo Heininen]], ''[[Aleksis Kivi (opera)|Aleksis Kivi]]'' (1997) by [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] and ''[[The Age of Dreams]]'' (2000–2001) by Herman Rechberger [http://sonopt.pp.fi], [[Olli Kortekangas]] and [[Kalevi Aho]].

=== Visits by foreign opera companies ===
For over a decade, the Savonlinna Opera Festival has hosted foreign opera companies: The first of these was the [[Estonia Theatre]] from [[Tallinn]]. This was followed for the next three seasons by the world-famous [[Mariinsky Theatre|Mariinsky (Kirov) Theatre]] from [[St. Petersburg]], by [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] from [[London]] in 1998, the [[Opéra national du Rhin]] from [[Strasbourg]] in 1999, the [[New Israeli Opera]] in 2000, [[Los Angeles Opera]] in 2001, the [[Deutsche Oper am Rhein]] in 2002, and the Choir and Orchestra of the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago]] in 2003, with a staging of [[Sergio Ortega]]'s ''Fulgor y Muerte de Joaquín Murieta'', after a libretto by [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Pablo Neruda]].

'''Seedfeeder''' is a pseudonymous illustrator known for contributing sexually explicit drawings to [[Wikipedia]]. Between 2008 and 2012, the artist created 48 depictions of various sex acts. Seedfeeder's illustrations garnered negative and positive reactions: some Wikipedia editors claimed they contained racist and sexist undertones, while Andy Cush of [[Gawker]] called him "Wikipedia's greatest artist of sex acts". [[Artnet]] columnist [[Paddy Johnson]] listed Seedfeeder's work as one of the "Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014".

''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'s}} Andres Jauregui said the illustrations were "anything but shy" and that "by rendering intense acts of coupling in a sterile, almost instructional manner, Seedfeeder's drawings have a normalizing effect on bedroom play that some might consider taboo".&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt; He wrote that the sexual acts Seedfeeder illustrates "aren't weird, but the plastic, detached style in which they're rendered is bizarrely matter-of-fact, like the airline safety pamphlets that the illustrator says inspired them". Furthermore, he said: "Some wouldn't consider it art, but it's not porn, either. The drawings are educational, but they serve a purpose beyond illustration."&lt;ref name=Jauregui&gt;{{cite news|last=Jauregui|first=Andres|title=Wikipedia's SeedFeeder Is The Weirdest Sex Illustrator You've Never Heard Of (NSFW)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/12/seedfeeder-wikipedia-illustrator_n_6145146.html|accessdate=November 14, 2014|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artnet]] columnist [[Paddy Johnson]] listed Seedfeeder's work as one of the "Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014".&lt;ref name=artnetTop10&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Paddy|title=The Top 10 Digital Artworks of 2014|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/the-top-10-digital-artworks-of-2014-205405|website=Artnet News|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative reactions===

Seedfeeder's drawings were also met with controversy. Some Wikipedia contributors perceived there to be racist and sexist undertones, resulting in the removal of some images from English-language [[Wikimedia project]]s.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; A depiction of a facial featuring a black man ejaculating onto a white woman prompted criticism, with some users claiming that the image was racist and promoted violence against women.&lt;ref name=NaTemat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natemat.pl/129367,to-on-zilustrowal-seks-w-wikipedii-48-osiem-rysunkow-do-hasel-gonzo-czy-po-prostu-pozycja-misjonarska|title=To on zilustrował seks na Wikipedii. 48 osiem rysunków, które obrazują, co w łóżku się dzieje|last=Schwarzenberg-Czerny|first=Urszula|date=2015|accessdate=3 October 2015|work=[[NaTemat.pl]]|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seedfeeder responded to those who argued that descriptions of sex acts without accompanying images would be best by saying: "I come from a philosophical viewpoint that every Wikipedia article should have all forms of media available associated with it. Images, audio, and video. All articles, without exception. So any argument predicated on 'an image isn't necessary' is one that carries absolutely zero weight. None."&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt; In an interview with [[NaTemat]], sexologist {{illm|Andrzej Depko|pl}} defended the images, saying that images of sexual activity are nothing new and that people should not be offended by sex.&lt;ref name=NaTemat/&gt;

Seedfeeder also responded to criticism that children could discover his illustrations by writing, "if your children are actively searching for these kind of topics... it's because they already have a slight idea of them... and they feel ready to know more."&lt;ref name=Jauregui/&gt;

[[File:Interior view of The Beanery by Edward Kienholz.jpg|thumb|right|Interior view of ''The Beanery'']]
'''''The Beanery''''' is a life-size, walk-in artwork  created in 1965 by the American artist [[Edward Kienholz]]; it has been referred to as his greatest work, and "one of the most memorable works of late 20th-century art".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/nov/11/ed-kienholz-hoerengracht-national-gallery The National Gallery takes on Tate Modern with Ed Kienholz | Art and design | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the interior of a Los Angeles bar, [[Barney's Beanery]].

Modelled at two-thirds the size of the original Beanery,&lt;ref name=cultuurwijs&gt;[http://www.cultuurwijs.nl/nwc.stedelijkmuseumamsterdam/cultuurwijs.nl/i000030.html Cultuurwijs - Een nagemaakte kroeg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it features the smells and sounds of the bar, and models of customers, all of whom have clocks for faces with the time set at 10:10. Only the model of Barney, the owner, has a real face. Kienholz is quoted as saying "The entire work symbolizes the switch from real time (symbolized by a newspaper) to the surrealist time inside the bar, where people waste time, kill time, forget time, and ignore time".&lt;ref name=cultuurwijs/&gt;

First exhibited in the parking lot of the bar in October 1965,&lt;ref name="Pincus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pincus|first1=Robert L.|title=On a scale that competes with the world : the art of Edward and Nancy Reddin Kienholz|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-06730-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is now in the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. It was restored in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstbeeld.nl/nl/nieuws/18961/stedelijk-museum-restaureert-the-beanery-van-kienholz.html Stedelijk Museum restaureert 'The Beanery' van Kienholz - Kunstbeeld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Vom klugen Schneiderlein.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]
"'''The Clever Little Tailor'''" ({{lang-de|Vom klugen Schneiderlein}}) is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]] as tale 114.  It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 850, The Princess's Birthmarks.  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
A proud princess set a riddle to her wooers and sent them away when they could not answer.  Three tailors came.  Two were known for their cleverness and skill, and the third for his uselessness.  The princess asked them what two colors were her hairs.  The first said black and white; the second brown and red; the third gold and silver, and he was right.  

The princess demanded that he spend the night with a bear as well.  In his stall, the tailor began to crack nuts.  He offered the bear not nuts but pebbles, and the bear could not crack them.  The tailor took one away, substituted a nut, and cracked it.  The tailor began to fiddle, and the bear danced.  The tailor offered to teach it, but first he had to cut its nails.  He trapped it in a vise and left it there.

The princess agreed to marry him.  The other two tailors freed the bear.  It came after the carriage.  The tailor stuck his legs out the window and threatened the bear with the claim that they were a vise.  It ran off.

[[File:TheCuriousRoom.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition, published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]].]]

'''''The Curious Room''''' ({{ISBN|0-09-958621-5}}) is a book collecting various plays and scripts by English writer [[Angela Carter]]. Its full title is '''''The Curious Room: Plays, Film Scripts and an Opera'''''.

The book contains her original screenplays for the films ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[The Magic Toyshop]]'', both of which were based on her own original stories. It also contains a draft of a [[libretto]] for an opera based on ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]], and five radio plays: "Vampirella", which she then reworked as "The Lady of the House of Love" in ''[[The Bloody Chamber]]'' collection, "The Company of Wolves", "Puss in Boots" (both reworkings of Charles Perrault's fairy tales) and two "artificial biographies", one of Victorian painter, [[Richard Dadd]], who murdered his father, and the other about Edwardian novelist, [[Ronald Firbank]]. The collection also includes the unproduced screenplays ''Gun for the Devil'' (based upon an earlier short work of hers, collected in ''American Ghosts and Old World Wonders'') and  ''The Christchurch Murders'' (based on the [[Parker–Hulme murder case]] which also influenced the 1994 [[Peter Jackson]] film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''), as well a stage adaptation of [[Frank Wedekind]]'s Lulu plays.  Carter's television work also included a controversial documentary entitled ''[[The Holy Family Album]]'', which is not published here.

Edited and with production notes provided by Mark Bell, with an introduction by [[Susannah Clapp]], the book was published by [[Chatto and Windus]] in [[1996 in literature|1996]], four years [[List of works published posthumously|after Angela Carter's death]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">'''The GIMP Project''' is a New-York based modern dance project by the [[Heidi Latsky Dance]] company, and originally produced by Jeremy Alliger of Alliger Arts. Heidi Latsky choreographs work for four professional dancers and four dancers with physical disabilities, who perform [[Physically integrated dance|integrated dance]] pieces.

==Origins of the Project==
Heidi Latsky has had a longtime interest in dance that pushes beyond conventional boundaries. She is a former dancer in the [[Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company]], and has danced with [[Larry Goldhuber]], a dancer with large "physical proportions".{{sfn|Goodley|Hughes|Davis|2012}} Latsky has also trained actors in movement techniques for over 20 years.

GIMP has the goal of combining dancers of all "corporealities", making both disabled and able-bodied dancers objects of spectacle.{{sfn|McRuer|Mollow|2012|pp=394–395}} Latsky's plans for GIMP include adding to its body of work over "the next 5–10 years".

The name of the company is one meant to challenge stereotypes of physical disability. The GIMP Project's website provides the following definitions of the term "{{linktext|gimp}}": {{blockquote|
# a ribbonlike, braided fabric
# fighting spirit; vigor
# a lame person
# slang; a halting, lame walk
# to turn, vacillate, tremble ecstatically&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;{{cite web |title=In brief |url=http://www.thegimpproject.com/gimp/brief/ |publisher=The GIMP Project |accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

An outreach program is part of the GIMP performances. This brings an educational component to the project's work. According to the project's Website, the outreach program currently includes:{{blockquote|
* A diversity of articulate voices (a ready-made panel discussion)
*A genre-shattering showcase of cutting edge disability film (no handkerchief necessary, no heroism required!)
* A choreographer who is also a degreed psychologist
* A national disability advocate and lecturer
* A choreographer celebrated for setting work on local dancers
* A dancer with expertise working with HIV communities&lt;ref name="brief"/&gt; }}

==Reception==
In 2009, Theodore Bale wrote in ''[[Dance Magazine]]'' of the confrontational aspect of Latsky's approach: {{blockquote|the dancers in ''GIMP'' ... make the situation reciprocal. They stare back at you. Subverting these well-established "polite" conventions of gaze is the starting point for this event, which skillfully blends political inquiry, psychology, and aesthetic explorations of form, structure and dynamics. ''GIMP'' is without doubt a gleaming milestone in the progress of contemporary dance and theater, making "disabled dancer" an oxymoron.&lt;ref name="Gale-quote"/&gt; }}

In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Corey Kilgannon quotes dancer Lawrence Carter-Long explaining the GIMP approach: "This is no safe prearranged marriage of dance and disability [...] This is a collision. This is two worlds coming together that ain't supposed to co-exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgannon |first=Corey |title=Confronting Disability with Modern Dance |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/confronting-disability-with-modern-dance/ |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GIMP Project tours in major cities of the United States, and performs at such New York City theater institutions as the [[Lincoln Center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3426">A '''trademark examiner''' is an attorney employed by a government entity such as the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to determine whether an applicant should be permitted to receive a [[trademark registration]], thus affording legal protection to the applicant's [[trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://marklaw.com/trademark-glossary/D-F.htm#Examining Attorney Trademark Examiner, definition]&lt;/ref&gt; The job of a trademark examiner is thus to examine marks applied for to determine if they run afoul of any prohibitions on registration, such as infringing upon an existing registration of the same mark, or constituting the generic name of the goods with which the mark is associated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/jobs/trade-mark-examiners/ IP Australia (Australian Patent and Trademark agency) job description for trademark examiner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322024425/http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/about-us/jobs/trade-mark-examiners/ |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saic.gov.cn/sbjenglish/gjjl_1/201104/t20110414_105458.html Report on 2011 EU-China Trademark Examiner Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
The USPTO employs several hundred trademark examiners at any given time, although the number fluctuates with the strength of the economy, which influences how many new trademark filings are being submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usptocareers.gov/Pages/TMPositions/default.aspx U.S. Patent and Trademark Office careers, Trademark Examiners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415040831/http://usptocareers.gov/Pages/TMPositions/default.aspx |date=2012-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These employees are evaluated by a point system, based on the number of applications that they address and dispose of, either by permitting them to go forward to registration, or denying registration in an [[office action]], and seeing this denial through any appeals taken within the USPTO. Some USPTO trademark examiners work in the USPTO building in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], but a majority telework full-time.

In 2011, proposed budget cuts of $100 million to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office budget of slightly over $2 billion were reported to not have any impact on the size of the Trademark staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invents.com/u-s-patent-trademark-office-to-face-budget-cuts/ USPTO to Face Budget Cuts]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, all hiring in 2011 at the USPTO was frozen.

==In Turkey==
The [[Turkish Patent Institute|TPI]] (Turkish Patent Institute) employs more than hundred trademark examiners at any given time.
All TPI trademark examiners work in the TPE building in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].

At first, an examiner starts to work as an assistant for three years. After 2 years TPE wants from him to prepare a thesis about any subject of trademark. He studies on thesis nearly 10 months. After that he presents it to the Board of Directors. If thesis accepted by the Board, examiner will enter an exam about the thesis.
If everything goes on its way,  assistant examiner is going to leave the assistance label and will become a trademark examiner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2013/04/20130406-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vauhini Studios''' is an [[Indian film]] production company, and one of the largest production houses in South Asia at that time. Vauhini Studios was founded by ''Moola Narayana Swamy'' an [[Indian film]] producer, known for his works in [[Telugu cinema]], and [[Tamil cinema]]. In later years, [[B. Nagi Reddy]] acquired Vauhini Studios, and later merged it with [[Vijaya Vauhini Studios]].&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-story-in-a-road-name/article404360.ece |title=The story in a road name - CHEN |publisher=The Hindu |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0600570|Narayana Swamy Moola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idlebrain1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/research/anal/anal-tc4.html |title=Telugu Cinema - Research - "Telugu Cinema - past and the present" by Gudipoodi Srihari |publisher=Idlebrain.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/bhatktha-potana-1943/article2706259.ece |title=Bhatktha Potana (1943) - Anantapur |publisher=The Hindu |date=2011-12-11 |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

[[File:Victimless leather.jpg|thumb|left|x450px|Victimless leather, photo from TC&amp;A webpage [http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/images.html]]]

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Watsonville: Some Place Not Here''''' is a three-act 1996 play by [[Cherríe Moraga]]. It depicts a cannery strike in [[Watsonville, California]]. ''Watsonville'' and the 1995 play ''[[Circle in the Dirt]]'' were published together in a single book by the [[West End Press]]. It is the sequel to the 1994 play ''[[Heroes and Saints]]''.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43&gt;Pareles, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was a project of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=Pignatarop2829&gt;Pignataro, p. 28-29. "La obra ''Watsonville: Some Place Not Here'' (1996) fue parte de una proyecto de Stanford University por el cual Moraga entra a East Palo Alto — una comunidad cerca de la universidad— y de ello resulta una creatividad colectiva por su comunicacion con el pueblo para investigar los sentimientos de la gente en cuanto a los acontecimientos sociales, geograficos y religiosos en la region de California —los "cannery strikes" (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4) del 1985–1987; el terremoto de grado 7.1 de 1989 en California, y la apariencia de la Virgen de Guadalupe en un roble en el parque del condado Pinto Lake en 1992 (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4). Por lo tanto, tal obra teatral era un proyecto iniciado por un programa universitario y ligado a la comunidad."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pareles wrote that ''Watsonville'' criticizes anti-immigration policies in California and Mexican-Americans perceived to have sold out to Anglo culture, or ''vendidos'', who believe such policies should be compromised with.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Ruben Mendoza of ''[[Confluencia: Revista Hispanica de Cultura y Literatura]]'' wrote that the play uses a communal [[third place]] (also known as a third space)&lt;!--stated as "thirdspace" in the source--&gt; to criticize "[[capitalist]] spatial practice".&lt;ref name=Mendozap132&gt;Mendoza, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the play also discusses the labor movement's gender and immigrant rights situation.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;

Moraga stated that the play is based "loosely on three actual events that took place in a central California coastal farm worker town by the same name."&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524&gt;Thompson, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; These events were a 1985–1987 cannery strike, a 1989 7.1 [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] earthquake, and a vision of the [[Lady of Guadalupe]] in the Pinto Lake county park.&lt;ref name=Pignatarop2829/&gt; Lisa B. Thompson of the ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' wrote that there is "drama with vibrant dialogue and compelling, diverse characters" because Moraga did not use the words of those she interviewed for research purposes [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] and instead "the voices Moraga listened to while researching the plays merge with her own."&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;

''Watsonville'' has select phrases and sentences in the dialog in the Spanish language instead of English.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; The play, along with ''Circle in the Dirt'', uses dialog that is a mixture of English and Spanish to paraphrase the content of the interviews conducted by Moraga; most of the actual interviews were done entirely in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The music in the play includes [[bolero]], [[cumbia]], and [[rap]]. Some of the music includes original compositions.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;

==Plot==
In the play, set in the mid-1990s, workers in a [[Watsonville, California]] cannery strike.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; The workers at the Pajaro Valley Cannery strike partly because they want additional rights,&lt;ref name=Mendozap134&gt;Mendoza, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and also because they want to be paid better wages.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; As strategies the workers use a type of protest theater used by ''[[El Teatro Campesino]]'' and they also use [[hunger strikes]] in the manner done by [[César Chávez]].&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; At the same time, the area Latino community faces divisions as anti-immigration legislation is being proposed in California.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; During the play the politicians deliberate on Bill 1519, which is intended to separate the workers into legal residents and illegal immigrants as a way to divide them, referring to real-life [[border control]] legislation.&lt;ref name=Mendozap134/&gt; Marissa Pareles of the ''[[Lambda Book Report]]'' wrote that "the end of the play "has only a bit of a &lt;!--The D and M are both capitalized--&gt;[[Deus ex Machina]] feeling about it".&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt;

Lisa B. Thompson wrote that realism is the predominant atmosphere of the work, but that the work highlights the importance of the spiritual aspect of protesting by giving some characters relationships with spirits of the deceased and also having the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] appear on a tree trunk.&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; An earthquake with the magnitude 7.5 occurs during the story.&lt;ref name=Mendozap132/&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Lucha''' – A cannery worker,&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; she learns enough English to use the language to express her romantic desire for Susana.&lt;ref name=Mendozap137&gt;Mendoza, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Susana''' – Susana is physician's assistant at a community clinic,&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt; and she is an activist.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; Susana and Lucha become girlfriends, and Susana refuses to be [[LGBT|in the closet]].&lt;ref name=Thompsonp524/&gt;
* '''Juan''' – Juan is an organizer for radical leftist causes.&lt;ref name=Parelesp43/&gt; He is originally a priest who tries and fails to convince an area [[monsignor]] to bless a vision of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].&lt;ref name=Mendozap135&gt;Mendoza, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dolores Valle''' – A migrant worker who sees the Virgin of Guadalupe,&lt;ref name=Mendozap134/&gt; she ultimately dies in a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref name=Mendozap137/&gt;
* '''Chente''' – A labor organizer&lt;ref name=Mendozap135/&gt;

== Variations Within The Series ==

There are many variations within the WBR series.  The most common variations include cloth boards versus smooth boards, patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without ribbon bookmarks, different colored covers but retaining the same embossed cover image, and books that have completely different cover art than other editions.

One example of cloth boards versus plain boards is ''Far From The Madding Crowd''.  Both the cloth and the plain editions are the same color with the same artwork, only the material of the boards is different.  Other examples include ''Moby Dick, Treasure Island, O Pioneers, The Sea Wolf,'' and ''Uncle Tom’s Cabin''.

An example of the variation of patterned end papers with ribbon bookmarks versus plain colored end papers without bookmarks is ''Silas Marner''.  Both books have the same artwork on the outside cover, but on the inside one edition has plain white end papers and the other has marble patterned end papers and a colored ribbon bookmark.  Other titles with this variation are ''Pride And Prejudice, The Call of the Wild/White Fang, The Scarlet Letter, The House of Seven Gables, The Last Of The Mohicans, A Tale Of Two Cities, Tess of the D’Urbervilles, A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur’s Court, Little Women, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, Twice-Told Tales,'' and ''The Innocents Abroad.''

An example of a title having different colored covers but retaining the same embossed artwork image is ''A Tale Of Two Cities''.  Cover variations of ''A Tale of Two Cities'' include a blue cloth cover, a brown cloth cover, and a red cover.  Other editions with this variation include ''The Innocents Abroad, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, A Tale of Two Cities, Tales of Suspense, Silas Marner, Wuthering Heights'' (old cover style), ''Ben Hur, The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer'', and ''The Return of Sherlock Holmes''.

''Tess of the D’Urbervilles'' is an example where in two editions the boards are the same color (gray) but the embossed parts of the cover and the faux quarter leather covering are different colors.  The artwork and faux leather is red in one edition and blue in the other edition.

Some books have been printed with completely different cover artwork from other editions.  Examples include ''Barchester Towers, The Jungle Books, Captains Courageous, Beau Geste'', and ''Wuthering Heights''.  For some books, such as ''The Jungle Books'' and ''Barchester Towers'', the UK edition was published with illustrations where the American version was not.

A spelling variation in a book title occurs with ''A Journey to the Center of the Earth''.  In the UK, the edition was published under the title ''A Journey to the Centre of the Earth''.

In the United States, the James Hilton titles (''Lost Horizon, Good-bye Mr. Chips and Other Stories'') were printed in two separate volumes whereas in the UK edition, they were combined into one book.

Each edition in the WBR series includes a sheet folded in half numbered with page numbers one through four with a synopsis of the history of how the book came to be published and a short biography of the author and perhaps some information about the artist in illustrated editions.  ''On Our Selection/Our New Selection'' is different from the rest of the books because not only is the author biography insert included, but also a folder containing six 5.5" x 8.5" prints of artwork by artist Lionel Lindsay.  The prints included are titled ''Judy Wasn’t Frightened Of Jew-Lizards'', ''Sarah Thought It A Fine Effect'', ''‘It’s A Lie!’ Dad roared'', ''Daniel Damascus Rudd, Sir!'', and ''Dad Come to See the Great Metropolis.''  These are illustrations found in the actual book.  One print is not from the book.  It is not given a title and depicts the father scratching his bare head riding a horse in the woods at a walk towards the lower right hand foreground.

Reader’s Digest also issued a book safe as part of the WBR series, ''Paradise Lost'' by John Milton.  The outside of the book safe is designed to look like other editions in the series, but inside the safe are two separated compartments.  The interior of the safe is lined with light gray velvet and is kept closed with velcro strips on the back of the cover and on the middle divider between the two compartments.

Vivat Direct Limited, t/a Reader's Digest, a publishing company in the UK that usually prints Reader's Digest Select Editions,&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reader's Digest UK|url=http://www.readersdigest.co.uk/|publisher=Vivat Direct Limited, ta Reader's Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published World's Best Reading books starting in 2010: ''Kidnapped/Treasure Island'' ({{ISBN|0276446585}}), ''Wuthering Heights'' ({{ISBN|0276446518}}), ''Oliver Twist'', ''Pride &amp; Prejudice'', ''A Study In Scarlet/The Hound Of The Baskervilles''({{ISBN|9780895772541}}), ''Moonstone'', ''Robinson Crusoe'', ''The War of the Worlds/The Time Machine'', ''Jo's Boys'', ''Three Men in a Boat/Three Men on the Bummel'', and ''Ivanhoe'' ({{ISBN|9781780201184}}).  These editions were published with insert pages like the other World's Best Reading books with the World's Best Reading logo at the top of the first page just like the other inserts.  However, the inserts have the initials WBR above the spelled out World's Best Reading on the insert pages and the WBR initials on the spine of the books.  These books are different from the original World's Best Reading books because they are bound in cloth and do not have the faux quarter leather binding over the spine.  They also have illustrations on the front and back covers, unlike the rest of the series which have illustrations on the front cover board only.
