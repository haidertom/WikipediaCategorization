      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8362">In mathematics, an '''abstract cell complex''' is an abstract set with [[Alexandrov topology]] in which a non-negative integer number called [[dimension]] is assigned to each point. The complex is called “abstract” since its points, which are called “cells”, are not subsets of a [[Hausdorff space]] as it is the case in Euclidean and [[CW complex]]. Abstract cell complexes play an important role in [[image analysis]] and [[computer graphics]].

==History==
The idea of abstract cell complexes &lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Klette: Cell complexes through time. http://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.404813&lt;/ref&gt; (also named abstract cellular complexes) relates to [[Johann Benedict Listing|J. Listing]] (1862) &lt;ref&gt;Listing J.: "Der Census räumlicher Complexe". ''Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen'', v. 10, Göttingen, 1862, 97–182.&lt;/ref&gt; und [[Ernst Steinitz|E. Steinitz]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz E.: "Beiträge zur Analysis". ''Sitzungsbericht Berliner Mathematischen Gesellschaft'', Band. 7, 1908, 29–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Also A.W Tucker (1933),&lt;ref&gt;Tucker A.W.: "An abstract approach to manifolds", Annals Mathematics, v. 34, 1933, 191-243.&lt;/ref&gt; K. Reidemeister (1938),&lt;ref&gt;Reidemeister K.: "Topologie der Polyeder und kombinatorische Topologie der Komplexe". Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft Geest &amp; Portig, Leipzig, 1938 (second edition 1953)&lt;/ref&gt; P.S. Aleksandrov (1956) &lt;ref&gt;Aleksandrov P.S.: Combinatorial Topology, Graylock Press, Rochester, 1956,&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as R. Klette und A. Rosenfeld (2004) &lt;ref&gt;Klette R. und Rosenfeld. A.: "Digital Geometry", Elsevier, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; have described abstract cell complexes. E. Steinitz has defined an abstract cell complex as &lt;math&gt; C=(E,B,dim)&lt;/math&gt; where ''E'' is an '''abstract''' set, ''B'' is an asymmetric, irreflexive and transitive binary relation called the '''bounding relation''' among the elements of ''E'' and ''dim'' is a function assigning a non-negative integer to each element of ''E'' in such a way that if &lt;math&gt;B(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;dim(a)&lt;dim(b)&lt;/math&gt;. 
V. Kovalevsky (1989) &lt;ref&gt;Kovalevsky, V.: "Finite Topology as Applied to Image Analysis", ''Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing'', v. 45, No. 2, 1989, 141–161.&lt;/ref&gt; described abstract cell complexes for 3D and higher dimensions. He also suggested numerous applications to image analysis. In his book (2008) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.geometry.kovalevsky.de.&lt;/ref&gt; he has suggested an axiomatic theory of locally finite [[topological spaces]] which are generalization of abstract cell complexes. The book contains among others new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], a new definition of [[combinatorial manifold]]s and many algorithms useful for image analysis.

==Basic results==
The topology of abstract cell complexes is based on a [[partial order]] in the set of its points or cells. 

The notion of the abstract cell complex defined by E. Steinitz is related to the notion of an [[abstract simplicial complex]] and it differs from a [[simplicial complex]] by the property that its elements are no [[simplex|simplices]]: An ''n''-dimensional element of an abstract complexes must not have ''n''+1 zero-dimensional sides, and not each subset of the set of zero-dimensional sides of a cell is a cell. This is important since the notion of an abstract cell complexes can be applied to the two- and three-dimensional grids used in image processing, which is not true for simplicial complexes. A non-simplicial complex is a generalization which makes the introduction of cell coordinates possible: There are non-simplicial complexes which are Cartesian products of such "linear" one-dimensional complexes where each zero-dimensional cell, besides two of them, bounds exactly two one-dimensional cells. Only such Cartesian complexes make it possible to introduce such coordinates that each cell has a set of coordinates and any two different cells have different coordinate sets. The coordinate set can serve as a name of each cell of the complex which is important for processing complexes. 

Abstract complexes allow the introduction of classical topology (Alexandrov-topology) in grids being the basis of digital image processing. This possibility defines the great advantage of abstract cell complexes: It becomes possible to exactly define the notions of connectivity and of the boundary of subsets. The definition of dimension of cells and of complexes is in the general case different from that of simplicial complexes (see below).

The notion of an abstract cell complex differs essentially from that of a CW-complex because an abstract cell complex is no [[Hausdorff space]]. This is important from the point of view of computer science since it is impossible to explicitly represent a non-discrete Hausdorff space in a computer. (The neighborhood of each point in such a space must have infinitely many points). 

The book by V. Kovalevsky &lt;ref&gt;V. Kovalevsky: "Geometry of Locally Finite Spaces". Editing house Dr. Bärbel Kovalevski, Berlin 2008. {{ISBN|978-3-9812252-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contains the description of the theory of [[locally finite space]]s which are a generalization of abstract cell complexes. A locally finite space ''S'' is a set of points where a subset of ''S'' is defined for each point ''P'' of ''S''. This subset containing a limited number of points is called the '''smallest neighborhood''' of ''P''. A binary neighborhood relation is defined in the set of points of the locally finite space ''S'': The element (point) ''b'' is in the neighborhood relation with the element ''a'' if ''b'' belongs to the smallest neighborhood of the element ''a''. New axioms of a locally finite space have been formulated, and it was proven that the space ''S'' is in accordance with the axioms only if the neighborhood relation is anti-symmetric and transitive. The neighborhood relation is the reflexive hull of the inverse bounding relation. It was shown that classical axioms of the topology can be deduced as theorems from the new axioms. Therefore, a locally finite space satisfying the new axioms is a particular case of a classical topological space. Its topology is a [[poset topology]] or [[Alexandrov topology]].
An abstract cell complex is a particular case of a locally finite space in which the dimension is defined for each point. It was demonstrated that the dimension of a cell ''c'' of an abstract cell complex is equal to the length (number of cells minus 1) of the maximum bounding path leading from any cell of the complex to the cell ''c''. The bounding path is a sequence of cells in which each cell bounds the next one. The book contains the theory of digital straight segments in 2D complexes, numerous algorithms for tracing boundaries in 2D and 3D, for economically encoding the boundaries and for exactly reconstructing a subset from the code of its boundary.

==Abstract Cell Complex Digital Image Representation==
[[File:Digital Image ACC Decomposition.PNG|thumb|A 3x4 digital image decomposed into its Abstract Cell Complex dimensional constituents.]]
A digital image may be represented by a 2D Abstract Cell Complex (ACC) by decomposing the image into its ACC dimensional constituents: points (0-cell), cracks/edges (1-cell), and pixels/faces (2-cell).

[[File:Digital Image ACC Coordinate Assignment.PNG|thumb|Digital Image ACC Coordinate Assignment]]
This decomposition together with a coordinate assignment rule to unambiguously assign coordinates from the image pixels to the dimensional constituents permit certain image analysis operations to be carried out on the image with elegant algorithms such as crack [[boundary tracing]], [[digital straight segment]] subdivision, etc. One such rule maps the points, cracks, and faces to the top left coordinate of the pixel. It should be noted that these dimensional constituents require no explicit translation into their own data structures but may be implicitly understood and related to the 2D array which is the usual data structure representation of a digital image. This coordinate assignment rule and the renderings of each cell incident to this image is depicted in the image at right.

{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}
An '''academic honor code''' or [[honor system]] is a set of rules or [[ethical]] principles governing an academic community based on [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]] that define what constitutes [[Honour|honorable]] behaviour within that community.  The use of an honor code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be [[Trust (sociology)|trusted]] to act honorably.  Those who are in violation of the honor code can be subject to various [[Sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] from the institution.  Honor codes are used to deter [[academic dishonesty]] and should be taken seriously at all times.

==History==
The documented history of an academic honor code dates back to 1736 at [[The College of William and Mary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324161444/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/honorcodeandstudentconduct/honorcode/ |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the oldest honor code in the United States. Still a tradition, students administer the honor pledge to each incoming student and educate faculty and administration on the relevance of the Code and its application to students' lives at the College. Students administer the Code through six Honor Councils and the Council of Chairs. The College of William and Mary founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] academic honor society in 1776 and was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an honor code of conduct for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|title=History &amp; Traditions - William &amp; Mary|author=|date=|website=www.wm.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203155247/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/|archivedate=December 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon the premise that honor is one's most cherished attribute.

In a community devoted to learning, a foundation of honor among individuals must exist if that community is to thrive with respect and harmony among its members. An honor system is an ideal mechanism to ensure such a state of affairs. With it, students and faculty are afforded a freedom that otherwise may not be available. With that freedom comes each individual's responsibility to conduct oneself in such a way that the spirit of mutual trust which sustains the system is not compromised.

The Honor Code applies to alleged acts of lying, stealing or cheating that adversely affect the College community committed by a student on campus or elsewhere.

==US military service academies==
Presently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the [[United States Military Academy]] (see [[Cadet Honor Code]]), [[Virginia Military Institute]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]], and the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. The [[United States Naval Academy]] has an "[[Honor Concept]]," which is similar in scope to the honor codes at the other academies.

The military academy honor codes not only govern the [[Officer cadet|cadets']] and [[midshipman|midshipmen's]] lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes' ethical standards at all times.  The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at [[Virginia Military Institute]], which features a "drum out" ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet's dismissal. Outside of the military, [[Washington and Lee University]] and the [[University of Virginia]] also have single sanction codes.

At three of the service academies and at Virginia Military Institute, anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|title=VMI Honor System History - VMI Archives - Virginia Military Institute|author=|date=|website=www.vmi.edu|accessdate=April 24, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803180952/http://www.vmi.edu/archives/vmi-archives-faqs/vmi-honor-system-history/|archivedate=August 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to do so is considered "toleration," which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as [[Norwich University]], [[Texas A&amp;M]], and [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]], whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not "tolerate those who do." It is notable that the three [[Senior Military Colleges]] have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203841/http://www.citadel.edu/root/graduatecollege-current-students/honor-the-code|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914171716/http://lifeat.norwich.edu/honor-code/|archivedate=September 14, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Code, Education|url=http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920090937/http://student-rules.tamu.edu/aggiecode|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen.  A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one's true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies' honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |title=DoD Directive 1332.23, "Service Academy Disenrollment", February 19, 1988 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605133445/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133223p.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions. The all-male [[Hampden–Sydney College]] is reputed for an honor code system on a par with military systems,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} which extends to all student activities both on and off campus (off-campus violations can be prosecuted), and also like the military system, it considers tolerance of a violation itself a violation. Like the Naval Academy, however, those who witness a violation are encouraged to confront the violator and convince them to turn themselves in before resorting to reporting the violation. Another school with a very strict honor code is [[Brigham Young University]]. The university not only mandates honest behavior but also incorporates various aspects of [[Mormon]] religious law: drinking, smoking, drug use, and premarital sex are all banned. Also, the code includes standards for dress and grooming. Men must be clean-shaven, and men and women cannot wear short shorts or other revealing clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php#HCOfficeInvovement|title= Honor Code Statement|publisher= Brigham Young University|accessdate= 2011-04-07|work= Honour Code Office|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414163048/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php#HCOfficeInvovement|archivedate= April 14, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable American academic honor systems==

*[[United States Coast Guard Academy|U.S. Coast Guard Academy]]
*[[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]]
*[[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]

There are differences between the honor codes of different universities. 
*The [[University of Virginia]] opts for a system run by elected students and involving randomly chosen students. 
*[[Bryn Mawr College]] holds its students to a high degree of trust with their Honor Code which is revised yearly and ruled by the Honor Board.
*[[Connecticut College]] students uphold academic excellence and high community standards by practicing responsible citizenship that protects the core principles of the College. With the privilege of having a diverse student body, students should be able to interact and learn from each other in ways that uphold community respect and personal freedom. The honor system at Connecticut College is unique in that it is upheld and presided over by a student-governed judicial process. Because the Honor Code is taken very seriously by students, there is a strong trust between students, faculty and administration. The Honor Code sets the tone for campus life and acts as a philosophy to live by through demonstrating a commitment to personal participation in improving the quality of life in our community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/honor-code-shared-governance/the-honor-code/ |title=The Honour Code |publisher=Connecticut College |accessdate=2013-04-22 |work=Connecticut College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509053109/http://www.conncoll.edu/at-a-glance/honor-code-shared-governance/the-honor-code/ |archivedate=May 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Haverford College]] holds an honor code which is ratified by students yearly and run by an elected body, the Honor Council. This code is concerned with an academic as well as a social component, demanding equal respect among students, in contrast to the military academies' focus on hierarchy. 
*[[Davidson College]] also holds a dual honor code. According to a legend surrounding the Davidson code, a student was put on trial for not reporting an extra can of soda dispensed by a vending machine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 
*[[Princeton University]] has maintained a student-run Honor Code for over one hundred years, a unique policy compared to those of other Ivy League schools. 
*[[Vanderbilt University]] has also been governed by an Honor Code since its founding. [[First year]] students attend an honor code ceremony to protect the traditions and [[academic integrity]] of the university. A plaque of the honor code is engraved in the student life center with a quote by once-Chancellor Madison Sarratt, "Today I give you two examinations, one in [[trigonometry]] and one in [[honesty]]. I hope you pass them both, but if you must fail one, let it be trigonometry for there are many good men in this world today who cannot pass an examination in trigonometry, but there are no good men in the world who cannot pass an examination in honesty." 
*[[The University of Texas School of Law]] sets its Honor Code as a first step in the obligation of its students to the legal profession: "All law students are harmed by unethical behaviour by any student. A student who deals dishonestly with fellow law students may be dishonest in the future and harm both future clients and the legal profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|title= School of Law Honour Code|publisher= University of Texas|accessdate= 2008-03-05|work= Office of the Registrar|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220085948/http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/law06-08/ch3/ch3a.html#School.of.Law.Honor.Code|archivedate= February 20, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this approach to the honor code in the grand scheme of the legal profession, honor code violations are reported to the State Bar of Texas and the violator's home state bar, thus creating an impediment to licensure. UT Law School is unique in that regard. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 
*[[James Madison University]] holds its students to an Honor Code overseen by the Honor Council.  The honor code at JMU was founded in 1909 and the Honor Council is an organisation run by students.  A student who violates the code, if found "responsible", may receive anywhere from a letter grade reduction to expulsion from the university for a first time offense, while second time offenders are either suspended from the university for a semester or expelled. "The Honor Council at James Madison University is committed to instilling, promoting, and upholding individual and collective academic integrity.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|title= James Madison University Honor Code|publisher= JMU|accessdate= 2010-06-28|work= JMU Honour Council|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100951/http://www.jmu.edu/honor/index.shtml|archivedate= May 28, 2010|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*At [[Meredith College]], an all-women's institution, all first year students attend an Honor Code ceremony, where they sign a statement promising to uphold the values of the Code.  The Code places a high emphasis on integrity and good judgement.  Meredith College is unique in the fact that its judicial board (the Honor Council) is primarily governed by students, including the Chair who also sits on the Student Government Association executive board, and the Solicitor General, who facilitates and investigates all incoming reports.&lt;ref name="Meredith College Student Handbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meredith College Student Handbook|url=http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|website=Meredith College|publisher=Meredith College|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193843/http://www.meredith.edu/images/uploads/honor_system_section_for_website.pdf|archivedate=April 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumors about the Honor Code at Meredith include that students are not allowed to walk on the grass and must remain on the sidewalks.  Male visitation hours, or "boy hours," are a common violation at a school that does not allow men to stay overnight in the residence halls.  However criticized it may be for being outdated, Meredith's Honor Code has evolved with the times and can be seen in the school's archives. 
*[[Washington and Lee University]] and its [[Washington and Lee University School of Law|Law School]] feature an honor system in which all students are expected to act as gentlemen and women. The system governs both academic and social aspects of the university and is administered by the Executive Committee which includes the student body president. The honor system has a single penalty—expulsion. If allegations surface of a student violating the honor system they are given the right to a trial and appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/honor-and-testing-at-a-virginia-university/2012/12/12/bc9bfa6a-43ca-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html |title=Honour and testing at a Virginia university |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=2012-12-13 |work=Washington and Lee honour system |first=Nick |last=Anderson |date=December 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525085542/http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/honor-and-testing-at-a-virginia-university/2012/12/12/bc9bfa6a-43ca-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html |archivedate=May 25, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Action as a literary mode ==
"Action is the [[Mode (literature)|mode]] [that] [[fiction]] writers use to show what is happening at any given moment in the story," states [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | p = 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; who identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.

While [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] is the element that brings a story and its characters to life on the page, and [[Narration|narrative]] gives the story its depth and substance, action creates the movement within a story. Writing a story means weaving all of the elements of fiction together.  When it is done right, weaving dialogue, narrative, and action can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A scene top-heavy with action can feel unreal because it is likely that characters doing something—anything at all—would be talking during the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

{{redirect|Anthropic bias|the book|Anthropic Bias (book)}}
The '''anthropic principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical consideration]] that observations of the [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[sapience|sapient]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the [[age of the universe|age]] and the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the [[Fine-tuned Universe|narrow range thought to be compatible with life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html  Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ James Schombert, Department of Physics at University of Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''strong anthropic principle''' ('''SAP''') as explained by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life [[emergence|emerge]] within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a '''weak anthropic principle''' ('''WAP''') similar to the one defined by [[Brandon Carter]], which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the [[multiverse]] for there to be a [[statistical population]] of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of ''only'' this universe, compatible with ''our'' life) could occur.

==Definition and basis==
The principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this is a [[a priori and a posteriori|necessity]], because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe ''some'' universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in "anthropic principle" has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín J., (2005), ''Antropic Explanations in Cosmology'', in  Hajek, Valdés &amp; Westerstahl (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''; http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/"&lt;/ref&gt; to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref&gt;"anthropic" means "of or pertaining to mankind or humans".&lt;/ref&gt;  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or some kind of [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617015335/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf |date=June 17, 2012 }}, Victor J. Stenger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&amp;client=firefox-a Anthropic Bias], Nick Bostrom, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking [[falsifiability]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle anthropic principle]. ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is "easy" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[truism]].&lt;!--, albeit a "vacuously true" statement [removed for the time being] --&gt;  However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~lwilliam/sota/anth/SAP_FAP.htm The Strong Anthropic Principle and the Final Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstpraxis.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-knowing-sagan-from-pale-blue-dot/ On Knowing, Sagan from Pale Blue Dot]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropic 'coincidences'==
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In 1961, [[Robert Dicke]] noted that the [[age of the universe]], as seen by living observers, cannot be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = Dicke, R. H.  | journal = Nature | title = Dirac's Cosmology and Mach's Principle | volume = 192 | pages = 440–441| date = 1961 | doi = 10.1038/192440a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.192..440D | issue=4801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Paul Davies | author = Davies, P. | title = The Goldilocks Enigma | publisher = Allen Lane| date = 2006 | isbn = 0-7139-9883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
[[metallicity]] (levels of elements besides [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) especially [[carbon]], by [[nucleosynthesis]].  Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the "Dicke coincidences" [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[Cosmological constant problem|cosmological constant]]. [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | author = Weinberg, S. | title = Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant | journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 59| pages = 2607–2610| date = 1987 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607 | pmid = 10035596 | issue = 22 | bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.2607W}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the value [[particle physics]] predicts (this has been described as the "worst prediction in physics").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/02/physicists-debate-nature-of-space-time.html New Scientist Space Blog: Physicists debate the nature of space-time - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s (such as the [[fine-structure constant]]) governing the four [[fundamental interaction]]s are balanced as if [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? ] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html John Baez, mathematical physicist. U. C. Riverside], April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in the [[strong interaction]] would bind the [[dineutron]] and the [[diproton]], and [[nuclear fusion]] would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

==Origin==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume 1'', Routledge, 2016, p. 211: "the world [is a] mere ''presentation'', object for a subject..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson, ''Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man'', Numen Books, 2015, p. 71: "[Schopenhauer] said that "the world is our conception." A world without a perceiver would in that case be an impossibility. But we can—he said—gain knowledge about Essential Reality for looking into ourselves, by introspection. ... This is one of many examples of the anthropic principle. The world is there for the sake of man."&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "anthropic principle" first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Kraków]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: "Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | date = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291–298}}; republished in General Relativity and Gravitation (Nov. 2011), Vol. 43, Iss. 11, p. 3225-3233, with an introduction by [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]] (available on [[Arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a "weak" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial "strong" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:

{{quote|The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around to measure the physical constants in question—so the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10}}

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make "predictions" about the parameters. But second, "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the [[multiverse]] ("world ensemble" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: "why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?"

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term "anthropic principle" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; published that year which distinguished between "weak" and "strong" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: "Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R.

==Variants==
'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' ([[Brandon Carter|Carter]]): "[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is ''necessarily'' privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers." Note that for Carter, "location" refers to our location in time as well as space.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Carter): "[T]he universe (and hence the [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental parameters]] on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase [[Descartes]], ''cogito ergo mundus talis est''."&lt;br&gt;The Latin tag ("I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]") makes it clear that "must" indicates a [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a [[truism]].

In their 1986 book, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146–53 | date = 1997 | bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..146B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow &amp; Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]]—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the "must" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers'."
::This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]]. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to [[Sapience|intelligent life]], with the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.
* "Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being."
::Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from [[quantum mechanics]], as [[John Archibald Wheeler]] has suggested, especially via his idea that information is the fundamental reality (see [[It from bit]]) and his '''Participatory anthropic principle (PAP)''' which is an [[Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] associated with the ideas of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]].
* "An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe."
::By contrast, Carter merely says that an [[multiverse|ensemble of universes]] is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for ''anthropic bias''—that is, the bias created by anthropic [[selection effect]]s (which Bostrom calls "observation" selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

{{quote|Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, though these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation [[selection effect]]s are to be taken into account.|''Anthropic Bias'', Introduction&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N. (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''[[Self-sampling assumption|Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)]]''' ([[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom]]): "Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its [[reference class]]."&lt;br&gt; Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of "observer-moments" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], the anthropic principle essentially just says that the [[conditional probability]] of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as "gravity won't change tomorrow". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the [[prior distribution]] of [[multiverse|alternative universes]] are necessary.&lt;ref name="RgenSchmidhuber"&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2000, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic theories of everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], 2002, "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html The Speed Prior: A New Simplicity Measure Yielding Near-Optimal Computable Predictions.]" ''Proc. 15th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory'' (COLT 2002), Sydney, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer: 216-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and novelist [[Michael Frayn]] describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book ''The Human Touch'', which explores what he characterises as "the central oddity of the Universe":

{{quote|It's this simple paradox. The Universe is very old and very large. Humankind, by comparison, is only a tiny disturbance in one small corner of it - and a very recent one. Yet the Universe is only very large and very old because we are here to say it is... And yet, of course, we all know perfectly well that it is what it is whether we are here or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frayn]], ''The Human Touch''. Faber &amp; Faber {{ISBN|0-571-23217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the "fundamental parameters"—that is, the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins C. B. | author-link = C. B. Collins | author2 = Hawking, S. W. | author2-link = Stephen Hawking | title = Why is the universe isotropic? | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 180 | pages = 317–334 | date = 1973 | doi = 10.1086/151965 | bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the "typical" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1–51| date = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as "fundamental constants" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters. As [[Einstein]] said: "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a "theory of everything", [[string theory]], proclaimed "the end of the anthropic principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L. | author2 = Perry, Malcolm J. | author3 = Zytkow, Anna N. | last-author-amp = yes | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | date = 2002 | pages = 45–53  | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}&lt;/ref&gt; since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).

The modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliott, 2005, "[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]" in Mann, W. E., ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion''. Blackwell Publishers. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903095009/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ikeda and [[William H. Jefferys|Jefferys]],&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W., "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150-166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W. (2006). Unpublished FAQ "[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].

[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
#The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
#The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the Universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.
#The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.
#Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.
#The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.
#The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: "perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist". This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).
#The fake universe: We live inside a [[virtual reality simulation]].

Omitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as "fecund universes", which proposes that universes have "offspring" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, James N., 2005, "[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-physical-constants-as-biosignature-an-anthropic-retrodiction-of-the-selfish-biocosm-hypothesis The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]" ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347–363 | date = 1983 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1983.0096 | last2 = McCrea | first2 = W. H. | issue = 1512 |bibcode = 1983RSPTA.310..347C }}&lt;/ref&gt; inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account [[cosmological]] and [[astrophysical]] considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links.

==Observational evidence==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is "required" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in ''our'' portion of ''this'' universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

Hogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | date = 2000 | pages = 1149–1161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
#a particular multiverse with a "[[measure theory|measure]]", i.e. a well defined "density of universes" (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X'' &lt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dX''), and
#an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).
The probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X''). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be "over-tuned", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.

==Applications of the principle==
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}

===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===
[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]]. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;University of Birmingham [http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm Life, Bent Chains and the Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927094126/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 29 (1957) 547&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alfred Fowler|Willie Fowler]]'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (2010) When is a prediction anthropic? Fred Hoyle and the 7.65 MeV carbon resonance. http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5332/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic inflation ===
{{Main|Cosmic inflation}}
[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] criticized the entire theory of [[cosmic inflation]] as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D.N. | last = Page | date= 1983 | title = Inflation does not explain time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | page = 39 | doi = 10.1038/304039a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.304...39P | issue=5921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] in a universe with a [[Big Bang]] origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the [[entropy]] of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. [[Paul Davies]] rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P.C.W. | last = Davies |authorlink = Paul Davies | date = 1984 | title = Inflation to the universe and time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | page =  524 | doi = 10.1038/312524a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..524D | issue=5994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any "ad hoc" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
{{Main|String theory landscape}}
[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the "backgrounds" or "vacua". The set of these vacua is often called the "[[multiverse]]" or "[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]" or "string landscape". [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

[[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Weinberg, S. | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | date = 2007 | title = Living in the multiverse | booktitle = Universe or multiverse? | editor = B.

Others—most notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]], [[Peter Woit]], and [[Lee Smolin]]—argue that this is not predictive. [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Livio]], and [[Martin Rees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Livio, M. | author2 = Rees, M. J. | last-author-amp = yes | title = Anthropic reasoning | journal =  Science| volume =  309 | pages = 1022–3 | date = 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1111446 | pmid = 16099967 | issue = 5737|bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1022L }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] (2000–2002) points out that [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]] and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some [[prior distribution]] on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

{{anchor|Spacetime}}

===Dimensions of spacetime===
[[File:Spacetime dimensionality.svg|thumb|300px|Properties of ''n''+''m''-dimensional spacetimes]]
There are two kinds of dimensions, [[spatial dimension|spatial]] (bidirectional) and [[temporal dimension|temporal]] (unidirectional).&lt;ref name="Skow2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skow|first1=Bradford|title=What makes time different from space?|journal=Noûs |date=2007 |volume=41 |pages=227–252 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824025031/http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/research/temporality.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let the number of spatial dimensions be ''N'' and the number of temporal dimensions be ''T''. That ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by [[string theory]] and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting ''N'' differ from 3 and ''T'' differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue.  

The implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who in the [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] suggested that the world is [[wikiquote:Gottfried Leibniz|"the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena."]]&lt;ref name="Leibniz1686"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried|title=Die philosophischen schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Volume 4|date=1880|publisher=Weidmann|page=427&amp;ndash;463|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Metaphysics|accessdate=13 April 2018|chapter=Discourse on Metaphysics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square [[law of universal gravitation]]. While Kant's argument is historically important, [[John D. Barrow]] says that it "[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa" (Barrow 2002: 204).&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is because the law of gravitation (or any other [[inverse-square law]]) follows from the concept of [[flux]] and the proportional relationship of flux density and the strength of field. If ''N'' = 3, then 3-dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional to the square of their size in any selected spatial dimension. In particular, a sphere of [[radius]] ''r'' has area of 4π''r''&amp;nbsp;². More generally, in a space of ''N'' dimensions, the strength of the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated by a distance of ''r'' would be inversely proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the [[orbit]] of a [[planet]] about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its [[galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ehrenfest| first = Paul| authorlink = Paul Ehrenfest| title = How do the fundamental laws of physics make manifest that Space has 3 dimensions?|journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = 61| pages = 440| date = 1920| doi = 10.1002/andp.19203660503|issue = 5 |bibcode = 1920AnP...366..440E}}. Also see Ehrenfest, P. (1917) "In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions?" ''Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy''20: 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a [[wave]] impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are &lt;math&gt;5 + 2k&lt;/math&gt; spatial dimensions, where ''k'' is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, [[Hermann Weyl]] showed that [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] works only with three dimensions of space and one of time.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H. (1922) ''Space, time, and matter''. Dover reprint: 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] or disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tangherlini| first = F. R.| title = Atoms in Higher Dimensions| journal = Nuovo Cimento| volume = 14 | issue = 27| pages = 636| date= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tegmark| first = Max| authorlink = Max Tegmark| title = On the dimensionality of spacetime| journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity| volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = L69–L75| date= April 1997| url = http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf| doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002| accessdate = 2006-12-16 |arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''T'' differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant [[partial differential equation]]s. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if ''T'' &gt; 1, Tegmark maintains that [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If ''N'' &lt; 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when ''N'' &lt; 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.

In general, it is not clear how physical law could function if ''T'' differed from 1. If ''T'' &gt; 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like [[geodesic]]s would not be necessarily maximal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1976386 | last1 = Dorling | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = The Dimensionality of Time | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/38/539/1 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 539–40 |bibcode = 1970AmJPh..38..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''N'' = 1 and ''T'' = 3 has the peculiar property that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a ''lower bound'' on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of [[tachyon]]s.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim" /&gt; 

Hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.

== Metaphysical interpretations ==
Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare [[Omega Point]]), expressing a ''creatio evolutiva'' instead the elder notion of ''creatio continua''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Johann.&amp;nbsp;Dorschner. und.&amp;nbsp;Ralph.&amp;nbsp;Neuhäuser.&amp;nbsp;Evolution. des. Kosmos. und. der. Punkt. Omega, in Nikolaus Knoepffler,&amp;nbsp;H. James Birx, Teilhard de Chardin, V&amp;R unipress GmbH, 2005, p. 109 ff&lt;/ref&gt; From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Karl W. Giberson]]&lt;ref&gt;Giberson, Karl. "Anthropic principle: A postmodern creation myth?". ''Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies''. 9.1/2 (1997): 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; has been sort of laconic in stating that{{Quote|text=What emerges is the&amp;nbsp;suggestion&amp;nbsp;that cosmology may at last be in possession of some raw material for a&amp;nbsp;[[postmodern]] creation myth.|sign=[[Karl W. Giberson]]|source=}}

===''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''===
A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a [[cosmologist]] and [[mathematical physicist]]. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from [[eutaxiology|''eutaxiological'']] reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| date=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the [[final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and "closely connected with moral values". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. J. | last = Tipler |authorlink = Frank Tipler | title = The Physics of Immortality | publisher = DoubleDay | date = 1994 |isbn =  0-385-46798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such constraint is that the universe must end in a [[big crunch]], which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about [[dark energy]], based on observations of very distant [[supernova]]s.

In his review&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, M.]], "WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP," ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; of Barrow and Tipler, [[Martin Gardner]] ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

{{quote|At the instant the [[Omega Point]] is reached, life will have gained control of ''all'' matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into ''all'' spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including ''all'' bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know. And this is the end.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception and controversies  ==
Carter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word "anthropic", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised the word "principle" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: "[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-851973-7 | date =1989}} Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or trivial [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying "if things were different, they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G. D. | author2 = Trotta, R. | title = Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Λ | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 |page = 201301 | date = 2006 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.201301 | pmid = 17155671 | issue = 20 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..97t1301S|arxiv = astro-ph/0607227 }} See also this [http://www.physorg.com/news83924839.html news story.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's ''anthropic cosmological principle'', which are [[Teleology|teleological]] notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a ''necessary prerequisite'' for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| date =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | date= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0-7167-3090-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | date= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0-8050-8121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called "[[carbon chauvinism]]", see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B. J.]] |author2=[[Martin Rees|Rees, M. J.]] | title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world | journal = Nature | volume = 278 | pages = 605–612| date = 1979 | doi = 10.1038/278605a0 | bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C | issue=5705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a [[fine tuned universe]] have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stenger| first=Victor J| authorlink = Victor Stenger | date= 2000| title=Timeless Reality: Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes| publisher=Prometheus Books| isbn = 1-57392-859-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Harnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harnik, R. | author2 = Kribs, G. | author3 = Perez, G. | date = 2006 | title =A Universe without Weak interactions | journal = Physical Review | volume = D74 | page = 035006 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevD.74.035006 |arxiv= hep-ph/0604027 | bibcode=2006PhRvD..74c5006H | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a [[weakless universe]] in which the [[weak nuclear force]] is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—[[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.

[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have "offspring" through the creation of [[black hole]]s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lee Smolin| author-link=Lee Smolin | editor=Tyson, Neil deGrasse | editor-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson | editor2=Soter, Steve | editor2-link=Steven Soter| date=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1-56584-602-9 | pages =148–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Earman John | date = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | pages = 307–317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernan McMullin]],&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan. (1994). "Fine-tuning the Universe?" In M. Shale &amp; G. Shields (ed.), ''Science, Technology, and Religious Ideas'', Lanham: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jesús Mosterín]] contend that "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation".&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús. (2005). Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed "anthropic" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

{{quote|The suggestion that an infinity of objects characterized by certain numbers or properties implies the existence among them of objects with any combination of those numbers or characteristics [...] is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. [...] The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe is equivalent to the assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all numbers (or at least all Gödel numbers of the [defining] sequences), which is obviously false.}}

'''Anupadaka''', '''anupapadaka''', '''aupapaduka''' ([[Skt.]], 'parentless; self-existing,') is a philosophical term about reality such as the 'anupadaka plane'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; or gods or [[Dhyani]]-[[Buddhas]] that fit the definition.  Actually beyond anupadaka is '[[adi (metaphysical plane)|adi]]' (Skt., 'first,') having to do with the [[first cause]], itself from [[causeless cause]].

Hence, it does not matter if scientists think there are no gods or Dhyani-Buddhas: anupadaka is still an idea about something that is an effect of the first cause or [[causality]].  In that sense it may have to do with a scientific idea or the term can be applied to one: the term came to the West from [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], which focuses on science as much as religion, and 'anupadaka' may have distinct meanings in Theosophy.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the '''calculus of constructions''' ('''CoC''') is a [[type theory]] created by [[Thierry Coquand]].  It can serve as both a typed programming language and as [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive]] [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]].  For this second reason, the CoC and its variants have been the basis for [[Coq]] and other [[proof assistant]]s.

Some of its variants include the calculus of inductive constructions (which adds [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]]),
the calculus of (co)inductive constructions (which adds [[coinduction]]), 
and the predicative calculus of inductive constructions (which removes some [[impredicativity]]).

==General traits==
The CoC is a higher-order [[typed lambda calculus]], initially developed by [[Thierry Coquand]].  It is well known for being at the top of [[Henk Barendregt|Barendregt]]'s [[lambda cube]].  It is possible within CoC to define functions from integers to integers, as well as integers to types, types to types, and types to integers.

The CoC is [[normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]], although, by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], it is impossible to prove this property within the CoC since it implies inconsistency.

== Usage ==

The CoC has been developed alongside the [[Coq]] [[proof assistant]].  As features were added (or possible liabilities removed) to the theory, they became available in Coq.

Variants of the CoC are used in other proof assistants, such as [[Matita]].

==The basics of the calculus of constructions==

The Calculus of Constructions can be considered an extension of the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]]. The Curry–Howard isomorphism associates a term in the [[Typed lambda calculus|simply typed lambda calculus]] with each natural-deduction proof in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic propositional logic]]. The Calculus of Constructions extends this isomorphism to proofs in the full intuitionistic predicate calculus, which includes proofs of quantified statements (which we will also call "propositions").

===Terms===

A ''term'' in the calculus of constructions is constructed using the following rules:

* '''T''' is a term (also called ''Type'');
* '''P''' is a term (also called ''Prop'', the type of all propositions);
* Variables (''x'', ''y'', ...) are terms;
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are terms, then so is (''A''&amp;nbsp;''B'');
* If ''A'' and ''B'' are terms and ''x'' is a variable, then following are also terms:
** (&amp;lambda;''x'':''A''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;''B''),
** (&amp;forall;''x'':''A''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;B).

In other words, the term syntax, in BNF, is then:
:&lt;math&gt;e ::= \mathbf{T} \mid \mathbf{P} \mid x \mid e \, e \mid \lambda x\mathbin{:}e.e\mid \forall x\mathbin{:}e.e&lt;/math&gt;

The calculus of constructions has five kinds of objects:
# ''proofs'', which are terms whose types are ''propositions'';
# ''propositions'', which are also known as ''small types'';
# ''predicates'', which are functions that return propositions;
# ''large types'', which are the types of predicates ('''P''' is an example of a large type);
# '''T''' itself, which is the type of large types.

===Judgments===

The calculus of constructions allows proving '''typing judgments''':

:&lt;math&gt; x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots \vdash t:B&lt;/math&gt;

Which can be read as the implication

: If variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; have types &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, then term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

The valid judgments for the calculus of constructions are derivable from a set of inference rules. In the following, we use &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to mean a sequence of type assignments 
&lt;math&gt; x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots &lt;/math&gt;, and we use '''K''' to mean either '''P''' or '''T'''. We shall write &lt;math&gt;B[x:=N]&lt;/math&gt; to mean the result of substituting the term 
&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the free variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in 
the term &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

An inference rule is written in the form

:&lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash A:B} \over {\Gamma' \vdash C:D} &lt;/math&gt;

which means

: If &lt;math&gt; \Gamma \vdash A:B &lt;/math&gt; is a valid judgment, then so is &lt;math&gt; \Gamma' \vdash C:D &lt;/math&gt;

===Inference rules for the calculus of constructions===

'''1'''.  &lt;math&gt; {{} \over {} \Gamma \vdash P : T} &lt;/math&gt;

'''2'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash A : K \over 
{\Gamma, x:A \vdash x : A}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''3'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma, x:A \vdash B : K \qquad\qquad \Gamma, x:A \vdash N : B \over 
{\Gamma \vdash (\lambda x:A . N) : (\forall x:A . B) : K}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''4'''.  &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash M : (\forall x:A . B)\qquad\qquad\Gamma
\vdash N : A \over 
{\Gamma \vdash M N : B[x := N]}} &lt;/math&gt;

'''5'''.   &lt;math&gt; {\Gamma \vdash M : A \qquad \qquad A =_\beta B \qquad \qquad B : K 
\over {\Gamma \vdash M : B}} &lt;/math&gt;

===Defining logical operators===

The calculus of constructions has very few basic operators: the only logical operator for forming propositions is &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;. However, this one operator is sufficient to define all the other logical operators:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccll}
A \Rightarrow B &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall x:A . B &amp; (x \notin B) \\
A \wedge B      &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow B \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow C &amp; \\
A \vee B        &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow (B \Rightarrow C) \Rightarrow C &amp; \\
\neg A          &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (A \Rightarrow C) &amp; \\
\exists x:A.B   &amp; \equiv &amp; \forall C:P . (\forall x:A.(B \Rightarrow C)) \Rightarrow C &amp;
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Defining data types===

The basic data types used in computer science can be defined
within the Calculus of Constructions:

; Booleans : &lt;math&gt;\forall A: P . A \Rightarrow A \Rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
; Naturals : &lt;math&gt;\forall A:P . 
(A \Rightarrow A) \Rightarrow (A \Rightarrow A)&lt;/math&gt;
; Product &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;
; Disjoint union &lt;math&gt;A + B&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;

Note that Booleans and Naturals are defined in the same way as in [[Church encoding]]. However additional problems raise from propositional extensionality and proof irrelevance [http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/Coq.Logic.ClassicalFacts.html].

The '''clerical script''' ({{zh|t=隸書|s=隶书|p=lìshū|first=t}}; Japanese: 隷書体, ''reishotai''; Vietnamese: lệ thư), also formerly [[Chancery hand|chancery]] script, is an archaic [[Chinese script styles|style]] of [[Chinese calligraphy]] which evolved from the [[Warring States period]] to the [[Qin dynasty]], was dominant in the [[Han dynasty]], and remained in use through the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]-[[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;As discussed and referenced below, proto-clerical emerged in [[Warring States]] to [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]]; it is also widely known that clerical matured in the early Han. Although popularly associated only with the Han dynasty, clerical actually remained in use alongside cursive, neo-clerical, and semi-cursive scripts until ''after'' the Wei-Jin period, when the modern [[regular script|standard script]] became dominant; see Qiu 2000, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high legibility to modern readers, it is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications such as headlines, signboards, and advertisements. This legibility stems from the highly rectilinear structure, a feature shared with modern [[Regular script|regular script (kaishu)]]. In structure and rectilinearity, it is generally similar to the modern script; however, in contrast with the tall to square modern script, it tends to be square to wide, and often has a pronounced, wavelike flaring of isolated major strokes, especially a dominant rightward or downward diagonal stroke. Some structures are also archaic.

==Origins==

Clerical script is popularly but mistakenly thought to have developed or been invented in the early [[Han dynasty]] from the [[Small_Seal_Script|small seal script]]. The process of change between small seal script and clerical script is referred to as the ''Libian'' (lit: Clerical Evolution) (隸變).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdic.net/c/6/104/279737.htm Definition of 隸變: 文字學上指篆書改寫成隸書的經過。隸變過的形體，往往與原篆意有明顯差異。例如：篆書「󹡨」隸定成「秊」；隸變成「年」。隸定字仍可窺測出篆體的結構，隸變字則未必。&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also historical traditions dating to the Hàn dynasty which mistakenly attributed the creation of clerical script to the Qín dynasty and in particular to Chéng Miǎo, who was said to have invented it at the behest of [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.103, esp. footnote 28. Qiu cites Caì Yōng as saying: "Cheng Miao got rid of ancient (script) and established the clerical script forms".&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional account is that it was invented by government scribes, in particular those involved in the justice and penal systems.&lt;ref&gt;This is the version given in the Hanshu, acc. to Táng Lán (唐蘭) 1979.《中國文字學》（上海：上海古籍出版社）。Zhōnggúo Wénzìxué (Chinese Linguistics). Shànghǎi Gǔjí Publishing, p.165, and Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; However, from written materials unearthed by archaeologists, it is now known that ''all'' stages of Chinese writing underwent periods of natural evolution, and none of them were inventions by one person; this is true of clerical script as well.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, rather than being established by government scribes, it has been argued that clerical script was already in popular use, and the Qín dynasty use by scribes merely reflects this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Táng Lán 1979, p.165, cited in Qiu 2000, p.107; this does not, however, preclude influence by those scribes and even Cheng Miao in the process; as Qiu notes, Cheng Miao may have played a role in systematizing the script, thus leading to the mistaken tradition of his inventing it (Qiu p.107), much as Li Si's standardization of the already extant small seal script led to misperceptions that he had invented it.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries now clearly show that an immature form of clerical script ("proto-clerical") was already developing in the state of Qín during the Warring States period,&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000; p.59 &amp; p.104&lt;/ref&gt; and into the early Western Hàn; this can be seen on a number of [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo books]] unearthed recently.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the writing immediately preceding clerical script was not merely seal script alone; rather, there was a coexistence of seal script (the at-first dominant and formal style) alongside an increasingly popular but secondary form of "vulgar", "popular", or "common" writing, which was very roughly executed and which was generally rectilinear.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.104"&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.104"/&gt; The structures and style of many of the characters executed in this vulgar writing were similar or even identical to their later clerical script counterparts,&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104-5; others were similar or identical to the forms of cursive script and were instrumental in its formation -- Qiu p.108-9&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to conclude that proto-clerical (and therefore clerical) script evolved not from seal script but from the vulgar writing of Qín, which coexisted with seal script in Warring States to Qín dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The Qín bamboo script is a good example of this transition, having evolved from vulgar Qín writing and considered by some to constitute Qín clerical script.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The etymology of the Chinese name for the script lìshū ({{zh|t=隸書|s=隶书}}) is uncertain. ''Lì'' meant a slave or prisoner serving the state, and thus, some infer that the script was used in recording the affairs related to such slaves, while others infer that it was used by prisoners conscripted as scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and further evolution==
During Warring States, proto-clerical script emerged in casual, informal usage. During the Qin dynasty it appears to have also been used in some scribal capacity, but never in formal usage. Maturing into clerical script in the early Han, it soon became the dominant script for general purposes, while seal script remained in use for the most formal purposes such as some [[Stele#China|stelae]], signet seals (name chops), and especially the titles of written works and stelae; some [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] was also in use at the time.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.113"&gt;Qiu 2000, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly the same time, the clerical script was used and inscribed onto many stelae which later influenced subsequent development of Chinese calligraphic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vincentpoon.com/the-stele-of-mount-hua-temple-at-the-west-alp.html|title=The Stele of Mount Hua Temple at The West Alp|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of clerical script, a new form then emerged in the middle of the Eastern Han dynasty, which Qiu (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;113) terms "neo-clerical" script; it was from this neo-clerical and from cursive that by late in the Eastern Han [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] would then evolve, out of which then emerged the modern standard script. Thus, according to Qiu, the evolution from clerical script to standard script was not a direct step as commonly supposed.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.113"/&gt;

'''Confusion''' (from [[Latin]] ''confusĭo, -ōnis'', from ''confundere'': "to pour together;" "to mingle together;" "to confuse") is the state of being bewildered or unclear in one’s mind about something.

==Medical term==
{{Infobox symptom

The term "acute mental confusion"&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/confusion ''Confusion Definition'']; [[Oxford Dictionary]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is often used interchangeably with [[delirium]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symptomfind.com/symptoms/confusion/ ''Delirium'']; Symptom Finder online ; accessed .&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' and the ''[[Medical Subject Headings]]'' publications to describe the [[pathology]]. These refer to the loss of [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]], or the ability to place oneself correctly in the world by time, location and personal identity. Mental confusion is sometimes accompanied by disordered [[consciousness]] (the loss of linear thinking) and [[memory]] loss (the ability to correctly recall previous events or learn new material).&lt;ref name=thefreedictionary&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mental+confusion thefreedictionary.com] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers; 2007; Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Confusion may result from drug side effects or from a relatively sudden brain dysfunction.  Acute confusion is often called [[delirium]] (or "acute confusional state"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient.info/doctor/Acute-Confusional-State.htm ''Acute Confusional State'']; Dr. Gurvinder Rull; patient.info; Document ID/Version/Reference: 1714/22/bgp2104; updated: 13 Jan 2009; accessed: ''when?''.&lt;/ref&gt; although delirium often includes a much broader array of disorders than simple confusion.  These disorders include the inability to focus attention; various impairments in awareness; and temporal or spatial dis-orientation.  Mental confusion can result from chronic organic brain pathologies, such as [[dementia]], as well.

===Differential diagnosis===

The most common causes of drug induced acute confusion are [[dopaminergic]] drugs (used for the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]]), [[diuretics]], [[tricyclic antidepressants|tricyclic]] or [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] and [[benzodiazepines]].  The elderly, and especially those with pre-existing dementia, are most at risk for drug induced acute confusional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hufschmidt |first1=A. |last2=Shabarin |first2=V. |last3=Zimmer |first3=T. |title=Drug-induced confusional states: the usual suspects? |journal=[[Acta Neurologica Scandinavica]] |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=436–8 |date=Dec 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0404.2009.01174.x |pmid=19804475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New research is finding a link between [[Vitamin D]] deficiency and [[cognitive impairment]] (which includes 'foggy brain').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdage.com/brain-fitness/vitamin-d-linked-to-cognitive-impairment''Vitamin D Linked to Cognitive Impairment'']; [[Third Age]] online; accessed: .&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=WP:MEDRS|date=June 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11934">'''Constructive set theory''' is an approach to [[constructivism (mathematics)|mathematical constructivism]] following the program of [[axiomatic set theory]]. That is, it uses the usual [[first-order logic|first-order]] language of classical set theory, and although of course the logic is [[constructive logic|constructive]], there is no explicit use of [[constructive type theory|constructive types]]. Rather, there are just [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], thus it can look very much like classical mathematics done on the most common [[foundation of mathematics|foundations]], namely the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] (ZFC).

== Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel ==
In 1973, [[John Myhill]] proposed a system of set theory based on [[intuitionistic logic]]&lt;ref&gt;Myhill, '' "Some properties of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory"'', Proceedings of the 1971 Cambridge Summer School in Mathematical Logic (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 337) (1973) pp 206-231&lt;/ref&gt; taking the most common foundation, ZFC, and throwing away the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) and the [[law of the excluded middle]] (LEM), leaving everything else as is. However, different forms of some of the ZFC axioms which are equivalent in the classical setting are inequivalent in the constructive setting, and some forms imply LEM.

The system, which has come to be known as IZF, or Intuitionistic Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF refers to ZFC without the axiom of choice), has the usual axioms of [[axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom schema of separation|separation]] and [[axiom of power set|power set]]. The [[axiom of regularity]] is stated in the form of an [[epsilon-induction|axiom schema of set induction]]. Also, while Myhill used the [[axiom schema of replacement]] in his system,  IZF usually stands for the version with  [[Axiom schema of replacement#Axiom schema of collection|collection]].

While the axiom of replacement requires the relation ''φ'' to be a [[function (set theory)|function]] over the set ''A'' (that is, for every ''x'' in ''A'' there is associated exactly one ''y''), the axiom of collection does not: it merely requires there be associated at least one ''y'', and it asserts the existence of a set which collects at least one such ''y'' for each such ''x''. The [[axiom of regularity]] as it is normally stated implies LEM, whereas the form of set induction does not. The formal statements of these two schemata are:

&lt;math&gt;\forall A \; ([\forall x \in A \; \exists y \; \phi(x,y)] \to \exists B \; \forall x \in A \; \exists y \in B \; \phi(x,y))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;[\forall y \; ([\forall x \in y \; \phi(x)] \to \phi(y))] \to \forall y \; \phi(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Adding LEM back to IZF results in ZF, as LEM makes collection equivalent to replacement and set induction equivalent to regularity. Even without LEM, IZF's proof-theoretical power equals that of ZF.

=== Predicativity ===
While IZF is based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, it is considered [[impredicative]]. It allows formation of sets using the [[axiom of separation]] with any proposition, including ones which contain [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s which are not bounded. Thus new sets can be formed in terms of the universe of all sets. Additionally the power set axiom implies the existence of a set of [[truth value]]s. In the presence of LEM, this set exists and has two elements. In the absence of it, the set of truth values is also considered impredicative.

== Myhill's constructive set theory ==
The subject was begun by [[John Myhill]] to provide a formal foundation for [[Errett Bishop]]'s program of constructive mathematics. As he presented it, Myhill's system CST is a constructive first-order logic with three [[many-sorted logic|sorts]]: [[natural numbers]], [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, and sets. The system is:

* Constructive first-order predicate logic with identity, and basic axioms related to the three sorts.
* The usual [[Peano axioms]] for natural numbers.
* The usual [[axiom of extensionality]] for sets, as well as one for functions, and the usual [[axiom of union]].
* A form of the [[axiom of infinity]] asserting that the collection of natural numbers (for which he introduces a constant '''N''') is in fact a set.
* Axioms asserting that the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] and [[range (mathematics)|range]] of a function are both sets. Additionally, an [[axiom of non-choice]] asserts the existence of a choice function in cases where the choice is already made. Together these act like the usual [[axiom schema of replacement|replacement axiom]] in classical set theory.
* The [[axiom of exponentiation]], asserting that for any two sets, there is a third set which contains all (and only) the functions whose domain is the first set, and whose range is the second set. This is a greatly weakened form of the [[axiom of power set]] in classical set theory, to which Myhill, among others, objected on the grounds of its [[impredicative|impredicativity]].
* The [[axiom schema of predicative separation|axiom of restricted, or predicative, separation]], which is a weakened form of the [[axiom schema of separation|separation axiom]] in classical set theory, requiring that any [[quantification (logic)|quantification]]s be bounded to another set.
* An [[axiom of dependent choice]], which is much weaker than the usual [[axiom of choice]].

== Aczel's constructive Zermelo–Fraenkel ==
[[Peter Aczel]]'s ''constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Aczel and Michael Rathjen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130619020751/https://www.mittag-leffler.se/preprints/files/IML-0001-40.pdf ''Notes on Constructive Set Theory''], Reports Institut Mittag-Leffler, Mathematical Logic - 2000/2001, No. 40&lt;/ref&gt; or '''CZF''', is essentially IZF with its impredicative features removed. It strengthens the collection scheme, and then drops the impredicative power set axiom and replaces it with another collection scheme. Finally the separation axiom is restricted, as in Myhill's CST. This theory has a relatively simple interpretation in a version of [[constructive type theory]] and has modest proof theoretic strength as well as a fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. Adding LEM to this theory also recovers full ZF.

The collection axioms are:

'''Strong collection schema''': This is the constructive replacement for the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. It states that if φ is a [[binary relation]] between sets which is ''[[Functional relation|total]]'' over a certain domain set (that is, it has at least one image of every element in the domain), then there exists a set which contains at least one image under φ of every element of the domain, and only images of elements of the domain. Formally, for any formula φ:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a ((\forall x \in a \; \exists y \; \phi(x,y)) \to \exists b \; (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \phi(x,y)) \wedge (\forall y \in b \; \exists x \in a \; \phi(x,y)))&lt;/math&gt;

'''Subset collection schema''': This is the constructive version of the [[power set axiom]]. Formally, for any formula φ:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \; \exists u \; \forall z ((\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \phi(x,y,z)) \to \exists v \in u \; (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in v \; \phi(x,y,z)) \wedge (\forall y \in v \; \exists x \in a \; \phi(x,y,z)))&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to a single and somewhat clearer '''axiom of fullness''': between any two sets ''a'' and ''b'', there is a set ''c'' which contains a total subrelation of any  total relation between ''a'' and ''b'' that can be encoded as a set of [[ordered pair]]s. Formally:

&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \; \exists c \subseteq P(a,b) \; \forall R \in P(a,b) \; \exists S \in c \; S \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;

where the references to ''P(a,b)'' are defined by:

&lt;math&gt;R \in P(a,b) \iff (\forall u \in R \; \exists x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \langle x,y \rangle = u) \wedge (\forall x \in a \; \exists y \in b \; \langle x,y \rangle \in R)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c \subseteq P(a,b) \iff \forall R \in c \; R \in P(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

and some set-encoding of the ordered pair &lt;x,y&gt; is assumed.

The axiom of fullness implies CST's axiom of exponentiation: given two sets, the collection of all total functions from one to the other is also in fact a set.

The remaining axioms of CZF are: the axioms of [[axiom of extensionality|extensionality]], [[axiom of pairing|pairing]], [[axiom of union|union]], and [[axiom of infinity|infinity]] are the same as in ZF; and [[epsilon-induction|set induction]] and [[axiom schema of predicative separation|predicative separation]] are the same as above.

== Interpretability in type theory ==
{{expand section|date=June 2008}}
In 1977 Aczel showed that CZF can be interpreted in [[Martin-Löf type theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Aczel, Peter: 1978. The type theoretic interpretation of constructive set theory. In: A. MacIntyre et al. (eds.), Logic Colloquium '77, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 55–66.&lt;/ref&gt; (using the [[propositions-as-types]] approach) providing what is now seen a standard model of CZF in type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-first=Godehard |editor1-last=Link|title=One Hundred Years of Russell ́s Paradox: Mathematics, Logic, Philosophy|year=2004|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-019968-0| chapter =Predicativity, Circularity, and Anti-Foundation | first = M. | last= Rathjen| url=http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~rathjen/russelle.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Ingrid Lindström showed that [[non-well-founded set]]s obtained by replacing the [[axiom of foundation]] in CZF with [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]] (CZFA) can also be interpreted in Martin-Löf type theory.&lt;ref&gt;Lindström, Ingrid: 1989.

== Interpretability in category theory ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
[[Presheaf (category theory)|Presheaf]] models for constructive set theory were introduced by Nicola Gambino in 2004. They are analogous to the Presheaf models for intuitionistic set theory developed by [[Dana Scott]] in the 1980s (which remained unpublished).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Gambino | first1 = N. | chapter = PRESHEAF MODELS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE SET THEORIES | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198566519.003.0004 | title = From Sets and Types to Topology and Analysis | pages = 62–96 | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780198566519 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = http://www.math.unipa.it/~ngambino/Research/Papers/presheaf.pdf| editor = Laura Crosilla and Peter Schuster }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, D.

Disemvoweling is a common feature of [[SMS language]]&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; as disemvoweling requires little [[cognitive load|cognitive effort]]{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}} to read, so it is often used where space is costly. The word ''disemvoweling'' is a [[portmanteau]] combining ''vowel'' and ''[[Disembowelment|disembowel]]''.&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt;

The word was used with precisely this meaning in the 1939 novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;515).

==History==
A technique dubbed ''splat out'' was used by [[Usenet]] moderators to prevent [[flamewar]]s, by substituting a "splat" (i.e., [[asterisk]]) for some letters, often the vowels, of highly charged words in postings. Examples include ''[[Godwin's Law|Nazi]]''→''N*z*'', ''[[Creation–evolution controversy|evolution]]''→''*v*l*t**n'', ''[[gun control]]''→''g*n c*ntr*l''. "The purpose is not to make the word unrecognizable but to make it [[use–mention distinction|a mention rather than a use]]."&lt;ref name="splatout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/S/splat-out.html|title=splat out|last=Raymond |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric S.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, ''New York Times'' reporter Noam Cohen criticized disemvoweling as a moderation tool, citing a June 2008 dispute about the deletion of all posts on ''Boing Boing'' that mentioned sex columnist [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]]{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}}
. In the ''Boing Boing'' comment threads resulting from this controversy, Nielsen Hayden used the disemvoweling technique. Cohen noted that disemvoweling was "Not quite censorship, but not quite unfettered commentary either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Noam|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07link.html|title=Poof!

Matt Baumgartner, a blogger at the [[Times Union (Albany)|Albany ''Times Union'']], reported in August 2009 that the newspaper's lawyers had told him to stop disemvoweling comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/baumgartner/a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-why/1641/|title=A, E, I, O, U and sometimes why|last=Baumgartner |first=Matt |date=31 August 2009|website=City Brights|publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |accessdate=6 October 2009 |location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Nielsen Hayden originally disemvoweled postings manually, using [[Microsoft Word]]. Because the letter Y is sometimes a vowel and sometimes a consonant, there are a variety of ways to treat it.

[[File:Hyperbola one over x.svg|thumb|Diagrammatic representation of limits approaching infinity|The function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x''. As ''x'' approaches 0 from the right, ''y'' approaches infinity. As ''x'' approaches 0 from the left, ''y'' approaches negative infinity.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''division by zero''' is [[division (mathematics)|division]] where the divisor (denominator) is [[0 (number)|zero]]. Such a division can be formally [[expression (mathematics)|expressed]] as ''a''/0 where ''a'' is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives ''a'' (assuming ''a''≠0), and so division by zero is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]]. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is the form of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is an [[indeterminate form]]. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to ''a''/0 is contained in [[George Berkeley]]'s criticism of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in 1734 in ''[[The Analyst]]'' ("ghosts of departed quantities").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are mathematical structures in which ''a''/0 is defined for some ''a'' such as in the [[Riemann sphere]] and the [[projectively extended real line]]; however, such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic (the [[Field mathematics#Definition and illustration|field axioms]]).

In [[Computer|computing]], a [[computer programming|program error]] may result from an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the programming environment and the type of number (e.g. [[floating point]], [[integer]]) being divided by zero, it may generate [[Extended real number line|positive or negative infinity]] by the [[IEEE 754]] floating point standard, generate an [[exception handling|exception]], generate an [[error message]], cause the program to terminate, result in a special [[NaN|not-a-number]] value, a [[Hang (computing)|freeze]] via infinite [[Loop (computing)|loop]], or a [[Crash (computing)|crash]].

==Elementary arithmetic==
When division is explained at the [[elementary arithmetic]] level, it is often considered as splitting a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of objects into equal parts. As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{5}&lt;/math&gt; = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{1}&lt;/math&gt; = 10 cookies.

So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to evenly distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In [[mathematical jargon]], a set of 10 items cannot be [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] into 0 subsets. So &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.

Similar problems occur if one has 0 cookies and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase "'''the''' number". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] every set in our partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000.

If there are, say, 5 cookies and 2 people, the problem is in "evenly distribute". In any integer partition of a 5-set into 2 parts, one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other. But the problem with 5 cookies and 2 people can be solved by cutting one cookie in half. The problem with 5 cookies and 0 people cannot be solved in any way that preserves the meaning of "divides".

Another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the 10/0 example above, setting x = 10/0, if ''x'' equals ten divided by zero, then ''x'' times zero equals ten, but there is no ''x'' that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any other number than zero). If instead of x=10/0 we have x=0/0, then every ''x'' satisfies the question 'what number x, multiplied by zero, gives zero?'

==Early attempts==
The ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta]]'' of [[Brahmagupta]] (598–668) is the earliest known text to treat [[0 (number)|zero]] as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert |title=The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |location=New York |pages=68–75 |isbn=0-19-514237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author could not explain division by zero in his texts: his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities. According to Brahmagupta,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 830, [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] tried unsuccessfully to correct Brahmagupta's mistake in his book in ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'': "A number remains unchanged when divided by zero."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

==Algebra==

The four basic operations − addition, subtraction, multiplication and division − as applied to whole numbers (positive integers), with some restrictions, in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply. For instance, to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another, the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of [[integers]] in order to incorporate the negative integers. Similarly, to support division of any integer by any other, the realm of numbers must expand to the [[rational numbers]]. During this gradual expansion of the number system, care is taken to ensure that the "extended operations", when applied to the older numbers, do not produce different results. Loosely speaking, since division by zero has no meaning (is ''undefined'') in the whole number setting, this remains true as the setting expands to the [[real number|real]] or even [[complex numbers]].

As the realm of numbers to which these operations can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in the realm of integers, subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1925|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, "Why can't we divide by zero?", becomes "Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.

In the modern approach to constructing the field of real numbers, the rational numbers appear as an intermediate step in the development that is founded on set theory. First, the natural numbers (including zero) are established on an axiomatic basis such as [[Peano axioms|Peano's axiom system]] and then this is expanded to the [[ring of integers]]. The next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established, namely, addition, multiplication and the integers. Starting with the set of [[ordered pair]]s of integers, {{math|{(''a'', ''b'')}}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, define a [[binary relation]] on this set by {{math|(''a'', ''b'') ≃ (''c'', ''d'')}} if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. This relation is shown to be an [[equivalence relation]] and its [[equivalence class]]es are then defined to be the rational numbers. It is in the formal proof that this relation is an equivalence relation that the requirement that the second coordinate is not zero is needed (for verifying [[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1982|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henkin|Smith|Varineau|Walsh|2012|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above explanation may be too abstract and technical for many purposes, but if one assumes the existence and properties of the rational numbers, as is commonly done in elementary mathematics, the "reason" that division by zero is not allowed is hidden from view. Nevertheless, a (non-rigorous) justification can be given in this setting.

It follows from the properties of the number system we are using (that is, integers, rationals, reals, etc.), if {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} then the equation&lt;ref&gt;if {{math|1=''b'' = 0}} this is not an equation since the left side is not a number and the right side is a number.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|1={{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} = ''c''}} is equivalent to {{math|1= ''a'' = ''b'' × ''c''}}. Assuming that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|0}}}} is a number {{mvar|c}}, then it must be that {{math|1=''a'' = 0 × ''c'' = 0}}. However, the single number {{mvar|c}} would then have to be determined by the equation {{math|1= 0 = 0 × ''c''}}, but every number satisfies this equation, so we cannot assign a numerical value to {{math|{{sfrac|0|0}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division as the inverse of multiplication===
The concept that explains [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=E-Z Math |edition=revised |first1=Anthony |last1=Prindle |first2=Katie |last2=Prindle |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7641-4132-4 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC&amp;pg=PA35 Extract of page 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{3}=2&lt;/math&gt;
since 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;?\times 3=6&lt;/math&gt;
is true. But the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=6.&lt;/math&gt;
But any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation.

The expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0.

In general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined.

===Fallacies===
{{details|Mathematical fallacy}}
A compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., [[fallacy|fallacies]]) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation.

With the following assumptions:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0\times 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The following must be true:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by zero gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{0}{0}\times 1 = \frac{0}{0}\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplified, this yields:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number.

However, it is possible to disguise a division by zero in an [[algebra]]ic argument,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; leading to [[invalid proof]]s that, for instance, {{math|1=1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let {{math|1= 1 = ''x''}}.
:Multiply by {{mvar|x}} to get
::&lt;math&gt;x = x^2.&lt;/math&gt; 
:Subtract {{math|1}} from each side to get
::&lt;math&gt;x - 1 = x^2 - 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:Divide both sides by {{math|''x'' - 1}}
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{x-1} = \frac{x^2 -1}{x - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Which simplifies to
::&lt;math&gt;1 = x + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:But, since {{math|1=''x'' = 1}},
::  &lt;math&gt;1 = 1 + 1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
The disguised division by zero occurs since {{math|''x'' − 1}} is zero when {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}.

==Calculus==
===Extended real line===
{{see also|l'Hôpital's rule}}

At first glance it seems possible to define ''a''/0 by considering the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''a''/''b'' as ''b'' approaches 0.

For any positive ''a'', the limit from the right is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^+} {a \over b} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

however, the limit from the left is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^-} {a \over b} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

and so the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0} {a \over b}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined (the limit is also undefined for negative ''a'').

Furthermore, there is no obvious definition of 0/0 that can be derived from considering the limit of a ratio. The limit

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{(a,b) \to (0,0)} {a \over b} &lt;/math&gt;

does not exist. Limits of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} {f(x) \over g(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

in which both ''ƒ''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') approach 0 as ''x'' approaches 0, may equal any real or infinite value, or may not exist at all, depending on the particular functions ''ƒ'' and ''g''. These and other similar facts show that the expression 0/0 cannot be [[well-defined]] as a limit.

====Formal operations====
A [[formal calculation]] is one carried out using rules of arithmetic, without consideration of whether the result of the calculation is well-defined. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of ''a''/0, where ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, as being &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This infinity can be either positive, negative, or unsigned, depending on context. For example, formally:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {\frac{1}{x} =\frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {1}}{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {x}}} = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

As with any formal calculation, invalid results may be obtained. A logically rigorous (as opposed to formal) computation would assert only that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = +\infty\text{ and }\lim\limits_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[one-sided limit]]s are different, the two-sided limit does not exist in the standard framework of the real numbers. Also, the fraction 1/0 is left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]] in the [[extended real line]], therefore it and

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} 1 }{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x}&lt;/math&gt;

are meaningless [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]].

===Projectively extended real line===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[projectively extended real line]], which is a [[one-point compactification]] of the real line. Here &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; means an [[point at infinity|unsigned infinity]], an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies &lt;math&gt;-\infty = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, which is necessary in this context. In this structure, &lt;math&gt;a/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; can be defined for nonzero ''a'', and &lt;math&gt;a/\infty = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is the natural way to view the range of the [[tangent]] function and cotangent functions of [[trigonometry]]: tan(''x'') approaches the single point at infinity as ''x'' approaches either &lt;math&gt;+\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; from either direction.

This definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], and should not be expected to behave like one. For example, &lt;math&gt;\infty + \infty&lt;/math&gt; is undefined in this extension of the real line.

===Riemann sphere===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann sphere]], which is of major importance in [[complex analysis]]. Here too &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an unsigned infinity – or, as it is often called in this context, the [[point at infinity]]. This set is analogous to the projectively extended real line, except that it is based on the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s. In the Riemann sphere, &lt;math&gt;1/0=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, as is &lt;math&gt;0\times\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

===Extended non-negative real number line===
{{unsourced|subsection|date=October 2018}}
The negative real numbers can be discarded, and infinity introduced, leading to the set [0,&amp;nbsp;∞], where division by zero can be naturally defined as ''a''/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ for positive&amp;nbsp;''a''. While this makes division defined in more cases than usual, subtraction is instead left undefined in many cases, because there are no negative numbers.

==Higher mathematics==
Although division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures.

===Non-standard analysis===
In the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero [[infinitesimal]]s is possible.

===Distribution theory===
In [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] one can extend the function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using [[Cauchy principal value]]s). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a 'value' of this distribution at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; a sophisticated answer refers to the [[singular support]] of the distribution.

===Linear algebra===
In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra (or [[linear algebra]] in general), one can define a pseudo-division, by setting ''a''/''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in which ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represents the [[Moore–Penrose inverse|pseudoinverse]] of ''b''. It can be proven that if ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; exists, then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''b'' equals 0, then b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

===Abstract algebra===
Any number system that forms a [[commutative ring]]—for instance, the integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers—can be extended to a [[wheel theory|wheel]] in which division by zero is always possible; however, in such a case, "division" has a slightly different meaning.

The concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a [[skew field]] (which for this reason is called a [[division ring]]). However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''' of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; should be the solution ''x'' of the equation &lt;math&gt;2x = 2&lt;/math&gt;. But in the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''', 2 is a [[zero divisor]]. This equation has two distinct solutions, ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 4, so the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]].

In field theory, the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is only shorthand for the formal expression ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the multiplicative inverse of ''b''. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when ''b'' is zero. Modern texts, that define fields as a special type of ring, include the axiom 0&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1 for fields (or its equivalent) so that the [[zero ring]] is excluded from being a field. In the zero ring, division by zero is possible, which shows that the other field axioms are not sufficient to exclude division by zero in a field.

==Computer arithmetic==
[[File:TI86 Calculator DivByZero.jpg|thumb|Most calculators, such as this [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-86]], will halt execution and display an error message when the user or a running program attempts to divide by zero.]]
[[File:Division by zero on android 2.2.1 calculator.png|thumb|196px|x294px|Division by zero on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2.1 calculator shows the symbol of infinity.]]
The [[IEEE floating-point standard]], supported by almost all modern [[floating-point unit]]s, specifies that every [[floating point]] arithmetic operation, including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports [[signed zero]], as well as [[infinity]] and [[NaN]] (''not a number''). There are two zeroes: +0 (''positive zero'') and −0 (''negative zero'') and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In [[IEEE 754]] arithmetic, ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;+0 is positive infinity when ''a'' is positive, negative infinity when ''a'' is negative, and NaN when ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by [[−0 (number)|−0]] instead.

The justification for this definition is to preserve the sign of the result in case of [[arithmetic underflow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cody|first=W.J.|title=Analysis of Proposals for the Floating-Point Standard|journal=Computer|date=March 1981|volume=14|issue=3|pages=65|doi=10.1109/C-M.1981.220379|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1667286|accessdate=11 September 2012|quote=With appropriate care to be certain that the algebraic signs are not determined by rounding error, the affine mode preserves order relations while fixing up overflow. Thus, for example, the reciprocal of a negative number which underflows is still negative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(''x''/2), where ''x'' = ±2&lt;sup&gt;−149&lt;/sup&gt;, the computation ''x''/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching ''x'', and the result will be ±∞ with sign matching ''x''. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.

Integer division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an [[exception handling|exception]] when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others will simply continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer.

Because of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer [[programming language]]s (including those used by [[calculator]]s) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a "Divide by zero" error. In these cases, if some special behavior is desired for division by zero, the condition must be explicitly tested (for example, using an [[if statement]]). Some programs (especially those that use [[fixed-point arithmetic]] where no dedicated floating-point hardware is available) will use behavior similar to the IEEE standard, using large positive and negative numbers to approximate infinities. In some programming languages, an attempt to divide by zero results in [[undefined behavior]]. The graphical programming language [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch 2]] used in many schools returns Infinity or -Infinity depending on the sign of the dividend.

In [[two's complement]] arithmetic, attempts to divide the smallest signed integer by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; are attended by similar problems, and are handled with the same range of solutions, from explicit error conditions to [[undefined behavior]].

Most calculators will either return an error or state that 1/0 is undefined; however, some [[Texas Instruments|TI]] and [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] graphing calculators will evaluate (1/0)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ∞.

'''Ecogovernmentality''', (or '''environmentality'''), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government (Malette, 2009).  Begun in the mid-1990s by a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental studies]].

Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

Ecogovernmentality is part of the broader area of [[political ecology]].  It can be situated within the ongoing debates over how to balance concern with socio-natural relationships with attention to the actual environmental impact of specific interactions.  The term is most useful to authors like Bryant, Watts and Peet who argue for the importance of a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of nature that builds from [[post-structuralist]] concerns with knowledge, power and discourse.  In addition, it is of particular use to [[Geography|geographers]] because of its ability to link place based socio-environmental phenomena with the non-place based influences of both national and international systems of governance.  Particularly, for studies of environmental changes that extend beyond the borders one particular region, ecogovernmentality can prove a useful analytical tool for tracing the manifestations of specific policy across scales ranging from the individual, the [[community]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and on to larger structures of international [[environmental governance]].

== Resource management and the state ==
Work done by Rutherford, on US [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Assessments]], and by Agrawal on local forest governance in India, are examples of this method of analysis.  Both illustrate how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (statistical models of [[pollution]], or the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (the EIA assessment regime or local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].

Within a geographical context, this type of analysis provides insight into how territory is brought under state control, and how the [[regulation]] of human interaction with this territory is achieved.  Focusing on the evolution of techniques of [[cartography]], systems of [[Biological classification|natural classification]], and early attempts at scientific [[resource management]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Braun (2000, 2003) and Scott (1998) show how new systems of knowledge extend systems of governmentality into the [[Nature|natural world]].  Fundamental to this analysis is a connection between the abstract [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] logic employed by states and the shape of the territory under their control. In Scott, for example, measuring nature in terms of concepts of production and natural resources “allowed the state to impose that logic on the very reality that was observed” (Scott, 14).  The complex natural systems of a given place are first depicted as simplified sites of managed [[resource extraction]]. As part of this management their ecological composition is changed (through types of planting, [[harvest]]ing and extraction) in an attempt to make them resemble more closely the simplified statistical systems with which they are measured.

In this manifestation, which focuses primarily on the administration of particular resources at a [[Nation|national level]], ecogovernmentality is linked to the larger governmental aims identified by Foucault of securing the [[wellbeing]] of its inhabitants by managing “a complex composed of men and things” (93).  Scott’s work on scientific [[forestry]] in [[early modern Europe]] shows how the rational models constructed by state foresters were part of the larger body of statistical knowledge created to manage [[population]] and facilitate “[[taxation]], political control, and [[conscription]]” (23).  Likewise, Braun’s analysis of the Geological Survey of Canada creates a clear link between methods of measuring and representing the [[mineral composition]] of a territory, and the structures of government put in place both to create the concept of a unified nation and “to manage individuals, goods and wealth so as to improve the condition of the state’s population” (27).

Here, ecogovernmentality is seen as a subset of concerns within of the larger Foucauldian concept. But implicit in this is an important claim: that the types of knowledge produced in the process of making nature intelligible to the state have an important influence on the evolution of state rationality itself, an influence not adequately covered in Foucault’s original [[formulation]].  They seek to add to Foucault’s discussion of population and the operation of systems of knowledge/power that normalized certain ways of acting and being and marginalized others.  Building on Foucault’s brief references to “resources, means of subsistence [and] the territory with its specific qualities”(93), their contribution is the investigation of the parallel systems of measuring and assigning value to the natural world (the “[[crop]]” and the “[[weed]]” (Scott, 13) acting as homologies to categories like “[[sanity]]” and “[[insanity]]” in Foucault’s work) and to give these their due in discussions of the formation of state rationality and structures of governmentality.

== Eco-power and discipline ==
The work of Timothy Luke pushes the reach of this concept further, by envisaging a radically different relationship between governmentality and ecogovernmentality.  He argues that the ecological domain has become the “ultimate domain of being”(150) the key location for the production of knowledge and power.  Following Foucault, Luke traces this transformation back to a specific historical moment, the period of the early 70s encompassing the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and the détente between the [[USSR]] and the [[United States of America|US]].  From these beginnings, [[Conservation movement|environmental considerations]] grow, fertilized during the 1980s by the formation of [[Intergovernmental organization|international bodies]], like the [[UN World Commission on Environment and Development]], and increased concern and awareness over [[Steady state economy|ecological limits]] to [[Human development (humanity)|human development]].  The end result is the “environmentalization” of the production and exercise of knowledge and power.  Reversing the earlier focus on the integration of environmental knowledge into broader state projects of [[socio-economic management]], here it is these projects themselves which are reshaped by new forms of environmental knowledge (specifically the concepts of “[[ecology]]” and “[[sustainability]]”).  It is this new structure that becomes known as Ecogovernmentality.

Luke argues that heightened awareness of [[social vulnerability]] to [[environmental factors]] coupled with the increased importance of [[Macro-economics|macro-economic]] [[competition]] (rather than Cold-War [[Military conflict|military confrontation]]) in geo-political power struggles led to the rise of [[sustainable development]] as the synthesis of these two interrelated concerns.  The [[Discipline|disciplinary power]] of governmentality is refigured as “enviro-discipline”, a broader concept that “expresses the authority of eco-knowledgeable, geo-powered forces to police the fitness of all biological [[organisms]] and the health of their natural environments” (146).  This constitutes an important expansion of the object of governmental rule and the area to be managed.  Foucault’s focus on “population” now includes “all of life’s [[biodiversity]]” (Luke, 122) and, given the interconnected nature of environmental systems, states must now seek to extend their control far outside of their [[Border|territorial boundaries]] to ensure the security and productivity of their population (Luke 134).

Uniting both broad and narrow definitions of Ecogovernmentality is the attention paid to environmental subject formation, or the creation of environmental subject positions.  Definitions of these subject positions vary from Darrier’s (1999) construction of the environmental subject as a site for resistance to [[consumerism]] and the [[commodification]] of the relationship between the individual and the environment, through Agrawal’s broadly neutral concept of “environmentality” which denotes an acceptance on the part of the individual that nature is an object to be managed and their accompanying involvement in this process, to Luke’s (1999) assertion that “the environment emerges as a ground for [[Normalization (sociology)|normalizing]] individual behavior” that supersedes the previous influences of “the ethical concerns of family, community and nation” (149).  Underlying these [[Divergence|divergent]] definitions, is the common claim that the relationship between individual and environment is key to current analysis of systems of state management and governmentality.

== Ecogovernmentality and climate change ==

Since about 2002, scholars have analyzed the discourses surrounding global [[climate change]] and [[Climate change policy|related policies]] using ideas from [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and from ecogovernmentality.

This subfield or application of ecogovernmentality developed first by applying Foucauldean thought to analysis of national and international climate regimes, identifying categories and methodologies that work particularly well for climate change issues. As the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change has evolved, the principles of the theory have also been applied — in appropriately modified ways — to studies of state and local government as well as private and [[nonprofit organizations]].

Ecogovernmentality-grounded theories and methods of analysis have also begun to emerge as tools for examining climate change in fields outside political economy, such as [[communications]] and [[international relations]].

=== Development of ecogovernmentality and climate change studies ===

As researchers began to explore the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change problems and discourses, most studies focused on national and global scales. For example, an early study by Paul Henman applied governmentality to [[Australia]]n national policy and [[climate change modeling]], concluding that modeling was a technology for rendering climate governable though it would limit the capacity of government to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henman|first=Paul|title=Computer Modeling and the Politics of Greenhouse Gas Policy in Australia|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=Summer 2002|volume=20|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/089443930202000206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sverker Jagers and Johannes Stripple’s work published in 2003 identified the importance of [[Non state actors in environmental law|non-nation-state actors (NNSAs)]] in climate change [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] efforts and suggested that “private regimes” like the [[insurance industry]] may be more successful than national and global power structures in addressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=Sverker C.|author2=Johannes Stripple|title=Climate Governance Beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|date=July{{ndash}}September 2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–399|jstor=27800489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies applying governmentality to climate change picked up in frequency in the mid-2000s. Angela Oels’ 2005 paper summarized the initial forays into governmentality-based analyses for climate change discourses and suggested that the functioning governmentality of the issue had shifted since the 1980s, from a [[biopower]]-based discourse to one rooted in advanced liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oels|first=Angela|title=Rendering climate change governable: From biopower to advanced liberal government?|journal=Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning|year=2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15239080500339661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She demonstrated a method of discourse analysis particularly suited for addressing climate change, examining objectives, fields of visibility, technical aspects, forms of knowledge and formation of identities. Oels also provided some categories into which discourses can be sorted. These categories were also used by Karin Bäckstrand and Eva Lövbrand, beginning in 2006 with analysis of tree-planting initiatives stemming from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=Karin|author2=Eva Lövbrand|title=Planting Trees to Mitigate Climate Change: Contested Discourses of Ecological Modernization, Green Governmentality and Civic Environmentalism|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=February 2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=50–75|doi=10.1162/glep.2006.6.1.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their analysis of competing discourses in categories of ecological modernization, green governmentality, and civic environmentalism revealed areas of overlap and potential cooperation.

Also in 2006, Maria Carmen Lemos collaborated with Agrawal on a comprehensive summary of environmental governance studies to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemos|first=Maria Carmen|author2=Arun Agrawal|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~arunagra/papers/publications/2006.%20Maria%20Carmen%20Lemos%20and%20Arun%20Agrawal.%20%20Environmental%20Governance.pdf|title=Environmental Governance|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2006|volume=31|pages=297–325|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.31.042605.135621|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They divided the applications of these studies into two categories: resource management and climate change. Among other useful insights, their work provided a clear schematic for classifying new, hybrid forms of environmental governance and identifying where these forms derive their power — that is, from combinations of the state, the community, and the market.

=== Ecogovernmentality studies beyond global and national regimes ===

More recent studies have applied ecogovernmentality precepts to discourses at state and local levels. Chukwumerije Okereke, Harriet Bulkeley and Heike Schroeder published a study in 2009 that examined possible problems of power, relationships, structures, and agency in [[climate governance]] at scales other than national or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okereke|first=Chukwumerije|author2=Harriet Bulkeley |author3=Heike Schroeder |title=Conceptualizing Climate Governance Beyond the International Regime|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=58–78|doi=10.1162/glep.2009.9.1.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that examining these issues may help to overcome what they identify as an “impasse” in governmentality studies of global environmental problems.

As another example of an ecogovernmentality study of climate change at a non-global, non-national scale, Bulkeley’s 2010 paper examined network governance, vertical and horizontal power structures, political economics, the restructuring of the state, and institutional capacity, all at the urban scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|date=November 2010|volume=35|pages=229–253|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-072809-101747}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bulkeley argued for the importance of nuanced analyses of government at non-national, non-global scales as an important field in climate change governmentality studies.

A survey study from Dallas Elgin, Andrew Pattison and Christopher M. Weible in 2011 examines analytical capacity regarding climate change at the (U.S.) state level, concluding that the [[neoliberal]] government there is not as “hollowed out” as they expected but still lacks needed analytical capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elgin|first=Dallas J.|author2=Andrew Pattison |author3=Christopher M. Weible |title=Policy Analytical Capacity Inside and Outside of Government: A Case Studyof Colorado Climate and Energy Issues|journal=Canadian Political Science Review|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=101–116|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr/article/viewFile/378/374|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging influence in other fields ===

Ecogovernmentality-grounded studies in climate change are also emerging in fields outside political economy. For example, Max Boykoff’s work analyzing [[media coverage of climate change]] in his 2011 book was grounded in discourses analysis along with his perhaps-better-known content analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boykoff|first=Maxwell T.|title=Who Speaks for the Climate? Making Sense of Media Reporting on Climate Change|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-13305-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Weingart, Anita Engels and Petra Pansegrau published a study using a similar combination of methods in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weingart|first=Peter|author2=Anita Engels |author3=Petra Pansegrau |title=Risks of communication: discourses on climate change in science, politics, and the mass media|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=July 2000|volume=9|issue=3|pages=261–283|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/304}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Boykoff’s work was cited in [[An Inconvenient Truth]] and has received far more scholarly and public attention. Other media studies scholars have followed Boykoff’s lead incorporating discourses analysis in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antilla|first=Liisa|citeseerx = 10.1.1.372.2033|title=Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change.|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2005|volume=15|issue=4|pages=338–352|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another communications-related study, David Ockwell, Lorraine Whitmarsh and Saffron O’Neill applied governmentality concepts to a U.K. government [[marketing]] campaign aimed at increasing “green” behaviors in citizens.&lt;ref name="May 7, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ockwell|first=David|author2=Lorraine Whitmarsh |author3=Saffron O'Neill |title=Reorienting Climate Change Communication for Effective Mitigation: Forcing People to be Green or Fostering Grass-Roots Engagement?|journal=Science Communication|date=March 2009|volume=30|issue=3|pages=305–327|doi=10.1177/1075547008328969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of why the campaign was ineffective, they identify regime-based barriers to behavior change, including infrastructure, financial, and structural barriers.

Chris Methmann has published work on global warming as a form of global governmentality in the field of [[international relations]], citing the [[carbon market]] as a means of conducting individual conduct from a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Methmann|first=Chris Paul|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/26/1354066111415300.full.pdf|title=The sky is the Limit: Global Warming as Global Governmentality|journal=European Journal of International Relations|date=October 27, 2011|pages=1–23|doi=10.1177/1354066111415300|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concluded that the Clean Development Mechanism of carbon credit trading has become easily established because it protects “business as usual” – the established order of power.

Robyn Dowling argued for inclusion of ecogovernmentality perspectives regarding identity formation in the field of [[human geography]] in her 2008 paper, which addressed a variety of issues, including climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=Robyn|title=Geographies of identity: climate change, governmentality and activism|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2010|issue=34|pages=488–495|doi=10.1177/0309132509348427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fate '''''is a [[generic role-playing game system]] based on the ''[[Fudge_(role-playing_game_system)|Fudge]]'' gaming system. It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is customizable. It is designed to offer minimal obstruction to role-playing by assuming players want to make fewer dice rolls.

''Fate'' was written by [[Fred Hicks]] and [[Rob Donoghue]]; the 1st edition was published in early 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fate1e.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fate: About Fudge |website=Faterpg.com |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the latest version (4th edition) was published successfully through crowd sourcing [[Kickstarter]] in 2013. ''Fate'' gained adherents both for its high level of support, which is unusual for a free game, and for the numerous innovative gaming mechanics.{{Citation needed|reason=Unsubstantiated claim|date=July 2014}}

==System==
[[Image:FUDGE 4dF probability.svg|thumb|230px|right|Probability of results in the Fate system]]
Fate is derived from the ''[[Fudge_(role-playing_game_system)|Fudge]]'' system, primarily that earlier design's verbal scale and [[Fudge dice]], but most versions of Fate eschew the use of mandatory traits such as Strength and Intelligence. Instead, it uses a long list of skills and assumes that every character is "mediocre" in all skills except those that the character is explicitly defined as being good at. Skills may perform one or more of the four actions: attacking, defending, overcoming obstacles (a catch-all for solving problems) or creating an advantage (see below). Exceptional abilities are defined through the use of ''Stunts'' and ''Aspects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aspect is a [[Freeform role-playing game|free form]] descriptor of something notable about either the character or the scene. A relevant aspect can be invoked to grant a bonus to a die roll (either adding +2, or allowed a re-roll of the dice); this usually costs the player or GM a fate point. Aspects may also be compelled to influence the setting by offering the person with the aspect a fate point (which they can refuse by spending one of their own) to put them at a disadvantage relevant to the aspect. An example given in the rule book refers to the GM invoking a [[player character]]'s ''Rivals in the Collegia Arcana'' aspect to have said rivals attack them in the bath so they don't have access to their equipment. Situational aspects describe the scene, and may be created and used by the GM, or by players using the create advantage action with a relevant skill.

Stunts are exceptional abilities that grant the character a specific mechanical benefit; these may be drawn from a pre-defined list of stunts included in the rules, or created following guidelines provided by the authors.&lt;ref name="SotC_Stunts"&gt;{{cite book | quote=What follows is not a comprehensive list of stunts. GMs (and players under GM supervision) are encouraged to create their own to fit their game. |title=Spirit of the Century |last1=Donoghue |first1=Rob | last2=Hicks | first2=Fred | last3=Balsera | first3=Leonard |year=2006 |publisher=Evil Hat Productions |isbn=978-0-9771534-0-4 |page=115 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects, on the other hand, are always defined by the player. For example, a player may choose to give their character an aspect of "Brawny" (or "Muscle Man" or "Wiry Strength"); during play, the player may invoke those aspects to gain a temporary bonus in a relevant situation. Aspects may also relate to a character's possessions, e.g. the character [[Indiana Jones]] for example, might have the Aspect "Whip and Fedora".

==FATE versus Fate (naming conventions)==
When the system was originally published FATE was considered an acronym for “Fudge Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment” and then “Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment”. Most recently ''FATE'' has been simplified to just be ''Fate'' and is no longer an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faterpg.com/2013/fate-not-fate/ |title=Fate not FATE » Fate |website=Faterpg.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Fate'' OGL resources==
While there has been concern that ''[[Fudge (role-playing game system)|Fudge]]'' would restrict its "open" license and thus force ''Fate'' to change to a different underlying mechanic, such fears have subsided once ''Fudge'' itself was released under the [[Open Gaming License]]. ''Fate'' has an associated [[Yahoo!]] Group to discuss the gaming system and share settings and conversions of other [[role-playing game]]s.

==''Fate'' 3rd Edition ==
The 3rd edition of ''Fate'' was no longer a generic RPG like the first two versions, but set in the [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] genre. It is called [[Spirit of the Century]] and was nominated in 2007 for an [[ENnie]] award for ''Best Rules''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Several other role-playing games are built on the game mechanics of ''Fate 3.0''.

==Fate Core (4th edition) and Fate Accelerated Edition (FAE)==
A new (4th) edition called ''Fate Core'' (again a generic version) was published in 2013, funded by a successful crowdfunding campaign, and released under two [[free content]] licenses: [[CC BY|CC BY 3.0]] and the [[Open gaming license]].

As a result of the crowd funding effort, Evil Hat Productions released ''Fate Accelerated'', a streamlined version of the rules based on the same core mechanic intended to get players into the game faster. One notable difference is that skills are replaced with six "approaches" to solving problems - Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky. The approaches can each use all four skill actions.

== Kickstarter ==
To release the new version of Fate, Evil Hat Productions ran a Kickstarter campaign that initially asked for $3,000. At the end of the campaign they raised $433,365 and expanded the product line significantly, adding two world books and a system toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core |title=Fate Core by Fred Hicks / Evil Hat Productions — Kickstarter |website=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable RPGs based on ''Fate'' ==

The '''Financial Crimes Enforcement Network''' ('''FinCEN''') is a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions in order to combat domestic and international [[money laundering]], [[terrorist financing]], and other [[financial crimes]].

==Mission==
FinCEN's director expressed its mission in November 2013 as "to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and promote national security."&lt;ref name=FinCENDir&gt;{{cite web|last=Shasky Calvery|first=Jennifer|title=Statement of Jennifer Shasky Calvery, Director Financial Crimes Enforcement Network US Department of the Treasury Before the US Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs|url=http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/beyond-silk-road-potential-risks-threats-and-promises-of-virtual-currencies|publisher=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FinCEN serves as the U.S. [[Financial Intelligence Unit]] (FIU) and is one of 147 FIUs making up the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]]. FinCEN's self-described motto is "[[follow the money]]." The website states: "The primary motive of criminals is financial gain, and they leave financial trails as they try to launder the proceeds of crimes or attempt to spend their ill-gotten profits."&lt;ref name=what&gt;{{cite web|title=FinCEN - What we do|url=https://www.fincen.gov/what-we-do/|work=FinCEN website|publisher=FinCEN|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a network bringing people and information together, by  coordinating [[information sharing]] with law enforcement agencies, regulators and other partners in the [[financial services|financial industry]].&lt;ref name=what/&gt;

==History==
FinCEN was established by order of the [[Secretary of the Treasury]] (Treasury Order Numbered 105-08) on April 25, 1990. In May 1994, its mission was broadened to include regulatory responsibilities, and in October 1994 the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s precursor of FinCEN, the Office of Financial Enforcement was merged with FinCEN. On September 26, 2002, after [[Patriot Act, Title III|Title III of the PATRIOT Act]] was passed, Treasury Order 180-01&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TREASURY ORDER 180-01|url=http://www.treasury.gov/about/role-of-treasury/orders-directives/Pages/to180-01.aspx|publisher=U.S. Dept Treasury|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=March 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it an official bureau in the Department of the Treasury. In September 2012, FinCEN's information technology called FinCEN Portal and Query System migrated with 11 years of data into FinCEN Query, a search engine similar to Google. It is a "one stop shop" {{sic}} accessible via the FinCEN Portal allowing broad searches across more fields than before and returning more results. Since September 2012 FinCEN generates 4 new reports: Suspicious Activity Report (FinCEN SAR), Currency Transaction Report (FinCEN CTR), the Designation of Exempt Person (DOEP) and Registered Money Service Business (RMSB).&lt;ref name=FinCEN&gt;{{cite web|title=FinCEN - FinCEN's IT Modernization Efforts FAQs|url=http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/ITModernizationEffortsFAQ.html|work=FinCEN website|publisher=FinCEN|accessdate=6 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217205349/http://www.fincen.gov/about_fincen/wwd/ITModernizationEffortsFAQ.html|archivedate=17 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
[[Image:FinCEN organization.jpg|350px|right|thumb|FinCEN organization chart]]
As of November 2013, FinCEN employed approximately 340 people mostly intelligence professionals with expertise in the [[financial industry]], illicit finance, [[financial intelligence]], the AML/CFT (money laundering/terrorist financing) regulatory regime, computer technology, and enforcement".&lt;ref name=FinCENDir/&gt; The majority of the staff are permanent FinCEN personnel, with about 20 long-term detailees assigned from 13 different regulatory and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name=FinCEN /&gt; FinCEN shares information with dozens of intelligence agencies, including the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]]; the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]; the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]; the [[U.S. Secret Service]]; the [[Internal Revenue Service]]; the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]]; and the [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]].

==314 program==
The 2001 [[USA PATRIOT Act]] required the Secretary of the Treasury to create a secure network for the transmission of information to enforce the relevant regulations. FinCEN's regulations under Section 314(a) enable federal law enforcement agencies, through FinCEN, to reach out to more than 45,000 points of contact at more than 27,000 financial institutions to locate accounts and transactions of persons that may be involved in terrorist financing and/or money laundering. A web interface allows the person(s) designated in §314(a)(3)(A) to register and transmit information to FinCEN. The partnership between the financial community and law enforcement allows disparate bits of information to be identified, centralized, and rapidly evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appendix A – Financial Crimes enforcement network programs|url=https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/files/Appendix_A.pdf|publisher=FinCEN|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawala==
As early as 2003 FinCEN disseminated information on "[[informal value transfer system]]s" (IVTS), including [[hawala]], a network of people receiving money for the purpose of making the funds payable to a third party in another geographic location,... generally tak[ing] place outside of the conventional banking system through non-bank financial institutions or other business entities whose primary business activity may not be the transmission of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Informal Value Transfer Systems|url=http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/advisory/pdf/advis33.pdf|work=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN Advisory|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|accessdate=6 March 2014|format=PDF|date=March 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205556/http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/advisory/pdf/advis33.pdf|archivedate=30 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 1, 2010, FinCEN issued a guidance on IVTS referencing ''[[United States v. Banki]]'' and hawala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html|title=Informal Value Transfer Systems|publisher=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|date=September 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905002704/http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2010-A011.html|archivedate=September 5, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual currencies==
In July 2011, FinCEN added "other value that substitutes for currency" to its definition of [[money services business]]es in preparation to adapt the respective rule to virtual currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|url=https://federalregister.gov/a/2011-18309|work=Bank Secrecy Act Regulations; Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Money Services Businesses|publisher=Federal Register|accessdate=6 March 2014|author=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|page=76 FR 43585|date=2011-07-21|quote=31 C.F.R. § 1010.100(ff)(5)(i)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 18, 2013 FinCEN issued a guidance regarding [[virtual currency|virtual currencies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html|title=FIN-2013-G001: Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies|date=18 March 2013|publisher=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|page=6|accessdate=4 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319213642/http://fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html|archivedate=19 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to which, exchangers and administrators, but not users of convertible virtual currency are considered money transmitters, and must comply with rules to prevent money laundering/terrorist financing ("AML/CFT") and other forms of financial crime, by record-keeping, reporting and registering with FinCEN. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, director of FinCEN said, "Virtual currencies are subject to the same rules as other currencies. … Basic money services business rules apply here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/some_basic_rules_for_using_bitcoin_as_virtual_money/ |title=Some basic rules for using 'bitcoin' as virtual money |publisher=American Bar Association |year=2013 |author=Berson, Susan A.|accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a November 2013 [[United States Senate|Senate]] hearing, Calvery stated, "It is in the best interest of virtual currency providers to comply with these regulations for a number of reasons. First is the idea of corporate responsibility," contrasting [[Bitcoin]]'s understanding of a peer to peer system bypassing corporate financial institutions. She stated that FinCEN collaborates with the [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]], a congressionally-chartered forum called the "Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) Advisory Group" and BSA Working Group to review and discuss new regulations and guidance, with the FBI-led "Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group" (VCET) formed in early 2012, the FDIC-led "Cyber Fraud Working Group", the Terrorist Financing &amp; Financial Crimes-led "Treasury Cyber Working Group", and with a community of other financial intelligence units.&lt;ref name="FinCENDir" /&gt; According to the Department of Justice, VCET members represent the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, multiple U.S. Attorney's Offices, and the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division's]] Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section and Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman Testifies|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pr/speeches/2013/crm-speech-131118.html|work=Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|publisher=justice.gov|accessdate=6 March 2014|location=Washington, D.C|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[GAO]] found "opportunities" to improve "interagency and state examination coordination", noting that the federal banking regulators issued an interagency examination manual, that [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission|CFTC]], and their respective self-regulatory organizations developed [[Bank Secrecy Act]] (BSA) examination modules, and that FinCEN and [[IRS]] examining nonbank financial institutions issued an examination manual for money services businesses. Therefore multiple regulators examine compliance of the BSA across industries and for some larger holding companies even within the same institution. Regulators need to promote greater consistency, coordination and information-sharing, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, and find concerns across industries.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web|title=Bank Secrecy Act: Federal Agencies Should Take Action to Further Improve Coordination and Information-Sharing Efforts|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-227|work=GAO-09-227|publisher=GAO.gov|accessdate=6 March 2014|date=Feb 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; FinCEN estimated that it would have data access agreements with 80 percent of state agencies that conduct BSA examinations after 2012.&lt;ref name=GAO /&gt;

Since FinCEN's inception in 1990 the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] in San Francisco has debated its benefits compared to its threat to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bercu |first=Stephen |title=FinCEN: Big Brother After All?|url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/?f=cpsr_fincen.paper.txt |publisher=EEF.org |date=December 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; FinCEN´s value is hard to gauge without publication of evidence. It does not disclose how many 'Suspicious Activity Reports' result in investigations, indictments or convictions, and no studies exist to tally how many reports are filed on innocent people. FinCEN and money laundering laws have been criticized for being expensive and relatively ineffective, while violating [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights as an investigator may use FinCEN's government database system to investigate people instead of crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|title=Following the Money|url=http://www.govexec.com/magazine/2000/10/following-the-money/7309/ |accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=[[Government Executive]] |date=October 1, 2000|author=Julie Wakefield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been alleged, that FinCEN's regulations against [[structuring]] are enforced unfairly and arbitrarily; for example, it was reported in 2012 that small businesses selling at farmers' markets have been targeted, while politically connected people like [[Eliot Spitzer]] were not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walter Olson |url=http://overlawyered.com/2012/04/structuring-who-can-get-away-with-it-and-who-cant/ |title="Structuring": who can get away with it, and who can't |publisher=Overlawyered |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzers reasons for structuring were described as "innocent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/nyregion/12legal.html |title=The Reports That Drew Federal Eyes to Spitzer |author=David Johnston |author2=Stephen Labaton |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Finitism''' is a [[philosophy of mathematics]] that accepts the existence only of [[finite set|finite]] [[mathematical object]]s. It is best understood in comparison to the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical objects (e.g., [[infinite set]]s) are accepted as legitimate.

== Main idea ==
The main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are accepted as existing, the set of all natural numbers is not considered to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]] over infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory often associated with finitism is [[Thoralf Skolem]]'s [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

== History ==
The introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase when [[Georg Cantor]] in 1874 introduced what is now called [[naive set theory]] and used it as a base for his work on [[transfinite numbers]]. When paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]], [[Berry's paradox]] and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] were discovered in Cantor's naive set theory, the issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.

There were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. 
One position was the [[intuitionistic mathematics]] that was advocated by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are constructed.

Another position was endorsed by [[David Hilbert]]: finite mathematical objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects. This led to [[Hilbert's program]] of proving consistency of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the finitistic part. Hilbert's views are also associated with [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist philosophy of mathematics]]. Hilbert's goal of proving the consistency of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means turned out to be an impossible task due to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorems]]. However, by [[Harvey Friedman]]'s [[Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman.27s grand conjecture|grand conjecture]] most mathematical results should be provable using finitistic means.

Hilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered finitistic and refer to as elementary. However, based on his work with [[Paul Bernays]] some experts such as [[William W. Tait|William Tait]] have argued that the [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] can be considered an upper bound on what Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.

In the years following Gödel's theorems, as it became clear that there is no hope of proving consistency of mathematics, and with development of [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and the lack of any evidence against its consistency, most mathematicians lost interest in the topic. Today most classical mathematicians are considered [[Platonist]] and readily use infinite mathematical objects and a set-theoretical universe.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

== Classical finitism vs. strict finitism ==
In her book ''Philosophy of Set Theory'', [[Mary Tiles]] characterized those who allow ''potentially infinite'' objects as '''classical finitists''', and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as '''strict finitists''': for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as "every natural number has a [[successor function|successor]]" and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite [[series (mathematics)|series]] in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the [[recorded history|written history]] of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor discovered the hierarchy of [[transfinite number|transfinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinals]] at the end of the 19th century.

== Views regarding infinite mathematical objects ==
[[Leopold Kronecker]] remained a strident opponent to Cantor's set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, K., Estep D., and Johnson C. ''Applied Mathematics: Body and Soul''. Volume 1. Springer, 2004, p. 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
|God created the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.&lt;ref&gt;
From an 1886 lecture at the  'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to [[H. M. Weber]]'s memorial article, [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0002&amp;DMDID=dmdlog6 ''Leopold Kronecker'', in Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung, Vol. 2 1891-92]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reuben Goodstein]] is another proponent of finitism.  Some of his work involved building up to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] from finitist foundations.

Although he denied it, much of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writing on mathematics has a strong affinity with finitism.

If finitists are contrasted with [[Transfinite number|transfinitists]] (proponents of e.g. [[Georg Cantor]]'s hierarchy of infinities), then also [[Aristotle]] may be characterized as a strict finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the [[potential infinity]] as a middle option between strict finitism and [[actual infinity]] (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, in contrast with the Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers, which have nothing to do with the things in nature):

{{quote
|But on the other hand to suppose that the infinite does not exist in any way leads obviously to many impossible consequences: there will be a beginning and end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite. If, then, in view of the above considerations, neither alternative seems possible, an arbiter must be called in.
|Aristotle, Physics, Book 3, Chapter 6}}

== Other related philosophies of mathematics ==
'''[[Ultrafinitism]]''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''') has an even more conservative attitude towards mathematical objects than finitism, and has objections to the existence of finite mathematical objects when they are too large.

Towards the end of the 20th century [[John Penn Mayberry]] developed a system of finitary mathematics which he called "Euclidean Arithmetic". The most striking tenet of his system is a complete and rigorous rejection of the special foundational status normally accorded to iterative processes, including in particular the construction of the natural numbers by the iteration "+1". Consequently Mayberry is in sharp dissent from those who would seek to equate finitary mathematics with Peano Arithmetic or any of its fragments such as [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2716">In [[mathematical logic]], '''formation rules''' are rules for describing which [[String (computer science)|strings]] of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] formed from the [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of a [[formal language]] are [[syntax (logic)|syntactically]] [[Validity (logic)|valid]] within the language. These rules only address the location and manipulation of the strings of the language. It does not describe anything else about a language, such as its [[semantics]] (i.e. what the strings mean). (See also [[formal grammar]]).

==Formal language==
{{Main|Formal language}}
A ''formal language'' is an organized [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[symbol]]s the essential feature being that it can be precisely defined in terms of just the shapes and locations of those symbols. Such a language can be defined, then, without any [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. A [[formal grammar]] determines which symbols and sets of symbols are [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]s in a formal language.

== Formal systems ==
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Propositional and predicate calculi are examples of formal systems.

== Propositional and predicate logic ==
The formation rules of a [[propositional calculus]] may, for instance, take a form such that;

* if we take Φ to be a propositional formula we can also take {{not}}Φ to be a formula;
* if we take Φ and Ψ to be a propositional formulas we can also take (Φ {{and}}  Ψ), (Φ {{imp}}  Ψ), (Φ {{or-}}  Ψ) and (Φ {{eqv}}  Ψ) to also be formulas.

A [[predicate calculus]] will usually include all the same rules as a propositional calculus, with the addition of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] such that if we take Φ to be a formula of propositional logic and α as a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] then we can take ({{all}}α)Φ and ({{exist}}α)Φ each to be formulas of our predicate calculus.

The '''galaxy color–magnitude diagram''' shows the relationship between [[absolute magnitude]] (a measure of [[luminosity]]) and [[mass]] of [[galaxies]]. A preliminary description of the three areas of this diagram was made in 2003 by [[Eric F. Bell]] et al. from the [[COMBO-17]] survey&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eric F. et al. ''Nearly 5000 Distant Early‐Type Galaxies in COMBO‐17: A Red Sequence and Its Evolution since z=1'', [[The Astrophysical Journal]], 608:752–767, 2004 June 20. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...608..752B]&lt;/ref&gt; that clarified the [[bimodal]] distribution of red and blue galaxies as seen in analysis of [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] data&lt;ref&gt;Strateva, I., et al. ''Color Separation of Galaxy Types in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Imaging Data'', 2001, The [[Astronomical Journal]], 122, 1861 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AJ....122.1861S]&lt;/ref&gt; and even in [[de Vaucouleurs]]' 1961 [[de Vaucouleurs modified Hubble sequence|analyses]] of [[Galaxy morphological classification|galaxy morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;de Vaucouleurs, G. ''Integrated Colors of Bright Galaxies in the u, b, V System.'' 1961, [[The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]], 5, 233. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961ApJS....5..233D]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Noticed in this diagram are three main features: the [[red sequence]], the [[green valley (astronomy)|green valley]], and the [[blue cloud]]. The red sequence includes most red galaxies which are generally [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. The blue cloud includes most blue galaxies which are generally [[spiral galaxy|spirals]]. In between the two distributions is an underpopulated space known as the green valley which includes a number of red spirals. 

Unlike the comparable [[Hertzsprung&amp;ndash;Russell diagram]] for [[star]]s, galaxy properties are not necessarily completely determined by their location on the color–magnitude diagram. The diagram also shows considerable evolution through time. The red sequence earlier in [[Big Bang|evolution]] of the [[universe]] was more constant in color across magnitudes and the blue cloud was not as uniformly distributed but showed sequence progression.

[[File:A Deep Look into a Dark Sky.jpg|thumb|One of five patches of sky covered by the COMBO-17 survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Deep Look into a Dark Sky|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1428a/|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

New research suggests the green valley is actually composed of two different populations of galaxies: one of late-type galaxies, where star formation has been quenched due to their gas supplies being shut off followed by exhaustion of their gas reservoirs for several billion years, and another of early-type galaxies where both the gas supplies and gas reservoirs have been destroyed very quickly, likely because of [[galaxy merger|mergers with other galaxies]] and/or the presence of an [[active galactic nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Green Valley is a Red Herring: Galaxy Zoo reveals two evolutionary pathways towards quenching of star formation in early- and late-type galaxies | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=440 | issue=1 | pages=889 | date=2014 |author1=Schawinski, Kevin |author2=Urry, C.

The '''Gordian Knot''' is a [[legend]] of [[Phrygia]]n [[Gordium]] associated with [[Alexander the Great]]. It is often used as a [[metaphor]] for an intractable problem (disentangling an "impossible" knot) solved easily by finding a loophole or thinking creatively ("cutting the Gordian knot"):

== Legend ==
The [[Phrygians]] were without a king, but an [[oracle]] at [[Telmissus]] (the ancient capital of [[Lycia]]) decreed that the next man to enter the city driving an ox-cart should become their king. A peasant farmer named [[Gordias]] drove into town on an ox-cart and was immediately declared king.&lt;ref&gt;The ox-cart is often depicted in works of art as a [[chariot]], which made it a more readily legible emblem of power and military readiness. His position had also been predicted earlier by an eagle landing on his cart, a sign to him from the gods.&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of gratitude, his son [[Midas]] dedicated the ox-cart&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' (Αλεξάνδρου Ανάβασις), Book ii.3): "{{lang|grc|καὶ τὴν ἅμαξαν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐν τῇ ἄκρᾳ ἀναθεῖναι χαριστήρια τῷ Διὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀετοῦ τῇ πομπῇ.}}" which means "and he offered his father's cart as a gift to king Zeus as gratitude for sending the eagle".&lt;/ref&gt;  to the Phrygian god [[Sabazios]] (whom the [[Greeks]] identified with [[Zeus]]) and tied it to a post with an intricate knot of [[European Cornel|cornel]] bark (''Cornus mas''). The knot was later described by Roman historian [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] as comprising “several knots all so tightly entangled that it was impossible to see how they were fastened.”&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Evan|title=What was the Gordian Knot?|url=http://www.history.com/news/ask-history/what-was-the-gordian-knot|website=Ask History|accessdate=30 May 2017|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ox-cart still stood in the palace of the former kings of Phrygia at [[Gordium]] in the fourth century BC when Alexander arrived, at which point Phrygia had been reduced to a [[satrap|satrapy]] or province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. An oracle had declared that any man who could unravel its elaborate knots was destined to become ruler of all of Asia.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; Alexander wanted to untie the knot but struggled to do so without success. He then reasoned that it would make no difference ''how'' the knot was loosed, so he drew his sword and sliced it in half with a single stroke.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt; In an alternative version of the story, Alexander loosed the knot by pulling the [[linchpin]] from the yoke.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

Sources from antiquity agree that Alexander was confronted with the challenge of the knot, but his solution is disputed. Both [[Plutarch]] and [[Arrian]] relate that, according to [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]],&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, "The Campaigns of Alexander", p. 105, [[Penguin Group]] 1971, and Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'', p. 19, The Modern Library 2004 are secondary sources; Aristobolus' text is lost.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander pulled the knot out of its pole pin, exposing the two ends of the cord and allowing him to untie the knot without having to cut through it. Some classical scholars regard this as more plausible than the popular account.&lt;ref&gt;Fredricksmeyer, E. A. "Alexander, Midas, and the Oracle at Gordium" ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 56, No. 3 (July, 1961), pp. 160–168 citing Tarn, W.W. 1948, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/265752?seq=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Literary sources of the story include Alexander's propagandist [[Arrian]] (''[[Anabasis Alexandri]] ''2.3), [[Quintus Curtius]] (3.1.14), [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome of [[Pompeius Trogus]] (11.7.3), and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'s ''De Natura Animalium'' 13.1.&lt;ref&gt;The four sources are given in Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973) 1986: Notes to Chapter 10, p. 518; Fox recounts the anecdote, pp 149–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander later went on to conquer Asia as far as the [[Indus River|Indus]] and the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]], thus fulfilling  the prophecy.

== Interpretations ==
The knot may have been a religious knot-cipher guarded by Gordian/Midas's priests and priestesses. [[Robert Graves]] suggested that it may have symbolised the ineffable name of [[Dionysus]] that, knotted like a cipher, would have been passed on through generations of priests and revealed only to the kings of Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, ''The Greek Myths'' (1960) §83.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[fable]], true [[mythology|myth]] has few completely arbitrary elements. This myth taken as a whole seems designed to confer legitimacy to [[dynastic]] change in this central [[Anatolia]]n kingdom: thus Alexander's "brutal cutting of the knot... ended an ancient dispensation."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1960, §83.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The ox-cart suggests a longer voyage, rather than a local journey, perhaps linking Gordias/Midas with an attested origin-myth in Macedon, of which Alexander is most likely to have been aware.&lt;ref&gt;"Surely Alexander believed that this god, who established for Midas the rule over Phrygia, now guaranteed to him the fulfillment of the promise of rule over Asia," (Fredricksmeyer 1961:165).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the myth, the new dynasty was not immemorially ancient, but had widely remembered origins in a local, but non-priestly "outsider" class, represented by Greek reports equally as an [[eponym]]ous peasant "Gordias"&lt;ref&gt;Trogus ''apud'' Justin, Plutarch, ''Alexander'' 18.1; Curtius 3.1.11 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; or the locally attested, authentically Phrygian "Midas"&lt;ref&gt;Arrian&lt;/ref&gt; in his ox-cart.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn E. Roller, "Midas and the Gordian Knot", ''Classical Antiquity'' '''3'''.2 (October 1984:256–271) separates out authentic Phrygian elements in the Greek reports and finds a folk-tale element and a religious one, linking the dynastic founder (whether eponymous "Gordias" to Greeks, or Anatolian "Midas") with the cults of "Zeus" and [[Cybele]]. Both Roller and Fredricksmeyer (1961) offer persuasive arguments that the original name associated with the wagon is "Midas", "Gordias" being according to Roller a Greek back-formation from the site, ''Gordion''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] legitimize dynasties by right of conquest (compare [[Cadmus]]), but the legitimising [[oracle]] stressed in this myth suggests that the previous dynasty was a race of priest-kings allied to the unidentified oracle deity.

K. Ogden and his contemporaries, Thesis of James McElvenny, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophy]] developed by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. Based largely on the teachings of [[Hillel the Elder]], Zamenhof originally called it '''Hillelism'''. He sought to reform [[Judaism]] because he hoped that without the strange dress code and purity requirements, it would no longer be the victim of antisemitic propaganda.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The basis of Homaranismo is the sentence known as the [[Golden Rule]]: ''One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself''.

Zamenhof said about Homaranismo:{{Cite quote|date=June 2012}} &lt;blockquote&gt;With Hillelism we don't mean a new denomination; we mean a new corporate-religious order inside the old Jewish religion, which has existed for a long time. Everybody who lives ethically could take part in this religion with a clear conscience, no matter what the religious views he had before looked like.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on this idea, he came to the conclusion that this philosophy could be a bridge between religions, not just a subset of Judaism. Zamenhof subsequently renamed his philosophy Homaranismo.

While many different motivations drew early Esperantists to that movement, for Zamenhof Esperanto was always a means by which to facilitate improved human relations, especially beyond boundaries of race, language and culture. Zamenhof's daughter [[Lidia Zamenhof|Lidia]] embraced this philosophy and taught it alongside Esperanto and her adopted religion, the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Despite his entire [[Esperanto]] language project, Zamenhof astonishingly said of Homaranismo, "It is indeed the object of my whole life.  I would give up everything for it."&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Privat, "The Life of Zamenhof", p 117.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zamenhof developed his ideas on Homaranismo in two works: ''Hilelismo'' (1901) and ''Homaranismo'' (1913).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Ionic conduction''' (denoted by {{math|''&amp;lambda;''}}-lambda) is the movement of an [[ion]] from one site to another through [[Crystallographic defect|defect]]s in the [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] of a solid or aqueous solution.

Ionic conduction is one mechanism of [[current (electricity)|current]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Turton. (2000).The Physics of Solids. New York:: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-850352-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In solids, ions typically occupy fixed positions in the crystal lattice and do not move. However, ionic conduction can occur, especially as the temperature increases &lt;ref&gt;http://www.teknik.uu.se/ftf/education/Disordered_materials/Ion_conduction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionic conduction in solids has been a subject of interest since the beginning of the 19th century. [[Michael Faraday]] established in 1839 that the laws of [[electrolysis]] are also obeyed in ionic solids like [[lead(II) fluoride]] ({{chemical formula|Pb||F|2}}) and [[silver sulfide]] ({{chemical formula|Ag|2|S}}).

==Silver iodide==
{{confusing|section|date=October 2007|reason=Some of the text makes no sense (e.g. "nothing less than the melting") and lacks sufficient explanation}}
{{technical|section|date=October 2010}}
In 1921, Tubandt et al. found that solid [[silver iodide]] ({{chemical formula|Ag||I}}) had extraordinary high ionic conductivity. At temperatures above 147&amp;nbsp;°C, AgI changes into a phase that has an ionic conductivity of &lt;!--number and units needs fixing--&gt;~ 1 –1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, similar to that of its [[liquid phase]]. This high temperature phase of AgI was the first [[superionic conductor]] ever discovered. The highly conductive phase of AgI is now known as alpha-AgI. It was shown that a sub[[crystal structure|lattice]] [[cations|cationic]] disorder takes place in alpha-AgI. The liquid-like state of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, as proposed by Strock (1934, 1936) and later reinforced by others (Geller, 1977; Funke, 1976), consists of a cubic [[crystal structure#Unit cell|unit cell]] of iodide ions (I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), in which a total of 42 sites (6 [[octahedral]], 12 [[tetragonal]] and 24 [[trigonal bipyramid]]al) are available for 2 Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, as shown in the Figure 1. O' Keeffe and Hyde (1976) have argued that this [[phase transition]] in AgI is dramatic and powerful, nothing less than the melting and have also shown that the [[entropy]] change at the super-ionic transition is comparable to its value at the melting. Thus, in the -phase, I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions form a [[cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] lattice and the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are distributed in such a way that 42 [[crystallography|crystallographic]] equivalent [[:wikt:interstice|interstice]]s are available for the two Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.

[[Alpha phase]] crystals of various materials like {{chemical formula|Ag|2|s}}, {{chemical formula|Ag|2|se}}, {{chemical formula|Ag|2|Te}}, etc. were soon discovered (Tubandt, 1932). By the early 1930s, it was demonstrated that these [[fast ion conductor|fast ionically conducting]] solids could be treated entirely the same as [[aqueous]] [[electrolyte]]s from the viewpoint of [[chemical reaction]]s and [[thermodynamics]], hence these materials were labeled ''solid electrolytes''.

About six months after the [[invasion of Iraq]] rumors of '''Iraq prison abuse scandals''' started to emerge.

The best known abuse incidents occurred at the large [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. Graphic pictures of some of those abuse incidents were made public. Less well-known abuse incidents have been documented at American prisons throughout [[Iraq]].

==Timeline of events==
According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the coalition forces regularly use "[[torture]]-like" methods during the interrogation of suspects. Such methods were reportedly applied to people to find the hiding place of [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]]. [[British troops]] have also on occasion been accused of abusing Iraqi detainees. Such treatment violates article 17 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] and the [[United States|USA]] and [[UK|Britain]]'s official policies on [[combat]] and [[Military occupation|occupation]]. Despite numerous complaints by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], it took a year before the first US soldier was [[court-martial]]ed for their actions concerning abuse of Iraqis.

===Unknown date===
Eight [[United States Marine Corps|marine]] reservists were investigated for abuse and the death of a prisoner, outside [[Nasiriyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |date=May 7, 2004 |title=Details emerge of past cases |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913182100/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/world/2555551 |archivedate=September 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph leaked after the initial set shows Spc. [[Sabrina Harman]] smiling and giving a [[thumbs signal|thumbs up]] next to the body of [[Manadel al-Jamadi]]. Jamadi was reportedly beaten to death during interrogations in the prison's showers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6988054/| title=Reports detail Abu Ghraib prison death; was it torture?| first=Seth| last=Hettena| date=February 17, 2005| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Death certificates repeatedly stated that prisoners had died "while sleeping", and of "natural reasons". Iraqi doctors are not allowed to investigate the deaths of prisoners, even if death certificates are allegedly forged. No investigations against US military doctors who are alleged to have forged death certificates have been reported.

===Spring 2003===
A US veteran sergeant reports witnessing torture of journalists and writers all over Iraq. Kurdistan region was not an exception. Writers without Borders embarrassed the Iraqi government quite frequently in reports covering minority, women and marginalised Iraqis from all over the country but with much focus on Baghdad, Karkuk, Salahedin and Mosul.

Honorably discharged US veteran, Sergeant Frank "Greg" Ford reports that he witnessed war crimes in Samarra, Iraq. According to Ford, several members of his own unit, the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade participated in the torture of Iraqi detainees as young as 14.&lt;ref name="Whitewashing Torture"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |title=Democracy Now! |publisher=Pacifica.org |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205174712/http://www.pacifica.org/programs/dn/041209.html |archivedate=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:n:Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup|Veteran sergeant accounts US torture coverup]] (Wikinews)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ather Karen al-Mowafakia died in [[Basra]], while in British custody. Details about the investigation are not known.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14210212&amp;method=full |title=18 Cases That Need Answers |publisher=Mirror |date=5 May 2004 |first=Tom Newton |last=Dunn |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050509234030/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14210212&amp;method=full |archivedate=May 9, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Bartlam, a British soldier of the [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]], was arrested after submitting film to a photo developers shop in [[Tamworth, England]] while on leave. The photographs depict a gagged Iraqi POW suspended hanging by rope from a fork lift, and other pictures seem to show prisoners being forced to perform sexual acts. Bartlam and two other soldiers were convicted at court martial of abuse - a fourth soldier was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710195815/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/4283255.stm| archive-date=10 July 2012| date=23 February 2005| title=Photos led to abuse convictions| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

British Lieutenant Colonel [[Tim Collins (soldier)|Tim Collins]] was alleged by US Army Major [[Re Biastre]] to have been responsible for mistreatment of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. Lieutenant Colonel Collins was later cleared of any wrongdoing by an MOD investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720013037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_news/3198047.stm| archive-date=20 July 2012| date=1 September 2003| title=Officer cleared of Iraqi war crimes| publisher=BBC News| accessdate=2007-01-11 | location=London| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2003===
In separate incidents, the Royal Military Police declared that Radhi Natna died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while in British custody, yet his family reports that he had no heart trouble; and the [[Royal Highland Regiment|Black Watch regiment]] arrested the 17-year-old Ahmad Jabber Kareem Ali in Basra, who then drowned after being ordered to swim across a river despite not being able to swim, according to his friend Ayad Salim Hanoon.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"/&gt;

[[United States Army Reserve|Army Reservists]] abused Prisoners at [[Camp Bucca]], and were later [[court-martial]]ed.

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ennis Whitehead III]] reported that [[Master Sergeant]] [[Lisa Marie Girman]], a state trooper, "repeatedly kick[ed a prisoner] in the [[groin]], [[abdomen]] and head, and encouraging her subordinate [[soldier]]s to do the same,"

[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Vic Harris reported that [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Scott A. McKenzie]] who worked at a [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]] [[Basic Combat Training|boot-camp]]-style [[prison]], and  [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] [[Timothy F. Canjar]]: held prisoners' legs, encouraged others to then kick them in the groin, stepped on their previously injured arms, and made false sworn statements to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army Criminal Investigation Division]].

They received [[Military discharge|"general under honorable conditions" discharges]], were ordered to forfeit two months' salary, and returned to the United States.

[[Sergeant]] [[Shawna Edmondson]], also involved in the case, received an "other-than-honorable" discharge, after she requested it instead of being court-martialed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=January 6, 2004 |title=3 reservists discharged from Army after abuse |first=Diana |last=Elias |accessdate=2006-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010024050/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001830549_discharge06.html |archivedate=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hossam Shaltout]] said the abuse at Camp Bucca was similar to that at [[Abu Ghraib (prison)|Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], and that his torture included [[scorpion]]s placed on his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/08/1083911446364.html| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| title=Ex-prisoners tells of more abuses| date=May 10, 2004| accessdate=2006-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Said Shabram died in custody, but no information of the investigation were made public.&lt;ref name="mirror 14210212"/&gt;

The [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse|abuses at Abu Ghraib prison]] were reportedly committed by MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2004/05/06/AR2005040206744.html| title=New Prison Images Emerge| first= Christian| last=Davenport| date=May 6, 2004| publisher=The Washington Post| accessdate=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are allegations that private contractors contributed to them as well and that intelligence agencies such as the [[CIA]] ordered them to do so in order to break prisoners for interrogations. It is said to be a usual practice in other US prisons as well, such as in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Camp X-Ray|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022030050/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11017-2004May8.html| archive-date=2012-10-22| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-27 | work=The Washington Post| deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] submitted a detailed report to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in October 2003 about abuses in prisons, and the president of the Red Cross stated he had informed high-ranking members of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration about the abuses during a meeting in the [[White House]] in January 2004. A soldier came forward that month with photos of abuse that he found disturbing, some showed the stacking of prisoners into a human pyramid, with one prisoner's skin visibly bearing a slur written in English. Another showed a prisoner being forced to stand on a box with wires attached to his head and hands, who had reportedly been told that if he fell off the box, he would be electrocuted. Photos released to the public later included a person being attacked by a guard dog, which the soldier involved described as being useful for intimidation of prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorker.com/printable/?fact/040517fa_fact2 |title=404 error |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205005825/http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?fact%2F040517fa_fact2 |archivedate=February  5, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that an Iraqi hired as a translator raped a juvenile male prisoner while a female soldier took pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html| title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge| author=Scott Higham and Joe Stephens| publisher=Washington Post| date=May 21, 2004| page=A01| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| title=US general linked to Abu Ghraib abuse| date=22 May 2004| publisher=Mail&amp;Guardian Online| accessdate=2006-05-28| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603013743/http://www.mg.co.za/Content/l3.asp?ao=66729| archivedate=3 June 2004| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges have been brought against the contractor because he does not fall under military jurisdiction; it is questionable whether any charges will or even can be brought against him.

In March 2004, 6 soldiers in Abu Ghraib were charged with dereliction of duty, cruelty and maltreatment, and sexual abuse. 17 others were suspended from duty, including the seven U.S. officers who ran the prison. Also recommended for discipline was [[Brigadier general|Brig. Gen]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commander of the 800th brigade. The [[International Red Cross|Red Cross]], which had access to these prisons, has stated that the instances of torture were not aberrations but were systemic. Some officers have attempted to defend themselves by saying that they were only doing their duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4907419/ns/msnbc-about_msnbc_tv/t/deborah-norville-tonight-may/#.Uzh6cPldWSp | title=Deborah Norville MSNBC | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to ongoing complaints, the US military initiated a program to reform the internment and treatment systems. The reforms are expected to increase safeguards for prisoners' rights, to ensure each prisoner receives a copy of their internment order, and has their charges explained to them within 72 hours. They additionally plan to publicly post information about detainees so that family members can know what happened to their loved ones. Reforms were made in March 2004.

Theft of prisoner's possessions by soldiers, dirty, cramped quarters and bad food, prisoners forced into uncomfortable positions for prolonged periods of time, extreme exposure to the elements, and excessive jailings of people based on the paid testimony of individual informants were reported. 55-year-old cafe owner Mahmoud Khodair, who was arrested and held for six months before being released in early march without ever knowing what he was charged with, stated, "It was just like hell", and "Nothing has changed since Saddam. Before, the Mukhabarat [secret police] would take us away, and at least they wouldn't blow down the door. Now, some informant fingers you and gets $100 even if you're innocent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF| title= Iraqi detentions fuel anti-US sentiment| first=Thanassis| last=Cambanis| newspaper=Boston Globe| date=2004-03-28| accessdate=2006-05-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060116163920/http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/03/28/iraqi_detentions_fuel_anti_us_sentiment?mode=PF |archivedate = January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 2004 the media started to report on the abuse. The journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] (who was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his disclosure of the [[Vietnam War]] tragedy at the hamlet of [[My Lai]]) published a series of articles in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' with photo coverage of U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] on 2004-04-30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hersh |first=Seymour |date=May 10, 2004 |title=Torture at Abu Ghraib |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Dan Rather, the deputy director of operations for the US-led coalition, Brig. Gen. [[Mark Kimmitt]], stated "We're appalled. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day. They represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down. If we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect, we can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers."

On May 1, 2004, photos of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq being abused and humiliated by United States soldiers provoke an international outrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1207572,00.html| title=British investigate 10 claims of abuse| date=May 1, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthering the charges, excerpts from the [[Abu Ghraib]] [[Taguba report]]  were published on May 3, 2004. The report documented: the sodomizing of a prisoner with a chemical light, pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees, rape of a female prisoner, forced masturbation, "ghost detainees" moved around to avoid the [[Red Cross]], and many other abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4894033/| title=Key excerpts from the Taguba report| date=May 3, 2004| publisher=MSNBC| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Excerpts From Prison Inquiry | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/03/world/fg-excerpts3| work=Los Angeles Times | date=2004-05-03 | accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the photographs and reports had led to renewed calls for investigations into the abuses reported in other US military prisons, such as [[Camp X-Ray]] and [[Camp Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=14042696_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-MY-HELL-IN-CAMP-X-RAY-name_page.html| title=404 error| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2004, reporters for the Guardian documented a coercive technique which soldiers called "bitch in a box". The prisoner was shoved into the trunk of a car on a hot day, and driven around until the prisoner was near ready to pass out. Another technique documented was "waterboarding", which involves water being poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the individual to experience the sensation of drowning. They also interviewed many soldiers not involved in the current scandal, who claimed that they were taught to use [[sleep deprivation]], to stage mock executions, and to use other procedures. One platoon leader who objected to these practices was reportedly told that his stand could end his military career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1216579,00.html| title=US forces were taught torture techniques| first=Suzanne| last=Goldenberg| date=May 14, 2004| publisher=The Guardian| accessdate=2006-05-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Secretary of Defense|USA Defence Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] told an armed services committee of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on 2004-05-07 that "There are a lot more photographs and videos that exist [...] I looked at them last night and they're hard to believe [...] The pictures I've seen depict conduct, behaviour that is so brutal and so cruel and so inhumane that anyone engaged in it or involved in it would have to be brought to justice."

In a scene described as "surreal" by AFP, it was found in mid May, 2004 that US troops were handing out cash to freed prisoners along with a note stating "You have not been mistreated.". A reporter visiting the prison Camp War Horse described the tour:

:"Have you been mistreated?" the governor asks the detainees, dressed in orange boilersuits.

:"No. We have never been tortured," chorused those behind bars as some 50 soldiers stood nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/05/17/d40517130288.htm| volume=4| issue=342 | date=May 17, 2004| title=US military now trying to buy abused prisoners| newspaper=The Daily Star| accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Daily Mirror'' false allegations====
Alleged photographs of prisoner abuses by UK troops were published by the ''[[The Daily Mirror|Daily Mirror]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/newspapers/1_may_2004/html/3.stm| title=Daily Mirror front page| date=1 May 2004| accessdate=2006-05-28 | work=BBC News | location=London}} (appears to be missing as of last access date)&lt;/ref&gt; within 48 hours of the breaking of the story of abuses by US troops in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.

[[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|General Sir Mike Jackson]], [[British Army|Chief of the General Staff]], said "if proven, the perpetrators are not fit to wear the Queen's uniform and they have besmirched the Army's good name and conduct".

The authenticity of the photographs was called into question a day later. In particular, a number of specifics in the images, such as the type of rifles the soldiers in the pictures are carrying and the type of truck pictured did not match the equipment used by UK troops in Iraq. The ''Mirror'' responded to these criticisms of the photographs on May 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |date=3 May 2004 |title=xxxx |accessdate=2006-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305090751/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14205311&amp;method=full |archivedate=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist Tara McKelvey, writing for the magazine The American Prospect, interviewed an Iraqi sheik in the fall of 2004 about this issue and he told her that "he had seen a young girl, 15 years old, with internal bleeding. She had been raped over and over again by the soldiers, and she could no longer talk. He is a deeply religious man. But that night, he shouted at Allah. ‘How is it possible that you are there and these things are happening?!' he said.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prospect.org/article/unusual-suspects | title=Usual Subjects | publisher=The American Prospect | accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Red Cross reports that more than 100 children were kept in six different prisons of the coalition. Witnesses say US forces also abused children and youths. Soldier Samuel Provance from Abu Ghraib reported the harassment of a 15- to 16-year-old girl in her cell as well as a 16-year-old boy who was driven through the cold after he had been showered and who was then covered with mud. Allegations have been made that children have been subjected to torture and rape. This has been used to make detained parents talk in cases where other interrogation methods have failed. Seymour Hersh told a San Francisco audience: "what happened is that those women who were arrested with young boys, children, in cases that have been [video] recorded, the boys were sodomized, with the cameras rolling... the worst above all of them is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking." An unpublished [[UNICEF]] report is said to include statements about children that were arrested in Basra and Kerbela and routinely detained in Umm Kasr.

===December 2004===
Reports of mock executions by the US Marines in Iraq have surfaced in December 2004, as the [[ACLU]] published internal documents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. The documents were written seven weeks after the publication of the photographs which triggered the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17206&amp;c=206 ACLU]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several torture cases were also reported, notably torture by electricity, beatings, and sprayings of prisoners with fire extinguishers.

On 21 December, the [[ACLU]] released further documents&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17224&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Documents Show Possible Interference by Army Commander In Investigation Into Murder of Iraqi Detainee&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; documenting tortures. Notably, in a case of shooting of suspects without warning, Army commanders are reported to have interfered with the investigation. Procedures of autopsy of detainees who died in unclear circumstances have been canceled by battalion and group commands. Other cases include 
*An apparent attempt by a soldier in Baghdad to force a detainee to hold a gun to create the appearance of a justifiable homicide.
*Two mock executions of Iraqi juveniles by Army personnel (documents obtained by the ACLU two weeks ago showed that U.S. Marines had also conducted a mock execution of juvenile detainees).
*Allegations of a competition among Army dog handlers at Abu Ghraib prison to see who could make Iraqi detainees urinate themselves the fastest.
*The use of death threats during interrogations. Command failures in providing appropriate training to military interrogators in Baghdad detention facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116124849/http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/doa.html |date=November 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2005===
On 24 January 2005, the ACLU accused the Pentagon of deliberately closing investigations over Human Rights violations and torture cases before they were over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=17350&amp;c=206 American Civil Liberties Union : Newly Released Investigative Files Provide Further Evidence Soldiers Not Held Accountable for Abuse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi security forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and long periods of isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 said they had been tortured during interrogation. [[Sarah Leah Whitson]], HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: 
"A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity" . 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed."  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, arbitrary detention, refusal of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/26/iraq10053.htm Iraq: Torture Continues at Hands of New Government (Human Rights Watch, 25-1-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4203637.stm Iraqi forces 'committing abuse' (BBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6863916/ Torture in Iraq still routine, report says (MSNBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 2005===
A Pentagon order is mentioned in a military report filed on May 16, 2005 ordering U.S. personnel to turn a blind eye to Iraqi torture by refraining from investigating instances of apparent detainee abuse by Iraqi personnel, unless the investigation is first approved by U.S. headquarters: "Provided the initial report confirms US forces were not involved in the detainee abuse, no further investigation will be conducted unless directed by HHQ." Such approval was rarely granted.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, 2010 Oct. 24, "The Secret Iraq Files: The War US Turned Blind Eye to Torture; Leaked Documents on Iraq War Contain Thousands of Allegations of Abuse, But a Pentagon Order Told Troops to Ignore Them," http://english.aljazeera.net/secretiraqfiles/2010/10/20101022161828428516.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 2005===
In a report published by Human Rights Watch in September 2005, U.S. Troops are accused to routinely torture prisoners in Iraq. Two sergeants and a captain describe e.g. the breaking of a detainee’s leg, and applying chemical substances to detainees’ skin and eyes. Capt. [[Ian Fishback]] of the 82nd Airborne who made persistent efforts over 17 months to raise concerns about detainee abuse with his chain of command was consistently told to ignore abuses and to “consider your career.” When he made an appointment with Senate staff members of Senators [[John McCain]] and [[John Warner]], he says his commanding officer denied him a pass to leave his base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/09/25/usint11776.htm New Accounts of Torture by U.S. Troops (Human Rights Watch, 24-9-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/politics/24abuse.html | work=The New York Times | title=3 in 82nd Airborne Say Beating Iraqi Prisoners Was Routine | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=2005-09-24 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-173 detainees found in an [[Iraqi government]] bunker in [[Baghdad]]  were found [[Starvation#Capital punishment|starved]], [[Corporal punishment|beaten]] and [[torture]]d.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/starved-tortured-prisoners-found-in-iraqi-cell-1.539303]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4440134.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iraq detainees 'found starving' | date=2005-11-16 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-Colin Powell's former Chief of Staff, Colonel [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], stated in an interview with [[Amy Goodman]] on November 22 that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article11111.htm Colin Powell's Former Chief of Staff Col. Wilkerson on Prewar Intel, Murder and Torture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

:"the difficulties [our troops face] come from the two decisions that I had the most insight into that were made in this more or less alternative decision-making process. And those two decisions were the inept and incompetent planning for post-invasion Iraq, and [...] the decision... from that alternative decision-making process to depart from the Geneva Conventions and from international law, in general.

:"[The President's memorandum said] the spirit of Geneva would be adhered to... consistent with military necessity. [...] It did not say 'consistent with national security demands.' It did not say 'consistent with the demands of the war on terror.' It said 'consistent with military needs.' Now, military needs are very simple and clear to a man like me who spent 31 years in the military. It means that if one of my buddy's life is threatened or my life is threatened, I can take drastic action. I can even shoot a detainee. And I can expect not to be punished under Geneva, or at least if I am court-martialed, I have a defense. It doesn't mean that I can take a detainee in a cold, dark cell in Bagram, Afghanistan, for example, in December 2002, shackled to the wall, and pour cold water on him at intervals when the outside temperature is 50 degrees anyway, and eventually kill him, which is what happened."''

The [[Haditha killings]] occurred on November 19 in the town of [[Haditha, Iraq]]. A convoy of [[United States Marines]] was attacked with an [[improvised explosive device]] which killed Lance Corporal Miguel Terrazas. Up to twenty-four Iraqis were subsequently killed; it is alleged that they were non-combatant local residents who were massacred by Marines in the aftermath of the insurgent attack.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/01/military.training/index.html U.S. military mourns 'tragic' Haditha deaths]'', CNN.

===December 2005===
John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), told [[Reuters]] that there were an estimated 14,000 people being held in prison in Iraq contrary to UN Resolution 1546, according to which the US government claims legal permission to occupy Iraq. In a December 5, 2005, interview, Pace said,

:"All [prisoners in Iraq] except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison.

:"Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.

:"It's very rare to get judges ordering you to be released and effectively the police respecting that order.

:"We have cases also where the judge who has ordered a group of people to be released, about 50-60 people, and the police, the Interior Ministry simply refuses.

:"We have another case in another part of the country where the judge was actually the subject of reprisal for having found people not getting, as ordered, their release.

:"The judge is now in jail.

:"The judiciary has a lot to answer for in this country. It is really not carrying out its duties," he said, adding that bribes were sometimes paid for jobs in the judiciary and police.

:"This is not denied," Pace said. "This is symptomatic of the corruption problems in this country and stands in the way of any kind of rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US detentions abuse Iraq mandate: UN |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/US-detentions-abuse-Iraq-mandate-UN/2005/12/05/1133631177030.html |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=December 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June 2006===
According to the Iraqi Defense Ministry, Private First Class Thomas Tucker and Private First Class Kristian Menchaca were reportedly "killed in a barbaric way," "slaughtered," and tortured to death, and their bodies were so mutilated that DNA tests are being performed to help identify their remains. The alleged group has said it was a revenge for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl who was dishonoured by soldiers of the same brigade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/35231?page_no=2 'Jihadi Porn' Puts Beheadings Online - June 28, 2006 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Video of the killing of four Russian diplomats kidnapped in Iraq appear on the Internet. A group called the Mujahideen Shura Council released the hostage video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5118702.stm | work=BBC News | title=Russian diplomat deaths confirmed | date=2006-06-26 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2009===
In 2009, an additional 21 color photographs surfaced, showing prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq being abused by their U.S. captors.
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) said, "[T]he government had long argued that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was isolated and was an aberration. The new photos would show that the abuse was more widespread." President [[Barack Obama]] initially indicated he would not fight the release of the photographs, but "reversed course in May and authorized an appeal to the high court." "The Obama administration believe[d] giving the imminent grant of authority over the release of such pictures to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|defense secretary]] would short-circuit a lawsuit filed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] under the Freedom of Information Act." On Oct 10, 2009 the US "Congress [was] set to allow [[the Pentagon]] to keep new pictures ... from the public"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress could thwart bid to view abuse photos |author=Mark Sherman |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 10, 2009 |url=https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/congress-could-thwart-bid-to-view-abuse-photos-1.1515034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010-present===
On February 3, 2010, David A. Larson, an elected official in California who has a relationship with government contract personnel, made disclosures to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Office of the Inspector General (OIG) alleging that under the Bush Administration, prisoners detained at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and undisclosed "black sites" were being used as involuntary research subjects for human biomedical experimentation, behavior modification research, and drug-testosterone delivery in a manner similar to past CIA [[Project MKULTRA]] activities investigated in 1977 by Senators Kennedy and Inuoye. The allegation supports information contained in an International Red Cross report relative to the expanded role of CIA medical personnel in torture and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130102094447/http://www.electlarson.com/issues.htm On the Issues, David A. Larson, Candidate and Elected official]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghriab- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| work= | publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=15 July 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the US detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime, in which [[human rights]] abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the security forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say that "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. US authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by US forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010 nearly 400,000 secret [[United States]] army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, [[the Guardian]] and several other [[international]] media organisations through the [[whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among others, the logs detail how US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, [[torture]], [[rape]] and even [[murder]] by [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] police and soldiers, whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished and that US troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the UK and the US have condemned the unauthorised release of classified material, but did not question its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11612731 Wikileaks: Iraq war logs 'reveal truth about conflict']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
Several sets of investigations, both congressional via the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], military via [[courts-martial]], and criminal for non-military contractors, were launched in response to the scandal.

[[Seymour Hersh]], who exposed the Abu Ghraib scandal, and reports in Newsweek, has taken the case even further.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact Annals of National Security: The Gray Zone: The New Yorker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302212815/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact |date=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ The Roots of Torture - Newsweek: World News - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415220915/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4989438/ |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] instituted a policy that "encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq.". This policy stemmed from an earlier policy taken toward al-Qaeda prisoners. A memo to the Bush White House from counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] claimed that the new sort of war renders the Geneva Conventions' limitations on interrogating enemy prisoners "obsolete". The program was approved by the [[CIA]], [[NSA]], and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. President [[George W. Bush]] was informed of it. The [[Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence]] [[Steven Cambone]] administered the operation. His deputy, [[William Boykin]], instructed the head of operations at [[Camp X-ray]] [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Geoffrey Miller (MG)|Geoffrey Miller]] to do the same at [[Abu Ghraib]]. Miller told Brig. Gen. [[Janis Karpinski]] that the prison would now be dedicated to gathering intelligence.   [[Douglas Feith]] and [[William J. Haynes, II|William Haynes]] were also involved in the operation.

On May 18, 2004, a military intelligence analyst named [[Samuel Provance]] came out to the press, stating "There's definitely a cover-up". Provance, who ran a computer network used by military intelligence in the prison and who had been ordered not to speak to the press, told ABC News "Anything [the MPs] were to do legally or otherwise, they were to take those commands from the interrogators," and that the sexual humiliation began as a technique ordered by the investigators. He described several of the goings-on in the prison that he witnessed, such as the punching people in the neck hard enough to knock them unconscious after assuring them they weren't going to be hit, in order to catch them off guard. He also stated that Maj. Gen. [[George Fay]], the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, has shown little interest in investigating the interrogators and has gone only after the MPs, and that there is a culture of silence right now among those involved, who fear that if they say anything, the investigations will turn to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/sections/WNT/Investigation/abu_ghraib_cover_up_040518.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2004, a court martial hearing was held for Cpl. [[Charles Graner|Charles A. Graner Jr.]], who has been accused of being the ringleader of the group employing torture at Abu Ghraib. In an unexpected move, all three key witnesses - Lt. Col. [[Steven L. Jordan]], Capt. Donald J. Reese, and contractor Adel L. Nakhla - refused to testify. This is an almost unheard of action. Under court martial proceedings, one cannot refuse to testify unless they have a belief that they will be exposed to criminal charges for doing so. Consequently, it is likely that the investigative proceedings will be forced to move higher up the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | archive-url=https://archive.is/20040609204053/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/iraq/la-fg-prison19may19,1,5951548,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2004-06-09 | work=Los Angeles Times }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jens Haaning''' (born 1965) is a Danish conceptual, contemporary artist living and working in [[Copenhagen]].

Haaning has produced a body of artworks since the 1990s, which – when seen together – offers an acute reflection of a complex and changing society in the West. The works address the existing structures of power and communication in the global society and necessitate a debate around subjects such as migration, displacement, nationalism, and other aspects related to our coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gibca.se/index.php/en/2017/artists-gibca-2017/jens-haaning|title=GIBCA • Jens Haaning|website=www.gibca.se|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the works consist of interventions in institutional structures or public spaces. Examples of these are: ‘Middelburg Summer 1996’ (1996), which was a temporary relocation of a factory employing immigrant workers to the exhibition space De Vleeshal, Middelburg, The Netherlands, and ‘Turkish Jokes’ (1994) a sound piece with a tape-recording of jokes, told by Turks in their native language, which was originally played in a public square in Oslo, Norway.

==Exhibitions==
Haaning has exhibited extensively, the main exhibitions include: [[Documenta11|Documenta XI]], [[Kassel]], Germany (2002), the 9th [[Istanbul Biennial]], [[Istanbul]], Turkey (2005), Traffic at [[CAPC Museé d'art contemporain]], [[Bordeaux]], France (1996), [[Vienna Secession]], [[Vienna]], Austria (1997, 1998, 2007), Publicness at [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]], [[London]], England (2003), the 6th [[Gwangju Biennale]], [[Gwangju]], South Korea (2002, 2006) and latest a large survey of Haaning’s works from the 1990s until 2017 at Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art, [[Gothenburg]], Sweden (2017).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Langkawi Declaration on the Environment''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the issue of [[environmental sustainability]].  It was issued on October 21, 1989 at [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]], during the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).

The declaration covers a wide range of topics related to the environment, blaming 'past neglect in managing the natural environment and resources'.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |date=21 October 1989 |title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment 1989 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064714/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists what the Heads of Governments perceived to be the main environmental problems: the [[greenhouse effect]], damage to the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], [[marine pollution]], [[land degradation]], and species [[extinction]].  These, the declaration affirmed, were issues that transcended national borders, and hence required the involvement of international organisations, such as the Commonwealth, to coordinate strategies to solve them.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

A key agreement in the formulation of the agreement was the pledge by [[developed country|developed countries]] not to connect future international [[development aid]] to commitment to environmental sustainability or introduce [[trade barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Law and the Conservation of Biological Diversity |last=Bowman |first=Michael |author2=Redgwell, Catherine  |year=1996 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location= |isbn=978-90-411-0863-0 |pages=239 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'),&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt; and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments.  In exchange, the developing countries conceded to the Commonwealth's developed members (particularly [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]), their interest in protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt;

Amongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;
* Support the development of an international sustainable development funding mechanism.
* Support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and recommend the Commonwealth's own report on [[climate change]].
* Promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].
* Promote [[afforestation]] and sustainable forest management in developing countries, and the conservation of [[Old growth forest|virgin forest]] to protect [[biodiversity]].
* Restrict non-[[sustainable fisheries]], including banning tangle nets and pelagic driftnet fishing, as part of a general trend amongst international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrust.org/dnpaper/intllaw.html |date=May 1994 |title=International Law Governing Driftnet Fishing on the High Seas |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Earthtrust]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prevent dumping of toxic or hazardous materials in the oceans or in developing countries.
* Promote public awareness of environmental risks and issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5240">'''Legal opportunity structure''' or '''legal opportunity''' is a concept found in the study of law and [[social movements]]. It was first used in order to distinguish it from [[political opportunity structure]] or [[political opportunity]], on the basis that law and the courts deserved to be studied in their own right rather than being lumped together with political institutions.&lt;ref name="HilsonChris"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hilson | first = Chris | title = New social movements: the role of legal opportunity | journal = [[Journal of European Public Policy]] | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 238–255 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13501760110120246 | date = January 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13501760110120246 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal opportunities are made up of: access to the courts, which may be affected in particular by the law on standing or ''locus standi'', and costs rules; 'legal stock' or the set of available precedents on which to hang a case;&lt;ref name="AndersenEllen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Andersen | first = Ellen Ann | title = Out of the closets &amp; into the courts: legal opportunity structure and gay rights litigation | publisher = University of Michigan Press | location = Ann Arbor | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780472021574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial receptiveness. Some of these are more obviously structural than others - hence the term legal opportunity is sometimes preferred over legal opportunity structure.

Legal opportunity has been used as an [[independent variable]] to help to explain strategy choice by social movement organisations (SMOs) - e.g. why SMOS adopt litigation rather than protest or political lobbying as a strategy. Other variables or explanatory frameworks it is commonly found alongside include [[framing (social sciences)|framing]],&lt;ref name="VanhalaLisa"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vanhala | first = Lisa | title = Making rights a reality?: disability rights activists and legal mobilization | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107000872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[resource mobilization]] and grievance. It can also be employed as a [[dependent variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Evans Case | first1 = Rhonda | last2 = Givens | first2 = Terri E. | title = Re-engineering legal opportunity structures in the European Union?

'''Letterlike Symbols''' is a [[Unicode block]] containing 80 [[character (computing)|character]]s which are constructed mainly from the [[glyph]]s of one or more [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s. In addition to this block, Unicode includes [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols|full styled mathematical alphabets]], although Unicode does not explicitly categorise these characters as being "letterlike".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7826">[[Image:Manzoni-linee.jpg|thumb|"Linea 5m 70" and "Linea 10m 99".]]
'''''Linee''''' (lines) is an [[artist's book]] by the Italian artist [[Piero Manzoni]], created in 1959. Each work consists of a cardboard tube, a scroll of paper with a black line drawn down it, and a simple printed and autographed label. This label contains a brief description of the work, the work’s length, the artist’s name and the date it was created. Most of the lines were made between September and December 1959. 68 are known to have been made,&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant&lt;/ref&gt; each with different length strips inside.

==First public exhibition==

The first public exhibition of the ''Linee'' was at Galleria Pozzetto Chiuso in Albissola Marina, between 18 and 24 August, occasion in which Lucio Fontana Buy the Linea m 9,48.&lt;ref&gt;Pola, Francesca. Una visione internazionale. Piero Manzoni e Albisola. Electa, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The second public presentation of the lines was at the inaugural exhibition of the Galleria Azimut, Milan, a space run by Enrico Castellani and Manzoni himself, between 4 and 24 December 1959. 11 lines were exhibited unopened on wooden plinths, whilst a twelfth strip was unrolled and attached directly to the entire length of one wall. The tubes were sold for between 25 and 80 thousand lire,&lt;ref&gt;''Corriere della Sera'', Milan, 1959-12-16, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; depending on their length, which ranged from 4m 89 to 33m 63. Manzoni seems to have changed his mind about the unveiling of the twelfth strip, as he wrote in May 1960 that the tubes ‘must not be opened.’&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Shozu Yamazaki, quoted in ''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the strips are still occasionally unrolled when exhibited.

Originally the lines, when bought, would become a personal act of unveiling by the buyer, not dissimilar to an individual reading a book. There are documentary photos by Manzoni recording one such opening. Uliano Lucas, a friend and occasional collaborator of Manzoni is shown unravelling one such line, to discover the text '15 Capo Linea' (Head Line) at the end.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni, Catalog Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p61&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once the practice of demanding that the work remained hidden had been established, however, the tubes became objects that record an unseen artistic event, at a specific moment in time; what Duchamp called ‘a kind of rendezvous’.

The artistic act of drawing the lines becomes totally obscured, replaced by an imaginary idea of what they might look like, born witness by the labels on the tube, but not revealed.
The works elevate the external text whilst diminishing the art object, implying that only the visualisation of the work in the mind’s eye is valid. This idea was to be taken further with his ''[[Artist’s Shit]]'', where the contents are unknowable without destroying the container, and reached its logical conclusion with the ''Lines of Infinite Length'', where the line only exists as a metaphysical speculation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although the Lines are hidden from view, their labels identify them as events that occurred at a particular time; they are like pieces of evidence bearing witness to the artist's activity. The object of our gaze is therefore not a finished product, but rather the remnant of an act that has transpired.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni'', Suzanne Cotter, Serpentine Gallery, 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lines of Exceptional Length'' (''Linee dalla lunghezza eccezionale'', 1960-1961)===

There were three extra works that followed the original multiple; All were lines equal to or in excess of a kilometre long, and were contained in metal cylinders.
The first, a 7,200&amp;nbsp;m line made in the presence of witnesses, was drawn on a rotary press at the Printing press for the newspaper ''Herning Avis'', Denmark, on July 4, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The work was made with a bottle filled with ink with a stopper at the top. The continuous sheet was then placed inside a zinc cylinder covered in lead sheets. Two more ''Lines of Exceptional Length'' were made on 24 July 1961, one 1,000&amp;nbsp;m long, the other 1,140 metres.

These were then placed in steel containers, and marked the beginnings of a series of cylinders Manzoni planned to leave in the principal cities of the world, which, when the lines were joined together, would be equal to the circumference of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalogue Raisoné'', Battino &amp; Palazzoli, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This work would remain unfinished at his death, 20 months later.

== Other related works==

Another  related work on this theme are the ''Linee di Lunghezza Infinita'' of 1960 (''Lines of Infinite Length''), made of a carved piece of wood, closely resembling the original ''Linee'', and similarly labelled, but citing the length of the strip contained inside as Infinite. Since the wood is solid, it cannot contain a strip inside, any more than if there were, it couldn’t be infinitely long. The piece takes ideas Manzoni had about works existing only in the viewers imagination to their logical conclusion; the work, in effect, is impossible, containing an impossible line, and therefore can only exist in the viewer’s mind.

Six were made before Manzoni’s death, although he printed and signed more labels, which have been used to complete the edition since his death.

The ‘disappearance of the artwork as literal object’, and the elevation of the text as central to the works meaning clearly anticipates the conceptual art movement of the late 1960s.

Manzoni also prepared a mock-up of three booklets, intended to be published as part of the avant-garde magazine ''Gorgona'', Zagreb. One of these, ''Table of Assessment #3'', was a booklet featuring a continuous line running the length of the booklet. The work was never realised due to lack of funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Piero Manzoni Catalog Generale'', vol 1, Celant pp. 286-287&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

[[Rauschenberg]]’s ''Automobile Tire Print'', 1951 is an obvious precedent, being a scroll containing a continuous (tyre) print, which can only be seen in sections. The work is also contemporaneous with [[Tinguely]]'s ''Cyclomatic'', a big machine made of a roll of paper 1&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; km long, bicycle parts and an inkpad. When ridden by two cyclists, the work would scatter continuous bicycle tyre prints into the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=P.|last=Hulten|title=Una magia più forte della morte|publisher= Bompiani |pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Marcel Duchamp]] also provides a number of reference points, being concerned with the removal of the artist’s hand from the artwork, and attempting to negate any aesthetic decisions.

The sale of different ''Lines'' at different prices recalls [[Yves Klein]]’s "Proposition: Monochrome" exhibition in Milan, 1957, which Manzoni is known to have seen and been deeply affected by.&lt;ref&gt;''Manzoni'', Clemant, Electa 2007. p 61&lt;/ref&gt; The lines of exceptional lengths are recalled in Martin Kippenberger's "Metro-Net", a series of subway entrances intended to be built into the ground of every major city in the world, metaphysically joining them. Like Manzoni, Kippenberger would die before more than a handful were completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmediastudies.com/art/mk.htm New Media Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linguistic rights]] in Africa are stated in [[constitution]]s which differ by country. These constitutions usually state the [[national language]](s) and/or [[official language]](s), and may or may not explicitly allow for other languages in the country. Most of the linguistic rights stated here are negative rights, which grant freedom of usage of own language and prevent discrimination based on language.

==Linguistic rights in African constitutions==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">'''Moral syncretism''' consists of the attempt to reconcile disparate or contradictory [[Morality|moral beliefs]], often while melding the [[ethics|ethical]] practices of various schools of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==The role of moral syncretism==
The requirements of a global ethic call for "a minimal basic [[consensus]] relating to binding values, irrevocable standards and moral attitudes, which can be affirmed by all religions despite their undeniable dogmatic or theological differences and should also be supported by non-believers."&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"&gt;{{cite web | title=Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities | author=[[Hans Küng]] | work=Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, Santa Clara University (2007) | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/global_ethics/laughlin-lectures/global-ethic-human-responsibility.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot, however, make the specific ethics of the different [[religions]] and [[philosophies]] around the world superfluous or obsolete, nor should it strive to do so.&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"/&gt;

[[Syncretism]] tends to facilitate coexistence and constructive interaction between different cultures ([[intercultural competence]]), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic [[empire|realm]]s. Conversely the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of "[[piety]]" and "orthodoxy," may help to generate, bolster or authorize a sense of [[Cultural identity|cultural unity]] in a well-defined minority or majority. While strengthening the ethical [[Cultural identity|identity]] of the [[subculture|subgroup]], this is often detrimental to the [[Cooperation|unity]] of the whole.

==Morality independent of religion==
A [[cornerstone]] of moral syncretism is that [[religion]] cannot be morality's only arbiter.

The [[Dalai Lama]], for example, has said that compassion and affection are human values that are independent of religion: "We need these human values. I call these [[secular ethics]], secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things."&lt;ref name="The Dalai Lama Interview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Amitabh Pal | title=The Dalai Lama Interview | work=The Progressive (January 2006) | url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0106 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also supported by the [[traditional]] [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of [[natural law]]. In his book ''On Law, Morality and Politics'', [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] identifies the innate rational nature of humans as being what defines moral law: "The rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts."&lt;ref name="Natural Law"&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural Law | work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006) | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/natlaw.htm | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not, however, mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]], are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some [[Deists]], prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics.

===Atheism and morality===
Most [[atheists]] argue that no religious basis is necessary for one to live an ethical life.&lt;ref name="Is Atheism Consistent With Morality?"&gt;{{cite web | title=Is Atheism Consistent With Morality? | author=Mark I. Vuletic | work=Modern Documents, The Secular Web Library (2001) | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/moral.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that atheists are as motivated towards moral behavior as anyone, or more, citing a range of non-theistic sources of moral behavior including: parental love, their conventional (or advanced) [[education|educated upbringing]], natural [[empathy]], [[compassion]] and the [[humanism|humane concern]]; respect for [[norm (social)|social norms]], [[criminal law]] stemming from [[natural law]], [[Police|police or other enforced order]] (and in some cases [[social order|society]]); and a desire for a good reputation and self-esteem. According to this view, ethical behavior is a natural consequence of altruistic motivation, not stemming from divine or tenet-prescribed system of punishment or reward [[Karma|in life]] and/or after death, though experiences and tentative expectations may instead play a role in forming and strengthening a moral atheist's motivations and ethics, united in rejection of any theory of all human beings' [[afterlife]]. Thus while atheism does not entail any particular moral philosophy, many atheists are drawn towards philosophies and worldviews such as: [[secular humanism]], [[empiricism]], [[objectivist philosophy|objectivism]], or [[utilitarianism]], which provide a moral framework that is not founded on faith in deities.{{or|date=January 2013}}

===Humanist ethics===
[[Humanism|Humanists]] endorse [[Moral universalism|universal morality]] based on the commonality of [[human nature]] and the belief that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our understanding of individual and joint interests, rather than a system of ethics stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, rejecting [[faith]] completely as a basis for moral action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. Member organisations and individual members are required to accept the following statement:

:Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.

Humanism is also known to adopt principles of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]]. As [[Oscar Wilde]] once said, "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live." This emphasizes a respect for other people's identities and ideals.

===School of Economic Science===
The [[School of Economic Science]] (SES) is an [[organisation]] based in [[Mandeville Place]], [[London]], founded by Leon MacLaren in 1937. Originally constituted to facilitate the study of [[economics]], over time it came to focus on [[philosophy]], particularly the [[Hindu]] tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="Welcome to the School of Economic Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to the School of Economic Science | work=School of Economic Science, www.schooleconomicscience.org | url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/ | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the SES is also known as the [[School of Practical Philosophy]], or by other similar names.  In [[Australia]], it is known as the School of Philosophy.  Although the SES has been highly criticized for its methodology and alleged motives,&lt;ref name="School abuse inquiry"&gt;{{cite web | title=School abuse inquiry | author=Victoria Macdonald | work=Channel 4 News - World (14 Mar 2006) | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/special-reports/special-reports-storypage.jsp?id=1946 | accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070529054617/http://www.channel4.com/news/special-reports/special-reports-storypage.jsp?id=1946 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; it purports to be a syncretic school of moral philosophy.

==Religions that incorporate moral syncretism==
Several groups have taken on the challenge of establishing a [[world community]] through  doctrine, faith and practice.

===Unitarian Universalism===
[[Unitarian Universalism]] is a [[liberal religion|theologically liberal]] [[List of religions#Unitarian Universalism|religion]] characterized by its support of "a free and responsible search for truth and meaning."&lt;ref name="A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning |work=A Sermon by the Rev. James R. Bridges |url=http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212144944/http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This principle permits Unitarian Universalists a wide range of beliefs and practices. Some communities even offer a class called "Building Your Own Theology."

Many Unitarian Universalists consider themselves [[humanism|humanists]], while others hold [[Christian]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jew]]ish, [[pagan]], [[atheist]], [[agnostic]], [[pantheist]], or other beliefs.  Some choose to attach no particular theological label to their idiosyncratic combination of beliefs.  Others consider themselves to be Unitarian Universalists in theology and seek moral orientation in the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association's]] [[Unitarian Universalism#Seven Principles and Purposes|Seven Principles]] and [[Unitarian Universalism#Six Sources|Six Sources]].  This diversity of views is considered a strength, since the emphasis is placed on a common search for a meaningful existence, rather than an adherence to a particular [[doctrine]].

===Universal Sufism===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Soefiembleem.gif|thumb|The symbol of Universal Sufism, "Tughra Inayati"]] --&gt;
The philosophy of [[Universal Sufism]] revolves around a [[Cooperation|unity]] of all people and [[religion]]s, as well as the ability to find [[beauty]] in all things. It is a form of [[Sufism]] that does not exist within the traditional framework of [[Islam]] and  was most likely influenced by [[Advaita]] philosophy. Universal Sufism is characterised by its respect (if not inclusion) for other devotional traditions and its disapproval of miracles.

It is mandated that Universal Sufis should strive to "realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out."&lt;ref name="The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement"&gt;{{cite web | title=The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement | work=Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, Sufi Ruhaniat International (1956-2006) | url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php | accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307134652/http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1950">The '''[[Kiiti Morita|Morita]] conjectures''' in [[general topology]] are certain problems about [[normal space]]s, now solved in the affirmative. They asked 

# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[discrete space|discrete]]?
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal P-space ''Y'', is ''X'' [[metrizable]]?&lt;ref&gt;[[Kiiti Morita|K. Morita]], "Some problems on normality of products of spaces"  J. Novák (ed.) , Proc. Fourth Prague Topological Symp. (Prague, August 1976) , Soc. Czech. Math. and Physicists , Prague  (1977)  pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' is normal for every normal countably [[paracompact]] space ''Y'', is ''X'' metrizable and [[sigma-locally compact]]?

The answers were believed to be affirmative. Here a '''normal P-space''' ''Y'' is characterised by the property that the product with every metrizable ''X'' is normal; thus the conjecture was that the converse holds.

K. Chiba, T.C. Przymusiński and [[Mary Ellen Rudin]]
&lt;ref&gt;K. Chiba,   T.C. Przymusiński,   M.E. Rudin,   "Normality of products and Morita's conjectures"  ''Topol. Appl.'' '''22'''  (1986)  19–32&lt;/ref&gt; proved conjecture (1) and showed that conjectures (2) and (3) cannot be proven false under the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for mathematics (specifically that the conjectures hold under the [[axiom of constructibility]] ''V=L''). 

Fifteen years later, [[Zoltán Tibor Balogh|Z. Balogh]] succeeded in proving conjectures (2) and (3) true.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Balogh, Non-shrinking open covers and K. Morita's duality conjectures, ''Topology Appl.'', '''115''' (2001) 333-341&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, 10 Nobel Peace Laureates and more than 3,000 young people traveled from all over the world to Denver, Colorado, to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the PeaceJam Foundation. The [[14th Dalai Lama]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]], President [[Oscar Arias]], [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], Mairead Maguire, [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]], [[José Ramos-Horta]], [[Jody Williams]], and [[Shirin Ebadi]] came together in the largest gathering of Nobel Peace Laureates ever held in U.S. history. They announced plans for a 10-year campaign, now known as the '''One Billion Acts of Peace''' campaign, designed to tackle what they perceive as the 10 greatest challenges to the survival of humanity and the well-being of our planet today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jennifer|title=10 Nobel Prize winners gather for PeaceJam|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4340405?source=rss|accessdate=2011-07-07|newspaper=Denver Post|date=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Diana|title=H+K helps PeaceJam launch One Billion Acts of Peace campaign|url=http://www.prweek.com/article/1296734/h+k-helps-peacejam-launch-one-billion-acts-peace-campaign|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=PR Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") originates from the [[S-L-M|same root]] as the word ''[[Islam]]''.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{OEtymD|Islam|accessdate=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

The ideal society according to the [[Qur’an]] is [[Dar as-Salam]], literally, ''"the house of peace"''  of which it intones: ''And Allah invites to the 'abode of peace' and guides whom He pleases into the right path.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/010.qmt.html Qur'an 10:25]; Lewis, Bernard, The Crisis of Islam, 2001 Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], there will be an era in which justice, plenty, abundance, well-being, security, peace, and brotherhood will prevail among humanity, and one in which people will experience love, self-sacrifice, tolerance, compassion, mercy, and loyalty. Muhammad said{{cn|date=June 2017}} that this blessed period will be experienced through the mediation of the [[Mahdi]], who will come in the end times to save the world from chaos, injustice, and moral collapse. He will eradicate godless ideologies and bring an end to the prevailing injustice. Moreover, he will make religion like it was in the days of Muhammad, cause the Qur'an's moral teachings to prevail among humanity, and establish peace and well-being throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar al-Haythami]], Al-Qawl al-Mukhtasar fi `Alamat al-Mahdi al-Muntazar, 23, 34, 50, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''posetal category''', or '''thin category''',&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=thin+category|title=Thin category}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Category (mathematics)#Small and large categories|homsets]] each contain at most one morphism. As such, a posetal category amounts to a [[preordered class]] (or a [[preordered set]], if its objects form a set). As suggested by the name, the further requirement that the category be [[Skeleton (category theory)|skeletal]] is often assumed for the definition of "posetal"; in the case of a category that is posetal, being skeletal is equivalent to the requirement that the only isomorphisms are the identity morphisms, equivalently that the preordered class satisfies [[antisymmetry]] and hence, if a set, is a [[poset]].

All [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]s [[commutative diagram|commute]] in a posetal category. When the commutative diagrams of a category are interpreted as a typed equational theory whose objects are the types, a codiscrete posetal category corresponds to an inconsistent theory understood as one satisfying the axiom ''x'' = ''y'' at all types.

Viewing a [[2-category]] as an [[enriched category]] whose hom-objects are categories, the hom-objects of any extension of a posetal category to a [[2-category]] having the same 1-cells are [[monoid]]s.

Some lattice-theoretic structures are definable as posetal categories of a certain kind, usually with the stronger assumption of being skeletal. For example, a poset may be defined as a posetal category, a [[distributive lattice]] as a posetal [[distributive category]], a [[Heyting algebra]] as a posetal finitely [[cocomplete]] [[cartesian closed category]], and a [[Boolean algebra]] as a posetal finitely cocomplete [[*-autonomous category]]. Conversely, categories, distributive categories, finitely cocomplete cartesian closed categories, and finitely cocomplete *-autonomous categories can be considered the respective [[categorification]]s of posets, distributive lattices, Heyting algebras, and Boolean algebras.

[[Image:Hasse diagram of powerset of 3.svg|thumb|250px|The elements of the power set of the set {''x'', ''y'', ''z''}  [[order theory|ordered]] with respect to [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]].]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''power set''' (or '''powerset''') of any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|''S''}} is the set of all [[subset]]s of {{mvar|''S''}}, including the [[empty set]] and {{mvar|S}} itself, variously denoted as {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}), 𝒫({{mvar|''S''}}), ℘({{mvar|''S''}}) (using the "[[Weierstrass p]]"), {{math|''P''(''S'')}}, {{math|ℙ(''S'')}}, or, identifying the powerset of {{mvar|''S''}} with the set of all functions from {{mvar|''S''}} to a given set of two elements, {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In [[axiomatic set theory]] (as developed, for example, in the [[ZFC]] axioms), the existence of the power set of any set is [[postulated]] by the [[axiom of power set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|1979|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any subset of {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) is called a ''[[family of sets]]'' over {{mvar|''S''}}.

==Example==
If {{mvar|S}} is the set {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}, then the subsets of {{mvar|S}} are

* {{math|{{mset}}}} (also denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, the  [[empty set]] or the null set)
* {{math|{{mset|''x''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''y''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''y'', ''z''}}}}
* {{math|{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}
and hence the power set of {{mvar|S}} is {{math|{{mset|{{mset}},
{{mset|''x''}},
{{mset|''y''}},
{{mset|''z''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''y''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''z''}},
{{mset|''y'', ''z''}},
{{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Puntambekar|2007|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
If {{mvar|''S''}} is a finite set with {{math|1={{!}}''S''{{!}} = ''n''}} elements, then the number of subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} is {{math|1={{!}}{{mathcal|P}}(''S''){{!}} = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This fact, which is the motivation for the notation {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, may be demonstrated simply as follows,
: First, order the elements of {{mvar|S}} in any manner. We write any subset of {{mvar|''S''}} in the format {{math|{γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; }}} where {{math|γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; , 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}}, can take the value of {{math|0}} or {{math|1}}. If {{math|1=γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, the {{mvar|i}}-th element of {{mvar|''S''}} is in the subset; otherwise, the {{mvar|i}}-th element is not in the subset. Clearly the number of distinct subsets that can be constructed this way is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {0, 1} }}.

[[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that the power set of a set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself (informally the power set must be larger than the original set). In particular, [[Cantor's theorem]] shows that the power set of a [[countable set|countably infinite]] set is [[uncountable|uncountably]] infinite. The power set of the set of [[natural number]]s can be put in a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cardinality of the continuum]]).

The power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}}, together with the operations of [[union (set theory)|union]], [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[complement (set theory)|complement]] can be viewed as the prototypical example of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. In fact, one can show that any ''finite'' Boolean algebra is [[isomorphic]] to the Boolean algebra of the power set of a finite set. For ''infinite'' Boolean algebras this is no longer true, but every infinite Boolean algebra can be represented as a [[subalgebra]] of a power set Boolean algebra (see [[Stone's representation theorem]]).

The power set of a set {{mvar|''S''}} forms an [[abelian group]] when considered with the operation of [[symmetric difference]] (with the empty set as the identity element and each set being its own inverse) and a [[commutative]] [[monoid]] when considered with the operation of intersection. It can hence be shown (by proving the [[Distributive property|distributive laws]]) that the power set considered together with both of these operations forms a [[Boolean ring]].

==Representing subsets as functions== &lt;!-- this section is referenced forme some other place in this article, do not change its title carelessly --&gt;
In set theory, [[Function (mathematics)#Function space|{{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|Y}} to {{mvar|X}}.  As "2" can be defined as {{math|{{mset|0,1}}}} (see [[Natural number#A standard construction|natural number]]), {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (i.e., {{math|{{mset|0,1}}&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from {{mvar|''S''}} to {0,1}.  By identifying a function in {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the corresponding [[preimage]] of {{math|1}}, we see that there is a [[bijection]] between {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}), where each function is the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the subset in {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) with which it is identified.  Hence {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) could be considered identical set-theoretically.  (Thus there are two distinct [[set notation#Metaphor in denoting sets|notational motivations]] for denoting the power set by {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}}:  the fact that this function-representation of subsets makes it a special case of the {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;}} notation and the property, [[power set#Properties|mentioned above]], that {{math|1={{abs|2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 2&lt;sup&gt;{{abs|''S''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}.)

This notion can be applied to the example [[Power set#Example|above]] in which {{math|1=''S'' = {{mset|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}}} to see the isomorphism with the binary numbers
from 0 to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} with {{mvar|n}} being the number of elements in the set.
In {{mvar|''S''}}, a "1" in the position corresponding to the location in the enumerated set {{math|1={{mset| (''x'', 0), (''y'', 1), (''z'', 2) }}}} indicates the presence of the element. So {{math|1={{mset|''x'', ''y''}} = 011&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

For the whole power set of {{mvar|''S''}} we get:

Such bijective mapping of ''S'' to integers is arbitrary, so this representation of subsets of ''S'' is not unique, but the sort order of the enumerated set does not change its cardinality.

However, such finite binary representation is only possible if ''S'' can be enumerated (this is possible even if ''S'' has an infinite cardinality, such as the set of integers or rationals, but not for example if ''S'' is the set of real numbers, in which we cannot enumerate all irrational numbers to assign them a defined finite location in an ordered set containing all irrational numbers).

==Relation to binomial theorem==
The power set is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]].  The number of subsets with {{mvar|k}} elements in the power set of a set with {{mvar|n}} elements is given by the number of [[combination]]s, {{math|C(''n'', ''k'')}}, also called [[binomial coefficient]]s.

For example, the power set of a set with three elements, has:

*C(3, 0) = 1 subset with 0 elements (the empty subset),
*C(3, 1) = 3 subsets with 1 element (the singleton subsets),
*C(3, 2) = 3 subsets with 2 elements (the complements of the singleton subsets),
*C(3, 3) = 1 subset with 3 elements (the original set itself).


Using this relationship we can compute &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left|2^S \right|&lt;/math&gt; using the formula:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left|2^S \right | = \sum_{k=0}^{|S|} \binom{|S|}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore one can deduce the following identity, assuming &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|S| = n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left |2^S \right| = 2^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} &lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithms==
If {{mvar|S}} is a [[finite set]], there is a [[recursive algorithm]] to calculate {{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}).

Define the operation {{math|1={{mathcal|F}} (''e'', ''T'') = {''X'' ∪ {''e''} {{!}} ''X'' ∈ ''T''}}}.

In English, return the set with the element {{mvar|e}} added to each set {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|T}}.

*If {{math|1=''S'' = { } }}, then {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}({{mvar|S}}) = { { } } }} is returned.
*Otherwise:
:*Let {{mvar|e}} be any single element of {{mvar|S}}.
:*Let {{math|1=''T'' = ''S'' \ {''e''} }}, where {{math|''S'' \ {''e''} }} denotes the [[Complement (set theory)|relative complement]] of {{mvar|e}} in {{mvar|S}}.
:*And the result: {{math|1={{mathcal|P}}(''S'') = {{mathcal|P}}(''T'') ∪ {{mathcal|F}} (''e'', {{mathcal|P}}(''T''))}} is returned.

In other words, the power set of the empty set is the set containing the empty set and the power set of any other set is all the subsets of the set containing some specific element and all the subsets of the set not containing that specific element.

==Subsets of limited cardinality==
The set of subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} of [[cardinality]] less than or equal to {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the set of subsets with cardinality strictly less than {{math|κ}} is sometimes denoted {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;&lt; κ&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|[''S'']&lt;sup&gt;&lt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Similarly, the set of non-empty subsets of {{mvar|''S''}} might be denoted by {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sub&gt;≥ 1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')}} or {{math|{{mathcal|P}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'')}}.

==Power object==
A set can be regarded as an algebra having no nontrivial operations or defining equations.  From this perspective the idea of the power set of {{mvar|''X''}} as the set of subsets of {{mvar|''X''}} generalizes naturally to the subalgebras of an [[algebraic structure]] or algebra.

Now the power set of a set, when ordered by inclusion, is always a complete atomic Boolean algebra, and every complete atomic Boolean algebra arises as the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] of all subsets of some set.  The generalization to arbitrary algebras is that the set of subalgebras of an algebra, again ordered by inclusion, is always an [[algebraic lattice]], and every algebraic lattice arises as the lattice of subalgebras of some algebra.  So in that regard subalgebras behave analogously to subsets.

However, there are two important properties of subsets that do not carry over to subalgebras in general.  First, although the subsets of a set form a set (as well as a lattice), in some classes it may not be possible to organize the subalgebras of an algebra as itself an algebra in that class, although they can always be organized as a lattice.  Secondly, whereas the subsets of a set are in bijection with the functions from that set to the set {0,1} = 2, there is no guarantee that a class of algebras contains an algebra that can play the role of 2 in this way.

Certain classes of algebras enjoy both of these properties.  The first property is more common, the case of having both is relatively rare.  One class that does have both is that of [[multigraph]]s.  Given two multigraphs {{mvar|''G''}} and {{mvar|''H''}}, a [[homomorphism]] {{math|''h'': ''G'' → ''H''}} consists of two functions, one mapping vertices to vertices and the other mapping edges to edges.  The set {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to {{mvar|''H''}} can then be organized as the graph whose vertices and edges are respectively the vertex and edge functions appearing in that set.  Furthermore, the subgraphs of a multigraph {{mvar|''G''}} are in bijection with the graph homomorphisms from {{mvar|''G''}} to the multigraph {{math|Ω}} definable as the [[complete graph|complete directed graph]] on two vertices (hence four edges, namely two self-loops and two more edges forming a cycle) augmented with a fifth edge, namely a second self-loop at one of the vertices.  We can therefore organize the subgraphs of {{mvar|''G''}} as the multigraph {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''G''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called the '''power object''' of {{mvar|''G''}}.

What is special about a multigraph as an algebra is that its operations are unary.  A multigraph has two sorts of elements forming a set {{mvar|''V''}} of vertices and {{mvar|''E''}} of edges, and has two unary operations {{math|''s'',''t'': ''E'' → ''V''}} giving the source (start) and target (end) vertices of each edge.  An algebra all of whose operations are unary is called a [[presheaf]].  Every class of presheaves contains a presheaf {{math|Ω}} that plays the role for subalgebras that 2 plays for subsets.  Such a class is a special case of the more general notion of elementary [[topos]] as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[closed category|closed]] (and moreover [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]) and has an object {{math|Ω}}, called a [[subobject classifier]].  Although the term "power object" is sometimes used synonymously with [[exponential object]] {{math|''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, in topos theory {{mvar|''Y''}} is required to be {{math|Ω}}.

==Functors and quantifiers==
In [[category theory]] and the theory of [[elementary topos|elementary topoi]], the [[universal quantifier]] can be understood as the [[right adjoint]] of a [[functor]] between power sets, the [[inverse image]] functor of a function between sets; likewise, the [[existential quantifier]] is the [[left adjoint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Saunders Mac Lane]], [[Ieke Moerdijk]], (1992) ''Sheaves in Geometry and Logic'' Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|0-387-97710-4}} ''See page 58''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Powering Past Coal Alliance is a group of over 70 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the phase out of traditional or unabated coal power.

==History==
The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

{{quotation

"Canada and the UK are right to kick-start the Alliance, as science tells us that OECD countries need to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BREAKING: 25 Jurisdictions Join Canada, UK in Coal Phaseout Alliance |url=https://theenergymix.com/2017/11/16/breaking-25-jurisdictions-join-canada-uk-in-coal-phaseout-alliance/ |accessdate=30 September 2018|date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openeduLaunch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canada &amp; UK launch coal phaseout plan |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/environmental-studies/canada-uk-launch-coal-phaseout-plan |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

{{Bayesian statistics}}

The '''principle of maximum entropy''' states that the [[probability distribution]] which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]], in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a [[proposition]] that expresses [[#Testable information|testable information]]).

Another way of stating this:  Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function. Consider the set of all trial probability distributions that would encode the prior data. According to this principle, the distribution with maximal [[information entropy]] is the best choice.

==History==
The principle was first expounded by [[E. T. Jaynes]] in two papers in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.108.171  |mr=96414
|bibcode = 1957PhRv..108..171J }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he emphasized a natural correspondence between [[statistical mechanics]] and [[information theory]]. In particular, Jaynes offered a new and very general rationale why the Gibbsian method of statistical mechanics works. He argued that the [[entropy]] of statistical mechanics and the [[information entropy]] of [[information theory]] are basically the same thing. Consequently, [[statistical mechanics]] should be seen just as a particular application of a general tool of logical [[inference]] and information theory.

==Overview==
In most practical cases, the stated prior data or testable information is given by a set of [[conserved quantities]] (average values of some moment functions), associated with the [[probability distribution]] in question. This is the way the maximum entropy principle is most often used in [[statistical thermodynamics]]. Another possibility is to prescribe some [[symmetries]] of the probability distribution. The equivalence between [[conserved quantities]] and corresponding [[symmetry groups]] implies a similar equivalence for these two ways of specifying the testable information in the maximum entropy method.

The maximum entropy principle is also needed to guarantee the uniqueness and consistency of probability assignments obtained by different methods, [[statistical mechanics]] and [[logical inference]] in particular.

The maximum entropy principle makes explicit our freedom in using different forms of [[prior information|prior data]]. As a special case, a uniform [[prior probability]] density (Laplace's [[principle of indifference]], sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason), may be adopted. Thus, the maximum entropy principle is not merely an alternative way to view the usual methods of inference of classical statistics, but represents a significant conceptual generalization of those methods.

However these statements do not imply that thermodynamical systems need not be shown to be [[ergodic]] to justify treatment as a [[statistical ensemble]].

In ordinary language, the principle of maximum entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most ignorance beyond the stated prior data.

==Testable information==
The principle of maximum entropy is useful explicitly only when applied to ''testable information''. Testable information is a statement about a probability distribution whose truth or falsity is well-defined. For example, the statements

:the [[expected value|expectation]] of the variable ''x'' is 2.87
and
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.6

(where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are probabilities of events) are statements of testable information.

Given testable information, the maximum entropy procedure consists of seeking the [[probability distribution]] which maximizes [[information entropy]], subject to the constraints of the information. This constrained optimization problem is typically solved using the method of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s.

Entropy maximization with no testable information respects the universal "constraint" that the sum of the probabilities is one. Under this constraint, the maximum entropy discrete probability distribution is the [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;p_i=\frac{1}{n}\ {\rm for\ all}\ i\in\{\,1,\dots,n\,\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The principle of maximum entropy is commonly applied in two ways to inferential problems:

===Prior probabilities===
The principle of maximum entropy is often used to obtain [[prior probability|prior probability distributions]] for [[Bayesian inference]]. Jaynes was a strong advocate of this approach, claiming the maximum entropy distribution represented the least informative distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Posterior probabilities===
Maximum entropy is a sufficient updating rule for [[radical probabilism]]. [[Richard Jeffrey]]'s [[probability kinematics]] is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=[[Brian Skyrms|Skyrms, B]] | year=1987 | title=Updating, supposing and MAXENT | journal=Theory and Decision | volume=22 | pages=225–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maximum entropy models===
Alternatively, the principle is often invoked for model specification: in this case the observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Such models are widely used in [[natural language processing]]. An example of such a model is [[logistic regression]], which corresponds to the maximum entropy classifier for independent observations.

===Probability density estimation ===
One of the main applications of the maximum entropy principle is in discrete and continuous density estimation.

Similar to [[support vector machine]] estimators, 
the maximum entropy principle may require the solution to a [[quadratic programming]] and thus provide 
a sparse mixture model as the optimal density estimator. One important advantage of the method is able to incorporate prior information in the density estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==General solution for the maximum entropy distribution with linear constraints==
{{main article|maximum entropy probability distribution}}

===Discrete case===
We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' taking values in {''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}. We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''; that is, we require our probability distribution to satisfy the moment inequality/equality constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i)f_k(x_i) \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the probabilities must sum to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability distribution with maximum information entropy subject to these equality constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(x_i) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m)} \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes called the [[Gibbs distribution]]. The normalization constant is determined by:

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m) = \sum_{i=1}^n \exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x_i) + \cdots + \lambda_m f_m(x_i)\right],&lt;/math&gt;

and is conventionally called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]].  (The [[Pitman&amp;ndash;Koopman theorem]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a sampling distribution to admit [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient statistics]] of bounded dimension is that it have the general form of a maximum entropy distribution.)

The λ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; parameters are Lagrange multipliers. In the case of equality constraints their values are determined from the solution of the nonlinear equations

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of inequality constraints, the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program with linear constraints.&lt;ref name="BK08"/&gt; 
In both cases, there is no [[closed form solution]], and the computation of the Lagrange multipliers  usually requires  [[Numerical analysis|numerical methods]].

===Continuous case===
For [[continuous distribution]]s, the Shannon entropy cannot be used, as it is only defined for discrete probability spaces.  Instead [[E. T. Jaynes|Edwin Jaynes]] (1963, 1968, 2003) gave the following formula, which is closely related to the [[relative entropy]] (see also [[differential entropy]]).

:&lt;math&gt;H_c=-\int p(x)\log\frac{p(x)}{m(x)}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''(''x''), which Jaynes called the "invariant measure", is proportional to the [[limiting density of discrete points]]. For now, we shall assume that ''m'' is known; we will discuss it further after the solution equations are given.

A closely related quantity, the relative entropy, is usually defined as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] of ''m'' from ''p'' (although it is sometimes, confusingly, defined as the negative of this).  The inference principle of minimizing this, due to Kullback, is known as the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence#Principle of minimum discrimination information|Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information]].

We have some testable information ''I'' about a quantity ''x'' which takes values in some [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the [[real numbers]] (all integrals below are over this interval). We assume this information has the form of ''m'' constraints on the expectations of the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e. we require our probability density function to satisfy the inequality (or purely equality) moment constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)f_k(x)\,dx \geq F_k \qquad k = 1, \dotsc,m.&lt;/math&gt;

And of course, the probability density must integrate to one, giving the constraint

:&lt;math&gt;\int p(x)\,dx = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability density function with maximum ''H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' subject to these constraints is:&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;p(x) = \frac{1}{Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m)} m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] determined by

:&lt;math&gt; Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m) = \int m(x)\exp\left[\lambda_1 f_1(x) + \dotsb + \lambda_m f_m(x)\right]\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

As in the discrete case, in the case where all moment constraints are equalities, the values of the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; parameters are determined by the system of nonlinear equations:

:&lt;math&gt;F_k = \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_k} \log Z(\lambda_1,\dotsc, \lambda_m).&lt;/math&gt;

In the case with  inequality moment  constraints the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a [[convex optimization]] program.&lt;ref name="BK11"/&gt; 

The invariant measure function ''m''(''x'') can be best understood by supposing that ''x'' is known to take values only in the [[bounded interval]] (''a'', ''b''), and that no other information is given. Then the maximum entropy probability density function is

:&lt;math&gt; p(x) = A \cdot m(x), \qquad a &lt; x &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a normalization constant. The invariant measure function is actually the prior density function encoding 'lack of relevant information'.  It cannot be determined by the principle of maximum entropy, and must be determined by some other logical method, such as the [[principle of transformation groups]] or [[Marginalization (probability)|marginalization theory]].

===Examples===
For several examples of maximum entropy distributions, see the article on [[maximum entropy probability distribution]]s.

==Justifications for the principle of maximum entropy==
Proponents of the principle of maximum entropy justify its use in assigning probabilities in several ways, including the following two arguments. These arguments take the use of [[Bayesian probability]] as given, and are thus subject to the same postulates.

===Information entropy as a measure of 'uninformativeness'===
Consider a '''discrete probability distribution''' among ''m'' mutually exclusive [[proposition]]s. The most informative distribution would occur when one of the propositions was known to be true. In that case, the information entropy would be equal to zero. The least informative distribution would occur when there is no reason to favor any one of the propositions over the others. In that case, the only reasonable probability distribution would be uniform, and then the information entropy would be equal to its maximum possible value, log&amp;nbsp;''m''. The information entropy can therefore be seen as a numerical measure which describes how uninformative a particular probability distribution is, ranging from zero (completely informative) to log&amp;nbsp;''m'' (completely uninformative).

By choosing to use the distribution with the maximum entropy allowed by our information, the argument goes, we are choosing the most uninformative distribution possible. To choose a distribution with lower entropy would be to assume information we do not possess. Thus the maximum entropy distribution is the only reasonable distribution.

===The Wallis derivation===
The following argument is the result of a suggestion made by [[Graham Wallis]] to E. T. Jaynes in 1962.&lt;ref name=Jaynes2003/&gt; It is essentially the same mathematical argument used for the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics]] in [[statistical mechanics]], although the conceptual emphasis is quite different. It has the advantage of being strictly combinatorial in nature, making no reference to information entropy as a measure of 'uncertainty', 'uninformativeness', or any other imprecisely defined concept. The information entropy function is not assumed ''a priori'', but rather is found in the course of the argument; and the argument leads naturally to the procedure of maximizing the information entropy, rather than treating it in some other way.

Suppose an individual wishes to make a probability assignment among ''m''  [[mutually exclusive]] propositions. She has some testable information, but is not sure how to go about including this information in her probability assessment. She therefore conceives of the following random experiment. She will distribute ''N'' quanta of probability (each worth 1/''N'') at random among the ''m'' possibilities. (One might imagine that she will throw ''N'' balls into ''m'' buckets while blindfolded. In order to be as fair as possible, each throw is to be independent of any other, and every bucket is to be the same size.) Once the experiment is done, she will check if the probability assignment thus obtained is consistent with her information. (For this step to be successful, the information must be a constraint given by an open set in the space of probability measures). If it is inconsistent, she will reject it and try again. If it is consistent, her assessment will be

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{n_i}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition, while ''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of quanta that were assigned to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; proposition (i.e. the number of balls that ended up in bucket ''i'').

Now, in order to reduce the 'graininess' of the probability assignment, it will be necessary to use quite a large number of quanta of probability. Rather than actually carry out, and possibly have to repeat, the rather long random experiment, the protagonist decides to simply calculate and use the most probable result. The probability of any particular result is the [[multinomial distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(\mathbf{p}) = W \cdot m^{-N}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;W = \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!}&lt;/math&gt;

is sometimes known as the multiplicity of the outcome.

The most probable result is the one which maximizes the multiplicity ''W''. Rather than maximizing ''W'' directly, the protagonist could equivalently maximize any monotonic increasing function of ''W''. She decides to maximize

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac 1 N \log W 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dotsb \, n_m!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \log \frac{N!}{(Np_1)! \, (Np_2)! \, \dotsb \, (Np_m)!} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( \log N! - \sum_{i=1}^m \log ((Np_i)!) \right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, in order to simplify the expression, the protagonist takes the limit as &lt;math&gt;N\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. as the probability levels go from grainy  discrete values to smooth continuous values. Using [[Stirling's approximation]], she finds

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{N \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{N}\log W\right) 
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( N\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m Np_i\log (Np_i) \right)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log (Np_i)  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \log N - \log N \sum_{i=1}^m p_i - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= \left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i \right)\log N - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i  \\[6pt]
&amp;= - \sum_{i=1}^m p_i\log p_i \\[6pt]
&amp;= H(\mathbf{p}).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains for the protagonist to do is to maximize entropy under the constraints of her testable information. She has found that the maximum entropy distribution is the most probable of all "fair" random distributions, in the limit as the probability levels go from discrete to continuous.

===Compatibility with Bayes' theorem===
Giffin and Caticha (2007) state that [[Bayes' theorem]] and the principle of maximum entropy are completely compatible and can be seen as special cases of the "method of maximum relative entropy". They state that this method reproduces every aspect of orthodox Bayesian inference methods. In addition this new method opens the door to tackling problems that could not be addressed by either the maximal entropy principle or orthodox Bayesian methods individually. Moreover, recent contributions (Lazar 2003, and Schennach 2005) show that frequentist relative-entropy-based inference approaches (such as [[empirical likelihood]] and [[exponentially tilted empirical likelihood]] – see e.g. Owen 2001 and Kitamura 2006) can be combined with prior information to perform Bayesian posterior analysis.

Jaynes stated Bayes' theorem was a way to calculate a probability, while maximum entropy was a way to assign a prior probability distribution.&lt;ref name=Jaynes1988/&gt;

It is however, possible in concept to solve for a posterior distribution directly from a stated prior distribution using the [[Cross entropy|principle of minimum cross entropy]] (or the Principle of Maximum Entropy being a special case of using a [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] as the given prior), independently of any Bayesian considerations by treating the problem formally as a constrained optimisation problem, the Entropy functional being the objective function.  For the case of given average values as testable information (averaged over the sought after probability distribution), the sought after distribution is formally the [[Gibbs measure|Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution]] the parameters of which must be solved for in order to achieve minimum cross entropy and satisfy the given testable information.

==Relevance to physics==

The principle of maximum entropy bears a relation to a key assumption of [[kinetic theory of gases]] known as [[molecular chaos]] or ''Stosszahlansatz''. This asserts that the distribution function characterizing particles entering a collision can be factorized. Though this statement can be understood as a strictly physical hypothesis, it can also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis regarding the most probable configuration of particles before colliding &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chliamovitch | first1 = G. | last2 = Malaspinas | first2 = O. | last3 = Chopard | first3 = B. | doi = 10.3390/e19080381 | title = Kinetic theory beyond the Stosszahlansatz | journal = Entropy | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | year = 2017| bibcode = 2017Entrp..19..381C | page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18640">'''Relational frame theory''' ('''RFT''') is a [[psychological]] theory of human [[language]]. It was developed originally by [[Steven C. Hayes]] of [[University of Nevada, Reno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=Steven|chapter=A relational control theory of stimulus equivalence.|editors= L. J. Hayes &amp; P. N. Chase|year=1991|title=Dialogues on verbal behavior |pages=19–40|publisher=Context Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been extended in research notably by  [[Dermot Barnes-Holmes]] of [[Ghent University]].{{When|date=January 2017}}

Relational frame theory argues that the building block of human language and higher [[cognition]] is relating, i.e. the human ability to create bidirectional links between things. It can be contrasted with [[associative learning]], which discusses how animals form links between stimuli in the form of the strength of associations in memory. However, relational frame theory argues that natural human language typically specifies not just the strength of a link between stimuli but also the type of relation as well as the dimension along which they are to be related. For example, a tennis ball is not just associated with an orange, but can be said to be the same shape, but a different colour and not edible. In the preceding sentence, 'same', 'different' and 'not' are cues in the environment that specify the type of relation between the stimuli, and 'shape', 'colour' and 'edible' specify the dimension along which each relation is to be made. Relational frame theory argues that while there are an arbitrary number of types of relations and number of dimensions along which stimuli can be related, the core unit of relating is an essential building block for much of what is commonly referred to as human language or higher cognition.

Several hundred studies have explored many testable aspects and implications of the theory&lt;ref name="O'Connor2017"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=O'Connor, M.; Farrell, L.; Munnelly, A. &amp; McHugh, L.|year=2017 |title=Citation analysis of relational frame theory: 2009–2016|journal=Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|volume=6|pages=152–158|doi=10.1016/j.jcbs.2017.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the emergence of specific frames{{clarify|date=January 2018}} in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHugh|first=Louise|author2=Barnes-Holmes|author3=Barnes-Holmes|displayauthors=1|title=Perspective-taking as relational responding: A developmental profile|journal=The Psychological Record|year=2004|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/tpr/vol54/iss1/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; how individual frames can be combined to create verbally complex phenomena such as metaphors and analogies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Ian|last2=Barnes-Holmes|first2=Dermot|title=Understanding metaphor: a relational frame perspective|journal=Behaviour Analysis|year=2001|pmc=2731509|pmid=22478364|volume=24|issue=2|pages=191–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how the rigidity or automaticity of relating within certain domains is related to [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Emma|author2=Barnes-Holmes |title=Developing an implicit measure of disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity: examining the role of implicit disgust propensity and sensitivity in obsessive-compulsive tendencies|pmid=22387628|journal=Journal of Behaviour Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.02.001|volume=43|pages=922–930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In attempting to describe a fundamental building block of human language and higher cognition, RFT explicitly states that its goal is to provide a general theory of psychology that can provide a bedrock for multiple domains and levels of analysis.

Relational frame theory focuses on how humans learn language (i.e., communication) through interactions with the environment and is based on a philosophical approach referred to as [[functional contextualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|last2=Brownstein|first2=Aaron J.|date=1986-01-01|title=Mentalism, behavior-behavior relations, and a behavior-analytic view of the purposes of science|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=9|issue=2|pages=175–190|issn=0738-6729| pmc=2741891|pmid=22478660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
RFT is a [[behaviorism|behavioral]] account of language and higher cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blackledge, J.T.|year=2003|title=An Introduction to Relational Frame Theory: Basics and Applications|journal=The Behavior Analyst Today|volume=3|issue=4|pages=421–34|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bar/3/4/421.html|doi=10.1037/h0099997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1957 book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'', [[B.F. Skinner]] presented an interpretation of language. However, this account was intended to be an interpretation as opposed to an experimental research program, and researchers commonly acknowledge that the research products are somewhat limited in scope. For example, Skinner's behavioral interpretation of language has been useful in some aspects of language training in developmentally disabled children, but it has not led to a robust research program in the range of areas relevant to language and cognition, such as problem-solving, reasoning, metaphor, logic, and so on. RFT advocates are fairly bold in stating that their goal is an experimental behavioral research program in all such areas, and RFT research has indeed emerged in a large number of these areas, including grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Louise McHugh &amp; Phil Reed|year=2008|title=Using Relational Frame Theory to build grammar in children with Autistic Spectrum Conditions|journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=3|issue=2–3|page=241|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/slp/3/1/60.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Skinner's book, linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] argued that the [[generative grammar|generativity]] of language shows that it cannot simply be learned, that there must be some innate "[[language acquisition device]]". Many have seen this review as a turning point, when [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] took the place of [[behaviorism]] as the mainstream in psychology. Behavior analysts generally viewed the criticism as somewhat off point,&lt;ref&gt;For a behavior analytic response to Chomsky, see MacCorquodale (1970), ''[http://www.behavior.org/resources/324.pdf On Chomsky's Review Of Skinner's Verbal Behavior]''&lt;/ref&gt; but it is undeniable that psychology turned its attention elsewhere and the review was very influential in helping to produce the rise of cognitive psychology.

Despite the lack of attention from the mainstream, [[behavior analysis]] is alive and growing. Its application has been extended to areas such as language and cognitive training.&lt;ref name="Cullinan08"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cullinan, V. &amp; Vitale, A.|year=2008|title=The contribution of Relational Frame Theory to the development of interventions for impairments of language and cognition|journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=3|issue=1|pages=122–35|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/slp/3/1/122.pdf&amp;productCode=pa|doi=10.1037/h0100237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis has long been extended as well to animal training, business and school settings, as well as hospitals and areas of research.

RFT distinguishes itself from Skinner's work by identifying and defining a particular type of [[operant conditioning]] known as ''arbitrarily applicable derived relational responding'' (AADRR). In essence the theory argues that language is not associative but is learned and relational. For example, young children learn relations of coordination between names and objects; followed by relations of difference, opposition, before and after, so on. These are "frames" in the sense that once relating of that kind is learned, any event can be related in that way mutually and in combination with other relations, given a cue to do so. This is a learning process that to date appears to occur only in humans possessing a capacity for language: to date relational framing has not yet been shown unambiguously in non-human animals despite many attempts to do so. AADRR is theorized to be a pervasive influence on almost all aspects of human behavior. The theory represents an attempt to provide a more empirically progressive account of complex human behavior while preserving the naturalistic approach of behavior analysis.&lt;ref name="Cullinan08"/&gt;

==Evidence==
Approximately 300 studies have tested RFT ideas.&lt;ref name="O'Connor2017"/&gt; Supportive data exists in the areas needed to show that an action is "operant" such as the importance of multiple examples in training derived relational responding, the role of context, and the importance of consequences. Derived relational responding has also been shown to alter other behavioral processes such as classical conditioning, an empirical result that RFT theorists point to in explaining why relational operants modify existing behavioristic interpretations of complex human behavior. Empirical advances have also been made by RFT researchers in the analysis and understanding of such topics as metaphor, perspective taking, and reasoning.&lt;ref name="Barnes-Holmes04"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Barnes-Holmes, Y.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; McHugh, L.|year=2004 |title=Teaching Derived Relational Responding to Young Children|journal=JEIBI|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–16|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/1/1/3.html|doi=10.1037/h0100275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of RFT often indicate the failure to establish a vigorous experimental program in language and cognition as the key reason why behavior analysis fell out of the mainstream of psychology despite its many contributions, and argue that RFT might provide a way forward. The theory is still somewhat controversial within behavioral psychology, however. At the current time the controversy is not primarily empirical since RFT studies&lt;ref name="Dawson2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawson | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Barnes-Holmes | first2 = D. | last3 = Gresswell | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Hart | first4 = A.J. | last5 = Gore | first5 = N.J. | year = 2009 | title = Assessing the Implicit Beliefs of Sexual Offenders Using the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure: A First Study | url = | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 57–75 | doi = 10.1177/1079063208326928 | pmid=19218478}}&lt;/ref&gt; publish regularly in mainstream behavioral journals and few empirical studies have yet claimed to contradict RFT findings. Rather the controversy seems to revolve around whether RFT is a positive step forward, especially given that its implications seem to go beyond many existing interpretations and extensions from within this intellectual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B.|year=2001|title=Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4RmapzrihAC|isbn=9780306466007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Acceptance and commitment therapy===
RFT has been argued to be central to the development of the psychotherapeutic tradition known as [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]] more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ijpsy.com/volumen4/num2/88.html|title=Why Relational Frame Theory Alters the Relationship between Basic and Applied Behavioral Psychology {{!}} IJPSY|last=Orellana|first=Javier|website=www.ijpsy.com|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the psychologist [[Steven C. Hayes|Steven C Hayes]] was involved with the creation of both [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] and RFT, and has credited them as inspirations for one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Steven C.|date=2004-01-01|title=Acceptance and commitment therapy, relational frame theory, and the third wave of behavioral and cognitive therapies|url=https://zenodo.org/record/850397|journal=Behavior Therapy|volume=35|issue=4|pages=639–665|doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(04)80013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent and exact nature of the interaction between RFT as basic behavioral science and applications such as ACT has been an ongoing point of discussion within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118489857.ch18/summary|title=The Wiley Handbook of Contextual Behavioral Science|last=Barnes-Holmes|first=Yvonne|last2=Hussey|first2=Ian|last3=McEnteggart|first3=Ciara|last4=Barnes-Holmes|first4=Dermot|last5=Foody|first5=Mairéad|date=2015-01-01|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118489857|editor-last=Zettle|editor-first=Robert D.|pages=365–382|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118489857.ch18|editor-last2=Hayes|editor-first2=Steven C.|editor-last3=Barnes-Holmes|editor-first3=Dermot|editor-last4=Biglan|editor-first4=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guilford.com/books/Mastering-the-Clinical-Conversation/Villatte-Villatte-Hayes/9781462523061|title=Mastering the Clinical Conversation: Language as Intervention|website=Guilford Press|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism spectrum disorder===
RFT provides conceptual and procedural guidance for enhancing the cognitive and language development capability (through its detailed treatment and analysis of derived relational responding and the transformation of function) of early intensive behavior intervention (EIBI) programs for young children with autism and related disorders.&lt;ref name="Barnes-Holmes04"/&gt; The Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge (PEAK) Relational Training System is heavily influenced by RFT.&lt;ref name="Reed16"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reed, D.; Luiselli, J.|year=2016 |title=Promoting the emergence of advanced knowledge: A review of peak relational training system: Direct training module by Mark R. Dixon|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=49|issue=1|pages=205-211|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jaba.281|doi=10.1002/jaba.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution science===
More recently, RFT has also been proposed as a way to guide discussion of language processes within evolution science, whether within [[evolutionary biology]] or [[evolutionary psychology]], toward a more informed understanding of the role of language in shaping human social behavior. The effort at integrating RFT into evolution science has been led by, among others, [[Steven C. Hayes]], a co-developer of RFT, and [[David Sloan Wilson]], an evolutionary biologist at [[Binghamton University]]. For example, in 2011, Hayes presented at a seminar at Binghamton, on the topic of "Symbolic Behavior, Behavioral Psychology, and the Clinical Importance of Evolution Science",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/evos/seminars/spring-2011/hayes/ |title=Symbolic Behavior, Behavioral Psychology, and the Clinical Importance of Evolution Science [Abstract] |website=evolution.binghamton.edu |accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Wilson likewise presented at a symposium at the annual conference in Parma, Italy, of the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]], the parent organization sponsoring RFT research, on the topic of "Evolution for Everyone, Including Contextual Psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contextualpsychology.org/evolution_for_everyone |title=Evolution for Everyone, Including Contextual Psychology |website=contextualpsychology.org |accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes, Wilson, and colleagues have recently linked RFT to the concept of a symbotype&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Wilson, D. S.; Hayes, S. C.; Biglan, T., &amp; Embry, D.|year=2014|title=Evolving the future: Toward a science of intentional change. |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=34|pages=395–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an evolutionarily sensible way that relational framing could have developed has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hayes, S. C. &amp; Sanford, B.|year=2014|title=Cooperation came first: Evolution and human cognition.|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=101|pages=112–129.|doi=10.1002/jeab.64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Retirement Syndrome''' is a term coined by clinical professor of Leadership Development at [[INSEAD]], and author, [[Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries|Manfred F.R Kets de Vries]], to describe the difficulties faced by individuals in positions of authority, specifically [[Chief Executive Officer|Chief Executive Officer's]] (CEO's) as they attempt to "let go" at the end of a full career.&lt;ref&gt;Kets de Vries, M. (2003). The Retirement Syndrome:: The Psychology of Letting Go. European Management Journal, 21(6), 707-716.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbornassets.com/brexit-a-step-forward-or-backwards/ The Brexit – A Step Forwards or Backwards?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581485/talion&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome, also classified by Kets de Vries as the "CEO blues", is an insistence by individuals in positions of leadership or authority to remain in power, despite reaching a plateau in their careers. Individuals in this position may experience feelings of having accomplished all that can be accomplished, and a lack of creativity, or lack of lustre in their current position.  Effects are most strongly felt by those who reach a position of power earlier on in their lifetime as they will spend a much greater amount of time on the down slope towards retirement, as opposed to individuals who reach the "top" in their later years.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

Effects may also be credited to a realization by CEO's who have reached this plateau of the losses they may endure upon their retirement including:
* the loss of work
* the loss of health and vitality
* the loss of public exposure and public contact
* loss of influence, power, attention, and admiration
* loss of financial stability

As well as a desire to avoid difficult situations in which they may be required to confront the sacrifices they made on their way to the top -a fulfilling personal life, healthy relationships with spouse, children and friends, and time to develop outside contacts and interests.

== Psychological Effects ==

=== The Physical and Psychological Effects of Aging ===
The physical effects of aging- wrinkles, gray hair, balding, dental problems,  a need for glasses (stronger prescription), are coupled with a self-consciousness about the deterioration of the body. This can lead to a search for outlets that can act as substitutes for attractiveness. For leaders especially, maintaining power may be viewed as a substitute for the attractiveness that has been lost throughout the years. Leaders with narcissistic tendencies, are also more likely to feel the psychological effects of aging as they may experience a heightened sense of injury when the physical effects of aging become apparent.

=== The Experience of Nothingness ===
The Experience of nothingness is felt by individuals facing retirement if they feel as though their leadership is the only thing they have left, and a loss of this leadership would lead to their demise as a "somebody" to a "nobody".  Many individuals in this position often may not have anyone to turn to for emotional support, and will therefore cling to their position of power for as long as possible.

=== The Talion Principle ===
The [[lex talionis]] or talion principle, often referred to as the "[[eye for an eye]]" principle can be applied in the case of individuals facing retirement. This principle established in early Babylonian law, expresses the belief that criminals should be punished exactly as they had inflicted upon their victims. In the case of retirees, paranoia may ensue when it comes time for this shift in power, as they are consciously aware as leaders of the individuals who may attempt to retaliate or take revenge against them for leadership decisions taken during their careers that may have affected the happiness or wellbeing of one or more of these individuals.

=== The Edifice Complex ===
The Edifice Complex is a sense that with retirement comes the end of a legacy. More deeply felt when at the unconscious level, leaving a lasting legacy is equated with defeating death. In a way, difficulty in letting go of this legacy, and a desire to remain in power for as long as possible, may be seen in the broader sense as a difficulty facing mortality. When power begins to shift in the organization, a CEO may go through the stages of anger, sadness, and depression, which can lead to serious second thoughts in their decision to retire their position.  On the other hand, leaders who are committed to their organization and actively try to find a capable successor to carry on after their retirement generally experience less difficulty in letting go.

'''Role-taking theory''', or social perspective taking, is the [[Sociology|sociological]] theory that one of the most important factors in facilitating [[social cognition]] in children is the growing ability to understand others’ feelings and perspectives, an ability that emerges as a result of general cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=Shaffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=D.R.|title=Social and personality development|year=2008|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|location=Belmont, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this process requires that children come to realize that others’ views may differ from their own.&lt;ref name=J1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=D.W.|title=Cooperativeness and social perspective taking|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1975|volume=31|pages=241–244|doi=10.1037/h0076285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Role-taking ability involves understanding the [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] (i.e. relating to moods, emotions, and attitudes) aspects of another person's point of view and differs from [[Perspective-taking|perceptual perspective taking]], which is the ability to recognize another person's visual point of view of the environment.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Furthermore, albeit some mixed evidence on the issue, role taking and perceptual perspective taking seem to be functionally and developmentally independent of each other.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

[[Robert L. Selman|Robert Selman]] is noted for emphasizing the importance of this theory within the field of cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He argues that a matured role taking ability allows us to better appreciate how our actions will affect others,&lt;ref name=[3]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=The relation of role taking to the development of moral judgment in children|journal=Child Development|year=1971b|volume=42|pages=79–91|doi=10.2307/1127066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and if we fail to develop the ability to role take, we will be forced to erroneously judge that others are behaving solely as a result of external factors.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  One of Selman's principal additions to the theory has been an empirically supported developmental theory of role taking ability.

Social cognitive research on children's thoughts about others’ perspectives, feelings, and behaviors has emerged as one of the largest areas of research in the field.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt; Role taking theory can provide a theoretical foundation upon which this research can rest and be guided by and has relations and applications to numerous other theories and topics.

==Selman's theory of role-taking development==
[[Robert L. Selman|Selman]] developed his developmental theory of role taking ability based on four sources.&lt;ref name=[4]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Byrne, D.F. |title=A structural-developmental analysis of levels of role taking in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=803–806|doi=10.2307/1127850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first is the work of Feffer &lt;ref name=[5]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=The cognitive implication of role-taking behavior|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1959|volume=27|pages=152–168|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1959.tb01826.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[6]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|title=Developmental analysis of inter-personal behavior|journal=Psychological Review|year=1971|volume=77|pages=197–214|doi=10.1037/h0029171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Feffer and Gourevitch,&lt;ref name=[7]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feffer|first=M.H.|author2=Gourevitch, V. |title=Cognitive aspects of role-taking in children|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1960|volume=28|pages=383–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1960.tb01627.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which related role taking ability to Piaget's theory of social decentering and developed a projective test to assess children's ability to decenter as they mature.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is the research of Flavell, which studied children's growing abilities to judge other people's conceptual and perceptual perspectives.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The third is the developmental ideas of differentiation, whereupon one learns to distinguish his/her perspective from the perspectives of others, and integration, the ability to relate one's perspective to the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The final source of influence comes from Selman's own previous research where he assessed children's ability to describe the different perspectives of characters in a story.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

One example of Selman's stories is that of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Children are told about Holly, an avid 8-year-old tree climber. One day, Holly falls off a tree, but does not hurt herself. Holly's father sees this and makes Holly promise that she will stop climbing trees, and Holly promises. Later, however, Holly and her friends meet Shawn, a boy whose kitten is stuck in a tree. Holly is the only one amongst her friends who can climb trees well enough to save Shawn's kitten, who may fall at any moment, but she remembers the promise she made with her father. Selman then goes on to ask children about the perspectives of Holly and her father, and each stage is associated with typical responses.

===Stages===
'''Level 0: Egocentric Role Taking''' (ages 3–6, roughly)&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

This stage is characterized by two lacking abilities.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The first is the failure to distinguish perspectives (differentiation).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  More specifically, the child is unable to distinguish between his perspective, including his perspective on why a social action occurred, and that of others. [1] The second ability the child lacks is relating perspectives (integration).&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, children tend to respond that Holly will save the kitten and that the father will not mind Holly's disobedience because he will be happy and he likes kittens. In actuality, the child is displaying his/her inability to separate his/her liking for kittens from the perspectives of Holly and her father.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 1: Subjective role taking''' (ages 6–8, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

Children now recognize that they and others in a situation may have different information available to them, and thus may differ in their views.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In other words, children have matured in differentiation.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The child still significantly lacks integration ability, however: he/she cannot understand that his views are influenced by the views of others, and vice versa, ad infinitum.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child believes that the sole reason for differing social perspectives is because of different information, and nothing else.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when asked if the father would be angry if he found out that Holly climbed the tree again, children might respond, “If he didn’t know why she climbed the tree, he would be angry. But if he knew why she did it, he would realize that she had a good reason,” not recognizing that the father may still be angry, regardless of her wanting to save the kitten, because of his own values, such as his concern for his daughter's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 2: Self-reflective role taking''' (ages 8–10, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The child's differentiation ability matures at this age enough so that he/she understands that people can also differ in their social perspectives because of their particularly held and differing values and set of purposes.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In turn, the child is able to better put him/herself in the position of another person.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now understand that others think about his/her point of view too.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  This allows the child to predict how the other person might react to the child's behaviour.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  What is still lacking, however, is for the child to be able to consider another person's point of view and another person's point of view of the child simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In the Holly dilemma, when children are asked if Holly will climb the tree, they will typically respond, “Yes. She knows that her father will understand why she did it.” This indicates the child is considering the father's perspective in light of Holly's perspective; however, when asked if the father would want Holly to climb the tree, children typically respond that he would not. This shows that the child is solely considering the father's point of view and his worry for Holly's safety.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 3: Mutual role taking''' (ages 10–12, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In this stage, the child can now differentiate his/her own perspective from the viewpoint likely for the average member of the group.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In addition, the child can take the view of a detached third-person and view a situation from that perspective.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In terms of integration, the child can now simultaneously consider his/her view of others and others’ view of the child, and the consequences of this feedback loop of perspectives in terms of behaviour and cognition.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

In describing the result of the Holly dilemma, the child may take the perceptive of a detached third party, responding that “Holly wanted to get the kitten because she likes kittens, but she knew that she wasn’t supposed to climb trees. Holly’s father knew that Holly had been told not to climb trees, but he couldn’t have known about [the kitten].” &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

'''Level 4: Societal role taking''' (ages 12–15+, roughly) &lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

The adolescent now considers others’ perspectives with reference to the social environment and culture the other person comes from, assuming that the other person will believe and act in accord to their society's norms and values.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

When asked if Holly deserves to be punished for her transgression, adolescents typically respond that Holly should not as her father should understand that we need to humanely treat animals.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;

==Evidence for Selman's Stages==
Three studies have been conducted to assess Selman's theory, and all three have shown support for his developmental outline of role taking ability progression. Selman conducted the first study of his own theory using 60 middle-class children from ages 4 to 6.&lt;ref name=[8]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|title=Taking another's perspective: Role-taking development in early childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1971a|volume=42|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1971.tb03765.x|pages=1721–1734}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment, the children were asked to predict and explain their predictions about another child's behaviour in a certain situation. The child participants were given situational information not available to the child they were making behavioural and cognitive predictions about. Results implied a stage progression of role taking ability as a function of age, as theorized by Selman.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

In a second assessment of the theory, Selman and Byrne interviewed 40 children, ages 4, 6, 8, and 10, on two socio-moral dilemmas.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  Children were required to discuss the perspectives of different characters in each dilemma, and results again showed that role taking ability progressed through stages as a function of age.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

The third study assessing Selman's theory was a 5-year longitudinal study of 41 male children on their role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[9]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gurucharri|first=C.|author2=Selman, R.L. |title=The development of interpersonal understanding during childhood, preadolescence, and adolescence: A longitudinal follow-up study|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=924–927|doi=10.2307/1129129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results showed that 40 of the 41 children interviewed followed the stages as outlined by Selman and none skipped over a stage.&lt;ref name=[9] /&gt;

==Relation to other topics==

===[[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]]===
[[Jean Piaget]] stressed the importance of play in children, especially play that involves role taking.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  He believed that role taking play in children&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt; promotes a more mature social understanding by teaching children to take on the roles of others, allowing them to understand that different people can have differing perspectives.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  In addition, Piaget argued that good solutions to interpersonal conflicts involve compromise which arises out of our ability to consider the points of view of others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;
Two of Piaget's fundamental concepts have primarily influenced role taking theory. The first is [[egocentrism]], the mode of thinking that characterizes preoperational thinking, which is the child's failure to consider the world from other points of view.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  The second is decentration, the mode of thinking that characterizes operational thinking, which is the child's growing ability to perceive the world with more than one perspective in mind.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;  In Piagetian theory, these concepts were used to describe solely cognitive development, but they have been applied in role taking theory to the social domain.&lt;ref name=[4] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Piaget's theory and role-taking ability====

Evidence that Piaget's cognitive theories can be applied to the interpersonal aspects of role taking theory comes from two sources. The first is empirical evidence that children's ability to role take is correlated to their IQ and performance on Piagetian tests.&lt;ref name=[10]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pellegrini|first=D.S.|title=Social cognition and competence in middle childhood|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=253–264|doi=10.2307/1130192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Secondly, the two theories have been conceptually linked in that Selman's role taking stages correspond to Piaget's cognitive development stages, where preoperational children are at level 1 or 2, concrete operators are at level 3 or 4, and formal operators are at level 4 or 5 of Selman's stages.&lt;ref name=[11]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keating|first=D.|author2=Clark, L.V. |title=Development of physical and social reasoning in adolescence|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1980|volume=16|pages=23–30|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.16.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this relation, Feffer &lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[6] /&gt; and Feffer and Gourevitch &lt;ref name=[7] /&gt;  have argued that social role taking is an extension of decentering in the social sphere. Selman has argued this same point, also noting that the growth of role taking ability is brought on by the child's decreased egocentrism as he/she ages.&lt;ref name=[8] /&gt;

===[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]]===
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] argued that higher moral development requires role taking ability.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  For instance, Kohlberg's conventional level of morality (between ages 9 and 13, roughly), involves moral stereotyping, empathy-based morality, alertness to and behaviour guided by predicted evaluations by others, and identifying with authority, all of which require role taking.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;

====Evidence for a relation between Kohlberg's stages of moral development and role-taking ability====

Selman tested 60 children, ages 8 to 10, on Kohlberg's moral-judgment measure and two role taking tasks.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;  He found that the development of role taking, within this age range, related to the progression into Kohlberg's conventional moral stage. A retest a year later confirmed Kohlberg's argument, and in general, it was shown that higher moral development at the conventional stage requires children's achieved ability at this age to reciprocally deal with their own and others’ perspectives.&lt;ref name=[3] /&gt;
Mason and Gibbs found that moral judgment development, as measured by Kohlberg's theory, consistently related to role taking opportunities experienced after childhood in adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  This finding supported Kohlberg's view that moral progress beyond his third stage necessitates contact with other perspectives, namely those of entire cultures or political groups, which individuals are likely to encounter as they become adolescents and adults and thus meet many different people in school and the workplace.&lt;ref name=[12]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=M.G.|author2=Gibbs, J.C. |title=Social perspective taking and moral judgment among college students|journal=Journal of Adolescent Research|year=1993|volume=8|pages=109–123|doi=10.1177/074355489381008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation between Kohlberg’s stages, Piaget’s theory, and Selman’s theory===
Kohlberg and Piaget both emphasized that role taking ability facilitates moral development.&lt;ref name=[12] /&gt;  Kohlberg argued that cognitive and role taking development are required but not sufficient for moral development.&lt;ref name=[13]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|title=Cognitive and Perspective-taking Prerequisites for Moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1980|volume=51|pages=131–139|doi=10.2307/1129599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, he maintained that Piaget's cognitive developmental stages underlie Selman's role taking stages, which are subsequently fundamental to his own moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; This predicts that cognition develops first, followed by the corresponding role taking stage, and finally the corresponding moral stage, and never the other way around.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Conceptually, the three processes have been tied together by Walker.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; His reasoning is that cognitive development involves the progressive understanding of the environment as it is. Role taking is a step upon this, which is the recognition that people each have their own subjective interpretation of the environment, including how they think about and behave towards other people. Moral development, the final step, is the grasping of how people should think and behave towards one another.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

Evidence in support of this view comes first from three reviews which showed moderate correlations between Selman's role taking theory, Piaget's cognitive developmental stages, and Kohlberg's moral developmental stages.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; More evidence comes from Walker and Richards's finding that moral development to Kohlberg's stage 4 occurred only for those who already had early basic formal operations according to Piaget's developmental theory, and not for those in an earlier stage.&lt;ref name=[14]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=L.J.|author2=Richards, B.S. |title=Stimulating transitions in moral reasoning as a function of stage of cognitive development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1979|volume=15|pages=95–103|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.15.2.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Paolitto's attempts to stimulate moral development worked only for subjects who already attained the corresponding role taking stage.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Previous research has also shown that short role taking treatments, such as exposing subjects to the role taking reasoning of subjects in one stage higher, can lead to moral development.&lt;ref name=[14] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[15]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keasey|first=C.B.|title=Experimentally induced changes in moral opinions and reasoning|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=30–38|doi=10.1037/h0034210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[16]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tracy|first=J.J.|author2=Cross, H.J. |title=Antecedents of shift in moral judgment|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=26|pages=238–244|doi=10.1037/h0034432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In more general demonstrations of this argument, Faust and Arbuthnot and other researchers have shown that moral development is most probable for subjects with higher cognitive development.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[17]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faust|first=D.|author2=Arbuthnot, J. |title=Relationship between moral and Piagetian reasoning and the effectiveness of moral education|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=435–436|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.4.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a direct investigation of Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument, Walker tested the hypothesis that only children who had attained both beginning formal operations and role taking stage 3 could progress to Kohlberg's moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; 146 grade 4-7 children participated in this study, and the results strongly supported the hypothesis, given that only children who had the beginning formal substage of cognitive development and role taking stage 3 progressed to moral stage 3.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Further support came from the study's demonstration that a short role playing treatment stimulated progress in moral reasoning in a 6-week follow-up retest.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt; Krebs and Gilmore also directly tested Kohlberg's necessary but not sufficient argument of moral development in 51 children, ages 5–14, for the first three stages of cognitive, role taking, and moral development.&lt;ref name=[18]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krebs|first=D.|author2=Gillmore, J. |title=The relationship among the first stages of cognitive development, role-taking abilities, and moral development|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=877–886|doi=10.2307/1129124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results generally supported Kohlberg's view, but not as strongly, given that it was only demonstrated that cognitive development is a prerequisite for role taking development, and not for moral development.&lt;ref name=[18] /&gt; Based on these results, researchers have suggested that moral education programs underlain by Kohlberg's theory must first ensure that the prerequisite cognitive and role taking abilities have developed.&lt;ref name=[13] /&gt;

===[[Prosocial behavior]]===
Role taking ability and prosocial behaviours and feelings have been argued to be related.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Evidence for this claim has been found from many sources. Underwood and Moore have found that perceptual, affective, and cognitive perspective taking are positively correlated with prosocial behaviour.&lt;ref name=[19]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Underwood|first=B.|author2=Moore, B. |title=Perspective-taking and altruism|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1982|volume=91|pages=143–173|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.91.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children trained to improve their role taking ability subsequently become more generous, more cooperative, and more apprehensive to the needs of others in comparison to children who received no role taking training.&lt;ref name=[20]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=J.B.|author2=Townsend, M.A. |title=The effects of training in social perspective taking on socially maladjusted girls|journal=Child Development|year=1990|volume=61|pages=178–190|doi=10.2307/1131057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[21]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iannotti|first=R.J.|title=Effect of role-taking experiences on roletaking, empathy, altruism, and aggression|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1978|volume=14|pages=119–124|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.14.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also shown that people who are good at role taking have greater ability to sympathize with others.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=[22]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S |title=Brazilian adolescents’ prosocial moral judgment and behavior: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the picture is clear: prosocial behaviour is related to role taking ability development and social deviance is linked to egocentrism.&lt;ref name=[23]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandler|first=M.J.|title=Egocentrism and anti-social behavior: The assessment and training of social perspective-taking skills|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1973|volume=9|pages=326–332|doi=10.1037/h0034974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To study one reason for the link between role taking ability and prosociality,  grade 2 children found to be either high or low in role taking were instructed to teach two kindergartners on an arts and crafts task. 16 measures of prosocial behaviour were scored, and high and low role takers diverged on 8 of the measures, including several helping measures, providing options, and social problem solving. Analysis of the results showed that low role takers helped less than high role takers not because of a lack of wanting to help, but because of their poorer ability in interpreting social cues indicating the need for help.&lt;ref name=[24]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hudson|first=L.M.|author2=Forman, E.A. |author3=Brion-Meisels, S. |title=Role taking as a predictor of prosocial behavior in cross-age tutors|journal=Child Development|year=1982|volume=53|pages=1320–1329|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb04171.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, low role takers tended to only be able to recognize problems when they were made plainly obvious.&lt;ref name=[24] /&gt;

Role taking has also been related to [[empathy]]. Batson had participants listen to an interview of a woman going through hardship.&lt;ref name=[25]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D.|author2=Early, S. |author3=Salvarani, G. |title=Perspective taking: Imagining how another feels versus imagining how you would feel|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1997|volume=23|pages=751–758|doi=10.1177/0146167297237008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then instructed participants to imagine how she feels, or, to imagine how they would feel in her situation, and found that both conditions produced feelings of empathy. Schoenrade has found the same result, where imagining how a person in distress feels or how one would feel in that person's situation produces feelings of empathy.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;

Finally, many theorists, including Mead, [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Solomon Asch|Asch]], Heider, Deutsch, Madsen, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] have theorized a relationship between cooperation and role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  In one study, children's predisposition to cooperate was shown to strongly correlate with their affective role taking ability.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  Other researchers have also shown an indirect relationship between cooperation and role taking capacity.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;&lt;ref name=[26]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=H.H.|author2=Stahelski, A. J. |title=Social interaction basis of cooperators' and competitors' beliefs about others|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1970|volume=16|pages=66–91|doi=10.1037/h0029849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Social skills|Social functioning]]===
A child's ability to function in social relationships has been found to depend partially on his/her role-taking ability. For instance, researchers found that children poor in role-taking ability had greater difficulty in forming and sustaining [[Social relation|social relationships]], as well as receiving lower peer nominations.&lt;ref name=[27]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selman|first=R.L.|author2=Jacquette, D. |author3=Lavin, D. R. |title=Interpersonal awareness in children: Toward an integration of developmental and clinical child psychology|journal=[[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]]|year=1977|volume=47|pages=264–274|doi=10.1111/j.1939-0025.1977.tb00981.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis found that role taking ability was positively correlated with social understanding.&lt;ref name=[28]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=M.H.|title=Measuring individual differences in empathy: Evidence for a multidimensional approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1983|volume=44|pages=113–126|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, progress in role-taking ability has shown to be beneficial for one's personal and interpersonal life.&lt;ref name=[20] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[29]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muus|first=R.E.|title=Social cognition: Robert Selman's theory of role taking|journal=Adolescence|year=1982|volume=17|pages=499–525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better functioning in the interpersonal domain is particularly shown in the relation between role-taking ability and social problem solving ability. Role playing has been shown to improve male teenagers’ handling of social problem tasks.&lt;ref name=[30]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsh|first=D.T.|author2=Serafica, F. C. |author3=Barenboim, C. |title=Effect of perspective taking training on interpersonal problem solving|journal=Child Development|year=1980|volume=51|pages=140–155|doi=10.2307/1129600}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gehlbach found a similar supporting result, demonstrating that adolescents with better role taking abilities had superior ability in conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=[31]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gehlbach|first=H.|title=Social perspective taking: A facilitating aptitude for conflict resolution, historical empathy, and social studies achievement|journal=Theory and Research in Social Education|year=2004|volume=32|pages=39–55|doi=10.1080/00933104.2004.10473242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other researchers have also found that role taking ability development positively affects interpersonal problem solving skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[29] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[32]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelsohn|first=M.|author2=Straker, G.|title=Social perspective-taking and use of discounting in children’s perceptions of other’s helping behavior|journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology|year=1999|volume=160|pages=69–83|doi=10.1080/00221329909595381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, role taking can promote better social functioning in the interpersonal domain through smoothening social interactions by improving behavioural mimicking ability.&lt;ref name=[33]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galinsky|first=A.D.|author2=Ku, G. |author3=Wang, C. S. |title=Perspective-taking and self-other overall: Fostering social bonds and facilitating social coordination|journal=Group Process &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2005|volume=8|pages=109–124|doi=10.1177/1368430205051060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training children on role taking ability can improve interpersonal functioning as well. In one study, preschoolers were made to role play interpersonal conflicts using puppets.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Their task at the end was to discuss alternative solutions to the problems and how each solution would affect each character.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Over the 10 weeks that the preschoolers participated in this role playing, their solutions became less [[Aggression|aggressive]] and their classroom [[Adjustment (psychology)|adjustment]] became better.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Moreover, the use of role reversal in interpersonal problem situations has been found to stimulate cooperation, help participants better understand each other and each other's arguments and position, elicit new interpretations of the situation, change attitudes about the problem, and improve perceptions about the other person's efforts at solving the issue, willingness to compromise and cooperate, and trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt;  As a result of this research, it has been suggested that one way to improve cooperative skills is to improve affective role taking abilities.&lt;ref name=J1975 /&gt; 
 
Role taking can also work to decrease [[prejudice]] and [[Stereotype|stereotyping]].&lt;ref name=[34]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C.D. |author2=Polycarpou, M.

==Applications==

===[[ADHD|ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)]]===
Children with ADHD struggle in their social environments, but the social-cognitive reasons for this are unknown.&lt;ref name=[40]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marton|first=I.|author2=Wiener, J. |author3=Rogers, M. |author4=Moore, C. |author5=Tannock, R. |title=Empathy and social perspective taking in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2009|volume=37|pages=107–118|doi=10.1007/s10802-008-9262-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have indicated a difference between children with and without ADHD on their role taking ability, wherein children with ADHD have lower role taking ability, lower role taking use, and slower role taking development than children without ADHD.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;  Given these results, it has been suggested that children with ADHD be trained on role taking to improve their social skills, including their often comorbid oppositional and conduct problems.&lt;ref name=[40] /&gt;

===[[Juvenile delinquency|Delinquency]] and [[Social skills|social-skills training]]===
The relationship between childhood and adolescent [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]] and role taking is considerable. Burack found that maltreated children and adolescents with behavioural problems exhibited [[egocentrism]] at higher levels than non-maltreated children and adolescents who had progressed faster and more expectedly in their role taking development.&lt;ref name=[41]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burack|first=J.A.|author2=Flanagan, T. |author3=Peled, T. |author4=Sutton, H. M. |author5=Zygmuntowicz, C. |author6=Manly, J. T. |title=Social perspective taking skills in maltreated children and adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|pages=207–217|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.207 |pmid=16569161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chandler found that chronically delinquent boys exhibited lower role taking abilities so much so that their role taking ability was comparable to the role taking ability scores of non-delinquent children nearly half their age.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  In turn, one-third of the delinquent boys in this study were assigned to a treatment program designed to improve role taking skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  Post-treatment measures demonstrated that the program successfully induced role taking ability progress in this group, and an 18-month follow-up assessment found a nearly 50% decrease in delinquent behaviours following these progresses in role taking skills.&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;  The same has been found for delinquent girls. Chalmers and Townsend trained delinquent girls, ages 10–16, on role taking skills over 15 sessions, following which the girls demonstrated improved understanding of interpersonal situations and problems, greater empathy, more acceptance of individual differences, and exhibited more prosociality in the classroom.&lt;ref name=[20] /&gt;  The overall picture, then, is that role taking training can help delinquent youth and youth with conduct disorders &lt;ref name=[21] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[23] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[42]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=C.E.|title=The effects of sociodramatic play on problem solving behavior among culturally disadvantaged preschool children|journal=Child Development|year=1974|volume=45|pages=920–927|doi=10.2307/1128077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=[43]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grizenko|first=N.|author2=Zappitelli, M. |author3=Langevin, J.

===[[Autism]]===
Several researchers have argued that the deficits in the social lives, [[communication]] ability, and [[imagination]] of autistic children are a result of their deficiencies in role taking.&lt;ref name=[47]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=E. |author2=Tarbox, J. |author3=O'Hora, D. |author4=Noone1, S. |author5=Bergstrom, R. |title=Teaching children with autism a basic component skill of perspective-taking|journal=Behavioural Interventions|year=2011|volume=26|pages=50–66|doi=10.1002/bin.320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that autistic children's inability to role take prevents them from developing a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=[48]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Mechanical, behavioural and intentional understanding of picture stories in autistic children | journal = [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 113&amp;ndash;125 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | date = June 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-835X.1986.tb01003.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/1986_BC_etal_PictureStoriesInASChildren.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, role taking has been described as the theory of mind in action.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  Failing to role take and failing to develop a theory of mind may lead autistic children to use only their own understanding of a situation to predict others’ behaviour, resulting in deficits in social understanding.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;

In support, two studies found shortcomings in role-taking ability in autistic children in comparison to controls.&lt;ref name=[48] /&gt;&lt;ref name=[49]&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Leslie | first2 = Alan M. | last3 = Frith | first3 = Uta | title = Does the autistic child have a "theory of mind"? | journal = [[Cognition (journal)|Cognition]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | pmid = 2934210 | date = October 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(85)90022-8 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170928145836/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-alan-leslie/publications/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20%26%20Frith%201985.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study found that lower ability in role taking related significantly with the lower [[Social competence|social competency]] in autistic children.&lt;ref name=[50]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=D.P.|author2=Oilendick, T.H. |title=Role taking and social competence in autism and mental retardation|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1989|volume=19|pages=119–127|doi=10.1007/bf02212723}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the autistic children in the study could not focus concurrently on different cognitions required for successful role taking and proficient social interaction.&lt;ref name=[50] /&gt; More specifically, Dawson and Fernald found that conceptual role-taking related most to the social deficits and severity of autism experienced by autistic children, while affective role taking was related only to the severity of autism.&lt;ref name=[51]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=G.|author2=Fernald, M. |title=Perspective-taking ability and its relationship to the social behavior of autistic children|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|year=1987|volume=17|pages=487–499|doi=10.1007/bf01486965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The main criticism of Selman's role-taking theory is that it focuses too much on the effect of [[cognitive development]] on role-taking ability and [[social cognition]], thereby overlooking the non-cognitive factors that affect children's abilities in these domains.&lt;ref name=Shaffer /&gt;  For instance, social experiences, such as disagreements between close friends, have been found to foster role taking skills and social cognitive growth.&lt;ref name=[52]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=J.|author2=Aboud, F.E. |title=The resolution of social conflict among friends|journal=Child Development|year=1985|volume=56|pages=1009–1017|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00173.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, parental influence amongst sibling conflicts matters, as mothers who act as mediators to help solve sibling disagreements have been found to promote role taking skills and social cognitive maturation.&lt;ref name=[53]&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J.|author2=Ross, H. |title=Training parents to mediate sibling disputes affects children’s negotiations and conflict understanding|journal=Child Development|year=2007|volume=78|pages=790–805|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01033.x|pmid=17517005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Scene and sequel''' are two types of written passages used by authors to advance the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[narrative|story]]. ''Scenes'' propel a story forward as the [[character (arts)|character]] attempts to achieve a goal.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"&gt;Swain, p. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sequels'' provide an opportunity for the character to react to the scene, analyze the new situation, and decide upon the next course of action.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The concept of a scene in written [[fiction]] has evolved over many years. [[Dwight V. Swain]], in ''Techniques of the Selling Writer'' (1965) defined a ''scene'' as a unit of [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], an account of an effort to attain a goal despite opposition. According to Swain, the functions of a scene are to provide interest and to move the story forward. The structure of a scene, as described by Swain, is (1) goal, (2) conflict, (3) disaster.&lt;ref name="Swain 84-85"/&gt;

In ''The Art of Fiction'' (1983), John Gardner described a scene as having an unbroken flow of action without a lapse of time or leap from one setting to another.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years, other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of ''scene'', and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obstfeld, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, p. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In addition to defining a scene, Swain described a ''sequel'' as a unit of transition that links two scenes, adding that a sequel functions to translate disaster into goal, telescope reality, and control tempo. Swain also described the structure of a sequel as (1) reaction, (2) [[dilemma]], and (3) decision.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 96, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted to improve on the definition of a ''sequel'' and to explain its use and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Bickham, p. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrell, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive vs. reactive==
Rather than viewing scenes and sequels as distinct types of passages, some authors express the concept as two types of scenes: proactive and reactive.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 61, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingermanson and Economy, p. 168, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenes and sequels==
Swain defined, described, and explained scene and sequel as if they were separate entities, but then he explained that they must complement each other, linking together smoothly into a story. He went on to observe that

*An author controls [[Pace (narrative)|pacing]] by the way he proportions scene to sequel.
*The peaks and valleys in a diagram of a story correspond to scenes and sequels.
*Flexibility is important, versus a mechanical approach.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, p. 113-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural units of fiction== 
The ''structural units of [[fiction writing]]'' comprise all fiction.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"&gt;Klaassen, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*The smallest units of writing are [[word]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, and [[paragraph]]s.
*Two or more paragraphs with some common purpose are referred to as ''passages'' or ''segments'' of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scenes and sequels are specialized passages of writing. A ''scene'' is a passage of writing in which the character attempts to achieve a goal. A ''sequel'' is a passage of writing in which the character reacts reflectively to the previous scene.&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[chapter (books)|chapter]] is a segment of writing delineated by a form of punctuation called a ''chapter break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Prologue]]'' and ''[[epilogue]]'' are two specialized types of chapters.&lt;ref name="Klaassen 3"/&gt;
*A chapter may include one or more ''sections'', passages separated by another form of punctuation called a ''section break''.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeman, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some [[novel]]s, especially long ones, may be further divided into ''books'' or ''parts'', each including two or more chapters.

==Types of passages==
Passages of writing may be classified into four groups: (1) scenes, (2) sequels, (3) passages that are ''neither'' scenes nor sequels, and (4) passages that include elements of ''both'' scenes and sequels. Examples of passages that are neither scenes nor sequels include ''fragments''&lt;ref&gt;Scofield, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;  of scenes or sequels and passages of [[narration]], [[description]], or [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]]. An example of a passage that includes elements of both scenes and sequels is the ''problem-solving passage'', common in [[mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[detective stories]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of scenes==
Scenes may be classified by their position within the story (such as an opening scene or a [[climax (narrative)|climax]] scene). A scene may be classified by the [[fiction-writing mode]] that dominates its presentation (as in an [[action fiction|action]] scene or a [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]] scene). Some scenes have specialized roles (such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes and [[flashforward]] scenes).&lt;ref&gt;Klaassen, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social conflict theory''' is a [[Marxist]]-based [[social theory]] which argues that individuals and [[Social group|group]]s ([[social class]]es) within society interact on the basis of [[social conflict|conflict]] rather than consensus. Through various forms of conflict, groups will tend to attain differing amounts of material and non-material resources (e.g. the wealthy vs. the poor). More powerful groups will tend to use their [[power (social and political)|power]] in order to retain power and exploit groups with less power.

Conflict theorists view conflict as an engine of change, since conflict produces contradictions which are sometimes resolved, creating new conflicts and contradictions in an ongoing [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis|dialectic]]. In the classic example of [[historical materialism]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that all of human history is the result of [[class conflict|conflict between classes]], which evolved over time in accordance with changes in society's means of meeting its material needs, i.e. changes in society's [[mode of production]].

==Example (sample of the following)==

Consider the relationship between the owner of a housing complex and a tenant in that same housing complex. A [[consensus theory|consensus theorist]] might suggest that the relationship between the owner and the tenant is founded on mutual benefit. In contrast, a conflict theorist might argue the relationship is based on a conflict in which the owner and tenant are struggling against each other. Their relationship is defined by the balance in their abilities to extract resources from each other, e.g. rent payments or a place to live. The bounds of the relationship are set where each is extracting the maximum possible amount of resources out of the other.

Conflict can take many forms and involve struggle over many different types of resources, including [[social status|status]]. However, formal conflict theory had its foundations in the analysis of [[class conflict]], and the example of the owner and the tenant can be understood in terms of class conflict. In class conflict, owners are likely to have relative advantages over non-owners. For example, the legal system underlying the relationship between the owner and tenant can be biased in favor of the owner. Suppose the owner wishes to keep the tenant's [[security deposit]] after that tenant has moved out of the owner's residence. In legal systems based on English [[common law]], the owner is only required to notify the tenant that the security deposit is being withheld. To regain the security deposit, the tenant must file a lawsuit. The tenant bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and is therefore required to prove that the residence was adequately cleaned before move-out. This can be a very difficult or even impossible task.

To summarize the example, conflict theorists view the relationship between the owner and tenant as being built primarily on conflict rather than harmony. Even though the owner-tenant relationship may often appear harmonious, any visible harmony is only a product of the law and other elements of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] which constrain the relationship and which are themselves a product of an even deeper conflict, [[class conflict]]. A conflict theorist would say that conflict theory holds more explanatory power than consensus theory in this situation since consensus theory cannot explain lawsuits between owners and tenants nor the legal foundations of the asymmetrical power relationship between the two.

==Social conflict theories==

From a social conflict theorist/marxism point of view social class and inequality emerges because the social structure is based on conflict and contradictions. Contradictions in interests and conflict over scarce resources between groups is the foundation of social society, according to the social conflict theory (Engels &amp; Marx, 1848). The higher class will try to maintain their privileges, power, status and social position - and therefore try to influence politics, education, and other institutions to protect and limit access to their forms of capital and resources. Whereas the lower class - in contradiction to the higher class - has very different interests. They do not have specific forms of capital that they need to protect. All they are interested in is in gaining access to the resources and capital of the higher class. For example, education: the lower class will do everything to gain access to the higher class resources based on democratizing and liberalizing education systems because these forms of capital are thought to be of value for future success. The various institutions of society such as the legal and political system are instruments of ruling class domination and serve to further its interests. Marx believed that western society developed through four main epochs—[[primitive communism]], [[Ancient history|ancient society]], [[feudal society]] and [[capitalist society]]. Primitive communism is represented by the societies of pre-history and provides the only example of the classless society. From then all societies are divided into two major classes—master and slaves in ancient society, lords and serfs in feudal society and capitalist and wage laborers in capitalist society.

[[Max Weber|Weber]] sees class in economic terms. He argues that classes develop in market economies in which individuals compete for economic gain. He defines a class as a group of individuals who share a similar position in market economy and by virtue of that fact receive similar economic rewards. Thus a person's class situation is basically his market situation. Those who share a similar class situation also share similar life chances. Their economic position will directly affect their chances of obtaining the things defined as desirable in their society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sociology: Themes and Perspectives|last = Haralambos, Holborn|first = |publisher = HarperCollins|year = 1995|isbn = 000 3223167|location = Hammersmith|pages = 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symbolic equation''' is the term used in [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] psychoanalysis for states of thinking which equate current objects with those of the past, rather than finding a ''resemblance'' between the two sets.

==Origins==
[[Hanna Segal]] developed the concept of the symbolic equation in the 1950s, during her examination of concrete thinking in the schizophrenic.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots however have been traced back as far as Freud's ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' of 1895, where he noted how a phrase like a 'stab in the heart' could be concretised in terms of the original physical sensations behind it, so that "we find a symbolic version in concrete images and sensations of more artificial turns of speech".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J-M Quinodoz, ''Listening to Hanna Segal'' (2007) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Symbolic equations have been connected to the [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|paranoid-schizoid position]];&lt;ref&gt;J Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (London 2001) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively they can be seen as the result of a failure to make distinctions between self and others, or between real and [[Idealization|idealised]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;R Anderson ed., ''Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion'' (London 1992) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*[[Psychological trauma]] can lead to a collapse of the boundaries between inner and outer worlds, so that anything reminiscent of the trauma becomes by symbolic equation the trauma itself.&lt;ref&gt;F Busch ed., ''Mentalization'' (2011) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*Anxiety in nursing is correlated with the varying ability to relate symbolically to patients: where the latter are seen as symbolising the nurse's own damaged inner objects, care can be provided with manageable anxiety, but where patients are symbolically ''equated'' with parts of the self, anxiety spikes, leading either to despair or to [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] attempts at healing.&lt;ref&gt;M Rustin, ''Social Defences Against Anxiety'' (2014) p. 127-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate usages==
*In classical psychoanalysis, symbolic equation is used merely to specify the object to which a symbol relates, as when [[Otto Fenichel]] write of "the symbolic equation money = feces".&lt;ref&gt;O Fenicjel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[Jacques Lacan]]'s linguistically based [[Symbolic order]], a symbolic equation would mark the presence of (unarticulated) meaning, prior to its entrance into a linguistic code.&lt;ref&gt;M Charles, ''Working with Trauma'' (2011) p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bully: A Discussion and Activity Story''''' is a 40-page children's story and activity book by Rita Y. Toews published in 2003.  The story focuses on giving children a voice as to how [[bullying]] makes them feel, and educates parents on how to handle a bully situation in a positive manner. The book can be used in a classroom, one-on-one with a counsellor or with a parent/caregiver.

== Plot summary ==
Jason is bullied at school by a child who demands his lunch every day.  His mother is informed by the school that he is often hungry and realizes he is being bullied.  She advises Jason they will have to take the problem to the school for help.  Jason resists.  His mother reminds Jason that if the bully isn't stopped he will continue to bully.

== Book layout ==
The story is followed by a question and answer section for children.  The questions help children express their feelings about bullies, and the answers provide practical ways to deal with the problem.  The illustrations for the story can be used as a colouring book while the subject of bullying is discussed.  
 
The adult's section of ''The Bully'' contains a question and answer portion that informs parents and caregivers about [[bullying]].  It also gives effective information for dealing with a bully in a manner that provides a positive role model for children, as well as providing additional resources.

[[File:Full of fresh vitality (2864879525).jpg|thumb|right|Vitality means Life]]
'''Vitality''' is [[life]], life force, [[health]], [[youth]], or ability to live or exist. The word vitality is derived from the Latin word ''vita'', which means "life."

== Jainism ==
According to [[Jain philosophy]], there are ten vitalities or life-principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pujyapada (Shri.)|editor=S. A.

*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13641">'''Workplace deviance''', in [[group psychology]], may be described as the deliberate (or intentional) desire to cause harm to an organization – more specifically, a workplace. The concept has become an instrumental component in the field of [[organizational communication]]. More accurately, it can be seen as "voluntary behavior that violates institutionalized [[Norm (social)|norms]] and in doing so threatens the well-being of the organization".&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin and O'Leary-Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

=== Psychological contract ===
{{Main|Psychological contract}}
Employees often create a set of expectations about their workplace; people tend to make psychological contracts with their organizations. When his or her expectations are not met, the employee may "perceive a psychological contract breach by their employers".&lt;ref name="Chiu"&gt;Chiu and Peng&lt;/ref&gt; This "breach" of the psychological contract then presents potential problems, particularly in the workplace.

Workplace deviance may arise from the worker's perception that their organization has mistreated him or her in some manner. Employees then resort to misbehaving (or acting out) as a means of avenging their organization for the perceived wrongdoing. Workplace deviance may be viewed as a form of negative reciprocity. "A negative reciprocity orientation is the tendency for an individual to return negative treatment for negative treatment".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell and Ambrose&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the maxim "an eye for an eye" is a concept that some employees strongly feel is a suitable approach to their problem. However, what is critical in understanding employee deviance is that the employee perceives being wronged, whether or not mistreatment actually occurred.

=== Abusive supervision ===
{{Main|Abusive supervision}}
Workplace deviance is also closely related to abusive supervision. Abusive supervision is defined as the "subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which their supervisors engage in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; This could be when supervisors ridicule their employees, give them the [[silent treatment]], remind them of past failures, fail to give proper credit, wrongfully assign blame or blow up in fits of temper.&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem like employees who are abused by their supervisor will either directly retaliate or withdraw by quitting the job but in reality many strike out against their employer by engaging in organizational deviant behaviors. Since employees control many of the organization's resources, they often use, or abuse anything they can. This abuse of resources may come in the form of time, office supplies, raw materials, finished products or the services that they provide. This usually occurs in two steps. First step is that commitment is destroyed and employees stop caring about the welfare of the employer. The second step is that the abused employee will get approval (normally implied) of their coworkers to commit deviant acts.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

Workplace experiences may fuel the worker to [[act out]]. Research has been conducted demonstrating that the perception of not being [[respect]]ed is one of the main causes for workplace deviance; workplace dissatisfaction is also a factor. According to Bolin and Heatherly,&lt;ref&gt;Bolin and Heatherly&lt;/ref&gt; "dissatisfaction results in a higher incidence of minor offenses, but does not necessarily lead to severe offense". An employee who is less satisfied with his or her work may become less productive as their needs are not met. In the workplace, "frustration, injustices and threats to self are primary antecedents to employee deviance".&lt;ref&gt;Benner and Robinson&lt;/ref&gt; Although workplace deviance does occur, the behavior is not universal. There are two preventive measures that business owners can use to protect themselves. The first is strengthening the employee's commitment by reacting strongly to abusive supervision so that the employee knows that the behavior is not accepted. Holding the employee at high esteem by reminding them of their importance, or setting up programs that communicate concern for the employee may also strengthen employee commitment. Providing a positive ethical climate can also help. Employers can do this by having a clear code of conduct that is applied to both managers and employees alike.&lt;ref name= "Larsen"/&gt;

== Types==
Workplace deviance may be expressed in various ways. Employees can engage in minor, extreme, nonviolent or violent behavior, which ultimately leads to an organization's decline in productivity. Interpersonal and organizational deviance are two forms of workplace deviance which are directed differently; however, both cause harm to an organization.

=== Interpersonal deviance ===
Interpersonal deviance can occur when misconduct "target(s) specific stakeholders such as coworkers".&lt;ref name="Pulich"&gt;Pulich and Tourigny&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior falling within this subgroup of employee deviance includes gossiping about coworkers and assigning blame to them. These minor (but unhealthy) behaviors, directed at others, are believed to occur as some employees perceive "a sense of entitlement often associated with exploitation".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; In other words, they feel the need to misbehave in ways that will benefit them.

=== Organizational deviance ===
Deviant behavior typically aimed directly at the organization is often referred to as organizational deviance.&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; Organizational deviance encompasses production and property deviance. Workplace-deviant behavior may be expressed as tardiness or excessive absenteeism.&lt;ref name="Everton"&gt;Everton et al&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors have been cited by some researchers as "withdraw(al) behaviors…such behaviors allow employees to withdraw physically and emotionally from the organization".&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Silence ===
{{Main|Employee silence}}
Employee silence is also considered a deviant behavior in the workplace, falling into the realms of both interpersonal and organizational deviance. Silence becomes employee deviance when "an employee intentionally or unintentionally withholds any kind of information that might be useful to the organization".&lt;ref&gt;Tangirala and Ramanujam&lt;/ref&gt; The problem occurs if an employee fails to disclose important information, which detrimentally affects the effectiveness of the organization due to poor communication.

=== Coworker backstabbing ===
{{See also|Office politics}}
Coworker [[backstabbing]] occurs to some degree in many workplaces. It consists of an employee's doing something to another employee to get a "leg up" on the other employee. Strategies used for backstabbing include [[dishonesty]], [[blame]] (or [[false accusation]]), [[discrediting]] others and taking credit for another's work. Motives for backstabbing include disregarding others' rights in favor of one's own gain, [[self-image]] management, [[revenge]], [[jealousy]], and personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Malone&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber loafing ===
{{Main|Cyber loafing}}
A novel form of workplace deviance has emerged in recent years, as technology becomes a bigger part of people's work lives. Internet workplace deviance (or "cyber loafing") has become another way for employees to avoid the tasks at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Zoghbi&lt;/ref&gt; This includes surfing the web and doing non-work-related tasks on the internet such as chatting on social-networking sites, online shopping and other activities.

=== Production deviance ===
All behaviors in which deviant employees partake ultimately have a negative impact on the overall productivity of the organization. For this reason, all are considered production deviance. Production deviance is "behavior that violates formally prescribed organizational norms with respect to minimal quality and quantity of work to be accomplished as part of one's job".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt;

=== Property deviance ===
More serious cases of deviant behavior harmful to an organization concern property deviance. Property deviance is "where employees either damage or acquire tangible assets…without authorization".&lt;ref name="Pulich"/&gt; This type of deviance typically involves theft but may include "sabotage, intentional errors in work, misusing expense accounts", among other examples.&lt;ref name="Everton"/&gt;

=== Other types ===
Deviant behavior can be much more extreme, involving [[sexual harassment]] and even [[workplace violence|violence]]. All these deviant behaviors create problems for the organization. It is costly for an organization to pay employees who are not working efficiently.

==Reducing==

The relationships employees have with their organization are crucial, as they can play an important role in the development of workplace deviance. Employees who perceive their organization or supervisor(s) as more caring (or supportive) have been shown to have a reduced incidence of workplace-deviant behaviors. Supervisors, managers and organizations are aware of this, and "assess their own behaviors and interactions with their employees and understand while they may not intend to abuse their employees they may be perceived as doing so…".&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

'''[[Organizational justice]]''' and the organizational climate are also critical, since the quality of the work experience can impact employee behavior in the workplace. Organizational justice may be organized into three subcategories: procedural, distributive and interactional justice.

* [[Procedural justice]] is concerned with how the decision-making process was made.
* [[Distributive justice]], on the other hand, considers the actual decision.
* [[Interactional justice]] involves the interpersonal relationship and sense of fairness which employees have with supervisors and other authority figures within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Ogbonna&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that procedural justice (combined with interactional justice) is beneficial in reducing workplace-deviant behavior. Employees who are consulted (and given an opportunity to be involved in the decision-making processes at their organization) are less likely to act out, since their voices are valued.

Workplace deviance is a phenomenon which occurs frequently within an organization. Ultimately, it is the managers' and the organization's responsibility to uphold the norms to which the organization wishes to adhere; it is the organization's job to create an ethical climate.&lt;ref name="Litzky"&gt;Litzky et al&lt;/ref&gt; If organizations have authority figures who demonstrate their ethical values, a healthier workplace environment is created. "Research has suggested that managers' behavior influences employee ethical decision-making".&lt;ref name="Litzky"/&gt; Employees who perceive themselves as being treated respectfully and valued are those less likely to engage in workplace deviance.
