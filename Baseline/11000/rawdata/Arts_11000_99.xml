      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17242">'''Aftertaste''' is the [[taste]] intensity of a [[food]] or [[Drink|beverage]] that is perceived immediately after that food or beverage is removed from the mouth.&lt;ref name="neely"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neely|first1=G.|last2=Borg|first2=G.|title=The Perceived Intensity of Caffeine Aftertaste: Tasters Versus Nontasters|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1999|volume=24|issue=1|pages=19–21|doi=10.1093/chemse/24.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aftertastes of different foods and beverages can vary by intensity and over time, but the unifying feature of aftertaste is that it is perceived ''after'' a food or beverage is either swallowed or spat out. The [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] mechanisms of taste (and aftertaste) [[signal transduction]] from the taste receptors in the mouth to the brain have not yet been fully understood. However, the primary taste processing area located in the [[insular cortex|insula]] has been observed to be involved in aftertaste perception.&lt;ref name ="james"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=G. A.|last2=Li|first2=X.|last3=DuBois|first3=G. E.|last4=Zhou|first4=L.|last5=Hu|first5=X. P.|title=Prolonged insula activation during perception of aftertaste|journal=NeuroReport|date=2009|volume=20|issue=3|pages=245–250|doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e32831d2441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal taste perception==
Characteristics of a food's aftertaste are quality, intensity, and duration.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt; Quality describes the actual taste of a food and intensity conveys the magnitude of that taste. Duration describes how long a food's aftertaste sensation lasts. Foods that have lingering aftertastes typically have long sensation durations.

Because taste perception is unique to every person, descriptors for taste quality and intensity have been standardized, particularly for use in scientific studies.&lt;ref name = "just"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Just|first1=T.|last2=Pau|first2=H. W.|last3=Engel|first3=U.|last4=Hummel|first4=T.|title=Cephalic phase insulin release in healthy humans after taste stimulation?|journal=Appetite|date=2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=622–627|doi=10.1016/j.appet.2008.04.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; For taste quality, foods can be described by the commonly used terms "sweet", "sour", "salty", "bitter", "umami", or "no taste". Description of aftertaste perception relies heavily upon the use of these words to convey the taste that is being sensed after a food has been removed from the mouth.

The description of taste intensity is also subject to variability among individuals. Variations of the [[Borg scale|Borg Category Ratio Scale]] or other similar metrics are often used to assess the intensities of foods.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt;&lt;ref name="just" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valentová|first1=H.|last2=Skrovánková|first2=S.|last3=Panovská|first3=Z.|last4=Pokorný|first4=J.|title=Time–intensity studies of astringent taste|journal=Food Chemistry|date=2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=29–37|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scales typically have categories that range from either zero or one through ten (or sometimes beyond ten) that describe the taste intensity of a food. A score of zero or one would correspond to unnoticeable or weak taste intensities, while a higher score would correspond to moderate or strong taste intensities. It is the prolonged moderate or strong taste intensities that persist even after a food is no longer present in the mouth that describe aftertaste sensation.

Foods that have distinct aftertastes are distinguished by their temporal profiles, or how long their tastes are perceived during and after consumption. A sample testing procedure to measure a food's temporal profile would entail first recording the time of onset for initial taste perception when the food is consumed, and then recording the time at which there is no longer any perceived taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DuBois|first1=G. E.|last2=Lee|first2=J. F.|title=A simple technique for the evaluation of temporal taste properties|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1983|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=237–247|doi=10.1093/chemse/7.3-4.237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these two values yields the total time of taste perception. Match this with intensity assessments over the same time interval and a representation of the food's taste intensity over time can be obtained. With respect to aftertaste, this type of testing would have to measure the onset of taste perception from the point after which the food was removed from the mouth.

===Variability of human taste perception===
The categorization of people into "[[Supertaster|tasters]]" or "nontasters" based on their sensitivity to the bitterness of [[propylthiouracil]] and the expression of [[fungiform papillae]] on their tongues has suggested that the variations from person-to-person observed in taste perception are genetically based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=V. B.|last2=Davidson|first2=A. C.|last3=Kidd|first3=J. R.|last4=Kidd|first4=K. K.|last5=Speed|first5=W. C.|last6=Pakstis|first6=A. J.|last7=Reed|first7=D. R.|last8=Snyder|first8=D. J.|last9=Bartoshuk|first9=L. M.|title=Bitter Receptor Gene (''TAS2R38''), 6-''n''-Propylthiouracil (PROP) Bitterness and Alcohol Intake|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research|date=2004|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1629–1637|doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000145789.55183.D4|pmc=1397913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt; If so, then sensations of aftertaste could also be affected by the activities of specific genes that affect an individual's perception of different foods. For example, the intensity of the aftertaste sensations "nontasters" experienced after caffeine consumption was found to diminish faster than the sensations "tasters" experienced.&lt;ref name="neely" /&gt; This may imply that because of their taste bud profiles, "tasters" may be more sensitive to the tastes of different foods, and thus experience a more persistent sensation of those foods' tastes.

==Taste receptor dynamics==
Because a lingering taste sensation is intrinsic to aftertaste, the molecular mechanisms that underlie aftertaste are presumed to be linked to either the continued or delayed activation of receptors and signaling pathways in the mouth that are involved in taste processing. The current understanding of how a food's taste is communicated to the brain is as follows:&lt;ref name ="reed" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reed|first1=D. R.|last2=Tanaka|first2=T.|last3=McDaniel|first3=A. H.|title=Diverse tastes: Genetics of sweet and bitter perception|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|date=2006|volume=88|issue=3|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.05.033|pmc=1698869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Chemicals in food interact with receptors on the [[taste receptor|taste receptor cells]] located on the tongue and the roof of the mouth. These interactions can be affected by temporal and spatial factors like the time of receptor activation or the particular taste receptors that are activated (sweet, salty, bitter, etc.).
# The [[chorda tympani]] (cranial nerve VII), the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (cranial nerve IX), and the [[vagus nerve]] (cranial nerve X) carry information from the taste receptors to the brain for cortical processing.

In the context of aftertaste, the combination of both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent processes have been proposed to explain the signal transduction mechanisms for foods with distinct aftertastes, particularly those that are bitter.&lt;ref name="peri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peri|first1=I.|last2=Mamrud-Brains|first2=H.|last3=Rodin|first3=S.|last4=Krizhanovsky|first4=V.|last5=Shai|first5=Y.|last6=Nir|first6=S.|last7=Naim|first7=M.|title=Rapid entry of bitter and sweet tastants into liposomes and taste cells: implications for signal transduction.|journal=American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology|date=2000|volume=278|issue=1|pages=C17–25|pmid=10644507|doi=10.1152/ajpcell.2000.278.1.c17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The receptor-dependent process is the same as what was described above. However, the receptor-independent process involves the diffusion of bitter, [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] chemicals like [[quinine]] across the taste receptor cell membranes. Once inside the taste receptor cell, these compounds have been observed to activate intracellular [[G protein|G-proteins]] and other proteins that are involved in signaling pathways routed to the brain.&lt;ref name="peri" /&gt; The bitter compounds thus activate both the taste receptors on the cell surface, as well as the signaling pathway proteins in the intracellular space. Intracellular signaling may be slower than taste cell receptor activation since more time is necessary for the bitter compounds to diffuse across the cell membrane and interact with intracellular proteins. This delayed activation of intracellular signaling proteins in response to the bitter compounds, in addition to the extracellular receptor signaling is proposed to be related to the lingering aftertaste associated with bitter foods.&lt;ref&gt;Naim M, Nir S, Spielman AI, Noble AC, Peri I, et al. Hypothesis of receptordependent and receptor-independent mechanisms for bitter and sweet taste transduction: implications for slow taste onset and lingering aftertaste. In: Given P, Parades D, editors. Chemistry of Taste: Mechanisms, Behaviors, and Mimics ACS Symposium Series. Vol. 825. Washington, DC: Am. Chem. Soc; 2002. pp. 2–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of both mechanisms leads to an overall longer response of the taste receptor cells to the bitter foods, and aftertaste perception subsequently occurs.

==Processing in the cerebral cortex==
The primary taste perception areas in the cerebral cortex are located in the insula and regions of the [[Postcentral gyrus|somatosensory cortex]]; the [[nucleus of the solitary tract]] located in the brainstem also plays a major role in taste perception.&lt;ref name ="reed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=G. M.|title=Smell images and the flavour system in the human brain|journal=Nature|date=2006|volume=444|issue=7117|pages=316–321|doi=10.1038/nature05405}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions were identified when human subjects were exposed to a taste stimulus and their cerebral blood flow measured with [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. Although these regions have been identified as the primary zones for taste processing in the brain, other cortical areas are also activated during eating, as other sensory inputs are being signaled to the cortex.

For aftertaste, much is unclear about the cortical processing related to its perception. The first neuroimaging study to evaluate the temporal taste profile of [[aspartame]], an artificial sweetener, in humans was published in 2009.&lt;ref name ="james" /&gt; In it, the insula was observed to be activated for a longer period of time than other sensory processing areas in the brain when the aftertaste profile of aspartame was measured. Subjects were administered a solution of aspartame for a specific amount of time before being instructed to swallow the solution. Functional magnetic resonance images of the blood flow in the subjects' brains were recorded before and after they swallowed the aspartame solution. Before swallowing, the [[amygdala]], somatosensory cortex, [[thalamus]], and [[basal ganglia]] were all activated. After swallowing, only the insula remained activated and the response of the other brain regions was not evident. This suggests that the insula may be a primary region for aftertaste sensation because it was activated even after the aspartame solution was no longer present in the mouth. This finding aligns with the insula's identification as a central taste processing area and simply expands its function. An explanation for less activation of the amygdala was that because it is a reward center in the brain, less reward would be experienced by the subjects during prolonged exposure to the aspartame solution.

==Distinguishing aftertaste and flavor==
[[Flavor]] is an emergent property that is the combination of multiple sensory systems including [[olfaction]], taste, and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensation]].&lt;ref name="stevenson"&gt;Stevenson, R.J. (2009). The psychology of flavour. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; How the flavor of a food is perceived, whether it is unpleasant or satisfying, is stored as a memory so that the next time the same (or a similar) food is encountered, the previous experience can be recalled and a decision made to consume that food. This process of multisensory inputs to the brain during eating, followed by learning from eating experiences is the central idea of flavor processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Small|first1=D. M.|last2=Prescott|first2=J.|title=Odor/taste integration and the perception of flavor|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=2005|volume=166|issue=3–4|pages=345–357|doi=10.1007/s00221-005-2376-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verhagen|first1=J. V.|last2=Engelen|first2=L.|title=The neurocognitive bases of human multimodal food perception: Sensory integration|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date=2006|volume=30|issue=5|pages=613–650|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Richard Stevenson mentions in ''The Psychology of Flavour'' that people often do not realize that a food's flavor can be described by the food's smell, taste, or texture. Instead, he claims, people perceive flavor as a "unitary percept", in which a descriptor for either taste or smell is used to describe a food's flavor.&lt;ref name="stevenson" /&gt; Consider the terms that are used to describe the flavors of foods. For instance, a food may ''taste'' sweet, but often its flavor is described as such while not considering its smell or other sensory characteristics. For example, honey ''tastes'' sweet so its smell is associated with that descriptor, and ''sweet'' is also used to describe its flavor. In fact, sweetness is one of the four basic taste qualities and only comprises part of a food's flavor.

Unlike flavor, aftertaste is a solely gustatory event that is not considered to involve any of the other major senses. The distinction of being based on one (aftertaste) versus multiple (flavor) sensory inputs is what separates the two phenomena.

==Foods with distinct aftertastes==
===Artificial sweeteners===
Low-calorie artificial sweeteners like [[saccharin]] and [[Acesulfame potassium|acesulfame-K]] are known for their bitter aftertastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhn|first1=C.|last2=Bufe|first2=B.|last3=Winnig|first3=M.|last4=Hofmann|first4=T.|last5=Frank|first5=O.|last6=Behrens|first6=M.|last7=Lewtschenko|first7=T.|last8=Slack|first8=J. P.|last9=Ward|first9=C. D.|last10=Meyerhof|first10=W.|title=Bitter Taste Receptors for Saccharin and Acesulfame K|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=2004|volume=24|issue=45|pages=10260–10265|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1225-04.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, GIV3727 (4-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl) butanoic acid), a chemical that blocks saccharin and acesulfame-K activation of multiple bitter [[taste receptor]]s has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slack|first1=J. P.|last2=Brockhoff|first2=A.|last3=Batram|first3=C.|last4=Menzel|first4=S.|last5=Sonnabend|first5=C.|last6=Born|first6=S.|last7=Galindo|first7=M. M.|last8=Kohl|first8=S.|last9=Thalmann|first9=S.|last10=Ostopovici-Halip|first10=L.|last11=Simons|first11=C. T.|last12=Ungureanu|first12=I.|last13=Duineveld|first13=K.|last14=Bologa|first14=C. G.|last15=Behrens|first15=M.|last16=Furrer|first16=S.|last17=Oprea|first17=T. I.|last18=Meyerhof|first18=W.|title=Modulation of Bitter Taste Perception by a Small Molecule hTAS2R Antagonist|journal=Current Biology|date=2010|volume=20|issue=12|pages=1104–1109|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.04.043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, the addition of the bitter taste [[receptor antagonist]] GIV3727 to the saccharin and acesulfame-K solutions resulted in significantly lower taste intensity ratings when compared to the solutions that were not treated with GIV3727. This suggests that GIV3727 inhibits the normal functions of the bitter taste receptors because saccharin and acesulfame-K's bitter aftertastes were not observed. The ability to inhibit activation of the bitter taste receptors can have far-reaching effects if the bitter aftertastes of not only these two artificial sweeteners but also other foods, beverages, and even pharmaceuticals can be minimized.

===Wine===
In [[wine tasting]] the aftertaste or ''finish'' of a wine, is an important part of the evaluation.&lt;ref name ="wine" &gt;Stone, H, &amp; L., J. (2004). Sensory evaluation practices. Amsterdam: Elsevier Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After tasting a wine, a taster will determine the wine's aftertaste, which is a major determinant of the wine's quality. The aftertaste of a wine can be described as bitter, persistent, short, sweet, smooth, or even non-existent. Included in assessing the aftertaste of a wine is consideration of the aromas still present after swallowing. High quality wines typically have long finishes accompanied by pleasant aromas.&lt;ref name="wine" /&gt; By assessing the combination of olfactory and aftertaste sensations, wine tasting actually determines not only the aftertaste profile of a wine, but its flavor profile as well.

'''Aitysh Public Fund''' is a charitable organization, which aims to promote and develop culture throughout [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Founded by public figure, producer and director [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] in 2001 in the capital of [[Bishkek]], the structure of the Fund consists of the Union of Improvised Singing ‘Aitysh’, Film Production Company ‘[[Aitysh Film]]’, [[International Film Festival Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films|International Film Festival "Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films"]], [http://manascinema.kg Manas Cinema]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.kg/ru/news/35041/&lt;/ref&gt; network and Literary Organization ‘Kalemger’.

== History ==

The idea of creating Aitysh Public Fund was born in 1998 as at this time the art of traditional improvised singing was poorly developed throughout the country.

In 2001, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] established the Fund to support young singing improvisers and to restore the former greatness of this [[traditional art]] known as ‘Aitysh’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msn.kg/showwin.php?type=newsportal&amp;id=7914&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.for.kg/news-207706-ru.html&lt;/ref&gt; Together with such well-known singing improvisers as Ashyraly Aytaliev, [[:ru:Турсуналиев,_Эстебес|Estebes Tursunaliev]] and Tuuganbay Abdiev, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] established a school for young singing improvisers. By 2014, the school had approximately 30 students.

In 2003, the singing improvisers were included in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]] of Humanity. The Head of [[UNESCO]], [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], gave special thanks to the founder, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]], for his contribution to world culture.

In 2004, the [[NTV (Russia)|Russian NTV]] television channel devoted a programme&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq_3pweyKI0&lt;/ref&gt; to Aitysh Public Fund and the art of improvised singing and in 2005, the largest US newspaper ‘[[The Washington Post]]’ published an article&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html&lt;/ref&gt; about this tradition.

The Fund has helped to establish new, talented singing improvisers such as Amantay Kutmanaliev, Jenishbek Toktobek, Elmirbek Imanaliev, Aaly Tutkuchev, Azamat Bolgonbaev. In addition, the Fund has contributed to the resumption of cultural unity between [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] through international competitive concerts.

Later Aitysh Public Fund started to promote the development of other spheres of Kyrgyz culture and from 2004 to launch new cultural projects.

== Activities ==

Since 2001, Aitysh Public Fund has organized and sponsored:

* competitive concerts for singing improvisers 2-3 times per year, with a prize fund of one million Kyrgyz som
* [[charity concert]]s, cultural events and celebrations of the anniversaries of eminent singing improvisers
* [[Film Festivals|film festivals]], film screenings and other events in the field of [[Film|cinema]].

The fund also supports the release, presentation and distribution of publications, video and audio materials, the authors of which include singing improvisers and others.

In 2004, due to the large interest in the art of improvised singing among the population, the first public TV channel [[Kyrgyz Television|Public Television Radio Corporation]] (PTRC) and the second channel ElTR began live broadcasts of the competitive concerts.

Regular partners include the Ministry of Culture of the [[Kyrgyz Republic]], International Humanitarian Cooperation Fund, [[:ru:Платформа_Диалог_Евразия|The Platform ‘Dialogue Eurasia’]], Kyrgyzfilm and [[International PEN Club|International PEN]].

== Projects ==

In 2001, in order to promote the development of the traditional art of improvised singers, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] founded a school for young singing improvisers.

In December 2004, he also founded the literary organization ‘Kalemger’. The purpose of the organization is to support young, talented writers in Kyrgyzstan. Several collections of member’s work have been released, as well as dozens of periodic anthologies.

In 2006, [[Sadyk Sher-Niyaz]] founded the film production company ‘[[Aitysh Film]]’. The main objective of the film company is the development of Kyrgyz cinema by supporting the creativity of talented young people. [[Aitysh Film]] produces [[art-house]], [[animation]] and [[Documentary film|documentary]] films.

[[International Film Festival Kyrgyzstan - Land of Short Films|‘Kyrgyzstan – Land of Short Films’]], an annual International Film Festival for [[short films]] from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], has been held in [[Bishkek]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] since 2011. Traditionally, the festival opens on 12 December and lasts 4 days. The opening date of the festival marks the birthday of the famous Kyrgyz author [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], who died in 2008.  Aitmatov was also a [[screenwriter]] and former Head of the Union of Filmmakers of [[Kyrgyzstan]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Always Hiding''''' is a novel written by [[Filipino-American]] novelist [[Sophia Romero]]. Published by the [[William Morrow and Company]] in March/April 1998, the 272-page [[Philippine English|English-language]] novel's title was the translation of the [[Tagalog-language]] phrase ''"Tago nang tago"''. Abbreviated as "TNT", the phrase is a [[moniker]] for "an [[Alien (law)|illegal alien]] in the United States" who always has to hide and be cautious in his/her movements so as not to be found and caught by [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|immigration authorities]].&lt;ref name=Amazon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Always-Hiding-Sophia-G-Romero/dp/0688156320|title=Always Hiding: A Novel by Sophia G. Romero|accessdate=16 June 2011|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagalog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagalogtranslate.com/astore/tagalogtranslatecom-20/detail/0688156320/|title=Always Hiding: A Novel by Sophia G. Romero|accessdate=16 June 2011|publisher=Tagalog Dictionary Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The main protagonist in Romero's novel is Violetta Rosario "Viola" Dananay. Viola narrates her life in the [[Philippines]] and her eventual move to the United States. Viola was conceived before the marriage of her parents who belong to Manila's socialite class. Viola grew up in Manila during the regime of former [[Philippine president]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Her life was complicated by her quarrelsome parents. One of the main reasons for the disagreements between Viola's parents was her father's reputation as a [[promiscuity|womanizer]] and [[adultery|philanderer]]. Viola's father left the family to live with a pregnant mistress. Viola's mother, Ludy, left for the United States to escape the indiscretions of her husband, leaving Viola behind. Upon arrival in America, Viola's mother became an undocumented immigrant working as a maid in New York City. After the fall of the Marcoses, Viola's father was implicated in charges of [[Corruption in the Philippines|corruption]] committed by the Marcos government. Viola's father decided to send Viola, already a teenager, to the United States to live with her mother.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt; Viola obeyed her father but with a "secret agenda": to return to the Philippines together with her mother.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;

==Analysis==
According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' the female character and narrator Viola felt inferior and “morally rudderless”, without direction because of her physical features, comparing herself from the Caucasian features of the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]]. She was a teenage protagonist that “never seems to grow up” or mature, self-centered, and a person who suffered from “shallow self-dramatizations”. ''[[Booklist]]'' described Viola as a young woman focused on her own feelings of recklessness and abandonment, and "couched" or stuck in using "stolen" [[American-English|American]] phrases&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt; but with a firm grip of [[Filipino values]].&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt;  Although “smoothly but predictably written” and “with blatant symbolism”, the author of ''Always Hiding'' was not able to “fully exploit her plot’s full potential [[resonance]]”. One particular example was that Romero was able to present the evident parallels between the political and personal circumstances that ruined Viola’s family, as well as the situations that divided the Philippines, but Romero was not able to utilize such conditions in order to make the story line reverberate further. Thus, Romero (a [[Filipino American]]) was not able to reveal enough of the [[Filipino-American]] experience or the contributions of the Filipino immigrant to the [[history of the United States]].&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt; Romero was also not able to provide Viola, the character, with the “dignity” of an “unsympathetic heroine”. Despite this [[literary criticism]], the ''[[Library Journal]]'' described ''Always Hiding'' as a novel "about family, love, honor, and modern Filipino life”&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt; in the Philippines and in the United States.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;  According to ''Booklist'', there were abrupt changes in the direction of the plot and the dialogue between the characters reflects the "tumultuous feelings" of the young heroine, but the author was able to maintain her emotional closeness to the reader.&lt;ref name=Tagalog/&gt; The novel brings “sparkling humor and fresh perspective” and a portrayal of “[[A Dangerous Life|dangerous situations]]” that reveals the strength and potency of the characters, not their fear and apprehension.&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt;

[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Minerve et Arachne (Versailles).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Minerva]] and Arachne'', [[René-Antoine Houasse]], 1706]]

In [[Greek mythology]] (and later [[Roman mythology]]), '''Arachne''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|æ|k|n|iː}}; from {{lang-grc-gre|ἀράχνη}} "spider", cognate with [[Latin]] ''[[araneus]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; was a talented mortal weaver who challenged [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom and crafts, to a weaving contest; this [[hubris]] resulted in her being transformed into a [[spider]]. There are many versions of the story's weaving contest, with each saying that one or the other won.

== Biography ==
Arachne was a [[Lydians|Lydian]] maiden who was the daughter of [[Idmon]] of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], who was a famous dyer in purple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 6. 8&lt;/ref&gt; She was credited to have invented linen cloth and nets while her son Closter introduced the use of spindle in the manufacture of wool. She was said to have been a native of [[Hypaepa|Hypæpæ]], near Colophon in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=7:chapter=57&amp;highlight=arabus#note10 Book 7.56.3];'' According to Justin, B. ii. c. 6, the Athenians introduced the use of wool among their countrymen; but it has been supposed that they learned it from the Egyptians. As we have sufficient evidence that linen was manufactured by the Egyptians at a very early period, we may presume that this account of Arachne is either fabulous, or that, in some way or other, she was instrumental in the introduction of linen into Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

===Ovid's version===
[[File:Antonio Tempesta Arachne.jpg|thumb|''[[Athena]] and Arachne'' ([[Antonio Tempesta]])]]

One version appears in the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of the Roman poet [[Ovid]].

In this version, Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than that of Athena, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, in part at least, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned: "You can never compare to any of the gods. Plead for forgiveness and Athena might spare your soul."

"Ha! I only speak the truth and if Athena thinks otherwise then let her come down and challenge me herself," Arachne replied. Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white chiton. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods. Arachne's weaving depicted ways that the gods had misled and abused mortals, particularly Zeus, tricking and seducing many women. When Athena saw that Arachne had not only insulted the gods but done so with a work far more beautiful than Athena's own, she was enraged. She ripped Arachne's work to shreds and hit her on the head three times. Terrified and ashamed, Arachne hanged herself. Then Athena said, "Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless in
future, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!" After saying this she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate's herb, and immediately at the touch of this dark poison, Arachne's hair fell out. With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny. Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kline|first1=A.S,|title=Ovid - the Metamophoses|url=http://tikaboo.com/library/Ovid-Metamorphosis.pdf|website=Tikaboo|publisher=A.S. kline|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed how goddesses punished mortals who dared to insult them.

==Influence==
[[File:Velazquez-las hilanderas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|''The Spinners, or, The Fable of Arachne'']] (1644–48) by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]].]]
The [[Linnaean taxonomy|taxonomical]] class name ''[[Arachnida]]'' and the name for spiders in many [[romance languages]] are both derived from ''arachne''.

The metamorphosis of Arachne in Ovid's telling furnished material for an episode in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s mock-heroic ''[[Muiopotmos]]'', 257–352.&lt;ref&gt;Written c. 1590 and published in ''[[Complaints (Spenser)|Complaints]]'', 1591. Spenser's allusion to Arachne in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', ii, xii.77, is also noted in Reed Smith, "The Metamorphoses in ''Muiopotmos''" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''28'''.3 (March 1913), pp. 82-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Spenser's adaptation, which "rereads an Ovidian story in terms of the Elizabethan world" is designed to provide a rationale for the hatred of Arachne's descendent Aragnoll for the butterfly-hero Clarion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Brinkley, "Spenser's ''Muiopotmos'' and the Politics of Metamorphosis" ''[[ELH]]'' '''48'''.4 (Winter 1981, pp. 668-676) p 670. Brinkley makes a case for Spenser's episode as political allegory of Elizabeth's court.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] uses Arachne in [[Inferno_(Dante)#Seventh_Circle_(Violence)|Canto XVII]] of ''[[Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]'', the first part of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', to describe the horrible monster [[Geryon]]. "... his back and all his belly and both flanks were painted arabesques and curlicues: the Turks and Tartars never made a fabric with richer colors intricately woven, nor were such complex webs spun by Arachne."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri]], ''The Divine Comedy, Volume 1: Inferno''. Canto XVII, lines 15-18 (pp. 223-224). Translated by Mark Musa.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tale of Arachne inspired one of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]' most factual paintings: ''[[Las hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]'' ("The Spinners, or The fable of Arachne", in the [[Prado]]), in which the painter represents the two important moments of the myth. In the front, the contest of Arachne and the goddess (the young and the old weaver), in the back, an ''Abduction of Europa'' that is a copy of [[Titian]]'s version (or maybe of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]' copy of Titian). In front of it appears Minerva (Athena) at the moment she punishes Arachne. It transforms the myth into a reflection about creation and imitation, god and man, master and pupil (and therefore about the nature of art).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La légende d'Arachné|url=http://www.cineclubdecaen.com/peinture/peintres/velazquez/arachne.htm|accessdate=20 February 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that [[Jeremias Gotthelf]]'s nineteenth century novella, ''[[The Black Spider]]'', was heavily influenced by the Arachne story from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Gallagher, "The Transmission of Ovid's Arachne Metamorphosis in Jeremias Gotthelf's Die Schwarze Spinne"'', Neophilologus ''(2008) 92: 699-711&lt;/ref&gt; In the novella, a woman is turned into a venomous spider having reneged on a deal with the devil.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Pendule met Arachne en Athene - Meissen porselein 001.JPG|thumb|Pendule with Arachne and Athena in [[Meissen porcelain]], attributed to Johann Gottlieb Kirchner and George Fritzsche (1727)]]
Arachne has had a considerable degree of influence on modern popular culture. She frequently appears in modern [[fantasy]] books, movies, and television series in the form of a monstrous spider. In ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', she is pictured as a grotesque, half-woman, half-spider monster who nests on people to produce killer spiders. She is the central character in the 2011 novel ''The Spider Goddess'' by [[Tara Moss]]. In ''[[Class of the Titans]]'', Arachne is changed into a giant spider and makes a deal with Cronus to become human again. Cronus does not hold up the end of his bargain though and betrays her after getting her to trap the heroes for him. After being berated by Atlanta, Athena turns Arachne back into a human, and she is allowed to live at the Olympus High School, weaving for the gods.

In the 13th episode from season 6 of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', "Unforgiven", the monster of the week is an Arachne, depicted as a humanoid monster with spider-like attributes and abilities, including the ability to weave strong webs and a poisonous bite that can turn other humans into Arachnes. They can only be killed by decapitation and before one appeared in [[Bristol, Rhode Island]] hadn't been seen in 2,000 years. While soulless, [[Sam Winchester]] hunted one, but was unaware that it had turned its victims into Arachnes as well. One of the turned victims comes back for revenge and Sam is forced to kill him. 

Arachne is also featured in the ''[[Percy Jackson]]'' and ''[[Heroes of Olympus]]'' series. All of Athena's children, including Annabeth Chase, are arachnophobic because of Arachne's dispute with Athena. Arachne appears towards the end of ''[[The Mark of Athena]]'' as a large spider while still maintaining human features. She is defeated by Annabeth because of her pride and eventually they are both sent falling into [[Tartarus]], where Percy Jackson kills Arachne.

In the novel ''[[The Last Unicorn]]'' written by [[Peter S. Beagle]], a plain brown spider is bewitched into believing that she is Arachne until the witch who enchanted her is killed. She is mentioned to be one of the creatures in Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival. The book describes Arachne as "'...the greatest weaver in the world—her fate's the proof of it. She had the bad luck to defeat the goddess Athena in a weaving contest. Athena was a sore loser, and Arachne is now a spider, creating only for Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, by special arrangement. Warp of snow and woof of flame, and never any two the same. Arachne.'"&lt;ref&gt;Beagle, Peter Soyer. The Last Unicorn. 1968. New York, Penguin Group, 1991. [Page 21.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marvel Comics]], Arachne is the name used by the second Spider-Woman ([[Julia Carpenter]], currently the new Madame Web) to distinguish herself from [[Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman. In Volume 3 of ''[[Monster Musume]]'', an Arachne (a human female from the hips upward and the body/legs of a spider) named Rachnera Arachnera is introduced; she goes on to become a member of the "Monster Girl" household in Volume 4. Arachne Gorgon is a powerful witch and one of the main antagonists of ''[[Soul Eater (manga)|Soul Eater]]''. She was responsible for crafting the first demon weapons, an act that [[Death (personification)|Death]] fiercely opposed, forcing her to bide her time and remain in hiding for 800 years. She returns to lead the risen Arachnaphobia, her personal army against Death.

The story of Arachne has also been adapted for many plays. She is the inspiration for a character featured in the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''. ''Arachne: Spider Girl!'' is a play for children based on the myth by [[Ursula Dubosarsky]],  first published in the NSW [[School Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Arachne-Spider-Children-Metamorphoses-ebook/dp/B00AA7IGJU |title=Arachne: Spider Girl! (Plays for Children based on Ovid's Metamorphoses Book 8) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustave Doré]]'s illustration of Arachne's punishment in [[Purgatory]] for Dante's ''[[Purgatorio]]'' has had a surprising number of pop culture appearances. It is one of the many recurring images used by the rock band, [[The Mars Volta]]; it has been used in the cover of their ''[[Live (The Mars Volta EP)|Live]]'' EP, as a backdrop for their live shows, and a favorite accessory for guitarist and composer [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] in the form of a belt buckle. [[Eminem]]'s 2013 music video for the song "Rap God" features imagery from Dante's ''Purgatorio'', including the illustration of Arachne. (This is most likely a metaphor for the rappers who try to compete with the self-proclaimed "Rap God").

On Episode 245 of the Comedy Bang! Bang! Podcast, Comedian Neil Campbell references Arachne and Athena's rivalry during a freestyle rap battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/earwolf/clip-scott-aukerman-amy-1|title=Clip: Scott Aukerman, Amy Poehler, Paul F. Tompkins, Neil Campbell - Freestyle Rap Battle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/episode/poehler-ice-caps/|title=Poehler Ice Caps, episode #245 of Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast on Earwolf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the popular MOBA game, ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'', Arachne is listed as a playable deity in the Greek pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smitegame.com/gods/arachne/|title=Arachne|website=SMITE|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short story "More Spinned Against" [[John Wyndham]] tells of how Arachne finds herself in the clutches of a spider-obsessed collector and of the deal she makes with the collector's wife Lydia.

[[Art theft]] and [[looted art|looting]] occurred on a massive scale during [[World War II]]. It originated with the policies of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries, primarily [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Japan]], which systematically looted occupied territories. Near the end of the war the [[Soviet Union]], in turn, began looting reclaimed and occupied territories. "The grand scale of looted artwork by the Nazis has resulted in the loss of many pieces being scattered across the world." (Minyard, 2007)

Although the looting of "cultural heritage" of the German people and private collectors was not permitted in the 1945 agreement of Yalta, following the defeat of Germany by the Allied forces the following goods disappeared: three truckloads of precious art, which was listed in a confiscated list by the US forces (in the mine Merker in Thuringia), and one trainload of 20 wagons loaded with artwork and jewels from Hungary (named the "gold train").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to a 2001 ''Der Spiegel'' article,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} the artwork is suspected to be in the US and has never been officially declared. The lost artworks from the "Grube Merker," about 450 pictures, are not found in any museum and thought to have been sold privately.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An attempt by the US to confiscate more German art by requesting 202 precious pictures to be taken was prevented by [[Walter Farmer]] on 6 November 1945, an art protection officer in Wiesbaden leading the central art collection store.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Although against his direct orders from the US, he assembled 24 colleagues from Germany and Austria and successfully prevented the removal of the pictures (named as operation "Westward Ho").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19438032.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Before his death in 1997, Farmer was awarded Germany's highest civilian honor, the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit, for his work in returning the 202 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Walter Farmer. The Economist; London Vol. 344, Iss. 8031, Anonymous (Aug 23, 1997): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Art as Politics in the Third Reich'' by [[Jonathan Petropoulos|Jonathan Petropoulus]] he outlines how there is a need for further cooperation by smaller art galleries to recover art that they may be holding and not know who it belongs to. He says that there are still many tens of thousands of pieces of art missing today, but there is still more research to be done to get a more accurate number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|last=Petropoulos|first=Jonathan|publisher=Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large plan was drafted by the Nazis for much of the stolen art to be featured in a so-called [[Fuhrermuseum|Führermuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism &lt;/ref&gt; which would display much of the art plundered by the Nazis. This museum would feature works that were not considered to be "[[degenerate art]]" and would instead solely focus on the aesthetics that Hitler considered to be "good", and was to be created in the city of [[Linz]]. However, this museum was never created, and much of the art that may have been on display there is still missing today.  The Nazis were so vehemently against the loss of the art that they had plundered for this museum that there was a plan to destroy a stockpile of art saved for the Führermuseum at the [[Altaussee]] salt mines, which held over 12000 pieces of stolen art, using eight 500-kilogram bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edsel |first1=Robert M. |title=The Monuments Men |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Hachette/Center Street |isbn=978-1-59995-149-2 |pages=303-306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless pieces of art were stolen during the Holocaust and many were destroyed.  The Nazis were relentless in their efforts to get rid of the Jewish people and their culture. Paintings that had been passed down from generation to generation were taken and destroyed. This was extremely emotionally hard for many Jewish families because it was not only an attack on their families and culture, but also on their history. There have barely been any efforts of restitution. Many of the families who lost art are simply now left with claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willi|first1=Korte|title=Nazi Looted Art: The Case of the Missing Perspective|journal=First Person Singular|date=September 1, 2006|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary problems encountered by individuals pursuing claims is that it is difficult to locate the necessary documentation on provenance. Organizations with information on a piece's history, museums in particular, often have a disincentive to share information that could assist in an heir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foulkes|first=Lucia|date=2015|title=The art of atonement: how mandated transparency can help return masterpieces lost during World War II|url=|journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7369">[[File:Description of Wave by Monica Bonadies Hansel.pdf|thumbnail|Artist's statement by artist Monica Bonadies]]
An '''artist's statement''' (or '''artist statement''') is an artist's written description of their work. The brief verbal representation is for, and in support of, his or her own work to give the viewer understanding. As such it aims to inform, connect with an art context, and present the basis for the work; it is, therefore, didactic, descriptive, or reflective in nature.

==Description==
The artist's text intends to explain, justify, extend, and/or contextualize his or her body of work. It places or attempts to place the work in relationship to art history and theory, the art world and the times. Further, the statement serves to show that the artist is conscious of their intentions, aware of their practice and its position within art parameters and of the discourse surrounding it. Therefore not only does it describe and place, but it indicates the level of the artist's own comprehension of their field and making. The artist statement serves as a "vital link of communication between you [the artist], and the rest of the world." &lt;ref&gt; College Art Association (Producer). (2011, Jan 26). "Developing Your Artist Statement" [Audio Podcast]. Retrieved from http://www.collegeart.org/podcasts/ &lt;/ref&gt; Most people encounter a work of art through a reproduction first, and there are many elements that are not present within a reproduction. That is why it is imperative that the artist knows how to properly convey their work through their own words. What the artist writes in their statement may be integrated in wall text, hand outs at an exhibition or a paragraph in a press release. Judgments will be made based both on the nature of the art, as well as the words that accompany it.   


Artists often write a short (50-100 word) and/or a long (500-1000 word) version of the same statement, and they may maintain and revise these statements throughout their careers. &lt;ref&gt;''Tom Palin: Artist Statements 1992-2012''. Workshop Press Leeds, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;They may be edited to suit the requirements of specific funding bodies, galleries or [[call-out]]s as part of the application process.

==History==
The writing of artists' statements is a comparatively recent phenomenon beginning in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Detterer, Gabriele. Ed.  ''Art Recollection: Artists' Interviews &amp; Statements in the Nineties']'. Florence: Danilo Montanari, Exit, and Zona Archives Editori, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some respects, the practice resembles the [[art manifesto]] and may derive in part from it.  However, the artist's statement generally speaks for an individual rather than a collective, and is not strongly associated with [[polemic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  Rather, a [[contemporary art]]ist may be required to submit the statement in order to tender for commissions or apply for schools, residencies, jobs, awards, and other forms of institutional support, in justification of their submission.

In their 2008 survey of North American art schools and university art programs, Garrett-Petts and Nash found that nearly 90% teach the writing of artist statements as part of the curriculum; in addition, they found that, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like prefaces, forewords, prologues, and introductions to literary works, the artist statement performs a vital if complex rhetorical role: when included in an exhibition proposal and sent to a curator, the artist statement usually provides a description of the work, some indication of the work's art historical and theoretical context, some background information about the artist and the artist's intentions, technical specifications – and, at the same time, it aims to persuade the reader of the artwork's value. When hung on a gallery wall, the statement (or "didactic") becomes an invitation, an explanation, and, often indirectly, an element of the installation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett-Petts, W.F., and Rachel Nash. "Re-Visioning the Visual: Making Artistic Inquiry Visible." ''Rhizomes'' 18 (Winter 2008). Spec. issue on "Imaging Place".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As subject matter==
On at least two occasions, artist's statements have been the subject of gallery exhibitions. The first exhibition of artists' statements, ''The Art of the Artist's Statement'',  was curated by Georgia Kotretsos and Maria Pashalidou at the Hellenic Museum, [[Chicago]], in the spring of 2005. It featured the work of 14 artists invited to create artwork offering a visual commentary on the subject of artist statements. The second exhibition, ''Proximities: Artists' Statements and Their Works'', was installed in the fall of 2005 at the Kamloops Art Gallery, [[Kamloops, British Columbia]]. Co-curated by W.F. Garrett-Petts and Rachel Nash, the exhibition asked nine contributing artists to respond to the topic of artists’ statements by taking one or more of their own artist’s statements and working with the text(s) in a manner that documented, represented, and annotated the original work, creating a new work in the process.

Artist's statements have been the subject of a research project on the professional language of the contemporary art world by sociologist Alix Rule and artist David Levine. Presented in their 2012 article ''International Art English,'' published in the American art journal [[Triple Canopy (online magazine)|Triple Canopy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english|title=Triple Canopy – International Art English by Alix Rule &amp; David Levine|newspaper=Triple Canopy|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine &amp; Rule collated and analysed thousands of gallery [[Press release|press releases]], published by [[e-flux]] since 1999, in an attempt to dissect and understand the peculiar language of the professional art world. It has since become one of the most widely circulated pieces of online cultural criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/27/users-guide-international-art-english|title=A user's guide to artspeak|last=Beckett|first=Andy|date=2013-01-27|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashley's Sack''' is a mid-1800s cloth seed or feed sack featuring an embroidered text that recounts the [[Slavery in the United States|slave sale]] of a nine-year-old girl named Ashley and the parting gift of the sack by her mother, Rose. The sack is on display at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. Rose filled the sack with a dress, braid of her hair, pecans, and "my love always." The gift was likely passed down to Ashley's granddaughter, Ruth (Jones) Middleton, who embroidered their story on to the sack in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/artifacts-that-will-send-a-chill-down-your-spine/|title=Artifacts that will send a chill down your spine|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley's Sack was given to [[Middleton Place]], in [[Dorchester County, South Carolina|Dorchester]] County, [[South Carolina]], one of the nation's preeminent slavery-era plantation sites, in the mid-2000s. While still owned by Middleton Place, the sack is on long-term loan to the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] in Washington D.C. According to Tracey Todd, vice president of the Middleton Place Foundation, the sack is a rare material artifact from [[Slavery in the United States|a period in United States history when human slavery was legal]] and families suffered extraordinary losses; the sack typifies the strength and endurance of inter-generational love. "The sack allows us to relate to the enslaved people and feel the same pain today — if you have lost a child or been separated from a parent — that Rose and Ashley felt," said Todd. "Ashley's Sack is a portal to understanding more about our shared history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/national/article103549677.html|title=This scrap of cloth is one of the saddest artifacts at new DC museum|newspaper=kansascity|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://savannahnow.com/column-accent/2016-01-28/looking-pearls-ashleys-sack-davenport-dolls-give-insight-lives-slaves|title=Looking for Pearls: Ashley's Sack, Davenport dolls give insight into lives of slaves|newspaper=savannahnow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ashley's Sack was purchased for $20 at a flea market in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the early 2000s. Alarmed by the embroidered story of a slave sale separating a mother and her daughter, the woman who purchased the sack did an internet search for "slavery" and "Middleton" and then gifted the sack to Middleton Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On display from 2009-2013 at Middleton Place, the emotionally-charged artifact evoked human suffering and endurance. During this period, the identities of Rose, Ashley, and Ruth were unknown. It was viewed by thousands of museum visitors, including [[Central Washington University]] sociocultural anthropologist and museum studies professor Mark Auslander, who has since traced the history of the sack to identify Ashley, her mother Rose, and the author of the needlepoint, Ruth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/a-stitch-in-time-cwu-professor-tracks-history-of-embroidered/article_9f2d8aba-c298-11e6-8653-f7f4a912b32a.html|title=A stitch in time: CWU professor tracks history of embroidered seed sack to people held in slavery on South Carolina plantation|last=tayer@yakimaherald.com|first=Tammy Ayer|newspaper=Yakima Herald-Republic|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/anthropology/story-behind-smithsonian-%E2%80%9Cashley%E2%80%99s-sack-uncovered-cwu-professor|title=Anthropology and Museum Studies {{!}} Story Behind Smithsonian "Ashley's Sack" Uncovered by CWU Professor|website=www.cwu.edu|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the research article he published in 2016, Auslander uses census reports, wills, newspaper announcements of court-degrees, and inventory records to reconstruct their history. The historical chains of remaining evidence suggest that Ashley and her mother Rose were owned by a wealthy Charleston merchant and planter, Robert Martin (c. 1790–1852), who was worth over $300,000 at his death in December 1852. After his death, evidence suggests Ashley was sold away from her mother in order to raise money for his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kuow.org/post/record-wednesday-dec-21-full-show|title=The Record: Wednesday, Dec 21, Full Show|last=Staff|first=KUOW|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auslander's archival work retraces the life of Ruth. He posits Ruth Middleton was born Ruth Jones in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], South Carolina around 1903. Her parents, Austin and Rosa Jones, were servants at the [[University of South Carolina]]. Ruth made her way to [[Philadelphia]], Penn. and married Arthur Middleton, who was born around 1899 and also from South Carolina. However, Ruth and her husband are never listed as having lived together. She had a daughter, Dorothy Helen, born in Philadelphia in 1919. In 1921, when Ashley's Sack was embroidered, Ruth would have been a single mother to a young daughter. Newspaper reports and census records suggest that throughout her life Ruth worked in affluent households in Philadelphia. By 1928, she was well-known in Philadelphia's African American [[High society (social class)|high society]], gaining regular mention in the "Smart Set" and "High Society" pages of the [[Philadelphia Tribune]], the leading African American newspaper. Auslander writes that Ruth "host[ed] bridge and cocktail parties and [wore] elegant couture." Her daughter, Dorothy Helen was also known for her fashion-sense and authored several "Smart Set" columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth died in January 1942 of tuberculosis. Dorothy Helen died in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embroidery details==

{{quote|My great grandmother Rose&lt;br&gt;mother of Ashley gave her this sack when&lt;br&gt;she was sold at age 9 in South Carolina&lt;br&gt;it held a tattered dress 3 handfulls of&lt;br&gt;pecans a braid of Roses hair. Told her&lt;br&gt;It be filled with my Love always&lt;br&gt;she never saw her again&lt;br&gt;Ashley is my grandmother|Ruth Middleton|1921}}

==Impact==

The sack is a rare, important material artifact in African American history. The sack exemplifies the coming together of traditional oral and written history. [[Heather Andrea Williams]][http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v60/n33/heatherandreawilliams.html] describes the sack in the epilogue of her book ''Help Me To Find My People'' as a testimony to inter-generational loss and survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/books/review/help-me-to-find-my-people-by-heather-andrea-williams.html|title='Help Me to Find My People,' by Heather Andrea Williams|last=Perry|first=Imani|date=2012-06-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Mark Auslander emphasizes the importance of the sack, and the historical reconstruction of the lives of Ashley, Rose, and Ruth, as a conduit to understanding the endurance of family lineal memory "in the face of terrible fragmentation of family solidarity caused by the domestic slave trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mark|first=Auslander,|date=2016-01-01|title=Slavery's Traces: In Search of Ashley's Sack|url=https://southernspaces.org/2016/slaverys-traces-search-ashleys-sack|volume=2016|issn=1551-2754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is an emotional object," said Mary Elliot, museum specialist with the Smithsonian, who worked on the Slavery and Freedom exhibit at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] under curator Nancy Bercaw. "This piece is very important to telling that human story," Elliot said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalscene.com/archives/filled-with-my-love-slave-artifact-to-be-displayed-in/article_788d9120-6024-5536-aa6a-c3e569a21558.html|title='Filled with my love' Slave artifact to be displayed in new Smithsonian museum|last=Cantu|first=Leslie|newspaper=Journal Scene|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brass rubbing''' was originally a largely [[Great Britain|British]] enthusiasm for reproducing onto paper [[monumental brass]]es – commemorative [[brass]] plaques found in churches, usually originally on the floor, from between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. The concept of recording textures of things is more generally called [[rubbing|making a rubbing]]. What distinguishes rubbings from [[frottage (art)|frottage]] is that rubbings are meant to reproduce the form of something being transferred, whereas frottage is usually only intended to use a general texture.

Brass rubbings are created by laying a sheet of paper on top of a brass (actually called "[[latten]]" - an alloy of brass and nickel) and rubbing the paper with [[graphite]], [[wax]], or [[chalk]], a process similar to rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper placed on top of a coin.  In the "old days" rubbings were most commonly made using the equivalent of what nowadays is called "[[Butcher paper|butcher's paper]]" [a {{convert|22|-|30|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} roll of whitish paper] laid down over the brass and rubbed with "heelball", a waxy glob of black crayon once used to shine shoes. Now most brass rubbers purchase special paper rolls of heavy duty black velvety material, and the crayons are gold, silver or bronze (other colours are available).

Brass plaques are slowly but surely worn away by the rubbing process and in many cases creating rubbings is banned.  Brass rubbing centres with replicas of original brass plaques have become a prime source for brass rubbings in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stmartin-in-the-fields.org/visit/things-to-see-and-do/|title=Things to see and do - St Martin-in-the-Fields|work=St Martin-in-the-Fields|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas are often not the same scale as the original.

'''''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''''' is a sociological study of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] in the United States written by the American  Wiccan and journalist [[Margot Adler]]. First published in 1979 by [[Viking Press]], it was later republished in a revised and expanded edition by [[Beacon Press]] in 1986, with third and fourth revised editions being brought out by [[Penguin Books]] in 1996 and then 2006 respectively.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the book "is credited with both documenting new religious impulses and being a catalyst for the panoply of practices now in existence"&lt;ref name=Goldscheider&gt;Goldscheider, Eric. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/national/28religion.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=margot+adler+drawing&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin  Witches, Druids and Other Pagans Make Merry Again in the Magical Month of May], ''The New York Times'', May 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and  "helped popularize earth-based religions."&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Anthony. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB1238F931A1575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2   Another Hit Could Give Witches a Bad Name], ''The New York Times'', August 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler was a [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] and "recognized witch"&lt;ref name=Goldscheider /&gt; herself and a reporter for [[National Public Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;NPR. 2006. Margot Adler, NPR Biography, NPR website, accessed August 27, 2006 [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100166]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is an examination of [[Neopaganism in the United States]] from a [[sociology|sociological]] standpoint, discussing the history and various forms of the movement.  It contains excerpts from many interviews with average Pagans, as well as with well-known leaders and organizers in the community.

The first edition of the book sold 30,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
Successive versions have included over one hundred and fifty pages of additional text and an updated contacts section.  It has been praised by [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Susan Brownmiller]], ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and the ''Journal of the [[American Academy of Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblio.com/isbn/0807032530.html 0807032530 - Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler - 9780807032534&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], is one of a number of different Pagan religions, and developed in England during the first half of the 20th century. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884-1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934-2017), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was heavily influenced by [[second wave feminism]], rejecting the veneration of the Horned God and emphasizing female-only covens. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions, who used the pseudonym of [[Starhawk]] (1951-), later founded her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), through which she helped to spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adler and her research===
In 1976, Adler publicly announced that Viking Press had offered her a book contract to undertake the first wide-ranging study of American Paganism.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2012. pp. 235"&gt;[[#Llo12|Lloyd 2012]]. pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:Margot-adler-2004.jpg|thumb|right|Margot Adler in 2004.]]
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}
''Drawing Down the Moon'' offers a guide to the Pagan movement across the United States.

==Republication==

===1986 revision===
In 1986, Adler published a revised second edition of ''Drawing Down the Moon'', much expanded with new information. Identifying several new trends that had occurred in American Paganism since 1979, Adler recognized that in the intervening seven years, U.S. Pagans had become increasingly self-aware of Paganism as a movement, something which she attributed to the increasing number of Pagan festivals.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"/&gt;
One reviewer noted that the alterations made for the 1986 edition "often creates a vivid contrast with events and persons first described in 1979."&lt;ref name="Herndobler 1987"&gt;[[#Her87|Herndobler 1987]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 revision===
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}

===2006 revision===
The 2006 edition includes a new section on Greencraft (pp.&amp;nbsp;127–129), a Wiccan tradition emerging out of an [[Alexandrian Wicca]] [[coven]] which had been given authority over the [[Benelux]] countries, and which features its own [[rune]] alphabet and a non-[[Hebrew]] form of [[Kabbalah]] based on work by Neopagan author [[R. J. Stewart]]; it emphasizes the practice of Wicca as a nature religion and as a [[mystery religion]]. It also gives a more complete and sympathetic treatment of the Northern European Neopagan revivals grouped under the rubric "[[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenism]]," which she admits to having consciously omitted from the first edition because of discomfort with the more conservative social values of this form of Pagan revival, and because some far-right and even [[neo-Nazi]] groups were using it as a front for their activities at the time (pp.&amp;nbsp;286–296). And she prefaces her chapter "Women, Feminism, and the Craft," which discusses the emergence of [[feminist Wicca|feminist forms of Neopaganism]], with discussion of how her personal feelings about such groups have changed, but "decided to leave the chapter pretty much as is, with a few minor corrections, and address the question of feminist spirituality today at the end."

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
Writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Mara E. Donaldson of the [[University of Virginia]] commented that Adler's book provided an "extensive study of paganism" that "demythologizes" the movement "without being sentimental or self-righteous." Considering it to be a "serious corrective to common misconceptions" propagated in the media, Donaldson stated that it was "worth reading" despite what she herself perceived as "neopaganism's weaknesses", namely the movement's lack of "historical-traditional-cultural memory" and a lack of "sensitivity to the Western problem of evil".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Don82|Donaldson 1982]].&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "''Drawing Down the Moon'' is unmatched in its sweeping survey of Neo-Pagan culture and for the historical perspective it provides on the emergence of various small groups within the larger movement. More a report from the trenches than rigorous analysis, Adler's straightforward account of these groups is not an attempt to justify their existence or to explain them away. Her examination of the meanings that individuals make out of their lives through the encounter with and construction of Pagan culture is a welcome shift away from the focus of sociologists on questions of "deviancy" and "conversion" - all concepts defined from outside."
|salign    = right
|source    = Sarah M. Pike, American sociologist, 1996.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"/&gt;}}

In a 1996 paper discussing the various sociological studies that had then been made of Paganism, the sociologist Sarah M. Pike noted that ''Drawing Down the Moon'' had gone "a long way towards answering the question" as to "what makes these [Pagan ritual] activities valid and viable to those who engage in them". In doing so, Pike believed that Adler's work was an improvement on earlier sociological studies of the movement, namely that of [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]], which Pike felt had failed to answer this question.&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 362"&gt;[[#Pik96|Pike 1996]]. p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting Adler's position as a practicing Wiccan, and the impact which this would have on her study, Pike however felt that the book was "less defensive and apologetic than sociological studies conducted by many supposedly objective "outsiders"."&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 362"/&gt; Summarizing ''Drawing Down the Moon'' as being "unmatched" in its "sweeping survey" of the Pagan movement, Pike notes that in providing an overview of the subject it failed to focus on "detailed examination of specific issues and events."&lt;ref name="Pike 1996 363"&gt;[[#Pik96|Pike 1996]]. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reviews===
Writing for ''The Women's Review of Books'', Robin Herndobler praised Adler's "clear, graceful prose", and the manner in which she had written about Paganism "with interest and compassion."&lt;ref name="Herndobler 1987"/&gt;

==Influence==

===Pagan community===
Writing in his later biography of [[Eddie Buczynski]], the Pagan independent scholar Michael G. Lloyd noted that Adler's book was a marked departure from earlier books dealing with Pagan Witchcraft which continued to equate it with either historical Early Modern witchcraft or Satanism.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 2012. pp. 235"/&gt; In her 1999 study of American Wiccans, ''[[A Community of Witches]]'', the sociologist [[Helen A. Berger]] noted that ''Drawing Down the Moon'' had been influential in getting many Wiccans to accept the non-existence of a historical [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Witch-Cult]] from which their religion descended.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ber99|Berger 1999]]. pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
In her sociological study of American Paganism, Loretta Orion, author of ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), noted that she had "benefitted" from Adler's study, believing that it contained "insightful reflections" on those whom it was studying.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first theater troupe for senior citizens founded in the United States and served as a model for the birth of the "senior theater" movement in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Fabulous after Fifty" Indianapolis Star, August 2, 1988.

The company was founded by Bertha Starkus in 1976 with the backing of the Indiana Arts Commission, as an acting company focused on plays featuring older actors. Its first production took place at the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis. Later, the group moved to the Command Playhouse at Ft. Harrison and then the Hedback Community Theatre.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.indytheatrehabit.com/2008/05/11/three-belles-of-eden-at-epilogue&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14352">The '''Erlangen program''' is a method of characterizing [[geometry|geometries]] based on [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]]. It was published by [[Felix Klein]] in 1872 as ''Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen.'' It is named after the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University Erlangen-Nürnberg]], where Klein worked.

By 1872, [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:

:* Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, [[Euclidean geometry]] was more restrictive than [[affine geometry]], which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry.

:* Klein proposed that [[group theory]], a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of [[symmetry]], was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the [[theory of equations]] in the form of [[Galois theory]].

:* Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about [[conic section]]s, but not about [[circle]]s or [[angle]]s because those notions were not invariant under [[projective transformation]]s (something familiar in [[geometrical perspective]]). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way [[subgroup]]s of a [[symmetry group]] related to each other.

Later, [[Élie Cartan]] generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to [[Cartan connection]]s on certain principal bundles, which generalized [[Riemannian geometry]].

==The problems of nineteenth century geometry==

Since [[Euclid]], geometry had meant the geometry of [[Euclidean space]] of two dimensions ([[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]]) or of three dimensions ([[solid geometry]]). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of [[higher dimensions|four or more dimensions]]; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the [[parallel postulate]] from the others, and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the [[projective geometry]], as already developed by [[Jean-Victor Poncelet|Poncelet]], [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical ''physicists'' that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.

With every geometry, Klein associated an underlying [[symmetry group|group of symmetries]]. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these [[group (mathematics)|groups]], and hierarchy of their [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]]. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean group]] of symmetries, while only the [[incidence structure]] and the [[cross-ratio]] are preserved under the most general [[projective geometry|projective transformations]]. A concept of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]ism, which is preserved in [[affine geometry]], is not meaningful in [[projective geometry]]. Then, by abstracting the underlying [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a [[subgroup]] of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is ''a priori'' meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).

==Homogeneous spaces==

In other words, the "traditional spaces" are [[homogeneous space]]s; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language.

In today's language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as [[Lie group]]s: the [[classical groups]]. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language.

===Examples===

For example, the group of [[projective geometry]] in ''n'' real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of ''n''-dimensional real [[projective space]] (the [[general linear group]] of degree {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, quotiented by [[Scalar matrix|scalar matrices]]). The [[affine group]] will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen [[hyperplane at infinity]]. This subgroup has a known structure ([[semidirect product]] of the [[general linear group]] of degree ''n'' with the subgroup of [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.

To explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The [[Euclidean group]] is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi-direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations.  (See [[Klein geometry]] for more details.)

==Influence on later work==

The long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at [[congruence (geometry)]], for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] has become standard in [[physics]].

When [[topology]] is routinely described in terms of properties [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[homeomorphism]], one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not [[Lie group]]s – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by [[H.S.M. Coxeter]] routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became [[transformation geometry]], a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of [[Euclid]], but is less easily converted into a [[logical system]].

In his book ''Structuralism'' (1970) [[Jean Piaget]] says, "In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], the Erlangen Program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of [[mathematical structure|structure]]."

For a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]] through a development based on [[hyperbolic motion]]s. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the [[ultraparallel theorem]] by successive motions.

==Abstract returns from the Erlangen program==
Quite often, it appears there are two or more distinct [[Geometry|geometries]] with [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]]s. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the ''abstract'' group, to the geometry.

One example: [[oriented]] (i.e., [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] not included) [[elliptic geometry]] (i.e., the surface of an [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] with opposite points identified) and [[oriented]] [[spherical geometry]] (the same [[nonEuclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]], but with opposite points not identified) have [[isomorphic]] [[automorphism group]], [[Special orthogonal group|SO(''n''+1)]] for even ''n''. These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise.

To take another example, [[Elliptic geometry|elliptic geometries]] with different [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radii of curvature]] have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General [[Riemannian geometry]] falls outside the boundaries of the program.

[[Complex numbers|Complex]], [[dual numbers|dual]] and [[split-complex number|double (aka split-complex) numbers]] appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,'''R''')/H for the group [[SL2(R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] and its subgroups H=A, N, K &lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kisil |first=Vladimir V. |year=2012 |title=Geometry of Möbius transformations. Elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic actions of SL(2,R) | location=London |publisher=Imperial College Press|page=xiv+192 |isbn=978-1-84816-858-9 | doi=10.1142/p835}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The group SL(2,'''R''') acts on these homogeneous spaces by [[linear fractional transformation]]s and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen programme.

Some further notable examples have come up in physics.

Firstly, ''n''-dimensional [[hyperbolic geometry]], ''n''-dimensional [[de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[inversive geometry]] all have isomorphic automorphism groups,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{O}(n,1)/\mathrm{C}_2,\ &lt;/math&gt;

the [[orthochronous Lorentz group]], for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}. But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are "dual" for some models.

Again, ''n''-dimensional [[anti-de Sitter space]] and (''n''−1)-dimensional [[conformal space]] with "Lorentzian" signature (in contrast with [[conformal space]] with "Euclidean" signature, which is identical to [[inversive geometry]], for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with "dualities" between both [[Geometry|spaces]]. See [[AdS/CFT]] for more details.

The covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional [[twistor space]].

The Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics.

In the seminal paper which introduced [[Category theory|categories]], [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and S. Eilenberg stated: "This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Program, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings"&lt;ref&gt;S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane, ''A general theory of natural equivalences'', Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 58:231–294, 1945. (p. 237); the point is elaborated in Jean-Pierre Marquis (2009), ''From a Geometrical Point of View: A Study of the History of Category Theory'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-9383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations of the Erlangen program with work of C. [[Ehresmann]] on [[groupoids]] in geometry is considered in the article below by  Pradines.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Pradines, ''In [[Ehresmann]]'s footsteps: from group geometries to [[groupoid]] geometries'' (English summary) Geometry and topology of manifolds, 87–157, Banach Center Publ., 76, Polish Acad. Sci., Warsaw, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical logic, the Erlangen Program also served as an inspiration for [[Alfred Tarski]] in his analysis of [[Alfred Tarski#Work on logical notions|logical notions]].&lt;ref&gt;Luca Belotti, ''Tarski on Logical Notions'', Synthese, 404-413, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Guardians of the Gate''''' is a 1991 Everdur [[bronze sculpture]] depicting a family of [[sea lion]]s by [[Miles Metzger]], located northwest of [[Pier 39]] and adjacent to the [[Embarcadero Center]] in [[San Francisco]], California, United States. The sculpture was dedicated on January 22, 1992 and was surveyed by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program the same year.&lt;ref name=SOS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?print=yes&amp;q=siris_ari_308811|title=Guardians of the Gate, (sculpture)|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by Pier 39 Limited Partnership Beach Street and the Embarcadero Center.&lt;ref name=SOS/&gt;

''Guardians of the Gate'', which depicts a "nuzzling" male and female with a pup, was created in 1990 and cast in 1991. Metzger considers the sculpture one of his favorite pieces. He said of his work: "(My) sculptures mean to inspire, encourage and appreciate humanity and the natural world. The family (of sea lions) seemed such a beautiful, emotional moment."&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.auburnjournal.com/article/auburn-sculptor-carving-legacy-stone|title=Auburn sculptor carving legacy in stone|accessdate=July 26, 2013|date=February 28, 2012|work=Auburn Journal|first=Gloria|last=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzger claims he knew that sea lions would be the subjects of his work upon learning the statue had been commissioned by the pier's owner. In 2012, he said of the sculpture's prominent placement: "I've been told by many people it is (one of the) most photographed pieces of sculpture in the United States. It's so populated in that particular spot. Everybody sees that piece. It's one of those places where you can sit on the sculpture and get your picture taken."&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

'''Henry Pearlman''' (1895–1974) was a Brooklyn-born, self-made businessman who discovered in midlife a passion for [[impressionist]] and [[post-impressionist]] art. Over three postwar decades, he assembled a "deeply personal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Willis F.|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|location=Detroit|page=np}}&lt;/ref&gt;  collection centered on thirty-three works by [[Paul Cézanne]] and more than forty by [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaïm Soutine]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and a dozen other European modernists. His eye for quality was "rarely matched in a private collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=The Pearlman Collection|journal=Arts|date=February 1959|volume=33|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and business career==
Pearlman started his career in the cork insulation business, forming his own company, Eastern Cold Storage Insulation Corporation, at the age of twenty-four and becoming a major player in marine refrigeration. He married Rose Fried in 1925; they raised two daughters in [[Croton-on-Hudson]], eventually living both there and in Manhattan and traveling frequently in pursuit of art.

==Art Collector==

[[File:1921, Soutine, View of Céret.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chaïm Soutine]], ''View of Céret'', ca. 1921-22]]

While Pearlman initially decorated his Croton home with Old Master and American Realist paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeLue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|location=Princeton and New Haven|isbn=978-0300174403|page=60|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including those found at local flea markets, his passion for art, and the stories behind each work, found full expression with the purchase at auction in 1945 of an expressionist painting by [[Chaïm Soutine]] – ''View of Céret'' (formerly ''Village Square, Céret''). As one observer put it, "his first foray into Parisian modernism revealed an acute eye, an instinct for the historical moment and a deeply felt connection to an artist who opened up a new world for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pearlman quickly made connections in the New York art world; he spent time in museums and archives; and he soon traded his decorative collection for carefully selected examples of modern works by impressionist, post-impressionist and expressionist European artists. Pearlman found himself captivated by the details of the lives of and associations among these artists, and his acquisitions often followed such discoveries; he "liked connections and contexts, but as they arose within the framework of his vividly personal taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman was invigorated by the pursuit of quality as well as the challenges of finding, authenticating and negotiating the ownership of increasingly rare masterpieces.

In the years after World War II, Pearlman began traveling to Europe. During an early trip to London he met Austrian expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=61|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in a lifelong friendship for Pearlman with one of the few living artists whose work he collected. On this same trip he also visited the places where Soutine had painted, trying to identify the landscapes he already knew well from their expressionist representation – an activity he would repeat with other artists and works as he built his collection. In his hunt for new works, he looked first to Soutine’s close associates, including [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]. Ultimately the collection would include seven paintings by Soutine, and four works by Modigliani, including a rare limestone head and two oil portraits (''[[Léon Indenbaum]]'' and ''[[Jean Cocteau]]'').

[[File:Van Gogh - Die Postkutsche nach Tarascon.jpeg|thumb|left|Vincent Van Gogh, ''Tarascon Stagecoach'', 1888. Collection of the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation.]]

Although successful in business, Pearlman was never able to match the resources of his contemporaries. Instead, "he was both lucky and clever: lucky in that, when he first started, the art he was interested in…could be secured for thousands rather than millions of dollars…and clever in that he continuously honed his eye and then applied his skills… to obtain the objects of his passion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=B.

In 1950 Pearlman learned from a dealer that [[Van Gogh]]’s ''Tarascon Diligence'' was available from the heirs of the artist Milo Beretta. He quickly offered a combination of paintings and cash to make what is perhaps his most fabled acquisition – the last time a "lost" Van Gogh will reappear for the next sixty-five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Genauer|first=Emily|title=Art and Artists: A Van Gogh, New to America, Acquired by Private Collector,|journal=The New York Herald Tribune|date=3 September 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a reviewer described, this Van Gogh was "a typical Pearlman picture: assertive, pushing a characteristic manner to an extreme that is slightly unusual in the artist’s oeuvre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 1950, with the advice of noted [[Cézanne]] specialist [[John Rewald]], Pearlman made his first purchase of a Cézanne watercolor, ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir''. Over the following two decades, he would acquire more than thirty works by Cézanne and assemble the most distinguished collection of watercolors by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong, Carol and|first=Laura Giles, eds.|title=Cézanne in Focus: Watercolors from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum|location=Princeton|url=https://www.amazon.com/Cezanne-Focus-Watercolors-Pearlman-Collection/dp/B000JWDTRA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397143393&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=%22cezanne+in+focus%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This new fascination with Cézanne did not distract Pearlman from his expanding interest in the works of other artists who lived and worked in France, many of whom knew, were influenced by and competed with one another. In addition to Modigliani, he added works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Degas, Renoir and Gauguin as well as several significant oil paintings by Cézanne, including the only known vertical-format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rewald|first=John|title=The Paintings of Paul Cézanne: A Catalogue Raisonné|date=1996|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|pages=535–537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the artist’s favorite subject, [[Mont Sainte-Victoire]].  Pearlman continued to build his collection - buying, selling and trading works – for the three remaining decades of his life. His last two purchases were Cézanne watercolors: a late masterpiece (''Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit'') and ''Rocks at Bibémus'', which he had come to know when it appeared alongside works from his collection in a number of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Lue|first=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum and Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300174403|page=68|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions and Legacy==

[[File:1895, Cézanne, Cistern in the Park of Château Noir.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Cistern in the Park of Château Noir'', 1895-1900]]

Beginning in the 1950s, Henry and Rose Pearlman began lending individual works to major museums, initially for retrospectives of Soutine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Monroe|title=Soutine|date=1950|publisher=Museum of Modern Art, New York in collaboration with the Cleveland Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Modigliani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soby|first=James Thrall|title=Modigliani: Paintings, Drawings, Sculpture.|date=1951|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As their collection took shape, loans and exhibitions of the collection became important to them and eventually occupied as much of Henry’s time and attention as acquisitions did. Although he never tired of the hunt, works that met his eye for quality and expressiveness were soon available only to those with the funds, not just a passion.

Pearlman’s generosity extended beyond the loans of works from his collection. He lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and [[Jacques Lipchitz]], whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacques Lipchitz studio fund invoice, 1952? (Digital ID: 14010), Jacques Lipchitz papers and Bruce Bassett papers concerning Jacques Lipchitz, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/jacques-lipchitz-studio-fund-invoice-14010|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[http://www.pearlmancollection.org The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation] was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958: twenty-seven selected works, lent anonymously, to the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baltimore Museum of Art|title=Anonymous Collection Exhibition|date=July–September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at [[Knoedler &amp; Company]] in New York in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Knoedler &amp; Co.|title=A Loan Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman for the Benefit of Greenwich House|date=1959|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fogg Museum]] in 1959;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fogg Museum|title=Drawings, Watercolors and Oils by Paul Cézanne Lent by an Anonymous Collector|date=Exhibition, 1 July–1 September  1959|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=An Exhibition of 19th &amp; 20th Century Painting and Sculpture from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 29 June–5 September  1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 22 May–15 October 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1986;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brooklyn Museum of Art|title=Art of Cézanne from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 2 May–14 July 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Detroit Institute of Art]] in 1967;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cézanne and His Contemporaries: The Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection|date=1967|publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in 1970;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Impressionism, Post-impressionism, Expressionism: The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Henry Pearlman Collection of Works by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Degas, Toulouse Lautrec, Manet, Modigliani, Soutine, and Others|date=1970|publisher=Wadsworth Atheneum|location=Hartford, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.|title=Cézanne Watercolors from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman|date=Exhibition, 14 April–30 September  1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|title=Paul Cézanne: Works from the Pearlman Collection|date=Exhibition, 26 June–29 August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1960 article in ''Connoisseur'' magazine describes Pearlman’s "unflagging fascination of the hunt … [He] trusts a stubborn faith in his own taste and has no interest in assembling an anthology of the standard names of modern art, but only those artists who have a special appeal to his individual taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chanin|first=A. L.|title=The Henry Pearlman Collection|journal=Connoisseur|date=June 1960|volume=145|issue=586|pages=230–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]’s "Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. (When not on loan, the collection was divided between their Park Avenue apartment and Henry’s office in midtown Manhattan.)

[[File:1904, Cézanne, Mont Sainte-Victoire.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Cézanne, ''Mont Sainte-Victoire'', ca. 1904-6]]

Henry Pearlman spent much of the last year of his life organizing an exhibition of the collection at the Brooklyn Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=1974|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which toured after his death to Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Art Museum, Princeton University|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 8 December 1974–14 March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utica (NY),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 13 April–31August 1974|location=Utica, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williamstown (MA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Francine and Sterling Clark Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 26 September  1975–22 February 1976|location=Williamstown, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnegie Institute|title=An Exhibition of Paintings, Watercolors, Sculpture and Drawings from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman and Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation|date=Exhibition, 6 April–30 May 1976|location=Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection returned to the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] in 1976, when Rose Pearlman, as head of the foundation, initiated a series of longer-term loans that continue to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shirey|first=David L.|title=Princeton Gets Pearlman Art for 2 Years|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1976|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A world-class university-based museum, Princeton offers the collection security, conservation, curatorial expertise and management of loan requests from museums around the world.

In 2014, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation and the [http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/story/cézanne-and-modern-masterpieces-european-art-pearlman-foundation Princeton University Art Museum] initiated a tour of the collection, including its first exhibitions outside the United States. With the aim of expanding the audience for these works and artists, the tour (''Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection'') opened at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in Oxford, England, in March 2014. Reviewers noted: "A collection of truly stunning art works" (''Oxford Times'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Theresa|title=A collection of truly stunning art works|journal=The Oxford Times|date=20 March 2014|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/leisure/art/11090159.A_collection_of_truly_stunning_art_works/|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Cézanne and the Modern''… makes you think about modern art – where it began, and what it is" (''The Guardian'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=Cézanne and the Modern review – 'puts Ashmolean in the big league|journal=The Guardian|date=10 March 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/10/cezanne-modern-exhibition-review-ashmolean-museum-oxford|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The finest, best preserved collection of Cézanne watercolours in the world" (''Financial Times'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wullschlager|first=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|journal=Financial Times|date=14 March 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, 2014, it traveled to the [[Musée Granet]] in Aix-en-Provence, France, where many of the Cézanne works were originally created. The collection then returned to North America with three exhibitions: The [[High Museum]] in Atlanta, the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] and at [[Princeton University Art Museum|Princeton]] for the fall semester of 2015.

In September, 2018, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation launched a redesigned [http://www.pearlmancollection.org website] for the collection. Featuring high-quality, shareable images of the entire collection, it also offers details about where the works were created. Some of these include photographs of the same view today and many include Google Map locations. The site also has excerpts from Henry Pearlman’s "Reminiscences of a Collector," with anecdotes about collecting, forgeries, negotiations, dealers and competing collectors. The paper archives of Pearlman’s correspondence and files, held at the Smithsonian Institution’s [http://www.aaa.si.edu Archives of American Art], are also linked as well as other external resources, such as the letters of Van Gogh, X-rays of hidden works and connections among the artists represented in the collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">The {{nihongo|'''Japan Professional Photographers Society'''|日本写真家協会|Nihon Shashinka Kyōkai}} is a Tokyo-based organization of photographers founded in 1950. Its logo reads “JPS”.&lt;!-- No, not “JPPS”, instead, just one “P”. I've no idea why. --&gt; It was formed from the combination of three earlier organizations, none more than two years old: Seinen Hōdō Shashin Kenkyūkai (青年報道写真研究会), Seinen Shashinka Kyōkai (青年写真家協会, Young Photographers' Association), and Shashinka Shūdan (写真家集団, Photographers' Group), 

The organization exists to maintain professional standards and to protect the interests of professional photographers. It also sponsors exhibitions of interest to the general public, and, since 2005, the [[Yōnosuke Natori|Younosuke &lt;!-- Yes, this is how they romanize it. --&gt; Natori]] Photography Award for photographers under 30. Its current President (2007) is [[Takeyoshi Tanuma]].

'''Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t|r|ə}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑːr|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sartre "Sartre"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|saʁtʁ|lang}}; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]]. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of [[existentialist|existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and one of the leading figures in [[Twentieth-Century French Philosophy|20th-century French philosophy]] and [[Marxism]]. His work has also influenced [[sociology]], [[critical theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], and [[literary studies]], and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his [[open relationship]] with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the [[culture|cultural]] and [[society|social]] assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered [[bourgeois]], in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] (''mauvaise foi'', literally, "[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]") and an "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]" way of "[[being]]" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'Être et le Néant'', 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N.  |title=The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-55663-8 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work ''[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]'' (''L'existentialisme est un humanisme'', 1946), originally presented as a lecture.

He was awarded the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".&lt;ref&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1964).

==Biography==

===Early life===

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in [[Paris]] as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the [[French Navy]], and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer).&lt;ref name="Baird1999"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Forrest E.

When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in [[Indochina]]. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in [[Meudon]], where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to [[classics|classical literature]] at a very early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brabazon |first=James |title=Albert Schweitzer: A Biography |year=1975 |publisher=Putnam |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to [[La Rochelle]], where he was frequently bullied.&lt;ref&gt;''Jean-Paul Sartre'', by Andrew N. Leak, (London 2006), page 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[essay]] ''[[Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jean-Paul |first1=Sartre |author2=Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre, Jonathan Webber |title=The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination |origyear=1940 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28755-3 |pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Cours Hattemer]], a private school in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Quelques Anciens Celebres – Hattemar}} |url=http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/# |title=Quelques Anciens Celebres |publisher=Hattemer |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618133955/http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/ |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) in Paris at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Schrift"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrift |first=Alan D. |editor= |others= |title=Twentieth-century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=1-4051-3217-5 |pages=174–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (His 1928 MA thesis under the title "L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature" ["Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature"] was supervised by [[Henri Delacroix]].)&lt;ref name="Schrift"/&gt; It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs: fifty years of political reflection'', By Raymond Aron (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s seminars, which continued for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Auffret, D. (2002), Alexandre Kojeve. La philosophie, l'Etat, la fin de l'histoire, Paris: B. Grasset&lt;/ref&gt;

From his first years in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]], Sartre was one of its fiercest [[prank]]sters.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''], p.,53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''], pp. 61–2 quote: "During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, his [[antimilitarist]] [[satirical]] cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with [[Georges Canguilhem]], particularly upset the director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''], pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; he organized a [[media prank]] following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including ''[[Le Petit Parisien]],'' announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh [[look-alike]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''], pp.69, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/sartre.shtml |title=Jeanj.m.m.,n,mnn-Paul Sartre – philosopher, social advocate |publisher=Tameri.com |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public's resultant outcry{{Request quotation|date=May 2011}} forced Lanson to resign.&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuL98MtZ5poC&amp;pg=PA26 ''Sartre'' by David Drake, 2005], p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 at the École Normale, he met [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship,&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Humphrey |title=The People Magazine approach to a literary supercouple |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=20 November 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |date=28 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231192609/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |archivedate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Liliane  |title=In the shadow of Sartre |year=1990 |publisher=Collins (London) |isbn=0-00-215336-X |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Sartre took the [[agrégation]], he failed.  He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Desan, ''The Tragic Finale: An Essay on the Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1960) xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Bair, ''Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography'' (New York: Touchstone Book, 1990), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre was drafted into the [[French Army]] from 1929 to 1931 and served as a meteorologist for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, ''Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963'' (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le Sueur |first1=James D. |author2=Pierre Bourdieu |title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria |origyear=2005 |year= 2005|publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-8028-9 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various [[lycées]] of [[Le Havre]] (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée François-Ier (Le Havre)|fr}}, 1931–36), [[Laon]] (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]], 1937–39, and at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], 1941–44;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]] (ed.), ''Jean-Paul Sartre'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[#World War II|below]]).

In 1932, Sartre discovered ''[[Voyage au bout de la nuit]]'' by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], a book that had a remarkable influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''La Force de l'âge'', Gallimard, 1960, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the [[Institut Français|Institut français d'Allemagne]] in [[Berlin]] where he studied [[Edmund Husserl]]'s phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s ''Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl'' (''The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology'').&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, "Merleau-Ponty vivant", in ''Situations, IV: portraits'', Gallimard, 1964, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army, where he served as a [[meteorologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van den Hoven |first1=Adrian |author2=Andrew N. Leak |others=Andrew N. Leak |title=Sartre Today: A Centenary Celebration |year=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=1-84545-166-X |pages=viii }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by German troops in 1940 in [[Padoux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boulé |first=Jean-Pierre  |title=Sartre, Self-formation, and Masculinities |year=2005 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=1-57181-742-5 |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he spent nine months as a [[prisoner of war]]—in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and finally in {{Interlanguage link multi|Stalag XII-D|fr}}, [[Trier]], where he wrote his first [[theatre|theatrical]] piece, ''Barionà, fils du tonnerre'', a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'', later to become a major influence on his own essay on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[ontology]]. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and [[exotropia]] affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakewell |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Bakewell |date=2016 |title=At the Existentialist Café |publisher=Chatto&amp;Windus |page=158 |isbn=9781473545328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris, settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position at Lycée Condorcet in Paris, replacing a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by [[Statute on Jews|Vichy law]].

After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group ''Socialisme et Liberté'' ("Socialism and Liberty") with other writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Dominique Desanti]], Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with "cheerful ferocity" at a meeting that the ''Socialisme et Liberté'' assassinate prominent war collaborators like [[Marcel Déat]], but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as "none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=218}} The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General [[Otto von Stülpnagel]], and the popular slogan always was "Death to Laval!" rather than "Death to Hitler!".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=225}} In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of [[André Gide]] and [[André Malraux]]. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. ''Socialisme et liberté'' soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', ''[[The Flies]]'', and ''[[No Exit]]'', none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay "Paris under the Occupation", Sartre wrote about the "correct" behavior of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark "We could not be ''natural''".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=57-58}} French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Ousby wrote: "But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Sartre wrote the very "correctness" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the "correct" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the "New Order in Europe", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}

Throughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre wrote about the "languid existence" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing about how: "Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} Sartre also remarked on conversations at the [[Café de Flore]] between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a ''[[wiktionary:mouche|mouche]]'' (informer) or a writer of the ''[[wiktionary:corbeau|corbeau]]'' (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no-one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=148}} Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the ''Abwehr'' alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as ''mouches'' while by 1942 the Paris ''Kommandantur'' was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the ''corbeaux''.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=146}}

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a "sham", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=161}} Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris "was peopled by the absent".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=172}} Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing about how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the ''concierge'' forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre wrote the ''feldgrau'' ("field grey") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called "a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=170}} Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans ''les autres'' ("the others"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play ''Huis clos'' ("No Exit") of "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" ("Hell is other people").{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}} Sartre intended the line  "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}}

After August 1944 and the [[Liberation of Paris]], he wrote ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]''. In the book he tries to explain the [[etiology]] of "hate" by analyzing [[antisemitic|antisemitic hate]]. Sartre was a very active contributor to ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', a newspaper created during the clandestine period by [[Albert Camus]], a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''. Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant [[Vladimir Jankelevitch]] criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the [[rue Bonaparte]] which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political [[review]], ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' (''Modern Times''), in part to popularize his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, ''Les Chemins de la Liberté'' (''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'') (1945–1949).

===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===
[[File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Sartre (middle) and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (left) meeting with [[Che Guevara]] (right) in Cuba, 1960]]
The first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by ''Being and Nothingness'' (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the ''résistants'' were a "band of brothers" who had enjoyed "real freedom" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} Sartre was "merciless" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer [[Robert Brasillach]] from being executed.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} His 1948 play ''Les mains sales'' (''[[Dirty Hands]]'') in particular explored the problem of being a politically "engaged"  intellectual. He embraced [[Marxism]] but did not join the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as "provincial" and in a 1949 essay called for a "United States of Europe".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29}} In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal ''Politique étrangère'', Sartre wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29-30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the Korean War, Sartre wrote: "I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=34}} In July 1950, Sartre wrote in ''Les Temps Modernes'' about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a "revolutionary" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of "bourgeois" states were due to their innate shortcomings.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} The Swiss journalist [[François Bondy]] wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews "a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges "may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power", deeming Sartre's position to be "existentialist".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

While a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a "complete freedom of criticism" while condemning the United States for sinking into "prefascism".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=28}} Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union "still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=41}} He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: "In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=37}}  Sartre came to admire the Polish leader [[Władysław Gomułka]], a man who favored a "Polish road to socialism" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Sartre's newspaper ''Les Temps Modernes'' devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's "ultra Bolshevism" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] as the man who lead the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}}

As an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in the [[Algerian War]] and was one of the signatories of the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]''. Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s.&lt;ref&gt;István Mészáros, ''The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom and the Challenge of History,'' rev. ed. (New York: Monthly Review, 2012), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and, along with [[Bertrand Russell]] and others, organized a [[tribunal]] intended to expose U.S. [[war crimes]], which became known as the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 1967.

His work after Stalin's death, the ''Critique de la raison dialectique'' (''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the ''Critique'' Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of "class" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, [[Louis Althusser]], who claimed that the ideas of the [[young Marx]] were decisively superseded by the "scientific" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the "real damned of the earth", who would carry out the revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=27-28}} A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the "Americanization" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

Sartre went to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s to meet [[Fidel Castro]] and spoke with [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10/9/2006 |title="Remembering Che Guevara", 9 October 2006, '&amp;#39;The International News'&amp;#39;, by Prof Khwaja Masud |work=The News International |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112210219/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10%2F9%2F2006 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "era's most perfect man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1920888241 |title=Amazon Review of: 'The Bolivian Diary: Authorized Edition' |publisher=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that "he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html HeyChe.org – People about Che Guevara]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709042917/http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: "In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Conducta Impropria by [[Nestor Almendros]], 1983: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQB5cI9b4A&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLD12AFBD33DDE5D99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited [[Red Army Faction]] leader [[Andreas Baader]] in [[Stammheim Prison]] and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1974/baader.htm |title=The Slow Death of Andreas Baader |publisher=Marxists.org |date=7 December 1974 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, Sartre became an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref name="nybooks4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4 |title=Sartre at Seventy: An Interview by Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Contat |work=The New York Review of Books |date=7 August 1975 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raforum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |title=R.A.

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, ''Les Mots'' (''[[The Words (book)|The Words]]''). The book is an ironic counterblast to [[Marcel Proust]], whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of [[André Gide]] (who had provided the model of ''littérature engagée'' for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize,&lt;ref&gt;

Though his name was then a household word (as was "existentialism" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 strikes]] in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for [[civil disobedience]]. President [[Charles de Gaulle]] intervened and pardoned him, commenting that "you don't arrest [[Voltaire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF1538F934A35755C0A961948260 "Superstar of the Mind"], by Tom Bishop in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 7 June 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like &lt;nowiki&gt;[people]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remember ''Nausea'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[my plays]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''No Exit'' and ''The Devil and the Good Lord,'' and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. Then my essay on [[Jean Genet|Genet]], ''Saint Genet''. ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charlesworth  |first=Max  |title=The Existentialists and Jean-Paul Sartre |year=1976 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |isbn=0-7022-1150-8 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of [[amphetamine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Criterion review of La Cérémonie des adieux by Simone de Beauvoir|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-last-days-of-Jean-Paul-Sartre-6523}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put himself through during the writing of the ''Critique'' and a massive analytical biography of [[Gustave Flaubert]] (''The Family Idiot''), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hayman. ''Sartre: A Biography.'' Carroll &amp; Graf, 1992, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious [[chain smoker]], which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|title=Hell is other people removing your cigarette|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1485353/Hell-is-other-people-removing-your-cigarette.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from [[edema]] of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]] between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto Boulevard Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histoire Du Monde|url=http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Jean-Paul-Sartre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat-2000-Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080602061137/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 June 2008 |title=Sartre's Roads to Freedom |last=Singer |first=Daniel |date=5 June 2000 |work=The Nation |accessdate=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral started at "the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie. ''Sartre: A Life.'' Random House, Inc., 1987, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie, p. 523.

==Thought==
{{See also|Being and Nothingness}}
Sartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are "condemned to be free".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: "existence precedes essence".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"/&gt; This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. "We are left alone, without excuse." "We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8181406/Does_our_past_have_a_motivational_effect_Our_reasons_for_acting_Sartre_s_philosophy_of_action |title=Does our past have a motivational effect? Our reasons for acting: Sartre's philosophy of action. |author=[[Yoann Malinge]] |date= |website=[[Academia.edu]] |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience "death consciousness" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Death. (1999). In Gordon Hayim (Ed.) Dictionary of Existentialism (p. 105). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.

As a junior lecturer at the Lycée du [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (''Nausea''), which serves in some ways as a [[manifesto]] of [[existentialism]] and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the [[Husserl|German]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.

He also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: "Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | volume = 55 | issue = 3&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This indifference of "things in themselves" (closely linked with the later notion of "being-in-itself" in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the "nausea" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.

The novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that [[morality]] is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying "Condemned to be free") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.

Also important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; "When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yoann Malinge, ''"Sartre, « The Transcendance of the Ego »"'' (The Literary Encyclopedia: https://www.academia.edu/31648622/_Sartre_The_Transcendance_of_the_Ego_article_in_The_Literary_Encyclopedia_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as public intellectual==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] Memorial]]
While the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45.&lt;ref&gt;Baert 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: "Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined &lt;nowiki&gt;[with]&lt;/nowiki&gt; women. He wrote. And he was published."&lt;ref&gt;Gerassi 1989: 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where "the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out".&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir 1958: 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in ''[[The Age of Reason (Sartre)|The Age of Reason]]'', which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute [[rationalist]], analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could "recognize no allegiance except to [him]self",&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 13&lt;/ref&gt; though he realized that without "responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.

The war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: "the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 108&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the "Socialisme et Liberté" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, Ronald (2004). ''Camus &amp; Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel That Ended It''. University of Chicago Press. p. 30. {{ISBN|0-226-02796-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-02796-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this "crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature".&lt;ref&gt;Thody 1964: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

Sartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, "culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention." This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work "subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: "the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: 13&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its "authoritarian tendencies". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: "If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist."&lt;ref name="nybooks4"/&gt; He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.&lt;ref name="raforum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which "reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there".&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the "traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior", but there is "a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran|Oran, Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line "L'enfer, c'est les autres", usually translated as "Hell is other people."&lt;ref name="rickontheater"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |title= The Most Famous Thing Jean-Paul Sartre Never Said |last1=Woodward |first1=Kirk|date=9 July 2010 |work=Rick on Theater |publisher=Blogger (Google: blogspot.com) |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the impact of ''Nausea'', Sartre's major work of fiction was ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]].

[[John Huston]] got Sartre to script his film ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Le Scénario'', 10; Scenario. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits.&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth. ''Jacques Lacan &amp; Co: A History of Psychoanalysis in France, 1925–1985''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asharperfocus.com/Freud.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] placed Sartre's oeuvre on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (List of Prohibited Books)]].

==Criticism==
Some philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[Reification (fallacy)|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophers [[Richard Wollheim]] and [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=7 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals associated with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]] allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Brian C. Anderson]] denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and Castro's regime in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership:  "The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, "[http://www.fortfreedom.org/h11.htm The Heartless Lovers of Humankind]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre, who stated in his preface to [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' that, "To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man," has been criticized by Anderson and [[Michael Walzer]] for supporting the killing of European civilians by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] during the [[Algerian War]]. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6476 The Absolute Intellectual] Brian C. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 Can There Be a Decent Left?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118221640/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 |date=18 November 2011 }} {{website=Kenyon.edu |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Waltzer.htm |date=18 November 2011 }} Michael Walzer&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic, poet, essayist and philosopher [[Clive James]] excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies ''[[Cultural Amnesia (book)|Cultural Amnesia]]'' (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being "all a pose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/clives_lives/2007/03/jeanpaul_sartre.html|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|first=Clive|last=James|date=29 March 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kangra painting''' is the pictorial art of [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]], named after [[Kangra State|Kangra]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], a former [[princely state]], which patronized the art. It became prevalent with the fading of [[Basohli Painting|Basohli school of painting]] in mid-18th century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWKaR6LbEGcC&amp;pg=PA512&amp;dq=pligrim+Dharamshala%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Kangra school of painting] ''Footprint India'', by Roma Bradnock. Published by Footprint Travel Guides, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904777-00-7}}.''Page 512''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/311105/Kangra-painting Kangra painting] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and soon produced such a magnitude in paintings both in content as well as volume, that the [[Pahari painting]] school, came to be known as Kangra paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EGUpX1O0hoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA62&amp;dq=Kangra+painting&amp;as_brr=0 Pahari centres] ''Arts of India: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Dance and Handicraft'', by Krishna Chaitanya. Published by Abhinav Publications, 1987. {{ISBN|81-7017-209-8}}. ''Page 62''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the main centres of Kangra paintings are [[Guler State|Guler]], [[Basohli]], [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], [[Bilaspur State|Bilaspur]] and Kangra. Later on this style also reached [[Mandi State|Mandi]], [[Suket State|Suket]], [[Kullu Valley|Kulu]], [[Baghal State|Arki]], [[Nalagarh]] and [[Tehri Garhwal]] (represented by [[Mola Ram]]), and now are collectively known as [[Pahari painting]], covering the style that was patronized by [[Rajput]] rulers between the 17th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/indian_miniature_painting.html Chandigarh Museum - Kangra paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pahari paintings, as the name suggests, were paintings executed in the hilly regions of India, in the sub-Himalayan state of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. It is in the development and modification of Pahari paintings, that the Kangra School features. Under the patronage of [[Sansar Chand of Kangra|Maharaja Sansar Chand]] (c.1765-1823), it became the most important center of Pahari painting. To see some of these master pieces one can visit the Maharaja Sansar Chand Museum, adjoining the Kangra Fort in Kangra Himachal. This museum has been founded by the erst-while Royal Family of [[Kangra district|Kangra]].

==History==
[[File:Sansar chand.jpg|thumb|[[Sansar Chand of Kangra|Sansar Chand]] (c.1765-1823), an early patron of the Kangra style]]
This great art originated in [[Guler State]], a small hill state in the Lower Himalayas in the first half of the 18th century when a family of Kashmiri painters trained in [[Mughal painting]] Style sought shelter at the court of Raja Dalip Singh (r. 1695-1741) of Guler. The rise of [[Haripur_Guler#Guler_Paintings|Guler Paintings]] started in what is known as the Early phase of Kangra Kalam. The new arrivals mingled with the local artists and were greatly influenced by the atmosphere of the hills. Instead of painting flattering portraits of their masters and love scenes, the artistes adopted themes of eternal love between Radha and Krishna. The paintings were naturalistic and employed cool, fresh colors. The colors were extracted from minerals, vegetables and possessed enamel-like luster. Verdant greenery of the landscape, brooks, springs were the recurrent images on the miniatures.

[[Nainsukh]] (1710-1778), succeeded by two generations of his family workshop, introduced a distinctive style which combined Mughal elements with personal innovations.

This style reached its zenith during the reign of [[Sansar Chand of Kangra|Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch]] (r.1776-1824) who was a great patron of Kangra art. Being a liberal patron, the painters working at his atelier received large commissions while others accepted a permanent settlement in the form of lands. Maharaja Sansar Chand was an ardent devotee of Krishna and used to commission artists to paint subjects based on the loves and life of Krishna.

The Guler-Kangra art is the art of drawing and the drawing is precise and fluid, lyrical and naturalistic. In these styles the faces are well modelled and shaded so judiciously that they possess almost porcelain-like delicacy.

==Themes==
The focal theme of Kangra painting is Shringar (the erotic sentiment). The subjects seen in Kangra painting exhibit the taste and the traits of the life style of the society of that period. [[Bhakti]] cult was the driving force and the love story of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] was the main source of spiritual experience, which was also the base for the visual expression. [[Bhagavata Purana]] and the love poems [[Gita Govinda]] by [[Jayadeva]] were the most popular subjects dealing with the legends and the amorous plays of Radha and Krishna symbolising soul’s devotion to God. In some miniatures, the blue-god Krishna is seen dancing in the lush woodlands and every maiden’s eye are drawn to him. Krishna subjects, known commonly as Krishna-lila predominate, while the themes of love, inspired by the nayaks and nayikas and baramasa enjoyed great favour. The sentiment of love remained the inspiration and the central theme of Pahari painting. The Sat Sai depictions of the legendary lovers, on the other hand, were set against an architectural background with walls, balconies and windows. Kangra paintings influenced by the Bhagavad Purana portrayed incidents from the life of the young Krishna, against the Brindavan forest or river Yamuna. The other popular themes were the stories of Nala and Damayanti, and those from Keshavdas's Baramasa.

==Features of Kangra painting==
[[File:Indischer Maler von 1780 001.jpg|thumb|[[Rama]] and [[Sita]] in the forest,  1780]]

One striking feature of Kangra paintings is the verdant greenery it depicts. The style is naturalistic, and great attention is paid to detail. The foliage depicted is vast and varied. This is made noticeable by using multiple shades of green. The Kangra paintings feature flowering plants and creepers, leafless trees, rivulets and brooks.

The Kangra artists adopted various shades of the primary colors and used delicate and fresher hues. For instance, they used a light pink on the upper hills to indicate distance.

Kangra paintings depict the feminine charm in a very graceful manner. Facial features are soft and refined. The female figures are exceptionally beautiful.
[[File:A regal figure seated on a throne, Pahari school.jpeg|thumb|A regal figure seated on a throne, Pahari school]]
Later Kangra paintings also depicted nocturnal scenes, and storms and lightning. The paintings were often large and had complex compositions of many figures and elaborate landscapes. Towns and house clusters were often depicted in the distance.

The Kangra painters used colors made of vegetable and mineral extracts. They employed cool and fresh colors. Kangra paintings are known for the lyrical blending of form and color.

The Kangra Arts Promotion Society([http://www.kangraarts.org]) an [[NGO]] at Dharamshala Himachal Pradesh is working for the promotion of this art which is at the verge of extinction today. This NGO is running a school to train young boys and girls in this art. It also runs a workshop where genuine Kangra Paintings are made on traditional handmade paper using only mineral and vegetable colours.

[[File:GOTHA-cranach-veljo.jpg|thumb|420px|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], ''Law and Gospel'', Herzogliches Museum, Gotha, Germany. {{convert|82.2|x|118|cm|in|abbr=on}}]]

'''''Law and Gospel''''' (or '''''Law and Grace''''') is one of a number of thematically linked, allegorical panel paintings by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] from about 1529. The paintings, intended to illustrate [[Lutheran]] ideas of salvation, are exemplars of Lutheran ''Merkbilder'',&lt;ref&gt;Ehrstine, Glenn (2002). ''Theater, Culture, and Community in Reformation Bern: 1523–1555''. Studies in Medieval and Reformation Thought Vol. 85. Brill. {{ISBN|9789004123533}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were simple, [[Didacticism|didactic]] illustrations of Christian doctrine.

Cranach probably drew on input from his lifelong friend [[Martin Luther]] when designing these panels, which illustrate the [[Protestant]] concept of [[Law and Gospel]]. The earliest forms of the picture are the panels in [[Gotha]], Germany and the [[National Gallery in Prague]]; the Gotha panel is thought to be earlier. The paintings were the basis for many similar works by Cranach and his workshop, Lucas Cranach the Younger, and other artists in diverse forms such as printmaking, relief sculpture and household furnishings.

==Theological context==
[[File:Lucas Cranach - Verdammnis und Erlösung.jpg|thumb|300px|A later (1536) version by Cranach and his son. Oil, gold and paper on panel, transferred on panel]]

The left and right "wings" of the paintings illustrate the Protestant concept of [[Law and Gospel]], which emphasizes salvation through the forgiveness of sins in light of the person and work of Jesus Christ. "Law", or the [[Christian views on the Old Covenant|Old Covenant]], is symbolized on the left, and "Gospel" or "Grace" on the right. The panels illustrate the Lutheran idea that Law is not sufficient for salvation, but Gospel is.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 37&lt;/ref&gt; As Luther wrote in 1522:

{{blockquote|The Law is the Word in which God teaches and tells us what we are to do and not to do, as in the Ten Commandments. Now wherever human nature is alone, without the grace of God, the Law cannot be kept, because since Adam's fall in Paradise man is corrupt and has nothing but a wicked desire to sin... The other Word of God is not Law or commandment, nor does it require anything of us; but after the first Word, that of the Law, has done this work and distressful misery and poverty have been produced in the heart, God comes and offers His lovely, living Word, and promises, pledges, and obligates Himself to give grace and help, that we may get out of this misery and that all sins not only be forgiven but also blotted out... See, this divine promise of His grace and of the forgiveness of sin is properly called Gospel."&lt;ref&gt;Luther in translation by Christensen, C. C. (1979), ''Art and the Reformation in Germany''. Quoted in Kusukawa, Sachiko  (1995). ''The Transformation of Natural Philosophy: The Case of Philip Melanchthon'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The two halves of the panel can be seen as illustrating opposing theologies. Donald Ehresmann wrote in 1967, "The way to salvation set forth on the right side ... is strikingly contrasted to the way of damnation on the left side."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Noble, 41&lt;/ref&gt; A more nuanced approach asks the viewer to find a dynamic relationship between Law and Gospel. Art historian Bonnie Noble suggests that in Lutheranism, "law is also the means by which the necessity of grace becomes apparent.... The painting draws a boundary between the dynamics of law and gospel (Lutheran theology) on the one hand, and law on its own (Catholicism or Judaism) on the other".&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Cranach law and grace woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Law and Grace'', woodcut. Cranach, c. 1530]]

On the left, "Law" side of the Gotha painting, a naked man is tormented by a demon and a skeleton (Death) as they force him toward Hell. Other motifs on the left include [[Christ in Judgment]], the [[Fall of Man]], the [[Brazen Serpent]], and [[Moses]] with his tablets. On the right, "Gospel" side, a man interacts with [[John the Baptist]], who is pointing to Jesus as if to say, "He died for you."&lt;ref&gt;Kusukawa, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He stands before both [[Crucifixion of Christ|Christ on the Cross]] and the [[Risen Christ]], whose blood streams onto the man, through the [[Christian symbolism#Dove|Dove]] ([[Holy Spirit]]), making Christ's blood into "the saving waters of baptism".&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, 373&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lamb of God]] stands atop the trampled demons from the left half. A tree divides the two halves of the panel, shown dying on the left side but living on the "Gospel" side. The bottom of the Gotha painting has six columns of New Testament scripture in German, likely chosen by [[Philip Melanchthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 15, 27–32, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prague version unifies the two halves by portraying one man sitting in front of the tree, flanked by a prophet on the left and John the Baptist on the right, both of whom point towards Christ. The two panels can be read somewhat differently: it is easier for the viewer to identify with the man when he is the centered subject. Temporally, the Gotha panel shows two men simultaneously facing the consequences of past actions, while the man in the Prague panel clearly has a choice before him. While his "baser" lower body points to the "Law" side, his head and torso turn affirmatively toward John and the "Gospel" half. The painting includes many of the same symbols as the Gotha panel, such as the Brazen Serpent, Moses (at top left), the Fall, and the Crucified and Risen Christ. The [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] now stands on a hill at right. This panel originally contained text that labelled the motifs, but they were lost during cleaning. The Prague composition was the preferred one for many derivative works by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Erhard Altdorfer]], the engraver [[Geoffroy Tory]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Koerner, 398&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranach moved the Brazen Serpent motif from the left side in the original two panels to the right in later versions, such as the woodcut. It is an Old Testament story in which God punishes Israelites fleeing Egypt by inflicting them with serpents; they need only look upon the serpent placed on a cross by Moses to be saved. Luther considered the story an example of faith and illustrative of Gospel. The mixture of Old and New Testament concerns in both halves of the panels illustrates that Gospel is not only found in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Nadel, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:Lucas Cranach (I) - The Law and the Gospel.jpg|300px|thumb|''Law and Gospel'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]. Tempera panel. {{convert|72|x|88.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}]]

For Luther and Cranach, artworks such as ''Law and Gospel'' were intended to instill understanding of scripture and Lutheran thought, and the images were deemed acceptable so long as they were subordinate to the written word. The role of these Reformation ''Merkbilder'' contrasted with religious art in other parts of Europe, such as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] and [[Italian Renaissance painting]]. According to Bonnie Noble:

{{blockquote|Earlier art originated from nonscriptural sources and performed nebulous functions, such as to inspire pious meditations or even private visions. Pre-Reformation images could bestow merit upon the beholder and frequently became the objects of veneration themselves. The varied origins and functions of art before the Reformation offered a considerable amount of interpretive freedom to the beholder, a freedom that Lutheran views on images vehemently endeavored to curtail.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus the didactic format of the painting seeks to define and limit the viewer's response, making it ripe for art-historical criticism less enamored of such moral or instructive values. In one summary, Cranach's work is described as a "shallow fantasy" that fails to raise the "religious thought world of the Reformers ... to an artistic height"; it is "Protestant allegory overburdened with thoughts" and "overweighted with dry, didactic propagandistic content".&lt;ref&gt;Various critics collected by Weimer, 304–305&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has also been analyzed in terms of [[typology (theology)|typology]], in which correspondences between the Old and New Testaments are sought. In this case, the "Law" half is seen to illustrate the Old Testament, and the "Gospel" half the New Testament. For example, the "type" of Moses placing a serpent on a cross is answered by the "antitype" of the Crucifixion. The analysis is complicated by the appearance of Christ in Judgment, from the New Testament, on the "Law" side, and by the Old Testament's Brazen Serpent motif on the "Gospel" side in later versions of the panel.

'''Leon Rosselson''' (born 22 June 1934, Harrow, Middlesex) is an English songwriter and writer of children's books. After his early involvement in the [[folk music]] revival in Britain, he came to prominence, singing his own satirical songs, in the BBC's topical TV programme of the early 1960s, ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/583651/credits.html British Film Institute: Cast of 'That Was The Week That Was']&lt;/ref&gt; He toured Britain and abroad, singing mainly his own songs and accompanying himself with acoustic guitar.

In later years, he has published 17 children's books, the first of which, ''Rosa's Singing Grandfather'', was shortlisted in 1991 for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]].

He continues to write and perform his own songs, and to collaborate with other musicians and performers. Most of his material includes some sort of satirical content or elements of [[radical politics]].
[[File:Leon Rosselson performing, July 2013.jpg|thumb|450px|Leon Rosselson (right), performing with [[Ian Saville]] and "[[William Morris]]"]]

==The folk years==
Leon Rosselson was born and brought up in North London, lived in [[Tufnell Park]] and attended school in Highgate Road, adjacent to [[Parliament Hill Fields]]. His Jewish parents came to England as refugees from the [[Russian Empire]].

He joined the [[London Youth Choir]], formed by John Hasted and Eric Winter, which went to a number of [[World Youth Festival]]s in the 1950s.

At the end of that decade, two Scotsmen, [[Robin Hall]] (1936–1998) and [[Jimmie Macgregor]] (b. 1930), came to London and teamed up with [[Shirley Bland]] (Jimmie's wife) and Leon Rosselson to form a quartet called The Galliards. Rosselson played 5 string [[banjo]] and guitar and did most of the arrangements. Their repertoire consisted of folk songs. They made an EP and two LPs for [[Decca Records|Decca]] ('Scottish Choice' and 'A-Roving') and one LP for the American label, [[Monitor Records (New York)|Monitor]]. They also made a single for [[Topic Records|Topic]] of the [[Dave Arkin]]/[[Earl Robinson]] song 'The Ink Is Black'. The group broke up in 1963.

In 1964 Rosselson joined [[Marian Mackenzie]], [[Ralph Trainer]] and [[Martin Carthy]] (later replaced by [[Roy Bailey (folk singer)|Roy Bailey]]) in a group called The Three City Four. They concentrated on contemporary songs, including some of Rosselson's own, and made two LPs for Decca and for [[CBS]].

==That Was The Week That Was==
Britain's [[satire boom]] began on 24 November 1962 with the debut of a late-night Saturday television series called ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'', hosted by [[David Frost]]. It featured some of Rosselson's early satirical songs. The programme ran until 1963.

==Folk club singer==

His song 'Tim McGuire' (who loved to play with fire), written during this period, was the subject of a complaint from the Chairman of [[Staffordshire]] Fire Brigades when it was played a number of times on [[BBC]] radio. The BBC, however, refused to ban the song, despite the protests, because (they said) the pyromaniac does get caught in the end. An earlier recording, though, the Topic EP 'Songs for City Squares', was banned (or rather labelled 'for restricted listening only') by the BBC.

== With Roy Bailey ==

'Hugga Mugga' was released on the Leader label in 1971. Roy Bailey and Rosselson recorded 'That's Not The Way It's Got To Be' in 1975. Two other collaborations followed, 'Love, Loneliness and Laundry' (1977) and 'If I Knew Who the Enemy Was' (1979). Rosselson also scripted two shows for performance with Roy Bailey and [[Frankie Armstrong]]: the anti-nuclear 'No Cause for Alarm' and 'Love Loneliness and Laundry', about personal politics.

[[Billy Bragg]] took "The World Turned Upside Down" into the charts in 1985.  [[Dick Gaughan]] has also covered Rosselson's music ("The World Turned Upside Down" and "[[Stand Up for Judas]]").  [[The Dubliners]] covered ''[[Don't Get Married]]'' in 1987.

==Big Red Songs ==
The original ''Big Red Songbook'', a collection of socialist songs, came out in 1977. Rosselson produced a new collection ''The New Big Red Songbook'' in 2003.

==Spycatcher==
In 1987 three [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]] declared that [[Peter Wright]]'s book '[[Spycatcher]]' could not be published in Britain nor could any of it be quoted in the media. Rosselson set out to break the law. He spent two days reading it, then encapsulated it and quoted from it in a specially written song, ''Ballad of a Spycatcher'' which was published in the British weekly ''[[New Statesman]]''. A single of it, with backing from [[Billy Bragg]] and the [[Oyster Band]], was released and started to get radio play, including by [[Simon Bates]] on the BBC pop music channel [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]. He appeared to expect a police raid or court order. In the event, nothing happened. In Rosselson's words: "So much for subversive intentions." It reached number 7 in the [[NME]] indie singles charts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/05/folk The Guardian, 4 June 2009, 'A very modest provocateur']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's writer==
Rosselson has published 17 children's books. His first book, ''Rosa's Singing Grandfather'', published by [[Puffin Books|Puffin]], was shortlisted in 1991 for the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]].

In his most recent novel, ''Home is a Place Called Nowhere'' ([[Oxford University Press|OUP]]), Rosselson writes about the experience of being a refugee.

A '''limner''' is an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminator of manuscripts]], or more generally, a painter of ornamental decoration. One of the earliest mentions of a limner's work is found in the book ''Methods and Materials of Painting'' by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] (1793–1865).

{{quote|"The treatises [on oil painting] cannot be placed later than the thirteenth, or beginning of the fourteenth, century. This was the age of [[Dante]], and "the art which in Paris was called illuminating" (limning) is well illustrated by such guides." p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake. ''Methods and Materials of Painting''. Mineola, NY: [[Dover Publications]], 2001. {{ISBN|978-0486417264}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==United Kingdom==
In London in the mid-19th century the limner [[David Laurent de Lara]] established himself as a modern illuminator of manuscripts and documents.&lt;ref name=pal&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rubinstein |editor1-first=William L.|editor2-last=Jolles|editor2-first=Michael|editor3-last=Rubinstein |editor3-first=Hilary |title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History |isbn=9780230318946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spOxzrifZjcC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |chapter=Laurent de Lara, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work broke new ground and helped establish the idea of illumination as a contemporary artform in its own right, rather than as a historical artform.&lt;ref name=rowan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Rowan|editor1-last=Coomans D|editor1-first=Thomas|editor2-last=De Maeyer|editor2-first=Jan|title=The revival of medieval illumination : nineteenth-century Belgium manuscripts and illuminations from a european perspective = Renaissance de l'enluminure médiévale : manuscripts et enluminures belges du XIXe siècle et leur contexte européen |date=2007 |publisher=KADOC |location=Leuven |isbn=9789058675910 |pages=88–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VsLdTWjlnoC&amp;pg=PA88|chapter=Publishing for the Leisure Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of Her Majesty's [[Painter and Limner]] is a position within the [[Great Officer of State|Royal Household]] unique to Scotland. It is currently held by Dame Elizabeth Blackadder.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Birthdays Today 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The position of portrait painter to the royal household is honorary and for life.

==United States==
In early 19th-century America, a limner artist was one who had little if any formal training and would travel from place to place to solicit commissions.

Among colonial America's rising mercantile class, a limner was an unattributed [[portrait]] commissioned as a status symbol. The local landowners and merchants who commissioned these portraits posed in their finest clothes, in well-appointed interiors, or in landscapes that identified their position, property, good taste, and sophistication.

A late named artist who began in this genre is the [[Maine]] landscape artist [[Charles Codman]], who in Eastern Argus (April 1, 1831) is described as an "ornamental and sign painter" or "limner" who practiced "Military, Standard, Fancy, Ornamental, Masonic and Sign Painting".&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll, Jessica. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa654.htm "'The Real Pioneer of Art in this City': Charles Codman and the Rise of Landscape Painting in Portland, Maine". ''Resource Library Magazine'', July 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822120601/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/3aa/3aa654.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
The Victoria Limners Society was a group of artists working in Victoria, British Columbia from 1971 through 2008. They worked within a variety of artistic styles and mediums, such as painting, sculpting, pottery, and other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Bovey, Patricia. ''A Passion for Art: The Art and Dynamics of the Limners''. Victoria, B.C.: Sono Nis Press, 1996. {{ISBN|9781550390704}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists include Maxwell Bates, Pat Martin Bates, Richard Ciccimarra, Robert De Castro, Colin Graham, Helga Grove, Jan Grove, [[Elza Mayhew]], [[Myfanwy Pavelic]], Carole Sabiston, [[Herbert Siebner]], [[Robin Skelton]], and Karl Spreitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorybc.ca/limners-group-of-artists;isaar "Limners (Group of artists)"] MemoryBC&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[parodies]] and [[pastiches]] satirising ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Hergé]].

In addition to the twenty-four official comic albums written by [[Hergé]], several unofficial parodies and pastiches of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' have been published over the years by various authors. While some consist in entirely new drawings made to resemble the original art, others were created by splicing together strips from the original albums, and rewriting the dialogue.

The copyright owner of the original comics, Moulinsart, has taken legal steps to stop publication of some of the unofficial material.  Eric Jenot's Tintin Parodies site was closed down by Moulinsart in 2004 for displaying Tintin parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tintinologist.org/news/2004.html Tintin News Archive 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Other material has remained available, for instance the anarchist/communist comic ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free|Breaking Free]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tintinrevolution.free.fr/ ''Breaking Free'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parodies and satire==

Some parodies of Tintin feature the actual Tintin characters with their original identities and personalities, some feature the original characters but with wildly modified personalities, and some simply reuse the appearance of the characters but give them completely different names and identities.

They generally fall into one of two sub-sections:

=== Political ===

* ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free|Breaking Free]]'' by [[J. Daniels]] — [[Anarchist]]/[[Communist]] book about Tintin growing up in a poor working class area of [[England]] and about how he joins the revolution.
* ''Tintin in Lebanon'' — Tintin gets drawn into Middle eastern conflicts while in [[Lebanon]]. This comic was published in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', an American humour magazine, mocking the foreign policies of the Ronald Reagan administration.
[[File:RuddTintin.jpg|thumb|right|Tintin receives his copyright violation. A modified version of a [[Bill Leak]] satirical cartoon featuring [[Kevin Rudd]] in turn parodies [[Moulinsart]].]]
* ''Tintin en Irak'' (''Tintin in [[Iraq]]'') — published shortly after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], this comic uses actual panels from previous Tintin comics—with new text—to make a cynical statement about the events leading up to the war.
* ''Tintin au Salvador'' (''Tintin in [[El Salvador]]'') — Tintin battles the corrupt government of El Salvador.
* ''L'Énigme du 3ième message'' (''The Enigma of the 3rd Message'') — Tintin battles an international evil conspiracy involving the [[Pope]].
* ''Tintin dans le Golfe'' (''Tintin in the Gulf'')
* ''Juquin rénovateur du vingtième siècle au Pays de Soviets'' — This is a re-hash of ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' with French political leader [[Pierre Juquin]] being drawn instead of Tintin. It was published in the book ''Élysez-les tous'' by Jalons.
* ''Tintin in [[Fallujah]]'' — featured in ''[[Mad (magazine)|MAD]]'' magazine
* ''Les Harpes de Greenmore'' (''The Harps of Greenmore'') — Tintin is a [[Provisional IRA]] guerrilla fighting to re-unite [[Ireland]], after the British government kidnaps Calculus in an attempt to blame the IRA.
* Former Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]], then opposition leader, was portrayed as Tintin for at least 6 months in 2007 by political cartoonist [[Bill Leak]]. [[Moulinsart]] threatening legal action and demanded payment for past sales of the Rudd-Tintin likeness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1553330/Blistering-Barnacles!-Tintin-'parody'-threat.html Blistering Barnacles! Tintin 'parody' threat], [[The Daily Telegraph]], , 24 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Leak refused to give undertakings to cease using the character in future cartoons on the basis of the [[fair dealing]] exception for the purposes of parody and satire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilanchian.com.au/index.php/lightbulb-blog/23-ip-technology-e-business/290-fair-dealing-for-satire-but-tintins-not-laughing Fair dealing for satire, but Tintin's not laughing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624140617/http://www.dilanchian.com.au/index.php/lightbulb-blog/23-ip-technology-e-business/290-fair-dealing-for-satire-but-tintins-not-laughing |date=2015-06-24 }}, 24 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moulinsart]] conceded this point but continued to insist that Leak not profit commercially from publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21842711-2,00.html |title=Leak in the clear over Tintin |last=Wilson |first=Peter |date=2007-06-04 |work=[[news.com.au]] |accessdate=2015-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714171915/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C21842711-2%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pornographic ===

* ''[[Tintin in Thailand]]'' — Tintin goes to Thailand on a sex holiday.
* ''La vie sexuelle de Tintin'' (''The Sex Life of Tintin'')
* ''Tintin en Suisse'' (''Tintin in [[Switzerland]]'')
* ''Tintin à Paris'' (''Tintin in [[Paris]]'')
* ''Tientein en Bordélie'' (''Tintin in Brotheland'')
* ''Dindin et le secret de Moulinsal''
* ''Tintin pour les dames'' (''Tintin for Ladies'')

== Pastiches ==
* '''[[Yves Rodier]]''':
** ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'' — A "completed" version of Hergé's unfinished book. Available in colour and in French and English.
** ''The Lake of the Sorcerer'' — Tintin uncovers the mystery of a monster in a lake.
** ''A Day at the Airport'' — Rodier planned to complete the album debuted by Hergé as soon as his own version of the ''Alph-Art'' was completed. However, due to harsh reactions from the Moulinsart Foundation, Rodier decided to leave the project, though he did produce one page from the ''Airport'' album.
** ''Reporter Pigiste'' (''Freelance Reporter'') — 3-page story, made in autumn 1992, loosely based on a scenario suggested in issue No. 1027 of [[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]] from December 19, 1957: a young Tintin solves a bank robbery and gets his job with [[Le Petit Vingtiéme]]. The end of the story directly leads into ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets''.
**  ''Tintin and the Thermozéro'' — This page is an inking of page 4 from a leftover project of Hergé's.
* ''Tintin et l'Alph-art'' (''Tintin and Alph-art'') by "[[Ramo Nash]]" — This is a "completed" version of Hergé's unfinished ''[[Tintin and Alph-art]]''. It is only available in black-and-white, and in French.
* ''[[Tintin in the New World]]'' by [[Frederic Tuten]] — A prose novel, not illustrated, that got Hergé's permission shortly before his death. Tintin gets bored of adventures and falls in love.
* ''Tintin and the Flute of the Wendigo'' and ''Tintin in Australia'' by [[Conlan]].
* ''La Menace des Steppes'' (''The Terror of the Steppes'') by [[Sakharine (comics)|Sakharine]] — Tintin and Haddock battle Soviets in [[Afghanistan]].
* ''[[Teen Titans]] Spotlight'' #11, [[DC Comics]], 1987, "The Brotherhood is Dead", written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]], art by [[Joe Orlando]]
* ''Tum Tum and the Forged Expenses'' — At the height of its popularity in 1988, the ''[[Spitting Image]]'' television show produced a tie-in comic book featuring a Tintin spoof where Tum Tum, an alcoholic [[Fleet Street]] [[journalist]], follows a false lead to a drugs-smuggling operation at a [[Soho]] S&amp;M bar. Captain Haddock is portrayed as 'Captain Haddit', a leather-clad predatory homosexual. The Thomppson Twins (note the double ''p'') turn up at the end of the story to arrest Tum Tum for his forged expenses claims. Snowy is renamed 'Spewy', and ends up being run over by a car. The story makes numerous references to real Tintin adventures (most notably ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'') as well as fictional non-canonical ones (such as ''Tum Tum and the Cross-Eyed Vivisectionist'').
* ''Objectif Monde'' (''Destination World'') by [[Didier Savard]] — Released in ''[[Le Monde]]'' on January 28, 1999, to celebrate Tintin's 70th birthday and the Comics Festival in [[Angoulême]]. The Hergé Foundation gave its authorization and allowed the publication of this first "official" pastiche, fully approved by Hergé's beneficiaries. The short story, 26 pages long, makes numerous references to the adventures of Tintin. The main protagonist is a naive young reporter called Wzkxy, who is embroiled in an unlikely conspiracy theory — supposedly the Tintin books contained encoded messages aimed at the USSR. It has since been reprinted in various forms, and has also been translated into English by [[Vlipvlop]] (pseudonym) in early 2006.
* "Tim-Tim: Prisoners of the Red Planet," by [[Robert Sikoryak]] — A two-page parody of ''[[Destination Moon (comics)|Destination Moon]]'', about "Tim-Tim" on Mars, published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in July 2001.
*Tintin, Snowy, and Haddock all briefly appear in the comic ''[[Scarlet Traces]]'', by [[Ian Edginton]] and [[D'Israeli (cartoonist)|D'Israeli]].
*In [[Kim Newman]]'s novel ''[[Dracula Cha-Cha-Cha]]'', Tintin and Bianca Castafiore both appear. In his short story "Angels of Music", Bianca Castafiore is implied at being the descendant of the character [[Carlotta (The Phantom of the Opera)|Carlotta]] from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''.
* [[Jan Bucquoy]] made a pornographic parodic comic book album named ''La Vie Sexuelle de Tintin'' (''The Sexual Life of Tintin'') which has been banned in Belgium and France. In his film ''[[Camping Cosmos]]'' a lookalike of Tintin is one of the main characters. Despite having a different name his quiff, outfit and little white fox terrier are obviously referencing Tintin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.janpelleringfonds.be/Geschiedenis/biografieen/Belgen/pubwww/BUCQUOY%20Jan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naufrageur.com/a-sexe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ma Jolie''''' is an oil painting by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], USA. Completed in 1914, its fractured depiction of everyday objects is an early example of [[cubism]].&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not to be confused with [[Ma Jolie (Picasso, 1912)|the 1912 Picasso of the same name]], now in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

==Description==
Picasso used a limited palette to draw attention to the overlapping, fragmented shapes of common objects including musical instruments, sheet music, glasses, a bottle, and a cigarette. Rather than attempt to copy the world in paint, Picasso used the canvas to experiment with texture and form, fracturing the objects into geometric shapes and depicting them from multiple angles. He also displayed great creativity in the application of the paint, using a comb to create the lines on the sheet music and the recorder's wood grain.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Background information==
''Ma Jolie'' ("My Pretty One") was both a popular French song and the nickname of Picasso's lover, Eva Gouel (born Marcelle Humbert). Sheet music for the song can be seen in the background of the painting. This artwork represents Picasso's return to the oil paint medium after a period of experimentation with collage. Instead of using ready-made objects and materials to create textural effects, he used paint to imitate them, essentially reversing his experiments with collage. Using his new knowledge of texture to apply the syntax of collage to a painting, he raised questions about the very nature of the medium.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition history==
Picasso's dealer, [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] sold ''Ma Jolie'' to [[Katherine Dreier]], founder and president of the Société Anonymne, in 1922. Theodore Schempp of [[New York City]] acquired it in 1942, possibly from Karl Nierendorf.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Ma Jolie|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/ma-jolie-picasso-pablo|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the [[Herron School of Art]] debated purchasing it for $3,800, a suggestion which [[Booth Tarkington]], chairman of the Fine Arts Committee, laughed out of the room. Tarkington later regretted his display, mockingly justifying that it was "rather a distinction ''not'' to have ''either'' a [[Matisse]] or a Picasso." Devoted patron [[Caroline Marmon Fesler]], who missed the meeting due to illness, purchased the painting on her own and displayed it in the Herron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warkel|first1=Harriet Garcia|last2=Krause|first2=Martin F.|last3=Berry|first3=S.L.|title=The Herron Chronicle|year=2003|publisher=[[Herron School of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0253342376|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_Vr1C9DMj0C&amp;pg=PA1944&amp;lpg=PA1944&amp;dq=picasso+ma+jolie+1914&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ib6Xi2LRGu&amp;sig=Hq_6N7DXFg0rDdofyFMuZcYEMzc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AEytUI_wIqyayQGE7oDwBQ&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=picasso%20ma%20jolie%201914&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon her death in 1961, it was bequeathed to the IMA.

The '''''Madonna of Foligno''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Raphael]].  First painted on [[Panel painting|wood panel]], it was later [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]].

==History==
The painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti, chamberlain to [[Pope Julius II]], in 1511. It was placed on a high altar of the church of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli]] on [[Capitoline Hill]] ([[Italian language|Italian]]: Campidoglio) in [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="Champlin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings | editor=Champlin, J |editor2=Perkins, C | volume=3 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | year=1913 | page=138 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wgFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; where Sigismondo was buried in 1512.

It was moved by Anna Conti, a descendant of Sigismondi Conti, to the monastery of St. Anne in [[Foligno]] in 1565 and remained there for more than two centuries, hence the name.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;

In 1799 it was carried to Paris, France by Napoleon. There, in 1802, the painting was transferred from panel to canvas by Hacquin and restored by Roser of Heidelberg.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; A note was made by the restorer: "Rapporto dei cittadini Guijon Vincent Tannay e Berthollet sul ristauro dei quadri di Raffaello conosciuto sotto il nome di Madonna di Foligno." &lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;

In 1815, after the [[Battle of Waterloo]], it was returned to Italy, where it was placed in the room with the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; in the Pinacoteca Vaticana of the [[Vatican Museum]] in the [[Vatican City]].

==Description==
The painting is a ''[[Sacred conversation|sacra conversazione]],'' where holy figures seem to be in conversation and draw the audience into their discussion.&lt;ref name="Hersey"&gt;{{cite book | title=High Renaissance art in St. Peter's and the Vatican: An Interpretive Guide | author=Hersey, G | publisher=University of Chicago Press | location=Chicago | year=1993 | page=124 | isbn=0-226-32781-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs5zhwjSYAUC&amp;pg=PA124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than sitting under a canopy, of the Umbrian or Florentine style,&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; the Virgin is seated on clouds, embracing Jesus, while surrounded by angels. They look down upon Sigismonde de' Conti, kneeling in a red, fur lined cape.  Conti is presented by [[St. Jerome]] on the right with his lion, appealing for the Virgin's protection.  On the left are the kneeling [[St. Francis of Assisi]] and [[St. John the Baptist]], who is standing and wearing a tunic of skins. As St. John points to Jesus, he clearly looks out to us, pulling us in, while St. Francis points to us and looks at the Christ Child.  Between the men is an angel, linking the saints of earth to the seraph host of heaven. Behind them are the towers of Foligno.&lt;ref name="Champlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter"/&gt;

Painted during Raphael's Roman period, it is a testament to his artistic maturity, evidenced in the paintings composition, coloring and form.&lt;ref name="Ricci"&gt;{{cite book | title=Vatican: Its History Its Treasures | author=Ricci, C | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | location= | year=2003 | origyear=1914 | page=216 | isbn=0-7661-3941-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mu86ZWFl9GYC&amp;pg=PA216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Conti commissioned the painting to commemorate his survival of a shell that exploded near him during the Siege of Foligno, his hometown.  He credited his safety to heavenly intervention.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;{{cite book | title=Masters in Art: A Series of Illustrated Monographs | volume=1 | author= | publisher=Bates &amp; Guild Company | location=Boston | year=1900 | page=38 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oq4pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricci"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Vatican: Being a Brief History of the Palace, and an account of the Principal Art Treasures within its Walls | author=Potter, M | publisher=The Botolph Society | location=Boston | year=1912 | page=308 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7uS2GseeJsC&amp;pg=PA308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Massimo Polidoro]] this painting has been used by UFO websites as evidence of a flying saucer crash. What Polidoro says you are actually seeing is the house of Sigismondo Conti and a fireball. Painters at this time used "symbolic meanings that were anything but random." The angel is holding a sign with nothing written on it. According to Polidoro this was because Sigismondo died before he could tell Raphael what "thank you" to the Virgin he wanted written on the sign. Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, "reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures".&lt;ref name="Polidoro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polidoro|first1=Massimo|authorlink=Massimo Polidoro|title=Does the Vatican Hold a Painting of a UFO?|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=3|page=19|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negativland''' is an American [[experimental music]] band which originated in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the late 1970s. They took their name from a [[Neu!]] track,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/negativland-mt0012506492|title=Negativland - Neu! - Listen, Appearances, Song Review - AllMusic|author=Stewart Mason|work=AllMusic|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while their record label ([[Seeland Records]]) is named after another Neu! track.  The core of the band consists of [[Mark Hosler]], [[David Wills (musician)|David Wills (aka "The Weatherman")]], [[Peter Conheim]] and [[Wobbly (musician)|Jon Leidecker (aka "Wobbly")]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlevillagemag.com/the-pioneers-of-disruption-negativland-members-open-up-about-deceased-member-don-joyce-future-projects/ |title= The Pioneers of Disruption: Negativland members open up about deceased member Don Joyce, future projects |publisher=LittleVillageMag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Negativland has released a number of albums ranging from pure sound collage to more musical expositions. These have mostly been released on their own label, [[Seeland Records]].  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they produced several recordings for [[SST Records]], most notably ''[[Escape from Noise]]'', ''[[Helter Stupid]]'' and ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]''.  Negativland were sued by the band [[U2]]'s record label, [[Island Records]], and by [[SST Records]], which brought them widespread publicity and notoriety.

==History==

===1980s===
Negativland started in [[Concord, California|Concord]], [[California]], in 1979 around the core founding members of Lyons and Hosler (who were in high school at the time), and released an eponymous debut in 1980.

A number of releases followed in the early 1980s, but it wasn't until after the release of their breakthrough sample and cut-up sonic barrage ''[[Escape from Noise]]'' in 1987 that Negativland gained wider attention. Vinyl copies of the album came with "CAR BOMB" bumper stickers, in reference to the album's song "Car Bomb."

Following the somewhat unexpected success of this album, Negativland faced the prospect of going on a money-losing tour in 1988. To prevent this, they created a [[press release]] which said Negativland were prevented from touring by "Federal Authority Dick Jordan" because of claims that Negativland's song "[[Christianity Is Stupid]]" had inspired 16-year-old mass murderer [[David Brom]] to kill his family. The press release went on to vigorously deny the purported connection between Negativland and the murders. While Brom had in fact argued with his father about music shortly before Brom killed his family, no one had ever claimed that Brom was spurred to murder by Negativland's music. The claim that Brom's crimes were inspired by Negativland was disseminated and discussed in the [[mass media]], seemingly with little to no fact-checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |title=Negativland's "Helter Stupid" 20 Years Later - Cory Frye - Open Salon |publisher=Open.salon.com |accessdate=13 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127031224/http://open.salon.com/blog/coryfrye/2009/12/20/negativlands_helter_stupid_20_years_later |archivedate=November 27, 2013}}, page found at archive.org 2015-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the world was informed of the "Killer Song" that caused a kid to murder his parents with an ax.

The incident became the foundation for Negativland's next release, ''[[Helter Stupid]]'', which featured a cover photo of TV news anchorman [[Dave McElhatton]] intoning the Brom murder story, with the news station's caption "Killer Song" above his head, and a photo of the ax murderer.

=== ''U2'' record incident ===
Negativland's next project  was the ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]'' EP, with samples from ''[[American Top 40]]'' host [[Casey Kasem]]. In 1991, Negativland released a single with the title "U2" displayed in very large type on the front of the packaging, and "Negativland" in a smaller typeface. An image of the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane was also on the single cover.

The songs within were parodies of the group U2's well-known 1987 song "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]", including [[kazoo]]s and extensive sampling of the original song.  The song "The Letter U And The Numeral 2" features a musical backing to an extended profane rant from well-known [[disc jockey]] [[Casey Kasem]], lapsing out of his more polished and professional tone during a frustrating rehearsal which had gone out to many stations as raw feed and was taped by several engineers, who had been passing it around for a number of years. One of Kasem's milder comments was "These guys are from [[England]] and who gives a shit?" (U2 was actually formed in Ireland. Moments earlier he had read from his script, "the Irish band from Dublin".)

U2's label [[Island Records]] quickly sued Negativland, stating that placing the word "U2" on the cover violated trademark law, as did the song itself. Island Records also contended that the single was an attempt to deliberately confuse U2 fans, awaiting the impending release of ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', into purchasing what they believed was a new U2 album called ''Negativland''.

In June 1992, [[R. U. Sirius]], publisher of the magazine ''[[Mondo 2000]]'', came up with an idea. Publicists from U2 had contacted him regarding the possibility of interviewing [[The Edge|Dave "The Edge" Evans]], hoping to promote U2's impending multimillion-dollar [[Zoo TV Tour]], which featured found sounds and live sampling from mass media outlets (things for which Negativland had been known for some time). Sirius, unbeknownst to Edge, decided to have his friends Joyce and Hosler of Negativland conduct the interview. Joyce and Hosler, fresh from Island's lawsuit, peppered the Edge with questions regarding his ideas about the use of sampling in their new tour, and the legality of using copyrighted material without permission. Midway through the interview, Joyce and Hosler revealed their identities as members of Negativland. An embarrassed Edge reported that U2 were bothered by the sledgehammer legal approach Island Records took in their lawsuit, and furthermore that much of the legal wrangling took place without U2's knowledge: "by the time we [U2] realized what was going on it was kinda too late, and we actually did approach the record company on your [Negativland's] behalf and said, 'Look, c'mon, this is just, this is very heavy...'" Island Records reported to Negativland that U2 never authorized samples of their material; Evans' response was, "that's complete bollocks, there's like, there's at least six records out there that are direct samples from our stuff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=19 |title=Negativland Interviews U2's The Edge |publisher=Negativland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Joyce provided an audio cassette copy of the ''Mondo 2000'' interview with Evans to the U2 fan website U2Interview.com. The interview is freely available from this website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negativland And The Edge|url=http://www.u2interview.com/negativland-mondo-2000-interview/|publisher=U2Interview.com|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "U2" single (along with other related material) was re-released in 2001 on a "bootleg" album entitled ''[[These Guys Are from England and Who Gives a Shit]]'', released on "Seelard Records" (a parody of Negativland's record label Seeland Records). Negativland may have themselves been responsible for the re-release; although the Negativland website refers to this release as a bootleg, it is available from major retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Tower Records, as well as Negativland's own mail-order business.

Negativland are interested in [[intellectual property]] rights, and argue that their use of U2's and others' material falls under the [[fair use]] clause. In 1995, they released a book, with accompanying CD, called ''[[Fair Use: The Story of the Letter U and the Numeral 2]]'', about the whole U2 incident (from Island Records first suing Negativland for the release to Negativland gaining back control of their work four years later). The book ends with a large appendix of essays about fair use and copyright by Negativland and others, telling the story with newspaper clippings, court papers, faxes, press releases and other documents arranged in chronological order.  An unfortunate side effect of the Negativland-Island lawsuit was another one brought on between Negativland and SST, which served to sever all remaining ties the two had.  To get back at Negativland (while wryly circumventing their name), SST founder [[Greg Ginn]] later released the ''[[Negativ(e)land: Live on Tour]]'' album on SST.

Negativland were the main subjects of [[Craig Baldwin]]'s documentary ''[[Sonic Outlaws]]'', detailing the use of [[culture jamming]] to subvert the messages of more traditional media outlets. They also made an appearance in Brett Gaylor's 2009 copyright issue documentary, ''[[RiP: A Remix Manifesto]]''.

===ABCs and Teletubbies===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Neg02a.jpg|thumb|left|120px|]]   --&gt;
In 1999 Negativland collaborated with [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[anarchist]] band [[Chumbawamba]] to produce the EP ''[[The ABCs of Anarchism]]'', which is largely based around the writings of [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Cut-up technique|cut-up]] versions of Chumbawamba's hit song "Tubthumping", the theme tune to the children's program [[Teletubbies]] and the [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[Anarchy in the UK]]".

===2000s===
In 2003, members of Negativland contributed their efforts to [[Creative Commons]], a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share by providing alternative copyright licenses. In September 2002, Negativland spoofed [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel]] radio stations in an audio track broadcast by pirate radio broadcasters jamming a Seattle Clear Channel station while the National Association of Broadcasters met in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |title=News Archive: August 2003 |publisher=Diymedia.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703001229/http://diymedia.net/archive/0803.htm |archivedate=2010-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negativland.com/archives/003kjr/ KJR Prank]. "Negativland pranks clear channel, forces radio format change. For immediate release 8/25/2003".&lt;/ref&gt;

Former member Don Joyce long hosted a weekly radio show called [[Over the Edge (radio)|Over the Edge]] most Thursdays at midnight on [[KPFA]].  Recordings of some noteworthy episodes of the show have been released by Seeland in its ''Over the Edge'' series.

In September 2005, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, Negativland curated an art exhibit in Manhattan's [[Gigantic Artspace]] gallery. The exhibit, ''Negativlandland'', included a number of pieces of artwork from and inspired by Negativland recordings, video projection of music videos created by the band and others, and some artwork created specifically for the show, such as an animatronic Abraham Lincoln figure (inspired by the band's Lincoln cut-up piece ''God Bull'') and a hands-on exhibit featuring the ''Booper'', the audio-processing unit that band member David Wills (a.k.a. ''The Weatherman'') assembled out of old radio parts. The show appeared in [[Minneapolis]] on May 12, 2006, at Creative Electric Studios.

===2010s===

Former band member Ian Allen died on January 17, 2015, due to complications from heart valve surgery. He was 56 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2015.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club - January to June 2015|publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2015 Don Joyce, group member and host of Over The Edge, died of heart failure at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negativland.com/news/?p=696|title=Don Joyce (9 February 1944 – 22 July 2015)|work=Negativworldwidewebland|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, 2016, Richard Lyons died from complications of nodular melanoma following his 57th birthday party in a nursing facility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/richard-lyons-negativland-founder-dead-at-57-20160421 "Richard Lyons, Negativland Founder, Dead at 57", by Kory Grow, ''Rolling Stone'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/1Ui0zCM | title=Richard Lyons, 57, a Founder of the Subversive Band Negativland, Dies | publisher=New York Times | date=27 April 2016 | accessdate=11 July 2016 | author=Ratliff, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's latest album, ''Over the Edge Vol. 9: The Chopping Channel'', was released on October 21, 2016. Select copies of the album include a bag containing two grams of Don Joyce's cremated remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilton|first1=Robin|title=New Negativland Album Comes With A Bag Of A Band Member's Remains|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2016/10/18/498411077/new-negativland-album-comes-with-a-bag-of-a-band-members-remains|website=NPR.org|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nemuri-neko''' (眠り猫 or 眠猫, "sleeping cat", from ''nemuri'', "sleeping/peaceful" and ''neko'', "cat")}} is a famous [[wood carving]] by [[Hidari Jingorō]] (左甚五郎の作) located in the East corridor at [[Nikkō Tōshō-gū|Tōshō-gū Shrine]] (日光東照宮) in [[Nikkō]], [[Japan]].

The Japanese sleeping cat is modeled after the famous crouching nemurineko{{clarifyme | reason = which, if either, of 'the Japanese sleeping cat' and 'the famous crouching nemurineko' is the sculpture at Tōshō-gū Shrine mentioned earlier?|date=December 2012}} carving by Hidari Jingorō.
Based on the writing of [[Zempei Matsumura]]'s book, ''Nikkō Tōshō-gū Shrine and Jingorō Hidari'' published by [[Nohi Publishing Company]] in 1975:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hidari Jingorō loved cats and was fascinated by cats. Jingorō spent eight months in seclusion to refine his knowledge and technique in wood sculpturing. He spent the majority of his time studying, sculpturing, and carving wooden cats that appeared lifelike in various shapes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Matsumura, it was Jingorō's goal to carve and sculpture lifelike cats by making "utmost efforts in the future to create a new style in the field of sculpturing". 

Prior to his seclusion, Jingorō was an apprentice for the Chief Architect [[Hokyo Yoheiji Yusa]] of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]] where he studied how to build temples, shrines, and sculptures. 

Through Jingorō's insight and new technique, animal sculpturing would take a new direction in Japan, a realistic appearance of an animal due to fine detailed sculpturing by the artist. Jingorō's approach in detailed wood sculpturing would later have an effect in other areas of Japanese art, namely, ceramic animals. 

This creative attention to detailing sculptured cats can be seen throughout the history of Japan, and more applicably in the ceramic arts. It is the fine detailed realistic life like cats that fascinates cat collectors, and makes these special type of cats highly desirable and collectible.

Matsumura also states, Nemuri Neko "Sleeping Cat symbolizes Nikkō or the Spirit of Ieyasu, who was thought to be the manifestation of [[Yakushi Nyorai]]", the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of Healing, who offers medicinal remedies, gives nourishment to the mind, body, and spirit, and comforts the sick and cures illnesses.

The nemuri neko is a National Treasure in Japan, and has been of inspiration to Japanese artists and artists around the world for centuries.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

== Version history ==
NewPipe was originally released as Version 0.3 on 4 September 2015 and was created by Christian Schabesberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newpipe.schabi.org/press/|title=About NewPipe|last=Schabesberger|first=Christian|date=March 2018|website=NewPipe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable updates include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases|title=TeamNewPipe/NewPipe Releases|last=Schabesberger|first=Christian|date=|website=|via=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support for displaying YouTube Channels (since 0.8.5)

== Technology ==
NewPipe does not use the official [[YouTube API]], but instead scrapes the website for video and meta-data (such as likes, dislikes, and views). This is done intentionally to decrease the amount of data shared with [[Google]]. The [[Web scraping|web-scraping]] tool is called the NewPipe-Extractor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor|title=TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor|last=Schabesberger|first=Christian|date=|website=|via=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a stand-alone project. It is also used in the free and open-source app SkyTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ram-on/SkyTube|title=ram-on/SkyTube|last=|first=|date=|via=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In newer versions of the app, the Extractor supports both YouTube and SoundCloud, and there are plans to extend it to more platforms.

Because of the way NewPipe accesses YouTube without using the API or displaying [[Online advertising|advertisements]], it would be in conflict with the Google [[terms of service]] if it were available on the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slashgear.com/newpipe-youtube-android-app-with-more-controls-and-no-google-20492117/|title=NewPipe – YouTube Android app with more controls and no Google|last=Torres|first=J.

[[File:Nala Damayanti.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Nala]]-[[Damayanti]] theme, from the [[Mahabharat]] in Pahari style]]
'''Pahari painting''' (literally   meaning a painting from the mountainous regions: ''pahar'' means a mountain in [[Hindi]]) is an umbrella term used for a form of [[Indian painting]], done mostly in miniature forms, originating from Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India, during 17th-19th century, notably [[Basohli]], Mankot, [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Kangra State|Kangra]], [[Guler State|Guler]], [[Mandi State|Mandi]], and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/asia_features/sikhism/art/hindu/index.html Hindu Hill Kingdoms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330034200/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/asia_features/sikhism/art/hindu/index.html |date=30 March 2010 }} ''[[V&amp;A Museum]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/art/pahari.htm Pahari] ''Kamat''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nainsukh]] was a famous master of the mid-18th century, followed by his family workshop for another two generations.

==Origin and area==
[[File:Radha celebrating Holi, c1788.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Radha]] celebrating ''[[Holi]]'', ca 1788.]]

The Pahari school developed and flourished during 17th-19th centuries stretching from [[Jammu]] to [[Almora]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], in the sub-[[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[India]], through [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense [[Basohli Painting]], originating from [[Basohli]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], to the delicate and lyrical [[Kangra paintings]], which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed.  The Kangra style reached its pinnacle with paintings of [[Works of Jayadeva#Pahari paintings|Radha and Krishna]], inspired by [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]]'s [[Gita Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EGUpX1O0hoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA62&amp;dq=Kangra+painting&amp;as_brr=0 Pahari centres] ''Arts of India: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Dance and Handicraft'', by Krishna Chaitanya. Published by Abhinav Publications, 1987. {{ISBN|81-7017-209-8}}. ''Page 62''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pahari painting grew out of the [[Mughal painting]], though this was patronized mostly by the Rajput kings who ruled many parts of the region, and gave birth to a new idiom in Indian painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturopedia.com/Painting/pahari.html Pahari]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4088">[[File:Gerard van Papenbroeck.jpg|thumb|Lubbert Gerritsz. Yserman, one of the paintings in the collection]]
The '''Papenbroek Collection''' is one of the largest 18th-century Dutch art collections.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of its owner, [[Gerard van Papenbroek]] (1673&amp;ndash;1743), the antiquities were bequeathed to [[Leiden University]]. These antiquities would become the earliest collection of the Dutch [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]], and have been called a "decisive factor for the creation of the first academic chair of archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The portraits and manuscripts were divided between Leiden University and the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;M. van Roon, 'Getuigenissen van Geleerde mannen en Braave dichteren, de verzameling van de Amsterdamse koopman-verzamelaar Gerardus van Papenbroeck (1673-1743)', ''Jaarboek Amstelodamum'' 84 (1992), p. 41-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Gerard van Papenbroek was a member of the city elite in [[Amsterdam]], had been an [[alderman]] and became a [[burgomaster]] of the city in 1723. He began collecting art, a common pastime for the elite of the period. Instead of traveling to the Mediterranean he used his fortune to buy antiquities from other collectors at auctions. In this way Papenbroek gathered a part of the [[Reynst Collection]] and pieces from many other famous and lesser known collectors, including some Roman antiquities that had belonged to the Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 14-5&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life Papenbroek put the collection on display in his townhouse, his country house and in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in Amsterdam. He attempted to have the collection published, but this would not be done until after his death.

When Papenbroek died in October 1743 his will stipulated that his collection of antiquities should go to Leiden University and was to be put on public display.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The university thus gained about 150 pieces, which were welcomed with an official academic session after they had been arranged for public viewing. In 1746 a professor from Leiden published an illustrated catalogue of the collection, but after that little attention was paid to the antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;Halbertsma, R. B. (2003). ''Scholars, Travellers, and Trade: The Pioneer Years of the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, 1818-1840'', Routledge, p. 17-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] would be founded in the early 19th century, and the world's first professor of [[archaeology]], [[Caspar Reuvens]], would transform the 'archaeological cabinet' into a real museum.

His collections of portraits and manuscripts were divided between Leiden University and the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam. Amsterdam also received the painting ''View on the ruins of Palmyra'', the oldest known depiction of the legendary desert city of [[Palmyra]], in modern-day Syria, painted by [[G. Hofstede]] in 1693.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3382">'''Princess Rosette''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] written by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Madame d'Aulnoy]], ''Les Contes des Fees'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/aulnoy/1892/princessrosette.html "Princess Rosette"]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Red Fairy Book'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/aulnoy/rosette.html "Princess Rosette"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]] included an orally collected tale, ''The King of the Peacocks'', in his ''[[Italian Folktales]]'', but observed in the notes that it was clearly a variant on ''Princess Rosette''.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 735 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

A [[king]] and [[queen consort|queen]], who had two sons, had a daughter as well.  All the fairies came to the christening.  When the queen pressed them to [[self-fulfilling prophecy#Classic|predict]] Rosette's future, they said that she might cause great misfortune to her brothers, and even their deaths.  The king and queen consulted with a hermit, who advised them to lock Rosette in a tower.  They did so, but one day they died, and their sons instantly freed her from it.  She marveled at everything, but in particular, at a peacock.  When she heard that people sometimes ate them, she declared that she would never marry anyone except the King of the Peacocks, and then she would protect her subjects.

Her brothers, the new king and the prince, set out to find the King of the Peacocks, and at last were directed there by the King of the Mayflies.  There, they showed the king Rosette's portrait.  He said he would marry her if she was as beautiful, but kill them both if she was not.

When the news came, Princess Rosette set out with her nurse.  The nurse bribed the boatman to throw the princess, bed and all, with her little dog, into the sea in the middle of the night.  The bed was made of [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] feathers and floated, but the nurse put her own [[False hero|daughter]] in the princess's place.  The outraged king was about to execute her brothers, who persuaded him to give them seven days to prove their innocence.

When the princess woke, she was convinced that the king had decided not to marry her after all, and so had her thrown into the sea.  An old man saw her on the shore and brought her to shelter, but saw by her possessions that she was a great lady, and he could only give her meager fare.  The princess sent her dog to the best kitchen in town, and the dog stole all the food being cooked for the King of the Peacocks.  This happened for several days, until the Prime Minister spied on the kitchen, saw the dog, and followed it.  He told the king, and they went to the hut and seized Rosette and the old man.  The old man begged for mercy and told the story, and the king realized that this was his bride.  He freed her brothers and married her.

'''Protofeminism''' is a philosophical tradition that anticipates modern [[feminism]] in an era when the concept of feminism was still unknown,&lt;ref&gt;Botting Eileen H, Houser Sarah L. "Drawing the Line of Equality: Hannah Mather Crocker on Women's Rights". ''American Political Science Review'' (2006), 100, pp. 265–278.&lt;/ref&gt; i. e. before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott]], 1987. ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen M. Offen, 2000. European Feminisms, 1700–1950: A Political History. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise usage is disputed, as [[18th-century feminism]] and [[19th-century feminism]] are subsumed under "feminism". The usefulness of the term ''protofeminist'' has been rejected by some modern scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Margaret. Feminism in time. Modern Language Quarterly 2004 65(1), pp. 7–27&lt;/ref&gt; as has the term [[postfeminism|''postfeminist'']].

==History==
{{see also|History of feminism}}

===Ancient Greece===
[[Plato]], according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, "[argued] for the total political and sexual equality of women, advocating that they be members of his highest class,&amp;nbsp;... those who rule and fight".&lt;ref&gt;Baruch, Elaine Hoffman, ''Women in Men's Utopias'', in Rohrlich, Ruby, &amp; Elaine Hoffman Baruch, eds., ''Women in Search of Utopia'', ''op. cit.'', p. [209] and see p. 211 (Plato supporting "child care" so women could be soldiers), citing, at p. [209] n. 1, Plato, trans. Francis MacDonald Cornford, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (N.Y.: Oxford Univ. Press, 1973), Book V.&lt;/ref&gt; Book five of [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' discusses the role of women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Are dogs divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? Or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Republic'' states that women in Plato's ideal state should work alongside men, receive equal education, and share equally in all aspects of the state. The sole exception involved women working in capacities which required less physical strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plato |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |title=The Republic  |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.6.v.html |website=classics.mit.edu |accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic world===
{{see also|Islamic feminism|Women in Islam}}

While in the pre-modern period there was no formal feminist movement in Islamic nations, there were a number of important figures who argued for improving women's rights and autonomy. The medieval mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] argued that while men were favored over women as prophets, women were just as capable of [[Wali|sainthood]] as men.&lt;ref name=Hakim-2002&gt;{{citation |title=Ibn 'Arabî's Twofold Perception of Woman: Woman as Human Being and Cosmic Principle |first=Souad |last=Hakim |journal=Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society |volume=31 |year=2002 |pages=1–29 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 12th century, the [[Sunni]] scholar [[Ibn Asakir]] wrote that women could study and earn ''[[ijazah]]s'' in order to transmit religious texts like the [[hadiths]]. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |first=James E. |last=Lindsay |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |pages=196 &amp; 198 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336), who was appalled by women speaking in loud voices and exposing their ''[[Awrah|'awra]]'' in the presence of men while listening to the recitation of books.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |first=James E. |last=Lindsay |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-313-32270-8 |page=198 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, the [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] wrote a commentary on Plato's ''Republic'' in which he examined Plato's views on equality between the sexes. He concluded that while men were stronger than women, it was still possible for women to perform the same duties as men. In his ''Bidayat al-mujtahid'' (The Distinguished Jurist's Primer), he added that these duties could include participation in warfare, and he expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that women in his society were typically limited to being mothers and wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Some Considerations on Averroes' Views Regarding Women and Their Role in Society |last1=Belo |first1=Catarina |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |year=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1 |page=6-15 |doi=10.1093/jis/etn061}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of women are said to have participated in or helped direct battles during the [[Muslim conquests]] and [[Fitna (word)|fitnas]], including [[Nusaybah bint Ka'ab]] and [[Aisha]].&lt;ref name="Baghdad"&gt;{{Citation |last=Black |first=Edwin |title=Banking on Baghdad: Inside Iraq's 7,000 Year History of War, Profit, and Conflict |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year= 2004 |isbn=0-471-70895-X |page=34 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Europe===
In medieval Europe, the dominant view of women was that they were intellectually and morally weaker than men, tainted by Eve's original sin according to the biblical tradition. This was used as a justification for many restriction placed on women, such as not being allowed to own property or the obligation to obey their fathers or husbands at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/the-middle-ages/articles/women-in-medieval-society |title=Women in medieval society |last=|first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this view, along with the restrictions derived from it, raised objections already in medieval times. Protofeminists from the [[Middle Ages]] recognized as important participants in the development of feminism include [[Marie de France]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], [[Bettisia Gozzadini]], [[Nicola de la Haye]], [[Christine de Pizan]], [[Jadwiga of Poland]], [[Laura Cereta]], and [[La Malinche]].&lt;ref&gt;Blain, Virginia, et al. ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English'' (Yale UP, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's role in the Peasants' Revolt====
The [[Peasants’ Revolt]] of 1381 was a rebellion of the late [[Middle Ages]] against British serfdom, and many women played prominent roles in it. On June 14, 1381, [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Simon of Sudbury was dragged from the Tower of London and beheaded. The leader of the group was Johanna Ferrour, who ordered this violent action due to Sudbury's harsh poll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peasants' Revolt: The Time When Women Took Up Arms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18373149 |accessdate=8 April 2013}},&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrour also ordered the beheading of the Lord High Treasurer, Sir Robert Hales, for his role in the poll tax.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peasants' Revolt: The Time When Women Took Up Arms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18373149 |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to leading these rebels, Ferrour burned down the Savoy Palace and stole a duke’s chest of gold. The Chief Justice [[John Cavendish]] was beheaded by Katherine Gamen, another female leader.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

According to an Associate Professor of English at Bates College, Sylvia Federico, women often had the strongest desire to participate in revolts, especially this one in particular. These women did everything that the men did; they were just as violent, if not more, in their actions in order to rebel against the government. Johanna Ferrour was not the only female who was a leader within this revolt; there were quite a few more involved—one woman was indicted for encouraging an attack against a prison at Maidstone in Kent, while another female leader was responsible for the robbing of a multitude of mansions, which frightened servants so much that they did not feel safe enough to return afterwards. Although there were not many female leaders within this rebellion, there was a surprisingly large number of women who were a part of the crowd. For instance, there were seventy female rebels in Suffolk.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom, Melissa 2012"&gt;Hogenboom, Melissa. "Peasants' Revolt: The time when women took up arms." ''BBC News.'' BBC News Magazine, 14 June 2012. Web. 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women who were involved in this rebellion had valid reasons for desiring to participate, and in some instances, to take on the role of leader. The poll tax of 1380 was much tougher on married women, so it is not the least bit surprising that women were as violent as men, if not more so, in their involvement in the peasants' revolt. The various extreme acts of violence displayed by them exhibited their mounting hatred towards the government.&lt;ref name="Hogenboom, Melissa 2012"/&gt;

===European Renaissance===
==== Restrictions on women ====
[[File:Christine de Pisan - cathedra.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christine de Pizan]] lecturing to a group of men.]]At the beginning of the renaissance, women's sole role and social value was held to be reproduction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=167 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gender role defined a woman's main identity and purpose in life. [[Socrates]], a well-known exemplar of the love of wisdom to the [[Renaissance]] humanists, said that he tolerated his first wife [[Xanthippe]], because she bore him sons, in the same way one tolerated the noise of geese because they produce eggs and chicks.&lt;ref&gt;[Manetti, Giannozzo. "Life of Socrates"]&lt;/ref&gt; This analogy perpetuated the claim that a woman's sole role was reproduction.

Marriage during the [[Renaissance]] defined a woman: she was whom she married. An unmarried woman was the property of her father, and once married, she became the property of her husband. She had few rights, except for privileges granted by her husband or father. Married women were required to obey their husbands and were expected to be chaste, obedient, pleasant, gentle, submissive, and, unless sweet-spoken, silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=159–160 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1593 play, [[The Taming of the Shrew]], Katherina is considered unmarriageable due to her headstrong and outspoken nature, in contrast to her mild-mannered sister Bianca. Katherina is seen as a wayward woman{{spaced ndash}}a shrew{{spaced ndash}}who needs to be tamed into submission. When Petruchio tames her, she readily goes to him when he summons her, almost like a dog. Her submissiveness is applauded, and the crowds at the party accept her as a proper woman since she is now "conformable to other household Kates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ9lAjbtd_YC&amp;dq=The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew&amp;f=false |title=Taming of the shrew |last=Shakespeare |first=William |date=1898-01-01 |publisher=American Book Co. |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that most women were barely educated. In a letter to Lady Baptista Maletesta of Montefeltro in 1424, the humanist [[Leonardo Bruni]] wrote: "While you live in these times when learning has so far decayed that it is regarded as positively miraculous to meet a learned man, let alone a woman."&lt;ref name="Bruni, Leonardo 1494"&gt;[Bruni, Leonardo. "Study of Literature to Lady Baptista Maletesta of Montefeltro," 1494.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bruni himself thought that women had no need of an education because they were not engaged in the social forums in which educated discourse is required. In the same letter he wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;
For why should the subtleties of...a thousand...rhetorical conundra consume the powers of a woman, who never sees the forum? The contests of the forum, like those of warfare and battle, are the sphere of men. Hers is not the task of learning to speak for and against witnesses, for and against torture, for and against reputation.... She will, in a word, leave the rough-and-tumble of the forum entirely to men."&lt;ref name="Bruni, Leonardo 1494"/&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The famous [[Renaissance]] salons that held intelligent debate and lectures were not welcoming to women. This denial of access to public forums led to problems for educated women, and contributed to the unlikelihood that a woman would obtain an education in the first place.

===="Witch literature"====
Starting with the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], Renaissance Europe saw the publication of numerous treatises on witches: their essence, their characteristics, ways to spot, prosecute and punish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Discours Execrable Des Sorciers: Ensemble leur Procez, faits depuis 2. ans en çà, en diuers endroicts de la France. Avec une instruction pour un Juge, en faict de Sorcelerie... |last=Boguet |first=Heneri |publisher= |year=1603 |isbn= |location=Rouen |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Compendium maleficarum |last=Guazzo |first=Francesco |publisher= |year=1608 |isbn= |location=Milan |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to reinforce and perpetuate the view of women as morally corrupt sinners as well as keep in place the restrictions placed on them.

====Advocating women's education and learning====
However, not everyone agreed with this negative view of women and the restrictions placed on them. [[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that "the first time we see a woman take up her pen in defense of her sex" was when [[Christine de Pizan]]  wrote ''Épître au Dieu d'Amour'' (Epistle to the God of Love) and ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'', at the turn of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=de Beauvoir, Simone |first=English translation 1953 |title=The Second Sex |pages=105 |year=1989 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0-679-72451-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early male advocate of women's superiority was [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] wrote ''The Superior Excellence of Women Over Men''.&lt;ref name="Schneir-1994"&gt;{{Citation |author=Schneir, Miram |first=1972 |title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings |page=xiv |year=1994 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0-679-75381-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catherine of Aragon]], the first official female ambassador in European history, commissioned a book by [[Juan Luis Vives]] arguing that women had a right to an education, and encouraged and popularized education for women in England during her time as Henry VIII's wife.

[[Joan Lluís Vives|Vives]] and fellow [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] [[Rodolphus Agricola|Agricola]] argued that aristocratic women at least required education. [[Roger Ascham]] educated [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], who read Latin and Greek and wrote [[occasional poems]], such as ''[[On Monsieur's Departure]]'', that are still anthologized. Elizabeth I was described as having talent without a woman's weakness, industry with a man's perseverance, and the body of a weak and feeble woman, but with the heart and stomach of a king.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The only way she could be seen as a good ruler was for her to be described with manly qualities. Being a powerful and successful woman during the [[Renaissance]], like [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] meant in some ways being male, a perception that gravely limited women's potential as women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While women of the aristocracy had greater chances of receiving an education, it was not impossible for lower-class women to become literate. A woman named Margherita, living during the [[Renaissance]], learned to read and write at the age of about 30, so there would be no mediator for the letters exchanged between her and her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Becoming_Visible.html?id=Ve8pAAAAYAAJ |title=Becoming Visible: Women in European History |last=Bridenthal |first=Renate |last2=Koonz |first2=Claudia |last3=Stuard |first3=Susan Mosher |date=1987-01-01 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year= |isbn=9780395419502 |location= |pages=160 |language=en |quote= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Margherita did defy [[gender role]]s, she became literate not in order to become a more enlightened person, but because she wanted to be a better wife by gaining the ability to communicate with her husband directly. 

====Learned women of Early Modern Europe====
Women who did receive an education often achieved high standards of learning and wrote in defence of women and their rights. One example is the 16th century [[Venice, Italy|Venetian]] author [[Moderata Fonte|Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi]], who wrote about the superiority of women.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Anna Garlin and Mitchell Kennerly, eds. ''The Drama of a Woman of Genius''. NY: Forum Publications, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] (c. 1532-1625) was born into an enlightened family in [[Cremona]]. She and her sisters were educated to male standards, and four out of five sisters became professional painters. Sofonisba was the most successful of all, crowning her career as court painter to the Spanish king [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].

====The Reformation====
The [[Reformation]] was an important milestone for the development of women's rights and education. As the protestant faith was based on each believer's direct interaction with God, the ability to read the [[Bible]] and prayer books suddenly became a necessity for everybody, including women and girls. Therefore, protestant communities started to set up schools where ordinary boys and girls were taught basic literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/the-protestant-education-in-the-xvith-century/ |title=The protestant education in the 16th century |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Protestantism]] no longer saw women as weak and evil sinners; rather, women were worthy companions of men and should be educated in order to become capable wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faithmatters.us/women-in-the-protestant-reform/ |title=Women in the Protestant reform |last= |first= |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventeenth century===
====Nonconformism, protectorate and restoration====
[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645), the last love of [[Michel de Montaigne]], edited the third edition of Montaigne's ''[[Essays (book)|Essays]]'' after his death. She also wrote two feminist essays, ''The Equality of Men and Women'' (1622) and ''The Ladies' Grievance'' (1626). In 1673, [[François Poullain de la Barre]] wrote ''De l'égalité des deux sexes'' (On the equality of the two sexes).&lt;ref name=Schneir-1994 /&gt;

The 17th century saw the development of many [[nonconformist]] sects, such as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], which allowed more freedom of expression to women than the established religions. Noted feminist writers on religion and spirituality included [[Rachel Speght]], Katherine Evans, Sarah Chevers, [[Margaret Fell]] (a founding member of the Quakers), and [[Sarah Blackborow]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]]. The weaker vessel: Women's lot in seventeenth century England. Phoenix, London 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall-Wyatt, Sherrin. Women in the Reformation era. In, Becoming visible: Women in European history, Renate Bridenthal and [[Claudia Koonz]] (eds.) Houghton-Mifflin, Boston 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, K. Women and the Civil War sects. 1958 Past and Present 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency continued in the prominence of some female ministers and writers such as [[Mary Mollineux]] and [[Barbara Blaugdone]] in the early decades of Quakerism.&lt;ref&gt;''Persecution and Pluralism: Calvinists and Religious Minorities in Early....''  By Richard Bonney, David J. B. Trim. [https://books.google.hu/books?id=jQJuObBQerIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Persecution+and+Pluralism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=afmGVanxD4roywPwpIrwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Persecution%20and%20Pluralism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, though, women who preached or expressed opinions on religion were in danger of being suspected of lunacy or witchcraft, and many, like [[Anne Askew]], who was burned at the stake for heresy,&lt;ref name="lerner"&gt;[http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/lerner.html Lerner, Gerda. "Religion and the creation of feminist consciousness". Harvard Divinity Bulletin November 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506000541/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/articles/lerner.html |date=2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; died "for their implicit or explicit challenge to the patriarchal order".&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Claire Goldberg. ''French Feminism in the 19th Century''. 1984, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Persecution of witches.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Burning of witches]]]] In France and England, feminist ideas were attributes of [[heterodoxy]], such as the [[Waldensians]] and [[Catharism|Catharists]], rather than orthodoxy. Religious egalitarianism, such as that embraced by the [[Levellers]], carried over into gender equality, and therefore had political implications. Leveller women mounted large-scale public demonstrations and petitions for equal rights, although dismissed by the authorities of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html/ |title=British Women's Emancipation Since the Renaissance |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426092251/http://www.historyofwomen.org/politicalpre1850.html |archivedate=26 April 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th century also saw more women writers emerging, such as [[Anne Bradstreet]], [[Bathsua Makin]], [[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle, Lady [[Mary Wroth]],&lt;ref&gt;The poems of Lady Mary Roth. Roberts, Josephine A (ed.) Louisiana State University 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer|Greer, Germaine]]. Slip-shod sybils Penguin 1999, at 15-6&lt;/ref&gt;, the anonymous [[Eugenia (Lady of Quality)|Eugenia]], [[Mary Chudleigh]], and [[Mary Astell]], who depicted women's changing roles and made pleas for their education. However, they encountered considerable hostility, as exemplified by the experiences of Cavendish, and Wroth whose work was not published till the 20th century.

Seventeenth-century France also saw the rise of [[salon (gathering)|salon]]s, cultural gathering places of the upper-class intelligentsia, which were run by women and in which they participated as artists.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Claire Moses. ''French Feminism in the 19th Century''. Syracuse: State University of New York, 1985, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But while women were granted salon membership, they stayed in the background, writing "but not for [publication]".&lt;ref&gt;Bodek, Evelyn Gordon. "Salonieres and Bluestockings: Educated Obsolescence and Germinating Feminism." ''Feminist Studies'' 3 (Spring-Summer 1976), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the limited role played by women in the salons, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] thought them a "threat to the 'natural' dominance of men".&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Claire Moses, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Astell is frequently described as the first feminist writer. However, this depiction fails to recognise the intellectual debt she owed to [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Bathsua Makin]] and other women who preceded her. She was certainly one of the earliest feminist writers in English, whose analyses are as relevant today as in her own time, and moved beyond earlier writers by instituting educational institutions for women.&lt;ref name="kinnaird"&gt;Kinnaird, Joan. "Mary Astell: Inspired by ideas" in D.Spender, ed., ''Feminist Theories'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walters"/&gt; Astell and [[Aphra Behn]] together laid the groundwork for feminist theory in the seventeenth century. No woman would speak out as strongly again for another century. In historical accounts, Astell is often overshadowed by her younger and more colourful friend and correspondent [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].

The liberalization of social values and secularization of the [[English Restoration]] provided new opportunities for women in the arts, an opportunity that women used to advance their cause. However, female playwrights encountered similar hostility. These included [[Catherine Trotter Cockburn|Catherine Trotter]], Mary Manley and [[Mary Pix]]. The most influential of all&lt;ref name="walters"&gt;Walters, Margaret. "Feminism: A very short introduction". Oxford University 2005 ({{ISBN|0-19-280510-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goreau, Angeline. Aphra Behn: A scandal to modesty (c. 1640-1689) in Spender op. cit., pp. 8-27,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Woolf|Woolf, Virginia]]. A room of one's own. 1928, at 65.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Aphra Behn]], the first Englishwoman to achieve the status of a professional writer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Todd]]. ''The Secret Life of Aphra Behn''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a novelist, playwright, and political propagandist.&lt;ref name="Janet Todd, p. 2"&gt;Janet Todd, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful during her lifetime, Behn was often vilified as "unwomanly" by 18th-century writers like [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Samuel Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Janet Todd, p. 2"/&gt; Likewise, the 19th-century critic Julia Kavanagh said that "instead of raising man to woman's moral standards [Behn] sank to the level of man's courseness".&lt;ref&gt;Kavanagh, Julia. ''English Women of Letters''. (London, 1863), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, Behn gained a wider readership and critical acceptance. [[Virginia Woolf]] praised her career and wrote, "All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the grave of Aphra Behn...for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds".&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, Virginia. ''A Room of One's Own''. NY: Penguin Books, 1989, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[continental Europe]], important feminist writers included [[Marguerite de Navarre]], [[Marie de Gournay]], and [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], who mounted attacks on misogyny and promoted the education of women. In [[Switzerland]], the first printed publication by a woman appeared in 1694: in ''Glaubens-Rechenschafft'', [[Hortensia von Moos]] argued against the precept that women should stay silent. The previous year, 1693, saw the publication of an anonymous tract entitled ''Rose der Freyheit'' (Rose of Freedom). In it, the author denounces male dominance and abuse of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Färber |first=Silvio |date=2011 |title="Die Rose der Freyheit": eine radikal-feministische Streitschrift von "Camilla" aus dem Jahre 1693 |url=https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=jgr-003:2011:141::90#90 |journal=Jahrbuch der Historischen Gesellschaft Graubünden |volume= |pages=85-174 |via=e-periodica.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New World, the Mexican [[nun]], [[Juana Ines de la Cruz]] (1651–1695), advanced the education of women particularly in her essay "Reply to Sor Philotea."&lt;ref&gt;Juana Inés de la Cruz, Sor. Respuesta a Sor Filotea 1691. pub posthum. Madrid 1700&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the seventeenth century women's voices were becoming increasingly heard at least by educated women. The literature of the last decades of the century was sometimes referred to as the "Battle of the Sexes",&lt;ref&gt;Upman AH. "English femmes savantes at the end of the seventeenth century". ''Journal of English and Germanic Philology'' 12 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; and was often surprisingly polemic, such as [[Hannah Woolley]]'s  "The Gentlewoman's Companion."&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, Hannah. ''The Gentlewoman's Companion''. London, 1675.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, women received mixed messages, for they also heard a strident backlash, and even self-deprecation by women writers in response.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} They were also subjected to conflicting social pressures, one of which was fewer opportunities for work outside the home, and education which sometimes reinforced the social order as much as inspired independent thinking.

'''Publishing Scotland''' is a [[trade association]] for the [[publishing]] industry in [[Scotland]].

It was established in 1973 as the '''Scottish General Publishers Association''' with the support of the [[Scottish Arts Council]]. It was subsequently known as the '''Scottish Publishers Association''' (SPA), with a membership primarily comprising book and [[academic publishing|academic]] publishers, [[Local government in Scotland|local authority]] libraries and [[Scottish public bodies|public bodies]]. In April 2007, name Publishing Scotland was adopted, and the group's remit was extended to support individuals and companies working within the publishing industry, such as freelance editors, illustrators, and printing firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publishingscotland.org/what-we-do/members/membership/ |title=Membership |publisher=Publishing Scotland |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On behalf of its members, Publishing Scotland attends [[trade fair]]s throughout [[Europe]]; co-ordinates [[bookshop]] and [[library]] promotions, and other [[marketing]] initiatives; runs training courses and [[seminar]]s; and implements joint research projects and surveys with organisations such as [[Creative Scotland]] and [[VisitScotland]]. Publishing Scotland is also involved in the annual [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. It runs an online bookseller, BooksfromScotland.com. It is the majority owner of BookSource, a warehousing and worldwide [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] service for trade publishers, charities and other commercial enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publishingscotland.org/what-we-do/ |title=What we do |publisher=Publishing Scotland |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPA formerly compiled a list of best-selling Scottish books, which was criticised in 2005 when a book was included in the top ten, despite not selling any copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article129866.ece |title=Book makes top 10 list with no sales |work=The Sunday Times |date=30 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''registrar (museum)''' is responsible for implementing policies and procedures that relate to [[collections care|caring for collections]] of [[cultural institutions]] like [[archives]], [[libraries]], and [[museums]].  These policies are found in the museum's collections policy, the guiding tenet of the museum explaining why the institution is in operation, dictating the museum's professional standards regarding the objects left in its care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collections Management |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-11283-4 |editor=Fahy, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Registrars focus on sections that include acquisitions, loans, exhibitions, deaccessions, storage, packing and shipping, security of objects in transit, insurance policies, and risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Registrar|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/office-of-the-director/office-of-the-registrar|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate= April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[collections care]] professional, they work with [[collection manager]]s, [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], and [[curators]] to balance public access to objects with the conditions needed to maintain preservation.   Focusing on documentation, registrars are responsible for developing and maintaining records management systems, with individual files for each object in the collection.  Smaller and mid-sized institutions may combine the role of registrar with that of collections manager, while large institutions often have multiple registrars, each overseeing a different curatorial department.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The role of registrar was first defined in the early 1900s, and while the job description has not changed appreciably over time, the responsibilities have evolved with technology and increasing global awareness.   Successful registrars deftly manage many projects at once, maintain calm focus, and diligent attention to detail. Collaborating with other departments and community associations is key.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Elizabeth (2008)Museum Careers: A Practical Guide for Students and Novices. Left Coast Press, California. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A selection of the most critical responsibilities include: 
*'''Documentation''':  From the position's creation, registrars are most concerned with documentation and record keeping.  This documentation includes information about an object's condition, its [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]] (or identification number, depending on its status at the museum), provenance, materials, and all of its movement within the museum or out on loan.  Paper registers have been replaced by Collection Management Software, and this data is stored in multiple locations as a safeguard.   
*'''Acquisitions''':  When an object arrives at the museum for the first time as a prospective addition to the collection, a registrar immediately begins the documentation and tracking process by assigning a temporary [[Accession number (library science)|identification number]] and assembling records that include the object's condition, date of arrival, the reason for its arrival at the museum, and a photograph documenting its physical appearance.  This information follows the object through the acquisition process, tracking its movements.  If the museum decides to accept the object, the registrar will then update the record, assigning a permanent [[Accession number (library science)|accession number]] to the object.  The registrar also makes recommendations to the Collections Committee.  Using the museum's Collections Management Policy, the registrar assesses whether or not the object fits the collection, determines whether the museum has the necessary resources to properly care for the object, and ascertains that [[provenance]] can be established to protect the museum from potential litigation.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Museum Registration Methods |year=2010 |publisher=The AAM Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-1-933253-15-2 |edition=5th |editor=Buck, R. |editor2=Gilmore, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Loans''':  Objects are loaned between [[museums]] for a variety of reasons, typically for special exhibitions.  As with acquisitions, the registrar assigns a temporary [[Accession number (library science)|identification number]] to objects on loan to the museum, documents their condition, and creates a file to follow the object's movement while it is in the museum.  Registrars are also present at the loading dock upon arrival to supervise the unloading, condition of packing material, and ensure that the objects are handled properly.  In the case of outgoing loans, the registrar documents which objects are leaving the museum and either carries out or oversees their packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle.
*'''Exhibitions''':  Working together with [[curators]] and [[collection manager]]s, the registrar helps select objects for display or loan.  This means occasionally saying 'no' to colleagues to safeguard objects for the future.  If an object will not withstand the stresses of travel and/or an exhibition, it is the registrar's duty to make that clear and stand behind their decision.  Once objects are selected and agreed upon, the registrar updates the records to reflect the display location.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; 
*'''Deaccessions''':  Registrars are also involved in carrying out [[wikt:deaccession|deaccessions]].  Historically, museums did not follow strict guidelines for accepting donations.  As a result, objects that have little or nothing to do with the institution's mission statement sit in storage until they can be deaccessioned, or removed from the museum's collection.  Storage space and resources are valuable, and therefore it does not make sense to maintain objects that the museum cannot display.  Registrars assess these objects, make recommendations, and verify that all legal conditions are met to deaccession the object, and document every step of the process.  Since this process can be controversial, it is critical that every step, as described by the museum's policy, are carried out diligently and openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deaccessioning Activity|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/deaccessioning-activity.pdf?sfvrsn=2|work=American Association of Museums|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Packing and Shipping''':  When objects are sent out of the [[museum]], either being returned to the institution that provided them or as an outgoing loan to another museum, the registrar updates the registration system to documents which objects are leaving the museum.  The Condition report is updated to reflect the pre-shipping state of the object, and the registrar either carries out or oversees the packing for shipment, and loading into the shipping vehicle.
*'''Security in Transit''':  Most, if not all, objects on outgoing loan are accompanied by a courier.  The registrar selects and trains this individual, and, in the case of extremely important objects, the registrar may accompany the shipment, acting as a [[courier]] themselves.
*'''Risk Management''':  A main task for a registrar is also determining risk factors to a collection and mitigating them. Risk factors include vandalism, theft, pests, emergencies, and natural disasters. It is the responsibility of the registrar to develop and implement strategies to minimize these risks, such as [[integrated pest management]], guards, and secure display cases.  Additionally registrars oversee the development and implementation of a [[Emergency response (museum)|disaster management policy]] to safeguard both staff and collections objects in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Disaster Preparedness in Museums|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Guidelines/guidelinesdisasters_eng.pdf|work=International Council of Museums|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
A registrar should show strength and skill when handling objects. From physically moving an object to being able to identify any stress points or cultural significance, a registrar must take the initiative to study the museum's collection. They must be calm, flexible, resourceful, and focus on the details.  Registrars can be described as academic generalists, who, over time, can develop specializations.&lt;ref name =MRM5/&gt;

Working knowledge of American Association of Museum's Code of Ethics as well as the Collecting Guidelines for Museums should be required to be successful and respectful of any cultural or intrinsic objects. A registrar should be familiar with the AAM Guide to Provenance Research, as well as the Nazi-Era Provenance Internet Portal. A registrar should also be familiar with Digital Fair Use and the US Indemnity Program. In addition, a registrar should understand repatriation processes, both nationally and internationally.

As a member of a unique institution, a registrar must possess the ability to be successful in a team-oriented environment. Teaching qualities and customer service skills are helpful when trying to relay the importance of a collection's protection or access to a different department within the museum.

==Education and training==
Individuals looking to begin a career in the Collections Management field generally possess a bachelor's degree in history, art history, fine arts, or a field related to museum interests.  Many institutions now require a graduate education in museum studies or field relating to the museum's collections in this competitive job market.  Candidates are also expected to have hands-on experience in museum collection database management, object packing and handling, digitization, collections cataloging, and accession and loan procedures.

Internships and volunteer work in cultural institutions are excellent ways to gain experience and make connections with museum professionals.  By taking initiative to acquire experience, paid or unpaid, a candidate will also develop their organizational skills, familiarity with procedure, and the inherent flexibility needed to succeed as a registrar.

==Related positions==
Smaller museums tend to combine the role of registrar with that of [[collection manager]], in which case one person (or team) would oversee the traditional responsibilities of a registrar with the addition of a more hands-on role in [[collections care]].  Added duties include:  overseeing and maintaining environmental conditions in storage and exhibition facilities, taking a more active role in conditions assessments and contacting [[conservator-restorer|conservators]] directly, managing physical storage needs, and taking inventory of the collection at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 20, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416030603/http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|archivedate=April 16, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ringling College of Art and Design''' is a private four-year [[school accreditation|accredited]] college located in [[Sarasota, Florida]] that was founded by Ludd M. Spivey as an [[art school]] in 1931 as a remote branch of [[Florida Southern College|Southern College]], founded in Orlando in 1856.

The art school separated from Southern College and became an independent nonprofit institution in 1933 and has changed names several times. It qualified for full accreditation as a degree-granting institution by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] on December 11, 1979. Upon joining as a member, accreditation by the National Association of Schools of Art was granted in 1984. The campus includes the [[Longboat Key Center for the Arts]].

== History ==
The concept of founding the college originated from Dr. Ludd M. Spivey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tblc.org/fsc/archives/lspivey.html |title=404 Not Found - Tampa Bay Library Consortium |work=tblc.org |accessdate=21 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050323184059/http://www.tblc.org/fsc/archives/lspivey.html |archivedate=March 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then president of Southern College, which was founded in 1856 in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]], Florida, and is now called [[Florida Southern College]]. Spivey sought financial support for this concept from the Sarasota circus magnate, [[John Ringling]]. At that time, Spivey learned that Ringling was not interested in giving to Southern College and he was more interested in establishing his own art school at the museum founded with his first wife, Mable. The museum was constructed on their estate in the form of an Italian villa to house a vast collection of seventeenth century sculpture and paintings collected on their travels and at auctions. Most importantly, Ringling nearly was [[bankrupt]]. If Ringling could have, he would have opened his own art school that was drawn on his original plans for the museum, but not built because of a lack of funds.

Ringling's first wife died in June 1929, a few months before the crash of the stock market. Ringling's health began to fail as well. A year later, in 1930, he married Emily Haag Buck in Jersey City, New Jersey, a wealthy woman who turned out to have little interest in Florida. This marriage ended in divorce shortly before the death of John Ringling in 1936. He died just before losing his museum and residence to bankruptcy. His will left his residential property, including his home and the museum, to the state, otherwise they would have been sold for debts along with his other holdings. In retrospect, failure to involve Ringling in founding the school became a stroke of luck for its survival: if Ringling had founded the art school as requested, it would have been subjected to the same fate. After a ten-year struggle, his nephew was able to keep that deteriorating estate parcel intact and retained by the state.

Repeatedly Spivey's plan to found an art school was discussed and, after much negotiation, it was agreed that Southern College would open its own art school in Sarasota as a branch. With much reluctance, Ringling agreed that it could be known as the ''School of Fine and Applied Art of the John and Mable Ringling Art Museum'', lending his name and that of his former wife to the school, to associate the Florida Southern art school with the more famous name of the Ringlings and their museum.

In a portion of the Sarasota area that once had been the incorporated community of Bay Haven, the former Bay Haven Hotel and several adjacent store buildings close to its downtown and railway station became the location for the new art school. The buildings were renovated at the cost of $45,000. John Ringling was approached again and agreed to raise the money necessary to underwrite those renovation needs. The work was completed and on October 2, 1931, the School of Fine and Applied Art of the John and Mable Ringling Art Museum was opened with an official ceremony by Southern College. John Ringling was invited to speak at its opening.

{{quote|If any educational institution is to progress, it must be administered intelligently... I know of no other school in America equipped as this one to educate in art...Here I hope a famous school of artists will rise,  for though life is short, art is long|John Ringling, October 2, 1931.}}

Shortly thereafter John Ringling became more severely affected by losses on the stock market and plummeted more rapidly toward bankruptcy; he was removed from management of the family circus by its [[board of directors]].

Within two years, on May 14, 1933, under the name of ''Ringling School of Art'', a charter was obtained and the school became an independent, nonprofit institution, separating from Florida Southern College. Seventy-five students enrolled in the new school, which purported to "do more than develop artistic talent and to provide intellectual training: its purpose will include the fullest development of personality...in order to assist each student to a happy adjustment to the circumstances of the world in which he finds himself." In the same year, the art school became a member of the Florida Association of Colleges and Universities and has remained an active member of that organization ever since.

{{quote|When we opened in the Fall of 1933, we had one student in the dormitory, and thirteen day students. That was after a day and a half of registration.|Verman Kimbrough}}

In May 1935, written permission was received from John Ringling to build a new school on his property near the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art.  Due to a lack of resources, however, a school never was built on the grounds.  Ringling died in 1936 and the opportunity to use his property was never realized.

The school also was known as ''John and Mable Ringling Junior College and School of Art'' during these early years, functioning both as a [[junior college]] and as an art school.

The building chosen as the site of the new school was originally the two-star Bay Haven Hotel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutsarasota.com/scannedimages2/101bayhavenhotel.jpg Bay Haven Hotel]&lt;/ref&gt; which was new at the time. It was purchased and is now known as the Keating Center, which is used to house the college's administration and also serves as dormitory and classroom space.

The first class had only seventy-five students and there were thirteen faculty members. Each student paid $783 per year for [[tuition]], [[boarding house|board]], room, fees, and books. Each student also attended chapel services everyday and written permission had to be received by the school's president or [[Dean (education)|dean]] if a student wanted to leave the town.

Late in 1933 the school became a member of the Florida Association of Colleges and Universities.

=== 1937: First degree awarded ===
Although not fully accredited, on April 17, 1937 the school awarded its first [[fine arts]] degree to Dora G. McCollister of Clarksburg, Ohio.

=== 1940–70 ===
During the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s the school matured, realizing a gradual development and consolidation. During World War II, enrollment declined to fifty or sixty students, mostly women. With the end of the war, the school welcomed veterans returning to school on the G.I. Bill. By 1949 enrollment reached 250.

On October 2, 1949, the first building to be constructed by the school was put into use. It was an addition serving as a twenty-room dormitory for forty men. The new dorms had east and west wings with a combination writing and study room in the center. [[Harold Fennyhough]], known for his charcoal portraits taught at the school during the late 1940s.

By 1959 enrollment climbed to 450, approximately where it remained with minor fluctuations for decades. Expansion of the campus included purchase of the Brinkerhoff Motel and duplexes to the rear of the main building for use as dormitories.

In 1964 operation of the school shifted significantly, as all of the school's assets and the responsibility for its direction were turned over to a [[board of trustees]].

=== 1970–2007 ===
[[Image:Ringling1985.gif|thumb|right|250px|Night view of main entrance to school, c. 1985 - photograph by Ken Cormier]]

During the 1970s, considerable property was added to the campus, increasing the area of school holdings from just under {{convert|10|acre|m2}} to more than {{convert|24|acre|m2}}.
In May 1971, an alumni association was formed.

In 1973, a new {{convert|3200|sqft|m2}}, completely air-conditioned painting studio was completed that was later used for sculpture.

By 1977, the school had built and completely equipped a modern darkroom and laboratory for photography students. The pink look of the campus, prevalent for many years, disappeared when all of the buildings were painted a light yellow.

Failing infrastructure meant that in 1978 the building known as the Riverside Dormitory was condemned for use as a dormitory. Two years later, the main building was condemned subject to the installation of major renovations.

The board of the school adopted a statement in 1978 that assured the faculty appropriate freedom in teaching and research, a principle normally taken for granted in academia, but not granted at Ringling until this time. The school received full [[school accreditation|accreditation]] as a degree-granting institution by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools on December 11, 1979. The next step toward proper recognition by other professional art schools was to gain accreditation from the National Association of Schools of Art, and membership in the association was granted in 1984.
Throughout the 1970s, slow but steady progress was made toward full accreditation, obtained on December 11, 1979, when the school acquired the status of a degree-granting college by the [[Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS-COC).

Construction of a library-studio complex was completed in June 1980. Security concerns were raised as women students suffered attacks by night prowlers and pistol shots alarmed students.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1985, Arland "Chris" Christ-Janer, Ph.D., became the president of Ringling School and remained until 1996. In an article written by Mark Zaloudek that was published November 11, 2008, in the ''Sarasota Herald Tribune'', it was stated that the school experienced unprecedented growth during his tenure. Frank Countryman, Ringling vice president, was quoted as saying that "The school just took off and it was fun, because he was willing to try anything that might have a positive outcome... Some things worked and some didn't, but he changed the institution forever in a positive way." Larry Thompson, the college's new president, was quoted as adding that "Christ-Janer, who came out of retirement to head the art school, drew upon his experience as president of four other colleges to broaden Ringling's three-year specialized program into an accredited, four-year institution. We are the most high-tech art and design college in the world because of his visionary leadership." In another article, former ''Herald-Tribune'' editor Waldo Proffitt stated that Christ-Janer "transformed Ringling from an above average two-year art and design school to a four-year degree-granting college, generally thought to be the finest art and design school in the country".[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20081115/COLUMNIST/811150324?Title=Christ-Janer-s-vision-lives-on]

=== 2007–present ===
On April 14, 2007, the art school was renamed the Ringling College of Art and Design. The announcement was made by its new president, Larry R. Thompson, J.D., to more than 500 guests at "An Evening at the Avant-Garde: Anything Goes", a private, ticketed fund raising event on the campus to support the student scholarship fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Evening at the Avant-Garde|url=http://www.ringling.edu/connect/alumni-friends/an-evening-at-the-avant-garde/|publisher=Ringling College of Art and Design|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222002/http://www.ringling.edu/connect/alumni-friends/an-evening-at-the-avant-garde/|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the campus had expanded to {{convert|49|acre|m2}} and 108 buildings and the student population had reached over 1,300 students attending from 46 states and 46 countries. As of 2013, U.S. News reported a tuition rate of $36,624, 1,364 enrolled students (39% male and 61% female), and a student-faculty ratio of 12:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ringling College of Art and Design|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/ringling-college-of-art-and-design-12574|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Ringling College of Art &amp; Design trademarked the mission phrase Shattering the myth of the starving artist.™ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4807:8tj2gm.2.1|title=SHATTERING THE MYTH OF THE STARVING ARTIST|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the college announced plans to build an approximately 20,000 square foot Visual Arts Center with help from a $3,000,000 donation from Dr. Richard and Barbara Basch.&lt;ref name="prweb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/baschvisualarts/ringlingcollege/prweb12300817.htm |title=Ringling College of Art and Design Receives $3-Million Gift From Dr. Richard and Barbara Basch for New Visual Arts Center|date=4 November 2014|website=PRWeb|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planned features of the Richard and Barbara Basch Visual Arts Center include workshops for [[glassblowing]] and [[Work hardening|cold working]], as well as a [[Pottery|ceramics]] studio.&lt;ref name="prweb" /&gt;

On March 7, 2017, the construction site of the Center caught fire, and the flames were extinguished in 31 minutes by Sarasota [[firefighting]] crews.&lt;ref name="herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20170307/ringling-college-construction-site-burns-in-sarasota|title=Ringling College construction site burns in Sarasota|author=Carlos R.

'''''SMart''''' was a British [[CBBC]] television programme based on the subject of [[art]], which began in 1994 and ended in 2009. The programme was recorded at [[Television Centre, London|BBC Television Centre]] in London, previously it had been recorded in Studio A at [[Pebble Mill Studios|BBC Pebble Mill]] in Birmingham. The format is similar to the [[Tony Hart]] programmes ''[[Take Hart]]'' and ''[[Hartbeat]]''. The show was revamped into an hour-long show in 2007; from 1994-2006 it was previously a 25-minute show. From 1994–2005, the show also featured [[Morph (character)|Morph]], originally from ''Take Hart''. It has 199 episodes. CBBC last aired ''SMart'' on 11 August 2011.

==Production==
The original theme tune was composed by [[Kjartan Poskitt]], famous for the ''[[Murderous Maths]]'' series of books.  From 2003, a different tune was used, written by [[Steve Brown (composer)|Steve Brown]] (known as the fictional musical director [[Glen Ponder]] in ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]''). In 2007, this was remixed by Matt Thomas of Mosquito Music in line with the new format.

In 2007, the new autumn series had a new format mixing some of the old segments with new ideas. It was aired on Sunday, and repeated on Wednesdays. It involved more child participation in games and celebrity guests. This new format also allowed for episodes of ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' to be aired halfway in. One of the segments displayed art that had been sent in by viewers, to the backing music of 'Give It Away' by [[Zero 7]].

The format was utilised again when a new series began with a new timeslot on Sunday 29 June 2008, airing on CBBC on BBC Two, still presented by [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mike Fischetti]]. A special tribute to [[Mark Speight]] was also broadcast. Along with this new format, guest presenters appear each week to assist the two presenters.

Following the death of presenter [[Mark Speight]]'s fiancee [[Natasha Collins]] in January 2008, repeats of the show and its [[CBeebies]] spin-off ''[[SMarteenies]]'' were suspended.  Speight left the programme, saying his "tragic loss" had left him unable to continue; he later committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7410338.stm | title= Presenter Speight hanged himself | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=20 May 2008 | accessdate=28 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC indicated that there would still be a new series of ''SMart'' in the autumn, but editions featuring Speight are unlikely to be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7350087.stm|title=TV presenter left suicide notes|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=16 April 2008|accessdate=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Series 16 began airing on 3 January 2009 in the same style to the series before. The major change was that the original airings moved to the [[CBBC Channel]] rather than [[BBC Two]]. [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mike Fischetti]] both returned to host the show and the show continued to have guest presenters. The games involving children in the studio were dropped and instead children participated via [[webcam]] or pre-recorded on location. The show also added segments on fun aspects of digital photography.

==Spin-offs==
The success of ''SMart'' allowed it to spawn various spin-off series.  The first was ''SMart on the Road'' where either [[Mark Speight]] or [[Kirsten O'Brien]], with the help of Lizi Botham, would travel around the country helping people with major projects, for example decorating a room or making a fun garden.  It starred [[Kirsten O'Brien]], [[Mark Speight]], [[Jay Burridge]] and Lizi Botham.

''[[SMarteenies]]'' was the second spin-off, where Kirsten, Mark, Jay and "Bizi Lizi" went through fun makes for younger viewers, including ''man of letters and shapes'' and Kirsten's Household Makes with Doogie the Dog. This programme was specifically aimed at a younger demographic, roughly from 3–6 years old on was aired on [[CBeebies]].  It starred [[Kirsten O'Brien]], [[Mark Speight]], [[Jay Burridge]] and Lizi Botham.

A special episode, ''SMart Africa'', was made by the BBC to coincide with Africa Week. The episode contained easy ways to make things. This episode, with [[Kirsten O'Brien]] and [[Mark Speight]], was aired as part of the 2003 series.

==Legacy==
In March 2011, CBBC started to air ''Deadly Art'' which followed a very similar format to ''SMart'' and also stars [[Mike Fischetti]]. They look to the wild for inspiration (to tie in with the "Deadly" series e.g. ''Deadly 60''). Then CBBC aired ''Totally Rubbish'' and their current art series is ''[[Art Ninja]]'', whose presenter Ricky Martin said he watched ''SMart'' religiously as a child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creativebloq.com/art-direction/aardman-designer-encourages-kids-get-creative-art-tv-show-21514202&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], and [[economics]], '''scale invariance''' is a feature of objects or laws that do not change if scales of length, energy, or other variables, are multiplied by a common factor, thus represent a universality.

The technical term for this [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] is a '''dilatation''' (also known as '''dilation'''), and the dilatations can also form part of a larger [[conformal symmetry]].

*In mathematics, scale invariance usually refers to an invariance of individual [[function (mathematics)|functions]] or [[curve]]s. A closely related concept is [[self-similarity]], where a function or curve is invariant under a discrete subset of the dilatations. It is also possible for the [[probability distribution]]s of [[random process]]es to display this kind of scale invariance or self-similarity.
*In [[classical field theory]], scale invariance most commonly applies to the invariance of a whole theory under dilatations. Such theories typically describe classical physical processes with no characteristic length scale.
*In [[quantum field theory]], scale invariance has an interpretation in terms of [[particle physics]]. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.
*In [[statistical mechanics]], scale invariance is a feature of [[phase transition]]s. The key observation is that near a phase transition or [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for an explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena. Such theories are scale-invariant [[statistical field theory|statistical field theories]], and are formally very similar to scale-invariant quantum field theories.
*[[universality (dynamical systems)|Universality]] is the observation that widely different microscopic systems can display the same behaviour at a phase transition. Thus phase transitions in many different systems may be described by the same underlying scale-invariant theory.
*In general, [[dimensionless quantities]] are scale invariant. The analogous concept in [[statistics]] are [[standardized moment]]s, which are scale invariant statistics of a variable, while the unstandardized moments are not.

==Scale-invariant curves and self-similarity==
In mathematics, one can consider the scaling properties of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[curve]] {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} under rescalings of the variable {{mvar|x}}.  That is, one is interested in the shape of {{math|''f'' (''λx'')}} for some scale factor {{mvar|λ}}, which can be taken to be a length or size rescaling. The requirement for  {{math|''f'' (''x'')}} to be invariant under all rescalings is usually taken to be
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x)=\lambda^{\Delta}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some choice of exponent {{mvar|Δ}}, and for all dilations {{mvar|λ}}. This is equivalent to {{mvar|f}} &amp;nbsp;  being a [[homogeneous function]] of degree {{mvar|Δ}}.

Examples of scale-invariant functions are the [[monomial]]s &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^n&lt;/math&gt;, for which {{math|Δ {{=}} ''n''}}, in that clearly

:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x) = (\lambda x)^n = \lambda^n f(x)~.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of a scale-invariant curve is the [[logarithmic spiral]], a kind of curve that often appears in nature. In [[polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'')}}, the spiral can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{b} \ln(r/a)~.&lt;/math&gt;

Allowing for rotations of the curve, it is invariant under all rescalings {{mvar|λ}}; that is, {{math|''θ''(''λr'')}} is identical to a rotated version of {{math|''θ''(''r'')}}.

===Projective geometry===
The idea of scale invariance of a monomial generalizes in higher dimensions to the idea of a [[homogeneous polynomial]], and more generally to a [[homogeneous function]]. Homogeneous functions are the natural denizens of [[projective space]], and homogeneous polynomials are studied as [[projective varieties]] in [[projective geometry]].  Projective geometry is a particularly rich field of mathematics; in its most abstract forms, the geometry of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], it has connections to various topics in [[string theory]].

===Fractals===
[[File:Kochsim.gif|thumb|right|250px|A [[Koch curve]] is [[self-similar]].]]
It is sometimes said that [[fractal]]s are scale-invariant, although more precisely, one should say that they are [[self-similar]]. A fractal is equal to itself typically for only a discrete set of values {{mvar|λ}}, and even then a translation and rotation may have to be applied to match the fractal up to itself.

Thus, for example, the [[Koch curve]] scales with {{math|∆ {{=}} 1}}, but the scaling holds only for values of {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 1/3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for integer {{mvar|n}}. In addition, the Koch curve scales not only at the origin, but, in a certain sense, "everywhere": miniature copies of itself can be found all along the curve.

Some fractals may have multiple scaling factors at play at once; such scaling is studied with [[multi-fractal analysis]].

Periodic [[External ray|external and internal rays]] are invariant curves .

==Scale invariance in stochastic processes==
If {{math|''P''(''f'' )}} is the [[expectation value|average, expected]] power at frequency {{mvar|f }}, then noise scales as
:&lt;math&gt;P(f) = \lambda^{-\Delta} P(\lambda f)&lt;/math&gt;
with {{mvar|Δ}} = 0  for [[white noise]],  {{mvar|Δ}} = −1  for [[pink noise]], and  {{mvar|Δ}} = −2  for [[Brownian noise]] (and more generally, [[Brownian motion]]).

More precisely, scaling in stochastic systems concerns itself with the likelihood of choosing a particular configuration out of the set of all possible random configurations. This likelihood is given by the [[probability distribution]].

Examples of scale-invariant distributions are the [[Pareto distribution]] and the [[Zipfian distribution]].

===Scale invariant Tweedie distributions===
'''[[Tweedie distributions]]''' are a special case of '''[[exponential dispersion model]]s''', a class of statistical models used to describe error distributions for the [[generalized linear model]] and characterized by [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]] under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jørgensen |first=B. |year=1997 |title=The Theory of Dispersion Models |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |location=London |isbn=0412997118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include a number of common distributions: the [[normal distribution]], [[Poisson distribution]] and [[gamma distribution]], as well as more unusual distributions like the compound Poisson-gamma distribution, positive [[stable distribution]]s, and extreme stable distributions.
Consequent to their inherent scale invariance Tweedie [[random variable]]s ''Y'' demonstrate a [[variance]] var(''Y'') to [[mean]] E(''Y'')  power law:
: &lt;math&gt;\text{var}\,(Y) = a[\text{E}\,(Y)]^p&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''a'' and ''p'' are positive constants. This variance to mean power law is known in the physics literature as '''fluctuation scaling''',&lt;ref name="Eisler2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisler |first=Z. |last2=Bartos |first2=I. |last3=Kertész |first3=J. |year=2008 |title=Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor's law and beyond |journal=[[Advances in Physics|Adv Phys]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=89–142 |doi=10.1080/00018730801893043 |arxiv = 0708.2053 |bibcode = 2008AdPhy..57...89E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ecology literature as [[Taylor's law]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kendal |first=W. S. |last2=Jørgensen |first2=B. |year=2011 |title=Taylor's power law and fluctuation scaling explained by a central-limit-like convergence |journal=Phys. Rev.

Random sequences, governed by the Tweedie distributions and evaluated by the [[Tweedie distributions|method of expanding bins]] exhibit a [[Logical biconditional|biconditional]] relationship between the variance to mean power law and power law [[autocorrelation]]s.  The [[Wiener–Khinchin theorem]] further implies that for any sequence that exhibits a variance to mean power law under these conditions will also manifest [[pink noise|''1/f'' noise]].&lt;ref name="Kendal2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kendal |first=W.

The [[Tweedie distributions|'''Tweedie convergence theorem''']] provides a hypothetical explanation for the wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and ''1/f'' noise.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jørgensen |first=B. |last2=Martinez |first2=J. R. |last3=Tsao |first3=M. |year=1994 |title=Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function |journal=[[Scandinavian Journal of Statistics|Scand J Statist]] |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=223–243 |jstor=4616314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires, in essence, that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance to mean power law will be required express a [[natural exponential family|variance function]] that comes within the [[Attractor|domain of attraction]] of a Tweedie model.  Almost all distribution functions with finite [[cumulant|cumulant generating functions]] qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form.  Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this [[Asymptotic expansion|asymptotic behavior]], and  the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011" /&gt;

Much as the [[central limit theorem]] requires certain kinds of random variables to have as a focus of convergence the [[normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]] and express [[white noise]], the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian random variables to express ''1/f'' noise and fluctuation scaling.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011" /&gt;

===Cosmology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;
In [[physical cosmology]], the power spectrum of the spatial distribution of the [[cosmic microwave background]] is near to being a scale-invariant function. Although in mathematics this means that the spectrum is a power-law, in cosmology the term "scale-invariant" indicates that the amplitude, {{math|''P''(''k'')}}, of [[primordial fluctuations]] as a function of [[wave number]], {{mvar|k}}, is approximately constant, i.e. a flat spectrum. This pattern is consistent with the proposal of [[cosmic inflation]].

==Scale invariance in classical field theory==
[[Classical field theory]] is generically described by a field, or set of fields,  ''φ'', that depend on coordinates, ''x''. Valid field configurations are then determined by solving [[differential equations]] for ''φ'', and these equations are known as [[field equation]]s.

For a theory to be scale-invariant, its field equations should be invariant under a rescaling of the coordinates, combined with some specified rescaling of the fields,
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\rightarrow\lambda^{-\Delta}\varphi~.&lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''Δ'' is known as the [[scaling dimension]] of the field, and its value depends on the theory under consideration.  Scale invariance will typically hold provided that no fixed length scale appears in the theory. Conversely, the presence of a fixed length scale indicates that a theory is '''not''' scale-invariant.

A consequence of scale invariance is that given a solution of a scale-invariant field equation, we can automatically find other solutions by rescaling both the coordinates and the fields appropriately. In technical terms, given a solution,  ''φ''(''x''), one always has other solutions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\Delta}\varphi(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Scale invariance of field configurations===
For a particular field configuration,  ''φ''(''x''),  to be scale-invariant, we require that
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)=\lambda^{-\Delta}\varphi(\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Δ'' is, again, the [[scaling dimension]] of the field.

We note that this condition is rather restrictive. In general, solutions even of scale-invariant field equations will '''not''' be scale-invariant, and in such cases the symmetry is said to be [[spontaneously broken]].

===Classical electromagnetism===

An example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetism]] with no charges or currents. The fields are the electric and magnetic fields, '''E'''('''x''',''t'') and '''B'''('''x''',''t''), while their field equations are [[Maxwell's equations]].

With no charges or currents, [[electromagnetic field#Light as an electromagnetic disturbance|these field equations]] take the form of [[wave equation]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light.

These field equations are invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, given solutions of Maxwell's equations, '''E'''('''x''', ''t'') and '''B'''('''x''', ''t''),  it holds that 
'''E'''(λ'''x''', λ''t'') and '''B'''(λ'''x''', λ''t'')  are also solutions.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Another example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is the massless [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] (note that the name [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] is unrelated to scale invariance). The scalar field, {{math|''φ''('''''x''''', ''t'')}} is a function of a set of spatial variables, '''''x''''', and a time variable, {{mvar|t}}.

Consider first the linear theory. Like the electromagnetic field equations above, the equation of motion for this theory is also a wave equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2 \varphi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
and is invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t.&lt;/math&gt;

The name massless refers to the absence of a term &lt;math&gt;\propto m^2\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in the field equation. Such a term is often referred to as a `mass' term, and would break the invariance under the above transformation. In [[relativistic field theory|relativistic field theories]], a mass-scale, {{mvar|m}}  is physically equivalent to a fixed length scale through
:&lt;math&gt;L=\frac{\hbar}{mc},&lt;/math&gt;
and so it should not be surprising that massive scalar field theory is ''not'' scale-invariant.

====φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory====
The field equations in the examples above are all [[linear]] in the fields, which has meant that the [[scaling dimension]], {{mvar|Δ}}, has not been so important. However, one usually requires that the scalar field [[action (physics)|action]] is dimensionless, and this fixes the [[scaling dimension]] of {{mvar|φ}}. In particular,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|D}} is the combined number of spatial and time dimensions.

Given this scaling dimension for {{mvar|φ}}, there are certain nonlinear modifications of massless scalar field theory which are also scale-invariant. One example is massless [[Phi to the fourth|φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory]] for {{mvar|D}}=4. The field equation is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}-\nabla^2 \varphi+g\varphi^3=0.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that the name {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; derives from the form of the [[Phi to the fourth#The Lagrangian|Lagrangian]], which contains the fourth power of {{mvar|φ}}.)

When {{mvar|D}}=4 (e.g. three spatial dimensions and one time dimension), the scalar field scaling dimension is {{mvar|Δ}}=1. The field equation is then invariant under the transformation
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda t,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi (x)\rightarrow\lambda^{-1}\varphi(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The key point is that the parameter {{mvar|g}} must be dimensionless, otherwise one introduces a fixed length scale into the theory: For  {{mvar|φ}}&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;  theory, this is only the case in {{mvar|D}}=4.
Note that under these transformations the argument of the function {{mvar|φ}} is unchanged.

==Scale invariance in quantum field theory==
The scale-dependence of a [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) is characterised by the way its [[coupling constant|coupling parameters]] depend on the energy-scale of a given physical process. This energy dependence is described by the [[renormalization group]], and is encoded in the [[beta-function]]s of the theory.

For a QFT to be scale-invariant, its coupling parameters must be independent of the energy-scale, and this is indicated by the vanishing of the beta-functions of the theory. Such theories are also known as [[Renormalization group|fixed points]] of the corresponding renormalization group flow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Zinn-Justin|J. Zinn-Justin]] (2010)  Scholarpedia article [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Critical_Phenomena:_field_theoretical_approach "Critical Phenomena: field theoretical approach"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum electrodynamics===
A simple example of a scale-invariant QFT is the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles. This theory actually has no coupling parameters (since [[photon]]s are massless and non-interacting) and is therefore scale-invariant, much like the classical theory.

However, in nature the electromagnetic field is coupled to charged particles, such as [[electron]]s. The QFT describing the interactions of photons and charged particles is [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the [[beta-function#Quantum electrodynamics|QED beta-function]]. This tells us that the [[electric charge]] (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles '''is''' scale-invariant, QED is '''not''' scale-invariant.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Free, massless [[scalar field (quantum field theory)|quantized scalar field theory]] has no coupling parameters. Therefore, like the classical version, it is scale-invariant. In the language of the renormalization group, this theory is known as the [[Gaussian fixed point]].

However, even though the classical massless ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory is scale-invariant in ''D''=4, the quantized version is '''not''' scale-invariant. We can see this from the [[beta-function]] for the coupling parameter, ''g''.

Even though the quantized massless ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is not scale-invariant, there do exist scale-invariant quantized scalar field theories other than the Gaussian fixed point. One example is the '''Wilson-Fisher fixed point''', below.

===Conformal field theory===
Scale-invariant QFTs are almost always invariant under the full [[conformal symmetry]], and the study of such QFTs is [[conformal field theory]] (CFT). [[operator (physics)|Operators]] in a CFT have a well-defined [[scaling dimension]], analogous to the [[scaling dimension]], ''∆'', of a classical field discussed above. However, the scaling dimensions of operators in a CFT typically differ from those of the fields in the corresponding classical theory. The additional contributions appearing in the CFT are known as [[anomalous scaling dimension]]s.

===Scale and conformal anomalies===
The φ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; theory example above demonstrates that the coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can be scale-dependent even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant (or conformally invariant). If this is the case, the classical scale (or conformal) invariance is said to be [[conformal anomaly|anomalous]]. A classically scale invariant field theory, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provides an explication of the nearly exponential expansion of the early universe called [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], as long as the theory can be studied through [[perturbation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salvio, Strumia|title=Agravity|journal=JHEP  |volume=6 |pages=080|date=2014-03-17|url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1286134|arxiv = 1403.4226|bibcode = 2014JHEP...06..080S|doi=10.1007/JHEP06(2014)080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase transitions==
In [[statistical mechanics]], as a system undergoes a [[phase transition]], its fluctuations are described by a scale-invariant [[statistical field theory]]. For a system in equilibrium (i.e. time-independent) in {{mvar|D}} spatial dimensions, the corresponding statistical field theory is formally similar to a {{mvar|D}}-dimensional CFT. The scaling dimensions in such problems are usually referred to as [[critical exponent]]s, and one can in principle compute these exponents in the appropriate CFT.

===The Ising model===
An example that links together many of the ideas in this article is the phase transition of the [[Ising model]], a simple model of [[ferromagnet]]ic substances. This is a statistical mechanics model, which also has a description in terms of conformal field theory. The system consists of an array of lattice sites, which form a {{mvar|D}}-dimensional periodic lattice. Associated with each lattice site is a [[magnetic moment]], or [[spin (physics)|spin]], and this spin can take either the value +1 or −1. (These states are also called up and down, respectively.)

The key point is that the Ising model has a spin-spin interaction, making it energetically favourable for two adjacent spins to be aligned. On the other hand, thermal fluctuations typically introduce a randomness into the alignment of spins. At some critical temperature, {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} , [[spontaneous magnetization]] is said to occur. This means that below {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} the spin-spin interaction will begin to dominate, and there is some net alignment of spins in one of the two directions.

An example of the kind of physical quantities one would like to calculate at this critical temperature is the correlation between spins separated by a distance {{mvar|r}}. This has the generic behaviour:
:&lt;math&gt;G(r)\propto\frac{1}{r^{D-2+\eta}},&lt;/math&gt;
for some particular value of &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, which is an example of a critical exponent.

====CFT description====
The fluctuations at temperature {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are scale-invariant, and so the Ising model at this phase transition is expected to be described by a scale-invariant statistical field theory. In fact, this theory is the '''Wilson-Fisher fixed point''', a particular scale-invariant [[scalar field (quantum field theory)|scalar field theory]].

In this context, {{math|''G''(''r'')}} is understood as a [[correlation function]] of scalar fields,
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\phi(0)\phi(r)\rangle\propto\frac{1}{r^{D-2+\eta}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now we can fit together a number of the ideas seen already.

From the above, one  sees that the critical exponent, {{mvar|η}}, for this phase transition, is also an '''anomalous dimension'''. This is because the classical dimension of the scalar field,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
is modified to become
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta=\frac{D-2+\eta}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|D}} is the number of dimensions of the Ising model lattice.

So this '''anomalous dimension''' in the conformal field theory is the ''same'' as a particular critical exponent of the Ising model phase transition.

Note that for dimension {{math|''D'' ≡ 4−''ε''}}, {{mvar|η}} can be calculated approximately, using the '''epsilon expansion''', and one finds that
:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\epsilon^2}{54}+O(\epsilon^3)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the physically interesting case of three spatial dimensions, we have {{mvar|ε}}=1, and so this expansion is not strictly reliable. However, a semi-quantitative prediction is that {{mvar|η}} is numerically small in three dimensions.

On the other hand, in the two-dimensional case the Ising model is exactly soluble. In particular, it is equivalent to one of the [[minimal models]], a family of well-understood CFTs, and it is possible to compute {{mvar|η}} (and the other critical exponents) exactly,
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{_{D=2}}=\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Schramm–Loewner evolution===
The anomalous dimensions in certain two-dimensional CFTs can be related to the typical [[fractal dimension]]s of random walks, where the random walks are defined via [[Schramm–Loewner evolution]] (SLE). As we have seen above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2''d'' critical Ising model and the more general 2''d'' critical [[Potts model]]. Relating other 2''d'' CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.

==Universality==
A phenomenon known as [[universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] is seen in a large variety of physical systems. It expresses the idea that different microscopic physics can give rise to the same scaling behaviour at a phase transition. A canonical example of universality involves the following two systems:
* The [[Ising model]] phase transition, described above.
* The [[liquid]]-[[vapour]] transition in classical fluids.

Even though the microscopic physics of these two systems is completely different, their critical exponents turn out to be the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.

The set of different microscopic theories described by the same scale-invariant theory is known as a [[universality class]]. Other examples of systems which belong to a universality class are:
* [[Avalanche]]s in piles of sand. The likelihood of an avalanche is in power-law proportion to the size of the avalanche, and avalanches are seen to occur at all size scales.
* The frequency of [[network outage]]s on the [[Internet]], as a function of size and duration.
* The frequency of citations of journal articles, considered in the network of all citations amongst all papers, as a function of the number of citations in a given paper.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* The formation and propagation of cracks and tears in materials ranging from steel to rock to paper. The variations of the direction of the tear, or the roughness of a fractured surface, are in power-law proportion to the size scale.
* The [[electrical breakdown]] of [[dielectric]]s, which resemble cracks and tears.
* The [[percolation]] of fluids through disordered media, such as [[petroleum]] through fractured rock beds, or water through filter paper, such as in [[chromatography]]. Power-law scaling connects the rate of flow to the distribution of fractures.
* The [[diffusion]] of [[molecule]]s in [[solution]], and the phenomenon of [[diffusion-limited aggregation]].
* The distribution of rocks of different sizes in an aggregate mixture that is being shaken (with gravity acting on the rocks).

The key observation is that, for all of these different systems, the behaviour resembles a [[phase transition]], and that the language of statistical mechanics and scale-invariant [[statistical field theory]] may be applied to describe them.

==Other examples of scale invariance==

===Newtonian fluid mechanics with no applied forces===

Under certain circumstances, [[fluid mechanics]] is a scale-invariant classical field theory. The fields are the velocity of the fluid flow, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, and the fluid pressure, &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;. These fields must satisfy both the [[Navier–Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity equation]]. For a [[Newtonian fluid]] these take the respective forms
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla \mathbf{u} = -\nabla P+\mu \left(\nabla^2 \mathbf{u}+\frac{1}{3}\nabla\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot \left(\rho\mathbf{u}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic viscosity#Viscosity .28dynamic viscosity.29: .CE.BC|dynamic viscosity]].

In order to deduce the scale invariance of these equations we specify an [[equation of state]], relating the fluid pressure to the fluid density. The equation of state depends on the type of fluid and the conditions to which it is subjected. For example, we consider the [[isothermal]] [[ideal gas]], which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;P=c_s^2\rho,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound in the fluid. Given this equation of state, Navier–Stokes and the continuity equation are invariant under the transformations
:&lt;math&gt;x\rightarrow\lambda x,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t\rightarrow\lambda^2 t,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\rightarrow\lambda^{-1} \rho,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\rightarrow\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;
Given the solutions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;, we automatically have that
&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{u}(\lambda\mathbf{x},\lambda^2 t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\rho(\lambda\mathbf{x},\lambda^2 t)&lt;/math&gt; are also solutions.

===Computer vision===
{{Main article|Scale space}}
In [[computer vision]] and [[biological vision]], scaling transformations arise because of the perspective image mapping and because of objects having different physical size in the world. In these areas, scale invariance refers to local image descriptors or visual representations of the image data that remain invariant when the local scale in the image domain is changed.&lt;ref name=Lin13PONE&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066990 Lindeberg, T.

In folklore, a [[bullet]] cast from [[silver]] is often the only weapon that is effective against a [[werewolf]], [[witch]], or other [[monster]]s. The term is also a metaphor for a simple, seemingly magical, solution to a difficult problem: for example, [[penicillin]] was a silver bullet that cured many bacterial infections.

==In folklore==
*The idea of the [[werewolf]]'s supposed vulnerability to silver probably dates back to the legend of the [[Beast of Gévaudan]], in which a gigantic wolf is killed by a hunter with the name of "Argent" which comes from the Latin word for silver, wielding a gun loaded with silver bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Jackson|year=1995|title=Witchcraft and the Occult|publisher=Devizes, Quintet Publishing|page=25|isbn=1-85348-888-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy-tale of ''[[The Two Brothers]]'', a bullet-proof witch is shot down by silver buttons, fired from a gun.

==The Lone Ranger==
Silver bullets also act as a calling card for [[The Lone Ranger]] in his adventures. The masked man decided to use bullets forged from the precious metal as a symbol of justice, law and order, and to remind himself and others that life, like silver, has value and is not to be wasted or thrown away. In the 3rd episode, his friend, who will be making his bullets for him, mentions killing villains with the bullets and the Lone Ranger explains that he will not shoot to kill; he will let the law dispense justice. The silver bullets will be as symbols of justice. Whether he actually used silver bullets in his guns varies depending on story and medium. In the radio series, the Lone Ranger used only lead bullets as weapons, while the silver bullets were used symbolically. In the [[The Legend of the Lone Ranger|1981 feature film]], The Lone Ranger used silver bullets in his guns as he was told that silver was far more solid than lead slugs and provided a straighter shot. The Lone Ranger's usage of bullet made from valuable metal like silver is satirized in an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' where after expertly shooting a tin can in the air, the Ranger's sidekick Tonto laments that the amount of silver the Ranger thoughtlessly wasted could have bought enough food to feed Tonto's entire village for a year.

==Ballistic effectiveness==
Silver bullets differ from lead bullets in several respects. [[Lead]] has a 10% higher density than [[silver]], so a silver bullet will have a little less mass than a lead bullet of identical dimensions. Pure silver is less [[malleable]] than lead and falls between [[lead]] and [[copper]] in terms of hardness (1.5 &lt; '''2.5''' &lt; 3.0 [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]]) and [[shear modulus]] (5.6 &lt; '''30''' &lt; 48 GPa). A silver bullet accepts the [[rifling]] of a gun barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/articles/silver/silverbullet14.shtml | title = History Channel Shoot | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = September 2008 | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017 | quotation = In this photo, you can see the marks the rifling in the barrel left on the bullet when it was fired. I'd like to see a little more on the nose, but the driving bands show very nice engraving.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terminal impact is somewhat speculative and will depend on a variety of factors including bullet size and shape, flight distance, and target material. At short ranges, the silver bullet will most likely give better penetration due to its higher shear modulus, and will not deform as much as a lead bullet. A 2007 episode of ''[[MythBusters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-silver-vs-lead-bullets.html | title = Mythbusters: Silver vs. Lead Bullets | date = 2007 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a greater penetration depth of lead bullets vs. silver bullets. Results cannot be considered conclusive, however, as the show utilized a 250-[[Grain (unit)|grain]] lead slug in a [[.45LC|.45-caliber Colt long]] shell vs a lighter (190-grain) silver slug fired at closer range. Another ''MythBusters'' episode, from 2012, showed that silver bullets are less accurate than lead bullets when fired from the M1 Garand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/hollywood-gunslingers/ | title = Mythbusters: Hollywood Gunslingers | date = June 17, 2012 | medium = Television production | publisher = The Discovery Channel | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Briggs also did some experiments with silver bullets compared to lead bullets. After making a custom mold to ensure that the sizes of the silver bullets were comparable to the lead bullets, he fired them. He found that the silver bullets were slightly slower than the lead bullets and less accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.patriciabriggs.com/books/silver/silverbullets.shtml | title = Silver Bullets | first = Michael | last = Briggs | date = | publisher = Patricia Briggs | accessdate = January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hopi mythology]], "Spider Grandmother" ([[Hopi language|Hopi]] ''Kokyangwuti'') is the creator of humans, identified with the "[[Earth Goddess]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spider Woman Stories, published by The University of Arizona Press, 1979. {{ISBN|0-8165-0621-3}}

In [[Navajo mythology]], Spider Woman (''Na'ashjé'íí Asdzáá'') is the constant helper and protector of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legendary Native American Figures: Spider Woman (Na'ashjéii Asdzáá)|url=http://www.native-languages.org/spider-woman.htm|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Diné Bahaneʼ#Spider Man, Spider Woman and Weaving|Diné Bahaneʼ]]'' creation narrative of the Navajo (recorded 1928) includes a mention of "Spider Man and Spider Woman", who introduced the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan, Aileen, ''The Diné: Origin Myths of the Navajo Indians'' (Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, "The Age of Beginning", transcribed 1928).

According to the [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[string game]]s were given to them by Grandmother Spider.&lt;ref&gt;Allan and Paulette Macfarlan (1958). ''Handbook of American Indian Games'', p.189. {{ISBN|978-0-486-24837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Pueblo Indians|Pueblo]] tradition, Spider Old Woman appears as the equivalent of "[[Tsichtinako|Thought Woman]]" ([[Keresan languages|Keresan]] ''Tse-che-nako, Sussistanako''): while the name of "Thought Woman" was reserved for sacred ceremonies, Spider Woman would be used in the context of everyday discussion or teaching.&lt;ref&gt;"Some confusion is sometimes created concerning Tse che nako and Old Spider Woman, especially in secular discussions. [[Keres people|Kere]] holy men hesitate to mention Tse che nako's name, especially for purely secular discussions; Thought Woman's name is reserved for use only in sacred ceremonies. In secular discussions and teachings, Tse che nako is often symbolically referred to as Old Spider Woman or Spider Woman. "Purley, Anthony F. (1974). "Keres Pueblo Concepts of Deity," ''American Indian Culture and Research'', 1, no.1: 31. Quoted in: Buell, Lawrence (1996). ''The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture'', p.518-519., n.27. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674258624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Karl Taube]] in 1983 tentatively connected the South Western "Spider Woman" mytheme with the pre-Columbian [[Teotihuacan]] "[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]]" known from pictorial representations.

The [[Ojibwe people]] (Chippewa) of southern Canada and northern US speak of Spider Woman, known as ''Asibikaashi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingham|first1=John Pratt|title=God and dreams : is there a connection?|date=2010|publisher=Resource Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=9781606086674|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a helper of the people, and inspiring mothers (or other close female relatives) to weave protective [[dreamcatcher|spider web charms]].&lt;ref name=Densmore&gt;Densmore, Frances (1929, 1979) ''Chippewa Customs''.

The [[Choctaw people]] of [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] tell the story of Grandmother Spider stealing fire, then after animals refused it, bringing fire to humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indigenouspeople.net/spider.htm] "Grandmother Spider Steals the Fire" story {{verify credibility|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">[[Harold Shapero]] completed the '''Symphony for Classical Orchestra''' in [[B-flat major]] on March 10, 1947, in [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts]]. It is written for an orchestra consisting of [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 2 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 2 tenor [[trombone]]s and one bass (silent until the Finale&lt;ref&gt;Along with the piccolo and contrabassoon, pp. 170 — 171 (1992) Pollack. "As its title indicated, the work calls for forces smaller than the modern orchestra," but its exact instrumentation is found only in Beethoven's 5th, right down to the detail that piccolo, contrabassoon and trombones are reserved for the final movement.&lt;/ref&gt;), [[timpani]] and strings. Although labelled "Classical," many of the work's features point to Beethoven rather than Haydn or Mozart, such as "the way in which Shapero paces himself, alternating long passages in the tonic and the dominant, with fast, dramatic modulations often reserved for transitions and developments."&lt;ref&gt;p. 173 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolas Slonimsky]] remarked on how the piece is "premeditatedly cast in the proclamatory key of B-flat major, the natural tonality of the bugle, and ending in a display of tonic major triads."&lt;ref&gt;p. 846 (1971) Slonimsky&lt;/ref&gt; But there are modern features as well, with "the work's orchestration, in general, ... distinctively bright and brassy, and undoubtedly derived a fair amount from [[Walter Piston|Piston]] and [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], as well as from the composer's experience as a dance band arranger."&lt;ref&gt;p. 171 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is in four movements:

# Adagio {{music|eighth}} = 48, 3/8 — Allegro {{music|half}} = 120 2/2
# Adagietto {{music|eighth}} = 54, [[E-flat major]], 8/8
# Vivace {{music|dottedhalf}} = 132 a due battute or {{music|dottedhalf}} = 138 a quattro battute, [[G major]] — [[E major]] — G major
# Allegro con spirito {{music|half}} = 138-144

Some commentators have found hints of the blues in the slow introduction to the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;p. 172 (1992) Pollack. "The form of the introduction itself, with its slow harmonic rhythm and three cadences in the tonic, faintly suggests a "blues" strophe, a suggestion that further contributes to the music's distinctively earthy character."&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Allegro is.

The Adagietto's theme "is classically balletic, with supple rhythms, graceful turns, sighing fourths, and sweet appoggiaturas and suspensions."&lt;ref&gt;p. 174 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; The movement consists of "quasi-variations that ... are organized according to the sonata principle."&lt;ref&gt;p. 175 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Scherzo, Shapero indicates it could be taken at two measures (battute) or four measures. These instructions naturally suggest the influence of Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'', but the scherzo theme itself ... points more directly to the ''Third''; Shapero updates Beethoven's two-note idea ... to include a jazzy flatted third. The movement contains other Beethovenian features: ghostly chromatics, ... a sort of peasant stomping, ... and a generous sense of humor, sometimes quite broad."&lt;ref&gt;pp. 176 — 177 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The Finale is rich in interconnections to the preceding movements, but especially the first movement.&lt;ref&gt;p. 179 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was given its premiere performance by [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducting the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] on January 30, 1948&lt;ref&gt;p. 846 (1971) Slonimsky&lt;/ref&gt; and later in Hague.&lt;ref&gt;p. 149, Peyser (1987) Joan. New York ''The Coast-to-Coast Bestseller Bernstein: A Biography'' Ballantine Biography&lt;/ref&gt; "Bernstein went on ... to record the whole work with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, a recording rough in spots, but whose passion and finesse clearly suited the music."&lt;ref&gt;p. 181 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, there was only one other recording of the piece, by [[André Previn]] and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 767 (2005) Stevenson, "Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra" in Woodstra, Brennan, Schrott (editors) Chris, Gerald, Allen. New York ''All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music'' Hal Leonard Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that has not helped the work's reception.&lt;ref&gt;p. 181 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Copland thought highly of Shapero but did not like his inclination to "hide the brilliance of his own gifts behind the cloak of the great masters."&lt;ref&gt;p. 198 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Of Copland's works, Shapero always admired the Short Symphony,&lt;ref&gt;p. 200 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; even after Copland's popular Symphony No. 3, of which "Shapero criticized, among other things, the first movement's trombone melody."&lt;ref&gt;p. 417 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later on in his life, Copland dedicated one of his [[Emily Dickinson]] settings to Shapero.&lt;ref&gt;p. 442 (1999) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Symphony for Classical Orchestra, the composer, still in his twenties, "was producing a series of chamber and orchestral works, each one longer and grander than the last,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 166 (1992) Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; but afterwards wrote rather little music for the rest of his life. Fellow composer [[Arthur Victor Berger|Arthur Berger]], who like Shapero was a member of the "Harvard Stravinsky school, and considered the latter to be "arguably the most talented of us all,"&lt;ref&gt;p. 75 (2002) Berger&lt;/ref&gt; was puzzled by the way the latter's "composing activity tapered off" after "this illustrious beginning."&lt;ref&gt;p. 76 (2002) Berger&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Snowman'''" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP378"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen as ''Sneemanden'' on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1861.&lt;ref name="HCACenter"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye Eventyr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager describes the tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to Andersen's "[[The Fir-Tree]]" of December 1844.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP378&amp;ndash;379"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=378&amp;ndash;379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wullschlager believes "The Snowman" was the product in part of Andersen’s "pining and discontent over" [[Harald Scharff]], a handsome young dancer at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP373,379"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=373,379}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet "some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP387&amp;ndash;389"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=387&amp;ndash;389}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen's life that brought him happiness.&lt;ref name="Andersen, H. C.P435"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, H.C.|2005|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
"The Snowman" begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise. He is only a day old, and quite naïve and inexperienced. His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch. The dog senses a change in the weather, enters his kennel and goes to sleep.

At dawn, the land is covered in frosty whiteness when a young couple enter the garden to admire the scene and the Snowman. When they leave, the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into "the same kennel and share their bones". He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper's room as a pampered pet. The Snowman can see the stove through a window in the house and believes it is female. He falls in love. The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove, but the dog warns him he would melt.

All day the Snowman gazes upon the stove, and, at twilight, the stove glows. When the door of the room is opened, the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. The dog warns the snowman of an imminent change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the Snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the Snowman within his remains, and then understands why the Snowman longed for the stove: "That's what moved inside him... Now he is over that, too!" The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP378" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersenHC2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, H.C.|2005|pp=325&amp;ndash;329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Scholars have noted Andersen was attracted to both men and women during his middle years. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes,  "Andersen's diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersen biographer [[Alison Prince]] comments, "It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet..."&lt;ref name="PrinceP13&amp;ndash;14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|1998|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both believe "The Snowman" has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.

=== Andersen and Harald Scharff ===
[[File:HaraldScharff1860.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Scharff as Gennaro in [[August Bournonville|Bournonville]]'s ballet ''[[Napoli (ballet)|Napoli]]'', 1860]]

In 1857 in Paris, he made the acquaintance of fellow Dane Harald Scharff, a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with Copenhagen's Royal Theatre. Andersen was returning to Copenhagen via Paris following a visit to [[Charles Dickens]] in England, and Scharff was on holiday with his Copenhagen housemate, the actor Lauritz Eckardt. Andersen and Scharff toured [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] together.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensP474"&gt;{{Harvnb| Andersen, Jens|2005|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP373"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Three years passed before Andersen again met the pair quite by accident in [[Bavaria]] in July 1860; the three men enjoyed a week together in [[Munich]] and its environs. It is probable that Andersen fell in love with Scharff at this time.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP373" /&gt;  According to his diary, Andersen did not "feel at all well" when the two young men left Munich on 9&amp;nbsp;July 1860 for [[Salzburg, Austria|Salzburg]].&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP374"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The day after their departure, Andersen (who usually thought of himself as ugly) had his photograph taken by [[Franz Hanfstaengl]] and wrote: “I’ve never seen such a lovely yet life-like portrait of myself. I was completely surprised, astonished, that the sunlight could make such a beautiful figure of my face.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP373&amp;ndash;376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=374&amp;ndash;376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of Scharff and Eckardt for Salzburg, Andersen traveled to Switzerland but grew despondent and then depressed. In November, he returned to Copenhagen and spent [[Christmas]] at Basnæs, the estate of an aristocratic patron and friend on the coast of [[Zealand]]. His spirits lifted with the holiday festivities and "The Snowman” was composed on [[New Year’s Eve]] 1860.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP377&amp;ndash;378"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=377&amp;ndash;378}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published with several other new tales by Andersen two months later on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1861 in ''New Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Series. First Collection. 1861.'' by the Copenhagen publisher C. A. Reitzel.&lt;ref name="HCACenter" /&gt;

[[File:Basnaes.jpg|thumb|Basnæs, the estate where Andersen wrote "The Snowman"]]

Andersen's relationship with Scharff continued to develop and early in 1862 the two entered a relationship that brought Andersen "joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP387&amp;ndash;389"/&gt;    Andersen referred to this time in his life as his "erotic period", but he was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensPP475&amp;ndash;476"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|pp=475&amp;ndash;476}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The affair came to an end late in 1863 as Scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with Eckardt who had married an actress.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensP477"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|p=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP272,291"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=373,391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andersen noted in his diary 13&amp;nbsp;November 1863: "Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over."  Andersen took the end of the affair calmly and the two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness. Andersen tried several times to lure Scharff into another intimate relationship but without success.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392&amp;ndash;393"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=392&amp;ndash;393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;While on holiday, for example, Andersen and Scharff were forced to spend the night in Helsingør. Andersen reserved a double room for them both but Scharff insisted upon having his own.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Andersen continued to follow Scharff's career with interest but in 1871 an injury during rehearsal forced Scharff permanently from the ballet stage. Scharff tried acting without success, married a ballerina in 1874, and died in the St. Hans insane asylum in 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensPP477&amp;ndash;479"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|pp=477&amp;ndash;479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commentaries ===
Andersen retained story ideas in his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as “The Snowman” was a compulsion with him. The tale has been described as poignant and lyrical, and as a self-mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light-hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen’s tragic Fir Tree and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns “to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form.”&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP378&amp;ndash;379" /&gt;

[[File:Hca ill 0094.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration c. 1870 from "The Snowman": "He had been born amid the triumphant shouts of the boys, and welcomed by the jingling of sleigh bells and the cracking of whips from the passing sleighs." ("The Snowman". H.C. Andersen, translated by [[Jean Hersholt]], 1949)]]

Andersen referred to "The Snowman" as a simple fairy tale, but the story may be viewed as a [[metaphor]] for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a common bond with [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]]&amp;mdash;both grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alsion Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of ''Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century'' calls his work an "[[Aesop]] of 19th-century homosexuality".&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrinceP13&amp;ndash;14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EcksteinP62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2007|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference.  "The Snowman" is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong type&amp;ndash;with the stove representing the danger in this "wrong" relationship. Andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love. His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to [[masturbation]] as a sexual outlet, and one critic notes that "[Andersen] so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets."&lt;ref name="EcksteinPP62&amp;ndash;64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2007|pp=61&amp;ndash;63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen biographer Alison Prince believes the tale to be a [[parable]] representing the different kinds of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|1998|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5280">A '''white point''' (often referred to as '''reference white''' or '''target white''' in technical documents) is a set of [[tristimulus|tristimulus values]] or [[chromaticity]] coordinates that serve to define the color "white" in image capture, encoding, or reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Color and Mastering for Digital Cinema | author = Glenn Kennel | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-80874-6 | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w__iiSih-zUC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=white-point+chromaticity&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=s4qJR6iuFJq6tgPYmYnQBQ&amp;sig=HeAw467xtg4Lrb24h4d9f1qKtJU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the application, different definitions of white are needed to give acceptable results. For example, photographs taken indoors may be lit by [[incandescent light]]s, which are relatively orange compared to [[daylight]]. Defining "white" as daylight will give unacceptable results when attempting to color-correct a photograph taken with incandescent lighting.

The white point of an illuminant is the [[chromaticity]] of a [[white]] object under the illuminant, and can be specified by chromaticity coordinates, such as the ''x'', ''y'' coordinates on the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] (hence the use of the relative SPD and not the absolute SPD, because the white point is only related to color and unaffected by intensity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging | author = R. E. Jacobson | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-240-51574-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HHX4xB94vcMC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=white-point+chromaticity+cie+object&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=K46JR8XYJoeWtgOw-MTQBQ&amp;sig=NbZh2Zi339EJCZ4oW9MdQgUEMY4#PPA388,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illuminant and white point are separate concepts. For a given illuminant, its white point is uniquely defined. A given white point, on the other hand, generally does not uniquely correspond to only one illuminant. From the commonly used [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]], it can be seen that almost all [[spectral color|non-spectral colors]] (all except those on the [[line of purples]]), including colors described as white, can be produced by ''infinitely many'' [[convex combination|combinations]] of spectral colors, and therefore by infinitely many different illuminant spectra.

Although there is generally no one-to-one correspondence between illuminants and white points, in the case of the [[standard illuminant|CIE D-series standard illuminants]], the spectral power distributions are mathematically derivable from the chromaticity coordinates of the corresponding white points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Spectral Power Distribution of a CIE D-Illuminant | url = http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_DIlluminant.html | author = Bruce Justin Lindbloom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the illuminant's spectral power distribution, the [[reflectance]] spectrum of the specified white object (often taken as unity), and the numerical definition of the observer allows the coordinates of the white point in any [[color space]] to be defined. For example, one of the simplest illuminants is the "E" or "Equal Energy" spectrum. Its spectral power distribution is flat, giving the same power per unit wavelength at any wavelength. In terms of both the 1931 and 1964 [[CIE XYZ color space]]s, its color coordinates are [''k'', ''k'', ''k''], where ''k'' is a constant, and its chromaticity coordinates are [''x'', ''y''] = [1/3, 1/3].

==White point conversion==
{{further information|Chromatic adaptation}}
If the color of an object is recorded under one illuminant, then it is possible to estimate the color of that object under another illuminant, given only the white points of the two illuminants. If the image is "uncalibrated" (the illuminant's white point unknown), the white point has to be estimated. However, if one merely wants to [[white balance]] (make neutral objects appear neutral in the recording), this may not be necessary.

Expressing color as tristimulus coordinates in the [[LMS color space]], one can "translate" the object's color according to the [[Von Kries transform]] simply by scaling the LMS coordinates by the ratio of the maximum of the tristimulus values at both white points. This provides a simple, but rough estimate. Another method that is sometimes preferred uses a [[Bradford transform]] or another [[chromatic adaptation transform]]; in general, these work by transforming into an intermediate space, scaling the amounts of the primaries in that space, and converting back by the inverse transform.

To truly calculate the color of an object under another illuminant, not merely how it will be perceived, it is necessary to record [[Multi-spectral image|multi-spectral]] or [[Hyperspectral imaging|hyper-spectral]] color information.

Princess '''Wijdan Ali''' ({{lang-ar|وجدان علي}}) (born 29 August 1939 in [[Baghdad]], Iraq) is a [[Jordan]]ian artist, art historian, educator and diplomat.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Ali, Wijdan, Princess |encyclopedia=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture |year=2009 |ISBN=019530991X |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the ex-wife of Prince 'Ali bin Naif of Jordan. She is best known for her efforts to revive the traditions of Islamic art and her abstract paintings and for her work as an art historian.

==Education and career==
Born, Sharifa Wijdan bint Fawwaz in Baghdad on  29 August 1939 into a noble family, she was raised in Jordan. She was the daughter of architect, Sharif Fawwaz Muhana and his wife, Sharifa Nafi'a bint Jamil Ali. Both her parents could trace their ancestry to the Prophet Mohammed, which allowed her to given the title of ''Sharifa''.&lt;ref&gt;The titles, ''Sharif'' and ''Sharifa'' which roughly translate as ''noble'', are honorific titles given to those who can tace their ancestry to Islamic prophet Mohammed. ''Encyclopedia.com,''[https://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/wijdan-ali-1939 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, she joined the Foreign Office of the United Nations in Jordan, shortly after completing her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Middle Eastern history from Beirut University College (1961), now the [[Lebanese American University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Princess Wijdan Ali:Interview" ''Nafas Arts Magazine,'' December, 2003, Online: https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2003/princess-wijdan-ali/&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to enter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jordan (1962) and also the first woman delegate to represent Jordan at [[United Nations]] meetings&lt;ref name=who/&gt; and the first female diplomat at the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

While working as a diplomat, she was studying art privately and received some of her early arts training from French teacher, Alice Ladoux.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, L., "Journey through Art: Princes Wijdan Ali," ''The Star,'' December 2002, in the Khalid Foundation Press Clippings, [http://thekhalidshomanfoundation.org/main/activit/press_clips/htm/wijdan.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, following her marriage to Prince 'Ali bin Naif the second son of the ruling Hashemite family on Jordan, she resigned from her diplomatic post and began to take art seriously. She then began to study art formally with Jordanian artists, [[Muhanna Al-Dura]] and Armando Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013  p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; She received a [[Ph.D.]] in Islamic art from the [[University of London]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Wijdan Ali is both a contemporary painter and art historian. Her art explores themes of universal tragedy, especially dramatic events in Arab history, such as the Karbala series, which explores the tragedy that occurred in seventh century Karbala, when the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussein]], was martyred.&lt;ref name="mjmes.wordpress.com"&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; She also uses the motif of Islamic calligraphy as a graphic form, which was itself a revival of a traditional art form.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S. (ed), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing explores the rise and fall of an Islamic aesthetic in Islamic art and the dilution of centuries-long traditions, with the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Palumbo, G., "Omages of Piety or Power? Conserving the Umayyad Royal Narrative in Qusayr Amra," Chapter 6 in T.

She is founder of the [[Royal Society of Fine Arts (Jordan)|Royal Society of Fine Arts]] and of the [[Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts]]. She is also founder and dean of the newly established Faculty of Arts and Design at the [[University of Jordan]].&lt;ref name=soas&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/about/fellows/hrh-princess-wijdan-bint-fawaz-al-hashemi/ |title=HRH Princess Wijdan bint Fawaz Al-Hashemi |publisher=SOAS, University of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a patron of the arts and has curated a number of exhibitions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Malt, C., ''Women's Voices In Middle East Museums: Case Studies In Jordan,'' Syracuse University Press, 2005, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Princess Wijdan Bint Fawwaz Muhana took the oath of office as Jordan's new ambassador to Italy before [[King Abdullah II]] on October 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.ju.edu.jo/alumni/UJConnect13/P.Wijdan.htm |title=H.R.H Princess Wijdan Ali: Ambassador to Italy |work=UJCOnnect |publisher=University of Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
In her art, she develops the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern format and, as such, she forms part of the contemporary school of Arabic calligraphic painting.&lt;ref name=Talhami/&gt; Due to her use of Arabic calligraphy as a graphic form, she has been described as a pioneer of the ''[[Hurufiyya movement|Hurufiyyah Art Movement]]''. &lt;ref name="mjmes.wordpress.com"/&gt; Her work, which has won [[award]]s in [[Belgium]] and [[France]], is found in [[museum]]s and private collections internationally, including the collections of the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the American [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] and the [[National Art Gallery, Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=soas/&gt; She has participated in the cross cultural cooperation " the Dance of Visions" in Gothenburg Sweden, invited by the Swedish artist [[Ragnhild Lundén]]. Her best known art works are a series of shimmering desert-scapes made during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides,'' 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a highly respected historian of Islamic art,&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Arab World 2007-2008'', Publitec Publications, pp 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; and has authored, edited and contributed to a number of books, including  several devoted to female artists in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, S. (ed), ''Bibliography of Art and Architecture in the Islamic World,'' BRILL,  2012, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of her seminal works in the field, are:&lt;ref name=Talhami&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=4ddqaCdZdZ0C&amp;pg=PA24 |title=Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa |page=24 |last=Talhami |first=Ghada Hashem |year=2013 |ISBN=081086858X}}; Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49. Ramadan writes that these two books are the "best English language works documenting important works and history of modern art in various countries in the region." (p.49)&lt;/ref&gt;
