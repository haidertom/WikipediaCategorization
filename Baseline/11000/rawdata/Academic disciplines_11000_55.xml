      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''Adaptive sampling''' is a technique used in computational [[molecular biology]] to efficiently simulate [[protein folding]].

==Background==
Proteins spend a large portion – nearly 96% in some cases&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/&gt; – of their [[protein folding|folding]] time "waiting" in various [[thermodynamic free energy]] minima. Consequently, a straightforward simulation of this process would spend a great deal of computation to this state, with the transitions between the states – the aspects of protein folding of greater scientific interest – taking place only rarely.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; Adaptive sampling exploits this property to simulate the protein's [[phase space]] in between these states. Using adaptive sampling, molecular simulations that previously would have taken decades can be performed in a matter of weeks.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Theory==
If a protein folds through the [[metastable state]]s A -&gt; B -&gt; C, researchers can calculate the length of the transition time between A and C by simulating the A -&gt; B transition and the B -&gt; C transition. The protein may fold through alternative routes which may overlap in part with the A -&gt; B -&gt; C pathway. Decomposing the problem in this manner is efficient because each step can be simulated in parallel.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Applications==
Adaptive sampling is used by the [[Folding@home]] distributed computing project in combination with [[Hidden markov model|Markov state models]].&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
While adaptive sampling is useful for short simulations, longer trajectories may be more helpful for certain types of biochemical problems.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9757">{{canon law}}
'''"Appeal as from an abuse"''' (French ''appel comme d'abus'') is a legal term applied in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], meaning originally a legal appeal as recourse to the civil forum (court) against the usurpation by the ecclesiastical forum of the rights of [[law|civil jurisdiction]]. It could mean (''vice versa'') a recourse to the ecclesiastical forum against the usurpation by the civil forum of the rights of [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]]. 

Thus defined, the "appeal as from an abuse" had as its object was to safeguard equally the rights both of the State and of the Church. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. In practice the use of such appeals was important, historically, as a way to undermine the power of church courts.

==Canon law==

The canons&lt;ref&gt;can. "Dilecto", in bk. VI of Decretals, "De sent. excom.", in ch. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; did not exclude a recourse to the civil authority when the acts of an ecclesiastical judge invaded the domain of the civil authority, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the right to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the lay judge to the damage of the rights of the Church. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an ecclesiastical court undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher ecclesiastical court, and the ruler was asked&lt;ref&gt;can. "Placuit" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction. Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century.

==History==

Ecclesiastical judges acquired a reputation for learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the laity were adjudicated by them. in 1329 complaint was brought to King [[Philip VI of France|Philip de Valois]] by the advocate general, Peter de Cugnières, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent. Even the Catholic states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the Church.

When the Protestant states had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the Catholic states, particularly France, strove to limit the jurisdiction of the Church as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the Catholic Faith. The [[Pragmatic Sanction]] was a serious aggression by France upon the acknowledged rights of the Church and of the Holy See. It is in France that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon Church jurisdiction, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the ecclesiastical forum. 

During the seventeenth century the French clergy presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments had a right to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics. 

Interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the right of protection over the Church conceded in early days to the Christian Roman Emperors. The Church was recognized as autonomous in all things of the divine law and in matters of ecclesiastical discipline. When rulers like [[Charlemagne]] seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the bishops claimed their sole right to govern the Church. Even in mixed assemblies of bishops and nobles and princes, the bishops insisted that the civil power should not encroach upon the rights of the Church, e. g. in the [[Concile of Narbonne (788)|Council of Narbonne]] (788). 

Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;Dissertaz. 28&lt;/ref&gt; recognized, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the Catholic rulers of Catholic States, in their quality of protectors of the Church, might receive a recourse from ecclesiastics in ecclesiastical matters, in order that justice might be done them by their ordinary ecclesiastical judges, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum. In her [[concordat]]s with Catholic states the Catholic Church granted to several that the civil cases of clerics, and such as concern the property and temporal rights of churches, as well as benefices and other ecclesiastical foundations, may be brought before the civil courts.

==Modern relationship==

All ecclesiastical causes, and those that concern the Faith, sacraments, morals, sacred functions, and rights connected with the sacred ministry, belong to the ecclesiastical forum, both in regard of persons and of matter.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Concordat with Ecuador in 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, as decreed by the [[Council of Baltimore]] (1837), the church law is that if any ecclesiastical person or member of a religious body, male or female, should cite an ecclesiastic or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely ecclesiastical nature, he should know that he falls under the censures decreed by canon law. 

The [[Congregation of Propaganda]] in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the persons may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the civil government is not in the hands of Catholics, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an ecclesiastical decision for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by Propaganda for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;17 August 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; that if a priest should bring a cleric before a civil tribunal on an ecclesiastical or other question without permission from the bishop he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the bishop must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the bishop is to be cited, the permission of the Holy See is required. 

By a special declaration of Propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;6 September 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric's transfer of a claim to a layman for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the consent of the bishop to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. Justice Redfield&lt;ref&gt;in vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; says in reference to the United States generally: "The decision of ecclesiastical courts or officers having, by the rules or laws of the bodies to which they belong, jurisdiction of such questions, or the right to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the jurisdiction of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the laws or the usage of the bodies they represent." Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;In his lecture on the "Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy" (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the Church as "an interior organization within a religious society", and adds,&lt;ref&gt;p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of discipline, of faith, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the Church, in its own modes of decision, civil law tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29806">{{short description|The bacterial component of the plankton that drifts in the water column}}
'''Bacterioplankton''' refers to the [[bacterium|bacterial]] component of the [[plankton]] that drifts in the water column.  The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''{{lang|grc|πλανκτος}}'' (''{{lang|grc-Latn|planktos}}''), meaning "wanderer" or "drifter", and ''{{lang|la|bacterium}}'', a [[Latin]] term coined in the 19th century by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]].  They are found in both [[seawater]] and [[freshwater]].

Bacterioplankton occupy a range of [[ecological niche]]s in marine and aquatic ecosystems. They are both primary producers and primary consumers in these ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycling of elements essential for life (e.g., carbon and nitrogen). Many bacterioplankton species are [[autotroph]]ic, and derive energy from either [[photosynthesis]] or [[chemosynthesis]]. Photosynthetic bacterioplankton are often categorized as [[phytoplankton|picophytoplankton]], and include major [[cyanobacteria]]l groups such as ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' and ''[[Synechococcus]]''. Other heterotrophic bacterioplankton are [[saprotroph]]ic, and obtain energy by consuming organic material produced by other organisms. This material may be [[Dissolved Organic Carbon|dissolved]] in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as [[marine snow]]. Bacterioplankton play critical roles in global [[nitrogen fixation]], [[nitrification]], [[denitrification]], [[remineralisation]] and [[methanogen]]esis.

Bacterioplankton [[Bacterioplankton counting methods|abundance]] depends on environmental variables like temperature, nutrient availability and predation. Like other small plankton, the bacterioplankton are [[predation|preyed]] upon by [[zooplankton]] (usually [[protozoa]]ns), and their numbers are also controlled through [[infection]] by [[bacteriophage]]s.

== Major groups ==

=== Photosynthetic Bacterioplankton ===
Photosynthetic bacterioplankton are responsible for a large proportion of the total [[primary production]] of aquatic food webs, supplying organic compounds to higher trophic levels. These bacteria undergo [[Photosynthesis|oxygenic]] and [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]]. Differences between these processes can be seen in the byproducts produced, the primary electron donor, and the light harvesting pigments used for energy capture.

Green bacteria have different light harvesting pigments consisting of bacteriochlorophyll c, d and e.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt; These organisms do not produce oxygen through photosynthesis or use water as a reducing agent.

=== Heterotrophic Bacterioplankton ===
Heterotrophic bacterioplankton rely on the available concentration of dissolved organic matter in the water column. Usually these organisms are saprophytic, absorbing nutrients from their surroundings. These heterotrophs also play a key role in the microbial loop and the remineralization of organic compounds like carbon and nitrogen. Pelagibacterales, also known as members of an alphaproteobacteria clade, are the most abundant bacterioplankton in the oceans. Members of this group are found in waters with low nutrient availability and are preyed on by protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robert M.|last2=Rappé|first2=Michael S.|last3=Connon|first3=Stephanie A.|last4=Vergin|first4=Kevin L.|last5=Siebold|first5=William A.|last6=Carlson|first6=Craig A.|last7=Giovannoni|first7=Stephen J.|date=December 2002|title=SAR11 clade dominates ocean surface bacterioplankton communities|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=420|issue=6917|pages=806–810|doi=10.1038/nature01240|pmid=12490947|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=JJ|last2=Findlay|first2=S|last3=Pace|first3=ML|title=Bacterial production in fresh and saltwater ecosystems: a cross-system overview|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/43/m043p001.pdf|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=43|pages=1–10|doi=10.3354/meps043001|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biogeochemical cycling ==

=== Carbon ===
Atmospheric carbon is sequestered into the ocean by three main pumps which have been known for 30 years: the [[solubility pump]], the [[carbonate pump]], and the [[Biological pump|biological carbon pump]] (BCP).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-05-01|title=The microbial carbon pump concept: Potential biogeochemical significance in the globally changing ocean|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661115000105|journal=Progress in Oceanography|language=en|volume=134|pages=432–450|doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2015.01.008|issn=0079-6611|last1=Legendre|first1=Louis|last2=Rivkin|first2=Richard B.|last3=Weinbauer|first3=Markus G.|last4=Guidi|first4=Lionel|last5=Uitz|first5=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological carbon pump is a vertical transmission pump driven mainly by the sinking of organic rich particles. Bacterial phytoplankton near the surface incorporate atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other nutrients into their biomass during photosynthesis. At the time of their death these phytoplankton, along with their incorporated carbon, sink to the bottom of the ocean where the carbon remains for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780080959757006045|last=De La Rocha|first=C.L.|last2=Passow|first2=U.|pages=93–122|doi=10.1016/b978-0-08-095975-7.00604-5|title=Treatise on Geochemistry|year=2014|isbn=9780080983004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other biologically mediated sequestration of carbon in the ocean occurs through the microbial pump. The microbial pump is responsible for the production of old recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon (DOC) which is &gt;100 years old.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Plankton in the ocean are incapable of breaking down this recalcitrant DOC and thus it remains in the oceans for 1000's years without being respired. The two pumps work simultaneously, and the balance between them is believed to vary based on the availability of nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polimene|first=Luca|last2=Sailley|first2=Sevrine|last3=Clark|first3=Darren|last4=Mitra|first4=Aditee|last5=Allen|first5=J Icarus|date=2017-03-01|title=Biological or microbial carbon pump?

Scientific Affairs Division.|isbn=9781402020872|location=Dordrecht|oclc=54974524}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when bacterioplankton and other organisms in the ocean consume organic matter and respire CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and as a result of the solubility equilibrium between the ocean and the atmosphere.

=== Nitrogen ===
[[File:Marine Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|A schematic showing the cycling of nitrogen within the ocean.]]
The nitrogen cycle in the oceans is mediated by microorganisms, many of which are bacteria, performing multiple conversions such as: [[nitrogen fixation]], [[denitrification]], [[Nitrogen assimilation|assimilation]], and anaerobic ammonia oxidation ([[anammox]]). There are many different nitrogen metabolism strategies employed by bacterioplankton. Starting with molecular nitrogen in the atmosphere (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is fixed by [[Diazotroph|diazatrophs]] such as [[trichodesmium]] into usable forms like ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=Birgitta|last2=Sandh|first2=Gustaf|last3=Lin|first3=Senjie|last4=Larsson|first4=John|last5=Carpenter|first5=Edward J|date=20 September 2012|title=Trichodesmium – a widespread marine cyanobacterium with unusual nitrogen fixation properties | journal=Fems Microbiology Reviews|volume=37|issue=3|pages=286–302|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2012.00352.x|pmc=3655545|pmid=22928644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ammonia can then be assimilated into organic matter like amino and nucleic acids, by both photoautrophic and heterotrophic plankton, it can also be [[Nitrification|nitrified]] to NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for energy production by nitrifying bacteria. Finally the use of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as [[Electron acceptor|terminal electron acceptors]] reduces the nitrogen back into N&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; which is then released back into the atmosphere thus closing the cycle.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zehr|first=Jonathan P.|last2=Kudela|first2=Raphael M.|title=Nitrogen Cycle of the Open Ocean: From Genes to Ecosystems|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=197–225|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-120709-142819|pmid=21329204|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important process involved in the regeneration of atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is anammox.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustaining Life on Planet Earth: Metalloenzymes Mastering Dioxygen and Other Chewy Gases|volume=15|last=Reimann|first=Joachim|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

=== Dissolved Organic Matter ===
[[Dissolved organic carbon|Dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) is available in many forms in the ocean, and is responsible for supporting the growth of bacteria and microorganisms in the ocean. The two main sources of this dissolved organic matter are; decomposition of higher trophic level organisms like plants and fish, and secondly DOM in runoffs that pass through soil with high levels of organic material. It is important to note that the age and quality of the DOM is important for its usability by microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Søndergaard|last2=Middelboe|date=1995-03-09|title=A cross-system analysis of labile dissolved organic carbon|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v118/p283-294/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=118|pages=283–294|doi=10.3354/meps118283|issn=0171-8630}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the DOM in the oceans is refractory or semi-labile and is not available for biodegradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gruber|first=David F.|last2=Simjouw|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Seitzinger|first3=Sybil P.|last4=Taghon|first4=Gary L.|date=2006-06-01|title=Dynamics and Characterization of Refractory Dissolved Organic Matter Produced by a Pure Bacterial Culture in an Experimental Predator-Prey System|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/72/6/4184|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=72|issue=6|pages=4184–4191|doi=10.1128/aem.02882-05|issn=0099-2240|pmid=16751530|pmc=1489638}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above the microbial pump is responsible for the production of refractory DOM which is unavailable for biodegradation and remains dissolved in the oceans for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The turnover of labile DOM organic material is quite high due to scarcity, this is important for the support of multiple trophic levels in the microbial community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirchman|first=David L.|last2=Suzuki|first2=Yoshimi|last3=Garside|first3=Christopher|last4=Ducklow|first4=Hugh W.|date=1991|title=High turnover rates of dissolved organic carbon during a spring phytoplankton bloom|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/352612a0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=352|issue=6336|pages=612–614|doi=10.1038/352612a0|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uptake and respiration of DOM by heterotrophs closes the cycle by producing CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;

== Trophic interactions ==
[[File:Lake Ontario food web.pdf|thumb|Schematic of the food chain in the freshwaters of Lake Ontario.]]
Variations in bacterioplankton abundance are usually a result of temperature, [[zooplankton]] grazing, and availability of substrate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Currie|first=David J.|date=1990-11-01|title=Large-scale variability and interactions among phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and phosphorus|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=35|issue=7|pages=1437–1455|doi=10.4319/lo.1990.35.7.1437|issn=1939-5590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial abundance and productivity are consistently related to algal abundance and productivity as well as organic carbon.

Predation of ciliates is analogous to predation by flagellates on bacteria as well.

With using prokaryotic inhibitors seasonally, there is a positive relationship between bacterial abundance and heterotrophic nanoplankton grazing rates and only 40-45 % of bacterioplankton production was observed to be consumed by phagotrophic Protozoa.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherr|first=Barry F.|last2=Sherr|first2=Evelyn B.|last3=Andrew|first3=Tamara L.|last4=Fallon|first4=Robert D.|last5=Newell|first5=Steven Y.|date=1986|title=Trophic interactions between heterotrophic Protozoa and bacterioplankton in estuarine water analyzed with selective metabolic inhibitors|jstor=24824977|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=32|issue=2/3|pages=169–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, eukaryotic inhibitory experiments show that protozoan grazing has a positive effect on bacterioplankton production suggesting that nitrogen regeneration by Protozoa could be highly important for bacterial growth. Eukaryotic inhibitors did not prove to be useful to determine protozoan grazing rates on bacterioplankton, however they may help understand control mechanisms in the microbial food web.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Bacterioplankton counting methods|Estimates of bacterioplankton abundance and density]] can be derived with a variety of methods including direct counts, flow cytometry, and conclusions drawn from metabolic measures.

Further, as discussed in the biogeochemical cycling section, plankton are responsible for the recycling and movement of essential nutrients (i.e. nitrogen/carbon/DOM) which are essential building blocks for many of the organisms co-existing with bacterioplankton in these ecosystems. These recycled nutrients can be reused by primary producers, thus increasing the efficiency of the biological food web and minimizing energy waste.

The Balseiro Institute teaches [[Physics]], [[Nuclear Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]] and [[Telecommunications Engineering]] at undergraduate and graduate levels. The institute admits students who have completed two years of university studies (either in Physics or Engineering) and undergoes a rigorous admission procedure.

It's considered the best Experimental Physics and Nuclear Engineering study centre of Latin America, as well as a very prestigious one worldwide. In fact, in 2012 the Balseiro institute was recognized among the best levels of education of the world displacing Princeton, Stanford and Columbia &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.visitemosmisiones.com/noticias/noticias/instituto-balseiro-bariloche-entre-los-10-mejores-del-mundo/ visitemos Misiones website – “Instituto Balseiro Bariloche entre los 10 mejores del Mundo” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is a free public institution with a number of features that make it unique. It was created in 1955 and it was formalized in the agreement signed between the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and the National University of Cuyo (UNCuyo). Its objectives are reflected in the Resolution of the Rectorate 0445 of 1999, where both parties reiterate their willingness to jointly formulate the academic policy of the Balseiro Institute, joining forces in order to contribute jointly to the training of specialists in Sciences and Engineering and renew their objective to contribute to the research and development of activities that meet the interests of the country, through UNIVERSITY and CNEA. At the same time, the Balseiro Institute is an academic unit integrated to the Centro Atómico Bariloche (CAB), which has state-of-the-art research and development laboratories to which IB students have access to practice.
It is noteworthy that all IB students receive full scholarships, allowing them a full dedication to the study. This, among other distinctive aspects, allows students of IB degree, master and postgraduate degrees to gain advanced training in both theoretical aspects as well as laboratory practice and technological innovation.

The students of the Balseiro Institute receive personalized education given the relationship, in quantity and quality, teacher-student. At the same time, these teachers are active researchers and technologists who are continuously linked both to scientific and technological centers and to technology companies in the country and the world. In this way, the acquired experience is transmitted to the students who are formed in a stimulating field of scientific research and technological development of vanguard; Face the challenge of growing professionally in a critical attitude and able to solve novel and highly complex problems. On the other hand, and following the original premise of Dr. José Balseiro, students practice in the first level laboratories of the CAB as an indissoluble part of their respective curricula. The training is completed with various optional subjects and special courses.

Thus, at the high academic level, there is the benefit of having a scholarship, which allows students to develop their career in a full way, with an innovative, inquisitive look and with a view to the challenges in science and technology that the present poses.
At the Balseiro Institute, degrees are given in Physics, Nuclear Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Telecommunications Engineering. It should be noted that the IB is the only institution in the country where Nuclear Engineering is taught at the undergraduate level. Also, they offer masters in Physics, Medical Physics and Engineering and PhDs in Physics, Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Sciences.

Other academic activities include the Specialization Course in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy (CEATEN), as well as the IB-CAB Solid Physics School, Summer Internships, Internship Internships with National and Foreign Universities and Summer Scholarships, Specialization, Workshops, Congresses, Conferences, Colloquia and Workshops.

Since the creation of the Balseiro Institute to date (April 2013) 963 graduates and engineers, 234 masters, 460 doctorates and 112 specialists graduated from CEATEN (Specialization in Technological Applications of Nuclear Energy) graduated. Most of these professionals achieved a successful job placement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ib.edu.ar/index.php/sobre-el-ib.html Balseiro Institute website – “Sobre el IB” page] (accessed 2017-06-03)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balseiro Institute works on a permanent basis with the mission of making a substantial contribution to the country's growth in science and technology through the training of scientists and technologists in both the nuclear area for peaceful and non-nuclear purposes. These achievements are achieved through the promotion and realization of high-level academic activities

== History ==
Nuclear research in the province of Rio Negro began as the [[Huemul Project]] in the Perón era. Nuclear facilities were organized as the [[Bariloche Atomic Centre]], under the direction of [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

An educational institution was established as the ''Instituto de Física de Bariloche'' on April 22, 1955, as a joint project of the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[National University of Cuyo]]; the former administers the Bariloche Atomic Centre, whose work led to the first [[research reactor]] in Latin America (1957), as well as the region's first [[Generation II reactor|commercial reactor]], [[Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha I]], in 1974. The institute was renamed in 1962 to honor José Antonio Balseiro, who was its first director.

The first graduates were members of the Physics class of 1958. In the 1970s, Balseiro became the only institute in Argentina to grant degrees in [[nuclear engineering]], as the country was stepping up its nuclear program with the incorporation of the [[Embalse nuclear power plant|Embalse]] and [[Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant|Atucha II]], as well as continued research activity in the Constituyentes and Bariloche reactors.

'''Bionics''' or '''biologically inspired engineering''' is the application of biological methods and systems found in [[nature]] to the study and design of [[engineering]] systems and modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W6DFBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA644&amp;ots=u_Vt-ceEvU&amp;dq=%22bionical%20creativity%20engineering%22&amp;pg=PA644#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bionical%20creativity%20engineering%22&amp;f=false Twenty-First Century's Fuel Sufficiency Roadmap] By Dr. Steve Esomba, Published 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bionic'' was coined by [[Jack E. Steele]] in 1958, possibly originating from the [[International scientific vocabulary|technical term]] ''bion'' (pronounced ''BEE-on''; from {{lang-grc|βίος}} ''bíos''), meaning 'unit of [[life]]' and the suffix ''-ic'', meaning 'like' or 'in the manner of', hence 'like life'. Some dictionaries, however, explain the word as being formed as a [[portmanteau]] from '''''bio'''logy'' and ''electro'''nics'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bionics "bionics"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by the 1970s U.S. television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', both based upon the novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' by [[Martin Caidin]], which was itself influenced by Steele's work. All feature humans given superhuman powers by [[electromechanical]] implants.

The [[technology transfer|transfer of technology]] between lifeforms and manufactured objects is, according to proponents of bionic technology, desirable because evolutionary pressure typically forces living organisms, including fauna and flora, to become highly optimized and efficient. A classical example is the development of dirt- and water-repellent paint (coating) from the observation that practically nothing sticks to the surface of the [[Nelumbo|lotus flower]] plant (the [[lotus effect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

The term "biomimetic" is preferred when reference is made to chemical reactions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  In that domain, biomimetic chemistry refers to reactions that, in nature, involve biological [[macromolecules]] (e.g. enzymes or nucleic acids) whose chemistry can be replicated ''in vitro'' using much smaller molecules.

Examples of bionics in engineering include the hulls of boats imitating the thick skin of dolphins; [[sonar]], [[radar]], and medical [[ultrasound]] imaging imitating [[animal echolocation]].

In the field of [[computer science]], the study of bionics has produced [[artificial neurons]], [[neural network|artificial neural networks]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in Research Interests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000000/http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in |date=14 November 2012 }}. Duke.edu. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[swarm intelligence]]. [[Evolutionary computation]] was also motivated by bionics ideas but it took the idea further by simulating evolution [[in silico]] and producing well-optimized solutions that had never appeared in nature.

It is estimated by [[Julian Vincent]], professor of [[biomimetics]] at the [[University of Bath]]'s Department of Mechanical Engineering, that "at present there is only a 12% overlap between [[biology]] and technology in terms of the mechanisms used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vincent, J. F. V.|author2=Bogatyreva, O. A.|author3=Bogatyrev, N. R.|author4=Bowyer, A.|author5=Pahl, A.-K.|last-author-amp=yes |year=2006|title= Biomimetics—its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume= 3|pages=471–482|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|issue=9|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name biomimetics was coined by [[Otto Schmitt]] in the 1950s. The term bionics was coined by [[Jack E. Steele]] in 1958 while working at the ''Aeronautics Division House'' at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. However, terms like biomimicry or biomimetics are more preferred in the technology world in efforts to avoid confusion between the medical term bionics. Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', which inspired the series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.

== Methods ==
[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Velcro]] was inspired by the tiny hooks found on the surface of [[bur]]s.]]
The study of bionics often emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, [[cybernetics]] tries to model the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while [[artificial intelligence]] tries to model the intelligent function regardless of the particular way it can be achieved.

The conscious copying of examples and mechanisms from natural organisms and ecologies is a form of applied [[case-based reasoning]], treating nature itself as a database of solutions that already work. Proponents argue that the [[selective pressure]] placed on all [[life|natural life forms]] minimizes and removes failures.

Although almost all [[engineering]] could be said to be a form of [[biomimicry]], the modern origins of this field are usually attributed to [[Buckminster Fuller]] and its later codification as a house or field of study to [[Janine Benyus]].

There are generally three biological levels in the fauna or flora, after which technology can be modeled:
*Mimicking natural '''methods of manufacture'''
*Imitating '''mechanisms''' found in nature ([[velcro]])
*Studying '''organizational principles from the [[Collective animal behavior|social behaviour of organisms]]''', such as the [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking behaviour]] of birds, optimization of [[Ant colony optimization|ant foraging]] and [[Bee colony optimization|bee foraging]], and the swarm intelligence (SI)-based behaviour of a [[Shoaling and schooling|school of fish]].

== Examples ==
* In [[robotics]], bionics and biomimetics are used to apply the way animals move to the design of robots.  [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the movements and physiology of kangaroos.
*[[Velcro]] is the most famous example of biomimetics.  In 1948, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Georges de Mestral|George de Mestral]] was cleaning his dog of burrs picked up on a walk when he realized how the hooks of the [[Burr (fruit)|burr]]s clung to the fur.
*The horn-shaped, saw-tooth design for [[lumberjack]] blades used at the turn of the 19th century to cut down trees when it was still done by hand was modeled after observations of a wood-burrowing [[beetle]]. It revolutionized the industry because the blades worked so much faster at felling trees.
*[[Cat's eye (road)|Cat's eye reflectors]] were invented by [[Percy Shaw]] in 1935 after studying the mechanism of cat eyes. He had found that cats had a system of reflecting cells, known as [[tapetum lucidum]], which was capable of reflecting the tiniest bit of light.
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s flying machines and ships are early examples of drawing from nature in engineering.
*[[Resilin]] is a replacement for rubber that has been created by studying the material also found in arthropods.
*Julian Vincent drew from the study of [[Conifer cone|pinecones]] when he developed in 2004 "smart" clothing that adapts to changing temperatures.  "I wanted a nonliving [[system]] which would respond to changes in moisture by changing shape", he said. "There are several such systems in plants, but most are very small — the pinecone is the largest and therefore the easiest to work on".  Pinecones respond to higher humidity by opening their scales (to disperse their seeds). The "smart" fabric does the same thing, opening up when the wearer is warm and sweating, and shutting tight when cold.
*"Morphing aircraft wings" that change shape according to the speed and duration of flight were designed in 2004 by biomimetic scientists from [[Penn State University]]. The morphing wings were inspired by different bird species that have differently shaped wings according to the speed at which they fly.  In order to change the shape and underlying structure of the aircraft wings, the researchers needed to make the overlying skin also be able to change, which their design does by covering the wings with fish-inspired scales that could slide over each other. In some respects this is a refinement of the [[swing-wing]] design.

[[Image:Lotus3.jpg|thumb|Lotus leaf surface, [[3D computer graphics|rendered]]: microscopic view]]
*Some paints and roof tiles have been engineered to be self-cleaning by copying the mechanism from the [[Nelumbo|Nelumbo lotus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/09/sto_lotusan_bio.php Sto Lotusan — Biomimicry Paint]. TreeHugger. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cholesteric liquid crystal]]s (CLCs) are the thin-film material often used to fabricate fish tank thermometers or [[mood ring]]s, that change color with temperature changes. They change color because their molecules are arranged in a [[helix|helical]] or [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different [[wavelength]]s of light.  [[Chiral Photonics, Inc.]] has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted [[optical fiber|glass fiber]].
*[[Nanostructures]] and physical mechanisms that produce the shining color of [[butterfly]] wings were reproduced [[in silico]] by [[Greg Parker (physicist)|Greg Parker]], professor of Electronics and Computer Science at the [[University of Southampton]] and research student [[Luca Plattner]] in the field of [[photonics]], which is [[electronics]] using [[photons]] as the information carrier instead of [[electrons]].
* The wing structure of the blue [[morpho butterfly]] was studied and the way it reflects light was mimicked to create an [[RFID]] tag that can be read through water and on metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfidradio.com/?p=26 RFID Through Water and on Metal with 99.9% Reliability (Episode 015)]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, RFID Radio&lt;/ref&gt;
* The wing structure of butterflies has also inspired the creation of new nanosensors to detect explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors Nanosensors inspired by butterfly wings (Wired UK)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017124358/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors |date=17 October 2010 }}. Wired.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neuromorphic]] [[integrated circuit|chips]], [[silicon]] [[retina]]e or [[cochlea]]e, has wiring that is modelled after [[Biological neural networks|real neural networks]]. ''S.a.:'' connectivity.
* Technoecosystems or 'EcoCyborg' systems involve the coupling of natural ecological processes to technological ones which mimic ecological functions. This results in the creation of a self-regulating hybrid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://infolib.hua.edu.vn/Fulltext/ChuyenDe2009/CD131/53.pdf|author1=Clark, O.

== Specific uses of the term ==
[[File:Induced-sensorimotor-brain-plasticity-controls-pain-in-phantom-limb-patients-ncomms13209-s2.ogv|thumb|Induced sensorimotor brain plasticity controls pain in phantom limb patients-ncomms13209-s2]]
=== In medicine ===
'''Bionics''' refers to the flow of concepts from [[biology]] to [[engineering]] and vice versa. Hence, there are two slightly different points of view regarding the meaning of the word.

In medicine, '''bionics''' means the replacement or enhancement of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] or other body parts by mechanical versions. Bionic implants differ from mere [[prosthesis|prostheses]] by mimicking the original function very closely, or even surpassing it.

Bionics' German equivalent, ''Bionik'', always adheres to the broader meaning, in that it tries to develop engineering solutions from biological models. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological solutions will usually be optimized by [[evolutionary]] forces.

While the technologies that make bionic implants possible are developing gradually, a few successful bionic devices exist, a well known one being the Australian-invented multi-channel [[cochlear implant]] (bionic ear), a device for [[deaf]] people. Since the bionic ear, many bionic devices have emerged and work is progressing on bionics solutions for other sensory disorders (e.g. vision and balance).   Bionic research has recently provided treatments for medical problems such as neurological and psychiatric conditions, for example Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicsqueensland.com.au/bionics-in-our-world/|title=Bionic devices|last=|first=|date=|website=Bionics Queensland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2004 fully functional [[artificial heart]]s were developed. Significant progress is expected with the advent of [[nanotechnology]]. A well-known example of a proposed nanodevice is a [[respirocyte]], an artificial red cell, designed (though not built yet) by [[Robert Freitas]]. 

Kwabena Boahen from [[Ghana]] was a professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the '''University of Pennsylvania'''. During his eight years at Penn, he developed a [[silicon]] [[retina]] that was able to process images in the same manner as a living retina. He confirmed the results by comparing the electrical signals from his silicon retina to the electrical signals produced by a [[salamander]] eye while the two retinas were looking at the same image.

In 2007 the Scottish company [[Touch Bionics]] launched the first commercially available bionic hand, named "i-Limb Hand". According to the firm, by May 2010 it has been fitted to more than 1,200 patients worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1273258/i-Limb-Pulse-Bionic-hand-uses-wireless-technology-unveiled.html Bionic hand that uses wireless technology unveiled], Mail Online, 6 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nichi-In group is working on biomimicking scaffolds in tissue engineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine have given a detailed classification on biomimetics in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrm.org/biomimetics.htm Biomimetics and NCRM, Nichi-In classification of Biomimetics Biomimicry tissue engineering, stem cells, cell therapy]. Ncrm.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2015, the [[BBC]]’s medical correspondent [[Fergus Walsh]] reported, "Surgeons in Manchester have performed the first bionic eye implant in a patient with the most common cause of sight loss in the developed world. Ray Flynn, 80, has dry age-related macular degeneration which has led to the total loss of his central vision. He is using a retinal implant which converts video images from a miniature video camera worn on his glasses. He can now make out the direction of white lines on a computer screen using the retinal implant." The implant, known as the [[Argus retinal prosthesis#History|Argus II]] and manufactured in the US by the company [[Second Sight Medical Products]], had been used previously in patients who were blind as the result of the rare inherited degenerative eye disease [[retinitis pigmentosa]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 21 July 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= Bionic eye implant world first|url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33571412| last= Walsh| first= Fergus|date= 22 July 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
A political form of biomimicry is [[bioregional democracy]], wherein political borders conform to natural [[ecoregions]] rather than human cultures or the outcomes of prior conflicts.

Critics of these approaches often argue that [[ecological selection]] itself is a poor model of minimizing [[manufacturing complexity]] or conflict, and that the [[free market]] relies on conscious cooperation, agreement, and standards as much as on efficiency – more analogous to [[sexual selection]]. [[Charles Darwin]] himself contended that both were balanced in [[natural selection]] – although his contemporaries often avoided frank talk about sex, or any suggestion that free market success was based on persuasion, not value.

Advocates, especially in the [[anti-globalization movement]], argue that the mating-like processes of standardization, financing and marketing, are already examples of [[runaway evolution]] – rendering a system that appeals to the consumer but which is inefficient at use of energy and raw materials.  Biomimicry, they argue, is an effective strategy to restore basic efficiency.

Biomimicry is also the second principle of [[Natural Capitalism]].

=== Other uses ===

[[Business biomimetics]] is the latest development in the application of biomimetics. Specifically it applies principles and practice from biological systems to business strategy, process, organisation design and strategic thinking. It has been successfully used by a range of industries in FMCG, defence, central government, packaging and business services. Based on the work by Phil Richardson at the [[University of Bath]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817164045/http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ |date=17 August 2009 }}. Bath.ac.uk (21 February 2009). Retrieved on 2011-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; the approach was launched at the House of Lords in May 2009.

In a more specific meaning, it is a [[creativity techniques|creativity technique]] that tries to use [[nature|biological]] prototypes to get ideas for engineering solutions. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological organisms and their organs have been well optimized by [[evolution]]. In chemistry, a [[biomimetic synthesis]] is a [[chemical synthesis]] inspired by [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes.

Another, more recent meaning of the term bionics refers to merging organism and machine. This approach results in a hybrid system combining biological and engineering parts, which can also be referred as a cybernetic organism ([[cyborg]]). Practical realization of this was demonstrated in [[Kevin Warwick]]'s implant experiments bringing about [[ultrasound]] input via his own nervous system.

'''Calligraphy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: καλλιγραφία) is a [[Visual arts|visual art]] related to [[writing]]. It is the design and execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument,  [[brush]], or other writing instruments.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|17}} A contemporary calligraphic practice can be defined as "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious, and skillful manner".&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{rp|18}}

Modern calligraphy ranges from functional inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the letters may or may not be readable.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996 /&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Classical calligraphy differs from [[typography]] and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may practice both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|trans-title=Calligraphy: Intensive Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874397001|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie: Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt|isbn=9783874396752|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of technical developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester, New York|isbn=9781933360225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapf, H.|year=2006|title=The world of Alphabets: A kaleidoscope of drawings and letterforms}} CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt;

Calligraphy continues to flourish in the forms of [[wedding invitations]] and event invitations, [[font]] design and typography, original hand-lettered [[logo]] design, [[religious art]], announcements, [[graphic design]] and commissioned calligraphic art, cut stone [[inscription]]s, and memorial [[document]]s. It is also used for [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and moving images for film and television, and also for [[testimonial]]s, [[birth certificate|birth]] and [[death certificate|death]] certificates, [[map]]s, and other written works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Propfe, J.|year=2005|title=SchreibKunstRaume: Kalligraphie im Raum Verlag|publisher=[[Callwey Verlag]].|location=Munich|isbn=9783766716309|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geddes, A.|author2=Dion, C.|year=2004|title=Miracle: a celebration of new life|publisher=Photogenique Publishers|location=Auckland|isbn= 9780740746963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[File:Pointed pen parts.svg|thumb|A calligraphic [[Nib (pen)|nib]], with part names.]]

The principal tools for a calligrapher are the [[pen]] and the [[paintbrush|brush]]. Calligraphy pens write with [[nib (pen)|nibs]] that may be flat, round, or pointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reaves, M.|author2=Schulte, E.|year=2006|title=Brush Lettering: An instructional manual in Western brush calligraphy|edition=Revised|publisher=Design Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Child|editor-first=H.|year=1985|title=The Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Lamb|editor-first=C.M.|origyear=1956|title=Calligrapher's Handbook|publisher=Pentalic|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with [[felt-tip pen|felt-tip]] and [[ballpoint pen]]s, although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, such as Gothic script, that require a stub nib pen.

Writing ink is usually water-based and is much less viscous than the oil-based inks used in printing. High quality paper, which has good consistency of absorption,{{clarify|date=October 2013}} enables cleaner lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calligraphyfonts.info/aesthetic-theory-arabic-calligraphy-islamic-art/ |title=Paper Properties in Arabic calligraphy |publisher=calligraphyfonts.info |date= |accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] is often used, as a knife can be used to erase imperfections and a [[light-box]] is not needed to allow lines to pass through it. Normally, light boxes and templates are used to achieve straight lines without pencil markings detracting from the work. Ruled paper, either for a light box or direct use, is most often ruled every quarter or half inch, although inch spaces are occasionally used. This is the case with ''litterea unciales'' (hence the name), and college-[[ruled paper]] often acts as a guideline well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://calligraphyislamic.com |title=Calligraphy Islamic website |publisher=Calligraphyislamic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608004825/http://www.calligraphyislamic.com/ |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World traditions==

===Europe===
{{Main|Western calligraphy}}
====History====
[[Image:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|Folio 27r from the Lindisfarne Gospels (c.700) contains the [[incipit]] from the [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
Western calligraphy is recognizable by the use of the [[Latin script]]. The [[Latin alphabet]] appeared about 600 BC, in Rome, and by the first century{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} developed into [[Roman imperial capitals]] carved on stones, [[Rustic capitals]] painted on walls, and [[Roman cursive]] for daily use. In the second and third centuries the [[uncial]] lettering style developed. As writing withdrew to monasteries, uncial script was found more suitable for copying the Bible and other religious texts. It was the monasteries which preserved calligraphic traditions during the fourth and fifth centuries, when the Roman Empire fell and Europe entered the [[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabard, V.|author2=Geneslay, V.|author3=Rébéna, L.|title=Calligraphie latine: Initiation|location=, Paris|edition=7th|year=2004|pages=8–11|isbn=978-2215021308|trans-title=Latin calligraphy: Introduction|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the Empire, its power reached as far as Great Britain; when the empire fell, its literary influence remained. The [[Semi-uncial]] generated the Irish Semi-uncial, the small Anglo-Saxon. &lt;ref&gt;Insular Manuscripts: Paleography Section 6: Language on the Page in Insular Manuscripts LAYOUT AND LEGIBILITY. (n.d.). Retrieved May 30, 2018, from https://www.vhmml.org/school/lesson/insular-paleography/layout&lt;/ref&gt; Each region developed its own standards following the main monastery of the region (i.e. [[Merovingian script]], Laon script, [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil script]], [[Visigothic script]], [[Beneventan script]]), which are mostly cursive and hardly readable.

[[Image:Calligraphy.malmesbury.bible.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Calligraphy in a [[Latin]] [[Bible]] of 1407 on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire]], England. This bible was hand written in Belgium, by Gerard Brils, for reading aloud in a [[monastery]].]]
Christian churches promoted the development of writing through the prolific copying of the Bible, the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]], and other sacred texts.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 2001a&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct styles of writing known as uncial and half-uncial (from the Latin "uncia", or "inch") developed from a variety of Roman bookhands.&lt;ref&gt;Knight 1998: 10&lt;/ref&gt; The 7th-9th centuries in northern Europe were the heyday of Celtic illuminated manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow, [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Trinity College Library Dublin 2006; Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; Brown &amp; Lovett 1999: 40; Backhouse 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlemagne]]'s devotion to improved scholarship resulted in the recruiting of "a crowd of scribes", according to [[Alcuin]], the Abbot of [[York]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 64&lt;/ref&gt; Alcuin developed the style known as the Caroline or [[Carolingian minuscule]]. The first manuscript in this hand was the Godescalc Evangelistary (finished 783)—a Gospel book written by the scribe Godescalc.&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf 2005; de Hamel 1994: 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; Carolingian remains the one progenitor hand from which modern booktype descends.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel 1994: 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh century, the Caroline evolved into the [[blackletter|Gothic script]], which was more compact and made it possible to fit more text on a page.&lt;ref name=lovett2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Lovett, Patricia|title=Calligraphy and Illumination: A History and Practical Guide|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|year=2000|isbn= 978-0810941199}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}} The Gothic calligraphy styles became dominant throughout Europe; and in 1454, when [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed the first printing press in Mainz, Germany, he adopted the Gothic style, making it the first [[typeface]].&lt;ref name=lovett2000 /&gt;{{rp|141}}

[[File:მარიამისეული ქართლის ცხოვრება.JPG|thumb|The [[Georgian calligraphy]] is centuries-old tradition of an artistic writing of the [[Georgian language]] with its [[Georgian scripts|three scripts]].]]
In the 15th century, the rediscovery of old Carolingian texts encouraged the creation of the [[humanist minuscule]] or ''littera antiqua''. The 17th century saw the [[Bastarda|Batarde script]] from France, and the 18th century saw the [[English script (calligraphy)|English script]] spread across Europe and world through their books.

In the mid-1600s French officials, flooded with documents written in various hands and varied levels of skill, complained that many such documents were beyond their ability to decipher.  The Office of the Financier thereupon restricted all legal documents to three hands, namely the Coulee, the Rhonde, (known as [[Round hand]] in English) and a Speed Hand sometimes simply called the [[Bastarda]].&lt;ref name="Whalley"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyce Irene Whalley|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|date=c. 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were many great French masters at the time, the most influential in proposing these hands was Louis Barbedor, who published ''Les Ecritures Financière Et Italienne Bastarde Dans Leur Naturel'' circa 1650.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

With the destruction of the [[Camera Apostolica]] during the [[sack of Rome (1527)]], the capitol for writing masters moved to Southern France.  By 1600, the Italic Cursiva began to be replaced by a technological refinement, the Italic Chancery [[Circumflessa]], which in turn fathered the Rhonde and later English [[Roundhand]].&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

In England, [[Philip Ayres (poet)|Ayres]] and Banson popularized the Round Hand while Snell is noted for his reaction to them, and warnings of restraint and proportionality. Still Edward Crocker began publishing his copybooks 40 years before the aforementioned.&lt;ref name="Whalley" /&gt;

====Style====
[[Image:Westerncalligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Western calligraphy]]
Sacred [[Western calligraphy]] has some special features, such as the illumination of the first letter of each book or chapter in medieval times. A decorative "carpet page" may precede the literature, filled with ornate, geometrical depictions of bold-hued animals. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] (715–720 AD) are an early example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, M.P.|year=2004|title=Painted Labyrinth: The World of the Lindisfarne Gospel|edition=Revised|publisher=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[Chinese calligraphy|Chinese]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]], Western calligraphic script employed the use of strict rules and shapes. Quality writing had a rhythm and regularity to the letters, with a "geometrical" order of the lines on the page. Each character had, and often still has, a precise [[stroke order]].

The Chinese name for calligraphy is ''{{transl|zh|ISO|shūfǎ}}'' ({{lang|zh|書法}} in Traditional Chinese, literally "the method or law of writing");&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-TW|書}} (Taiwanese) being here used as in {{lang|yue|楷书}} (Cantonese) or {{lang|zh-TW|楷書}} (Taiwanese), meaning "writing style".{{clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese name ''{{transl|ja|shodō}}'' ({{lang|ja|書道}}, literally "the way or principle of writing"); and the Korean name being ''{{transl|ko|seoye}}'' ({{lang-ko|서예}}/{{lang|ko-Hant|書藝}}, literally "the art of writing"). The calligraphy of [[CJK characters|East Asian characters]] is an important and appreciated aspect of traditional East Asian culture.

In [[ancient China]], the oldest Chinese characters existing are [[Oracle bone script|Jiǎgǔwén  characters]] (甲骨文) carved on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastrons]], because the dominators in [[Shang Dynasty]] carved pits on such animals' bones and then baked them to gain auspice of military affairs, agricultural harvest, or even procreating and weather. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone to be later carved. (Keightley, 1978).

In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial China]], the graphs on old steles—some dating from 200 BC, and in Xiaozhuan style—are still accessible.

About 220 BC, the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first to conquer the entire Chinese basin, imposed several reforms, among them [[Li Si]]'s character unification, which created a set of 3300 standardized ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn（小篆）}}'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fazzioli |first=Edoardo |others=Calligraphy by Rebecca Hon Ko |title=Chinese Calligraphy: From Pictograph to Ideogram: The History Of 214 Essential Chinese/Japanese Characters |publisher=[[Abbeville Publishing Group (Abbeville Press, Inc.)|Abbeville Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0896597741 |page=13 |quote=And so the first Chinese dictionary was born, the ''Sān Chāng'', containing {{formatnum:3300}} characters|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the main writing implement of the time was already the brush, few papers survive from this period, and the main examples of this style are on steles.

The [[Clerical script|Lìshū style]] ({{lang|zh-TW|隸書}}/{{lang|zh|隸书}})(clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text, have been also authorised under Qin Shi Huangdi.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6"&gt;{{cite book |author=R.

[[Regular script|Kǎishū style]] (traditional regular script)—still in use today—and attributed to [[Wang Xizhi]] ({{lang|zh|王羲之}}, 303–361) and his followers, is even more regularized.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; Its spread was encouraged by [[Li Siyuan|Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang]] (926–933), who ordered the printing of the classics using new wooden blocks in Kaishu. Printing technologies here allowed a shape stabilization. The Kaishu shape of characters 1000 years ago was mostly similar to that at the end of Imperial China.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt; But small changes have been made, for example in the shape of &lt;big&gt;{{lang|zh|广}}&lt;/big&gt; which is not absolutely the same in the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] of 1716 as in modern books. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while stroke order is still the same, according to old style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=zh:康熙字典|trans-title=Kangxi Zidian|year=1716|url=http://ctext.org/library.pl?if=en&amp;res=77358|page=41|language=zh}}.

The 2007 common shape for those characters does not clearly show the stroke order, but old versions, visible on p. 41, clearly allow the stroke order to be determined.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles which did not survive include Bāfēnshū, a mix made of Xiaozhuan style at 80%, and Lishu at 20%.&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;
Some [[variant Chinese character]]s were unorthodox or locally used for centuries. They were generally understood but always rejected in official texts. Some of these unorthodox variants, in addition to some newly created characters, compose the [[Simplified Chinese]] character set.

====Technique====
[[File:Mi Fu-On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|''On Calligraphy'' by [[Mi Fu]], [[Song Dynasty]]]]
Traditional East Asian writing uses the [[Four Treasures of the Study]] ({{lang|zh-TW|文房四寶}}/{{lang|zh|文房四宝}})&lt;ref&gt;Li, J. (Ed.). (n.d.). "Four treasures of Study" tour. Retrieved May 30, 2018, from http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/anhui/travel/2010-06/02/content_9948922.htm&lt;/ref&gt;: the [[ink brush]]es known as máobǐ ({{lang|zh-TW|毛筆}}/{{lang|zh|毛笔}}) to write [[Chinese character]]s, Chinese ink, paper, and inkstone, known as the ''Four Friends of the Study'' ({{lang-ko|문방사우|文房四友}}) in Korea. In addition to these four tools, desk pads and paperweights are also used.

The shape, size, stretch, and [[Brush#Bristles|hair type]] of the ink brush, the color, color density and water density of the ink, as well as the paper's water absorption speed and surface texture are the main physical parameters influencing the final result. The calligrapher's technique also influences the result. The calligrapher's work is influenced by the quantity of ink and water he lets the brush take, then by the pressure, inclination, and direction he gives to the brush, producing thinner or bolder strokes, and smooth or toothed borders. Eventually, the speed, accelerations, decelerations of the writer's moves, turns, and crochets, and the [[stroke order]] give the "spirit" to the characters, by greatly influencing their final shapes.

=====Styles=====
Cursive styles such as ''[[Semi-cursive script|{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|行書}}/{{lang|zh|行书}})(semi-cursive or running script) and ''[[Grass script|{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}]]'' ({{lang|zh-TW|草書}}/{{lang|zh|草书}})(cursive, rough script, or grass script) are less constrained and faster, where more movements made by the writing implement are visible. These styles' stroke orders vary more, sometimes creating radically different forms. They are descended from Clerical script, in the same time as Regular script ([[Han Dynasty]]), but ''{{transl|zh|xíngshū}}'' and ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}'' were used for personal notes only, and never used as a standard. The ''{{transl|zh|cǎoshū}}''  style was highly appreciated in [[Emperor Wu of Han]] reign (140–187 AD).&lt;ref name="Blakney, p6" /&gt;

Examples of modern printed styles are [[Ming (typeface)|Song]] from the [[Song Dynasty]]'s [[Four Great Inventions of ancient China#Printing|printing press]], and [[East Asian sans-serif typeface|sans-serif]]. These are not considered traditional styles, and are normally not written.

Both Japanese and Korean calligraphy were greatly influenced by Chinese calligraphy. The Japanese and Korean people have also developed their own specific sensibilities and styles of calligraphy while incorporating Chinese influences. For example, [[Japanese calligraphy]] go out of the set of [[CJK strokes]] to also include local alphabets such as [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], with specific problematics such as new curves and moves, and specific materials ([[Japanese paper]], ''{{transl|ja|washi}}'' {{lang|ja|和紙}}, and Japanese ink).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Yuuko|title=An introduction to Japanese calligraphy|year=2005|publisher=Search|location=Tunbridge Wells|isbn=978-1844480579}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Korean calligraphy]], the [[Hangeul]] and the existence of the circle required the creation of a new technique which usually confuses Chinese calligraphers.

Temporary calligraphy is a practice of water-only calligraphy on the floor, which dries out within minutes. This practice is especially appreciated by the new generation of retired Chinese in public parks of China. These will often open studio-shops in tourist towns offering traditional Chinese calligraphy to tourists. Other than writing the clients name, they also sell fine brushes as souvenirs and lime stone carved stamps.

Since late 1980s, a few Chinese artists have branched out traditional Chinese calligraphy to a new territory by mingling [[Chinese characters]] with English letters; notable new forms of calligraphy are [[Xu Bing]]'s square calligraphy and DanNie's coolligraphy or cooligraphy.

[[Mongolian calligraphy]] is also influenced by Chinese calligraphy, from tools to style.

Calligraphy has influenced [[ink and wash painting]], which is accomplished using similar tools and techniques. Calligraphy has influenced most major art styles in [[East Asia]], including [[ink and wash painting]], a style of [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Japanese painting|Japanese]], and [[Korean painting|Korean]] based entirely on calligraphy.

The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as [[suyat]]. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are [[Hanunó'o alphabet|hanunó'o/hanunoo]] of the Hanuno'o [[Mangyan]] people, [[Buhid alphabet|buhid/buid]] of the Buhid [[Mangyan]] people, [[Tagbanwa script|apurahuano/tagbanwa]] of the [[Tagbanwa people]], and [[Palawan people|palaw'an/pala'wan]] of the [[Palawan people|Palaw'an people]]. All four scripts were inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Programme]], under the name ''Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan)'', in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-7/philippine-paleographs-hanunoo-buid-tagbanua-and-palawan/|title=Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, Buid, Tagbanua and Pala’wan) – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayi, a bamboo bow from Mindoro.jpg|thumb|left|Bow with [[Hanunó'o alphabet|Hanunó'o calligraphy]]]]
Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of [[suyat]] scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the [[Kulitan alphabet|kulitan]] script of the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan people]], the [[Visayan languages|badlit]] script of various [[Visayan languages|Visayan ethnic groups]], the [[Eskaya|iniskaya]] script of the [[Eskaya people]], the [[baybayin]] script of the [[Tagalog people]], and the [[Ilocano language|kur-itan]] script of the [[Ilocano people]], among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/201104-baybayin-national-writing-system-reactions|title=‘Educate first’: Filipinos react to Baybayin as national writing system|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1602707/Manila/Local-News/House-panel-approves-Baybayin-as-national-writing-system|title=House panel approves Baybayin as national writing system|date=24 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/life/04/25/18/5-things-to-know-about-phs-pre-hispanic-writing-system|title=5 things to know about PH's pre-Hispanic writing system|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diversity of [[suyat]] scripts, all calligraphy written in [[suyat]] scripts are collectively called as Filipino suyat calligraphy, although each are distinct from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/577701/a-primer-on-baybayin/story/|title=A primer on Baybayin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnphilippines.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2018/04/26/baybayin-bill.html|title=The Baybayin bill and the never ending search for ‘Filipino-ness’|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy using the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are also prevalent in the Philippines due to its colonial past, but the Western alphabet and the Arabic alphabet are not considered as suyat, and therefore Western-alphabet and Arabic calligraphy are not considered as suyat calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brideandbreakfast.ph/2015/08/12/awesome-calligraphers/|title=10 Perfectly Awesome Calligraphers You Need To Check Out|author=|date=12 August 2015|website=brideandbreakfast.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/arts-and-culture/2018/06/01/1820721/watch-how-ace-script-lettering|title=WATCH: How to ace in script lettering - Philstar.com|author=|date=|website=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] is the primary form of Thai calligraphy. Historically Thai calligraphy has been limited to sacred texts of the Pali Canon with few wider artistic applications where graphic calligraphy representing figures and objects is produced. Calligraphy appears on the personal flag of each member of the Thai royal family  bearing its owner's initials in calligraphy. The most obvious place in the country where calligraphy is present is in graffiti. A few books have been published with calligraphic compositions.

Vietnamese calligraphy uses a variety of scripts, including Chinese characters, Chữ nôm, and the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ. Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts. Due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy uses Roman characters. Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China for historical and geographic regions. As part of the East Asian cultural sphere, Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. In modern times, calligraphy has been done mainly in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aśoka]]'s edicts (c. 265–238 BC) were committed to stone. These inscriptions are stiff and angular in form. Following the Aśoka style of Indic writing, two new calligraphic types appear: [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭī]] and [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]]. Kharoṣṭī was used in the northwestern regions of India from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century of the Christian Era, and it was used in [[Central Asia]] until the 8th century.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In many parts of ancient India, the inscriptions were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves.

Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered on top of one another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to [[Southeast Asia]]. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used in many of the scripts of southern Asia.

====Nepal====
{{Main|Nepalese calligraphy}}
[[Ranjana script]] is the primary form of Nepalese calligraphy. The script itself, along with its derivatives (like [[Lanydza Script|Lantsa]], [['Phags-pa script|Phagpa]], [[Kutila]]) are used in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[Leh]], [[Mongolia]], coastal Japan, and Korea to write "[[Om mani padme hum]]" and other sacred [[Buddhist texts]], mainly those derived from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].

====Tibet====
{{Main|Tibetan calligraphy}}
[[Image:BonpoBook.jpg|thumb|A [[Bön]] text]]

Calligraphy is central in [[Tibet]]an culture. The script is derived from [[Indic script]]s. The nobles of Tibet, such as the High [[Lama]]s and inhabitants of the [[Potala Palace]], were usually capable calligraphers. [[Tibet]] has been a center of [[Buddhism]] for several centuries, and that religion places a great deal of significance on written word. This does not provide for a large body of [[secular]] pieces, although they do exist (but are usually related in some way to Tibetan Buddhism). Almost all high religious writing involved calligraphy, including letters sent by the [[Dalai Lama]] and other religious and secular authority. Calligraphy is particularly evident on their [[prayer wheels]], although this calligraphy was forged rather than scribed, much like Arab and Roman calligraphy is often found on buildings. Although originally done with a reed, Tibetan calligraphers now use chisel tipped pens and markers as well.

===Islamic world===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
[[File:Basmalah-1wm.svg|left|thumb|The phrase [[Basmala|Bismillah]] in an 18th-century Islamic calligraphy from the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] region.]]
Islamic calligraphy (''calligraphy'' in Arabic is ''{{transl|ar|khatt ul-yad}}'' {{rtl-lang|ar|خط اليد}}) has evolved alongside [[Islam]] and the [[Arabic language]]. As it is based on Arabic letters, some call it "Arabic calligraphy". However the term "Islamic calligraphy" is a more appropriate term as it comprises all works of calligraphy by the Muslim calligraphers from [[Andalusia]] in modern [[Spain]] to China.

Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art ([[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]) on the walls and ceilings of [[mosque]]s as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the [[Islamic world]] draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions.

Instead of recalling something related to the spoken word, calligraphy for [[Muslim]]s is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[Qur'an]] has played an important role in the development and evolution of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and passages from the Qur'an are still sources for Islamic calligraphy.

It is generally accepted that Islamic calligraphy excelled during the [[Ottoman era]].{{By whom|date=December 2016}} Istanbul is an open exhibition hall for all kinds and varieties of calligraphy, from inscriptions in mosques to fountains, schools, houses, etc. {{Clear}}

===Ethiopia/Abyssinia===
[[File:Ethiopian Scroll comprising prayers against various ailments Wellcome L0031387.jpg|thumb|upright|A painting of [[Susenyos I]] (r. 1607-1632)on a [[Ge'ez]] prayer scroll meant to dispel evil spirits, [[Wellcome Collection]], London]]

[[Ethiopian]] (Abyssinian)) calligraphy began with the [[Ge'ez script]], which replaced Epigraphic [[South Arabian]] in the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], that was developed specifically for [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]]. In those languages that use it, such as [[Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], the script is called ''{{transl|sem|Fidäl}}'', which means script or alphabet. The Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since [[Dʿmt]].

Early inscriptions in Ge'ez and Ge'ez script have been dated to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Ge'ez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Ge'ez literature begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of [[Ezana of Axum]]. 

The Ge'ez script is read from left to right and has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for [[Amharic language|Amharic]] in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] in [[Eritrea]] and Ethiopia.

===Persia===

[[Image:Nastaliq-proportions.jpg|thumb|Example showing Nastaliq's proportional rules]]

The history of calligraphy in [[Persia]] dates back to the pre-Islam era. In [[Zoroastrianism]] beautiful and clear writings were always praised.

It is believed that [[Old Persian|ancient Persian script]] was invented by about 600–500 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid Empire#Achaemenid kings and rulers|Achaemenid kings]]. These scripts consisted of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal nail-shape letters, which is why it is called [[Cuneiform script|"script of nails/cuneiform script"]] (''{{transl|fa|khat-e-mikhi}}'') in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Centuries later, other scripts such as "[[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]" and "[[Avestan script|Avestan]]" scripts were used in ancient Persia.









==== Contemporary scripts ====
The [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]] style is the most popular contemporary style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the "bride of calligraphy scripts". This calligraphy style has been based on such a strong structure that it has changed very little since. [[Mir Ali Tabrizi]] had found the optimum composition of the letters and graphical rules so it has just been fine-tuned during the past seven centuries. It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.

===Mayan civilization===
Mayan calligraphy was expressed via [[Mayan hieroglyphs]]; modern Mayan calligraphy is mainly used on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and monuments in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in Mexico. Mayan hieroglyphs are rarely used in government offices; however in [[Campeche]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and [[Quintana Roo]], Mayan calligraphy is written in Latin letters.{{clarify|date=August 2016}} Some commercial companies in southern Mexico use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their business. Some community associations and modern Mayan brotherhoods use Mayan hieroglyphs as symbols of their groups.

Most of the archaeological sites in Mexico such as [[Chichen Itza]], Labna, [[Uxmal]], [[Edzna]], [[Calakmul]], etc. have glyphs in their structures. Carved stone monuments known as [[stele]] are common sources of ancient Mayan calligraphy.

After studying published copies of manuscripts by architect [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], he was introduced to [[William Lethaby]] in 1898, principal of the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Arts and Crafts]], who advised him to study manuscripts at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;such as the Ramsey Psalter, BL, Harley MS 2904&lt;/ref&gt;

This triggered Johnston's interest in the art of calligraphy with the use of a broad edged pen. He began a teaching course in calligraphy at the Central School in [[Southampton Row]], London from September 1899, where he influenced the typeface designer and sculptor [[Eric Gill]]. He was commissioned by  [[Frank Pick]] to design a [[Johnston (typeface)|new typeface]] for [[London Underground]], still used today (with minor modifications).&lt;ref&gt;The Eric Gill Society: [https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172820/http://www.ericgill.org.uk/associates/edward-johnston-1872-1944 Associates of the Guild: Edward Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been credited for reviving the art of modern [[penmanship]] and lettering single-handedly through his books and teachings - his handbook on the subject, ''Writing &amp; Illuminating, &amp; Lettering'' (1906) was particularly influential on a generation of British typographers and calligraphers, including [[Graily Hewitt]], [[Stanley Morison]], [[Eric Gill]], [[Alfred Fairbank]] and Anna Simons. Johnston also devised the simply crafted round calligraphic handwriting style, written with a broad pen, known today as the ''Foundational hand''. Johnston initially taught his students an uncial hand using a flat pen angle, but later taught his hand using a slanted pen angle.&lt;ref&gt;Gilderdale 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He first referred to this hand as "Foundational Hand" in his 1909 publication, ''Manuscript &amp; Inscription Letters for Schools and Classes and for the Use of Craftsmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Baines &amp; Dixon 2003: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
[[Graily Hewitt]] taught at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and published together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century. Hewitt was central to the revival of [[gilding]] in calligraphy, and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943. He is attributed with the  revival of  gilding with [[gesso]] and gold leaf on [[vellum]]. Hewitt helped to found the [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]] (SSI) in 1921, probably the world's foremost calligraphy society.

[[File:Graily Hewitt.JPG|thumb|left|An example of [[Graily Hewitt]]'s calligraphy.]]
Hewitt is not without both critics&lt;ref&gt;Tresser 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and supporters&lt;ref&gt;Whitley 2000: 90&lt;/ref&gt; in his rendering of [[Cennino Cennini]]'s medieval gesso recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Herringham 1899&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Jackson (calligrapher)|Donald Jackson]], a British calligrapher, has sourced his gesso recipes from earlier centuries a number of which are not presently in English translation.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1981: 81&lt;/ref&gt; Graily Hewitt created the patent announcing the award to [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] of the title of Duke of Edinburgh on November 19, 1947, the day before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt 1944-1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston’s pupil, [[Anna Simons]], was instrumental in sparking off interest in calligraphy in Germany with her German translation of ''Writing and Illuminating, and Lettering'' in 1910.&lt;ref name="ejf" /&gt; Austrian [[Rudolf Larisch]], a teacher of lettering at the Vienna School of Art, published six lettering books that greatly influenced German-speaking calligraphers. Because German-speaking countries had not abandoned the Gothic hand in printing, Gothic also had a powerful effect on their styles.

[[Rudolf Koch]] was a friend and younger contemporary of Larisch. Koch's books, type designs, and teaching made him one of the most influential calligraphers of the 20th century in northern Europe and later in the U.S. Larisch and Koch taught and inspired many European calligraphers, notably [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]], and [[Hermann Zapf]].&lt;ref&gt;Cinamon 2001; Kapr 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary typefaces used by computers, from word processors like [[Microsoft Word]] or [[Apple Pages]] to professional designers' software like [[Adobe InDesign]], owe a considerable debt to the past and to a small number of professional typeface designers today.&lt;ref name=mediaville1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Mediaville|first=Claude|title=Calligraphy: From Calligraphy to Abstract Painting|year=1996|publisher=Scirpus-Publications|location=Belgium|isbn=9080332518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zapf2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henning, W.E.|year=2002|title=An Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy|editor-last=Melzer|editor-first=P.|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, Delaware|isbn=978-1584560678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unicode]] provides "Script" and "[[Fraktur]]" Latin alphabets that can be used for calligraphy. See [[Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19541">A '''cognitive tutor''' is a particular kind of [[intelligent tutoring system]] that utilizes a [[cognitive model]] to provide feedback to [[student]]s as they are working through problems. This feedback will immediately inform students of the correctness, or incorrectness, of their actions in the tutor interface; however, cognitive tutors also have the ability to provide context-sensitive hints and instruction to guide students towards reasonable next steps.

== Introduction ==

The name of '''Cognitive Tutor®''' now usually refers to a particular type of intelligent tutoring system produced by [[Carnegie Learning]] for high school mathematics based on John Anderson's [[ACT-R|ACT-R theory]] of human cognition. However, cognitive tutors were originally developed to test ACT-R theory for research purposes since the early 1980s and they are developed also for other areas and subjects such as computer programming and science.&lt;ref name="Anderson, J. R., Corbett, A. T., Koedinger, K. R., &amp; Pelletier, R. (1995)"/&gt; Cognitive Tutors can be implemented into classrooms as a part of [[blended learning]] that combines textbook and software activities.

The Cognitive Tutor programs utilize cognitive model and are based on model tracing and knowledge tracing. Model tracing means that the cognitive tutor checks every action performed by students such as entering a value or clicking a button, while knowledge tracing is used to calculate the required skills students learned by measuring them on a bar chart called Skillometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blessing|first1=Stephen|title=The Cognitive Tutor™: Successful Application of Cognitive Science|url=http://www.carnegielearning.com/research-results/whitepapers-reports/whitepapers/cognitive-tutor-successful-application-of-cognitive-science|website=Carnegie Learning|publisher=Carnegie Learning|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model tracing and knowledge tracing are essentially used to monitor students' learning progress, guide students to correct path to problem solving, and provide feedback.

[[Institute of Education Sciences|The Institute of Education Sciences]] published several reports regarding the effectiveness of Carnegie Cognitive Tutor®. A 2013 report concluded that Carnegie Learning Curricula and Cognitive Tutor® was found to have mixed effects on mathematics achievement for high school students.&lt;ref name="US Dept of Ed, 2013"&gt;{{cite web|authors=U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences|year=2013|title=High School Mathematics intervention report: Carnegie Learning Curricula and Cognitive Tutor®|website=What Works Clearinghouse|publisher=whatworks.ed.gov|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED539061.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified 27 studies that investigate the effectiveness of Cognitive Tutor ®, and the conclusion is based on 6 studies that meet What Works Clearinghouse standards. Among the 6 studies included, 5 of them show intermediate to significant positive effect, while 1 study shows statistically significant negative effect. Another report published by Institute of Education Sciences in 2009 found that Cognitive Tutor® Algebra I to have potentially positive effects on math achievement based on only 1 study out of 14 studies that meets What Works Clearinghouse standards.it should be understood that What Works Clearinghouse standards call for relatively large numbers of participants, true random assignments to groups, and for a control group receiving either no treatment or a different treatment.  Such experimental conditions are difficult to meet in schools, and thus only a small percentage of studies in education meet the standards of this clearinghouse, even though they may still be of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences|year=2009|title=Middle School Mathematics intervention report: Cognitive Tutor® Algebra I|website=What Works Clearinghouse|publisher=whatworks.ed.gov|url=https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/pdf/intervention_reports/wwc_cogtutor_072809.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical foundations ==

=== Four-component architecture ===

[[Intelligent tutoring system|Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)]] traditionally had a three-component architecture: domain model, student model, and tutoring model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Self, J.|year=1990|title=Theoretical Foundations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems|journal=JAIED|volume=1|issue=4|pages=3–14|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.6841&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a fourth component was added: the interface component. Now ITS is commonly known to have a four component architecture.

Domain model contains the rules, concepts, and knowledge related to the domain to be learned. It helps to evaluate students' performance and detect students' errors by setting a standard of domain expertise.

Student model, the central component of an ITS, is expected to contain as much knowledge as possible about the students: their cognitive and affective states, and the progress they gained as they learn. The functions of the student model is three folded: to gather data from and about the learner, to represent the learner's knowledge and learning process, and to perform diagnosis of students' knowledge and select optimal pedagogical strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenger, E.|year=1987|title=Artificial Intelligence and Tutoring Systems: Computational and Cognitive Approaches to the Communication of Knowledge|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.|location=Los Altos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the data gained from domain model and student model, tutoring model makes decisions about tutoring strategies such as whether or not to intervene, when and how to intervene. Functions of tutoring model include instruction delivery and content planning.&lt;ref name="Nkambou"&gt;{{Cite book|editor=R. Nkambou|displayauthors=etal|year=2010|title=Advances in Intelligent Tutoring Systems|journal=Studies in Computational Intelligence|page=308|isbn=9783642143625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interface model reflects the decisions made by tutoring model in different forms such as Socratic dialogs, feedback and hints. Students interact with the tutor through the learning interface, also known as communication. Interface also provide domain knowledge elements.&lt;ref name="Nkambou"/&gt;

=== Cognitive model ===

A ''cognitive model'' tries to model the domain knowledge in the same way knowledge is represented in the human mind. [[Cognitive model]] enables intelligent tutoring systems to respond to problem-solving situations as the learner would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corbett, A.T.|author2=Koedinger, K.R.|author3=Anderson, J.R.|year=1997|chapter=Intelligent Tutoring Systems|editor1=Helander, T.K.|editor2=Landauer, P.|title=Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Elsevier Science|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tutoring system adopting a cognitive model is called a cognitive tutor.

Cognitive model is an expert system which hosts a multitude of solutions to the problems presented to students. The cognitive model is used to trace each student's solution through complex problems, enabling the tutor to provide step-by-step feedback and advice, and to maintain a targeted model of the student's knowledge based on student performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Corbett, A.|author2=Kauffman, L.|author3=MacLaren, B.|author4=Wagner, A.|author5=Jones, E.|year=2010|title=A Cognitive Tutor for genetics problem solving: Learning gains and student modeling|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|volume=42|issue=2|pages=219–239|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~genetics/Research/2010JEdCompRes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Tutors ===

Cognitive Tutors provide step-by-step guidance as a learner develops a complex problem-solving skill through practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=VanLehn, K.|year=2006|title=The behavior of tutoring systems|journal=International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education|volume=16|issue=3|pages=227–265|url=http://www.learnlab.org/opportunities/summer/readings/06IJAIED.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, cognitive tutors provide such forms of support as: (a) a problem-solving environment that is designed rich and "thinking visible"; (b) step-by-step feedback on student performance; (c) feedback messages specific to errors; (d) context-specific next-step hints at student's request, and (e) individualized problem selection.&lt;ref name="Aleven, 2010"/&gt;

Cognitive Tutors accomplish two of the principal tasks characteristic of human tutoring: (1) monitors the student's performance and providing context-specific individual instruction, and (2) monitors the student's learning and selects appropriate problem-solving activities.&lt;ref name="Koedinger"&gt;{{cite book|author=Koedinger, K.R.|author2=Corbett, A.T.|year=2006|title=Cognitive tutors: Technology bringing learning sciences to the classroom|editor=Sawyer, R.K.|work=The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|url=http://learnlab.org/uploads/mypslc/publications/koedingercorbett06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both cognitive model and two underlying algorithms, model tracing and knowledge tracing, are used to monitor the student's learning. In model tracing, the cognitive tutor uses the cognitive model in complex problems to follow the student's individual path and provide prompt accuracy feedback and context-specific advice. In knowledge tracing, the cognitive tutor uses a simple [[Bayes estimator|Bayesian]] method of evaluating the student's knowledge and uses this student model to select appropriate problems for individual student.&lt;ref name="Koedinger"/&gt;

=== Cognitive architecture ===

Cognitive tutors use a [[cognitive architecture]] which specifies the underlying framework for an intelligent system.

[[ACT-R]], a member of [[Adaptive Control of Thought|ACT]] family, is the most recent cognitive architecture, devoted primarily to modelling human behavior. ACT-R includes a [[declarative memory]] of factual knowledge and a [[procedural memory]] of production rules. The architecture functions by matching productions on perceptions and facts, mediated by the real-valued activation levels of objects, and executing them to affect the environment or alter declarative memory. ACT-R has been used to model psychological aspects such as memory, attention, reasoning, problem solving, and language processing.&lt;ref&gt;P. Langley and J. E. Laird, "Cognitive Architectures: Research Issues and Challenges". Draft of October 31, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application and utilization ==

In 1984, a group of high school students participated in a mini course in computer science and tried out the geometry tutor through [[Carnegie Mellon University]] using the LISP tutor, one of the first iterations of the cognitive tutor.&lt;ref name="Anderson, J. R., Corbett, A. T., Koedinger, K. R., &amp; Pelletier, R. (1995)" /&gt;
 
Since then, cognitive tutors have been used in a variety of scenarios, with a few organizations developing their own cognitive tutor programs. These programs have been used for students spanning elementary school through to university level, though primarily in the subject areas of Computer Programming, Mathematics, and Science.
&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=PACT Center @ Carnegie Mellon University, Home Page |date=May 2003|url=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first organizations to develop a system for use within the school system was the PACT Center at Carnegie Mellon University. Their aim was to "...develop systems that provide individualized assistance to students as they work on challenging real-world problems in complex domains such as computer programming, algebra and geometry".&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; PACT's most successful product was the ''Cognitive Tutor Algebra'' course. Originally created in the early 1990s, this course, at its peak, was offered at 75 schools through the U.S. by 1999, and then its spin-off company, Carnegie Learning, now offers tutors to over 1400 schools in the U.S.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;

The Carnegie Mellon Cognitive Tutor has attempted to raise students' math test scores in high school and middle-school classrooms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PACT Center @ Carnegie Mellon University, Current Research Projects |date=May 2003|url=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/research_current.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their Algebra course was designated one of five exemplary curricula for K-12 mathematics educated by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt;
There were several research projects conducted by the PACT Center to utilize Cognitive tutor for courses in Excel and to develop an intelligent tutoring system for algebra expression writing, called ''Ms. Lindquist''. Initially used by thousands of students, the aim of the Ms. Lindquist program was to have a tutor that could carry on running conversations with a student, with the intent of providing a more human connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PACT Center @ Carnegie Mellon University, Completed Research Projects |date=May 2003|url=http://pact.cs.cmu.edu/research_completed.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 2005, Carnegie Learning released ''Bridge to Algebra'', a product intended for middle schools that was piloted in over 100 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Cognitive Tutor History. (2003-2013)|website=Cognitive Tutoring Authoring Tools|url=http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu/index.php?id=timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive tutoring software is continuing to be used. According to a recent ''Business Insider Report'' article, Ken Koedinger, a professor of human-computer interaction and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, says teachers can integrate cognitive tutoring software into the classroom.&lt;ref name= "business"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Griswold, Alison|date=March 6, 2014|title=This Cognitive Tutor Software Is Already Having A Revolutionary Effect|journal=Business Insider|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cognitive-models-and-computer-tutors-2014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggests that teachers use it in a computer lab environment or during classes. In its more current versions, cognitive tutors can understand the many ways that a student might answer a problem, and then assist the student at the exact time that the help is required. Further, the cognitive tutor can customize exercises specific to the student's needs.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

== Limitations ==
At this time it is unclear whether Cognitive Tutor® is effective at improving student performance.&lt;ref name="US Dept of Ed, 2013"/&gt;  Cognitive Tutor® has had some commercial success however, there may be limitations inherently linked to its design and the nature of intelligent tutoring systems.  The following section discusses limitations of Cognitive Tutor® which may also apply to other intelligent tutoring systems.

===Curriculum===

At this time, creating a Cognitive Tutor® for all subject areas is not practical or economical.  Cognitive Tutor® has been used successfully but is still limited to tutoring algebra, computer programming and geometry because these subject areas have an optimal balance of production rules, complexity and maximum benefit to the learner.&lt;ref name="Anderson, J. R., Corbett, A. T., Koedinger, K. R., &amp; Pelletier, R. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anderson, J. R.|author2=Corbett, A. T.|author3=Koedinger, K. R.|author4=Pelletier, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=Cognitive tutor: Lesson learned|journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences|volume=4|issue=2|pages=167–207|url=http://www.learnlab.org/opportunities/summer/readings/AndersonEtAlJrnlLearningSci95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scandura, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scandura, J. M.|year=2012|title=The role of automation in instruction:  Recent advances in authorIT and TutorIT solve fundamental problems in developing intelligent tutoring systems|journal=Technology, Instruction, Cognition and Learning|volume=9|pages=3–8|url=http://tutorit.org/Articles/194-TheRoleofAutomationinInstruction-p00-00-Sc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of Cognitive Tutor® development has been the design of the software to teach specific production rules and not on the development of curricular content.  Despite many years of trials, improvements, and a potential to advance learning objectives, the creators continue to rely primarily on outside sources for curricular direction.&lt;ref name="Anderson, J. R., Corbett, A. T., Koedinger, K. R., &amp; Pelletier, R. (1995)"/&gt;

===Design===

The complexity of Cognitive Tutor® software requires designers to spend hundreds of hours per instructional hour to create the program.  Despite the time invested, the challenges associated with meeting the needs of the learner within the constraints of the design often result in compromises in flexibility and cognitive fidelity.&lt;ref name="Aleven, 2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aleven, V.|year=2010|chapter=Rule-Based Cognitive Modeling for Intelligent Tutoring Systems|editor=R. Nkambou|displayeditors=etal|title=Advances in Intelligent Tutoring Systems|publisher=SCI 308|pages=33–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practicality dictates that designers must choose from a discrete set of methods to teach and support learners.  Limited choices of methods, prompts and hints may be effective in supporting some learners but may conflict with the methods already in use by others.&lt;ref name="Scandura, 2012"/&gt; In addition, it is possible that learners will use the system of prompts and hints to access the answers prematurely thereby advancing through the exercises which may result in them not meeting the learning objectives.

===Model===

The [[cognitive model]], which inspired Cognitive Tutor® is based on assumptions about how learning occurs which dictates the chosen instructional methods such as hints, directions and timing of the tutoring prompts.  Given these assumptions and the limited methods of presentation, Cognitive Tutor® may not account for the flexible, complex and diverse ways humans create knowledge.&lt;ref name="Scandura, 2012"/&gt;  Human tutors outperform Cognitive Tutor® by providing a higher level of responsiveness to student errors.  They are capable of providing more effective feedback and scaffolding to learners than Cognitive Tutor®, indicating the cognitive model may still be incomplete.&lt;ref name="VanLehn, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author=VanLehn, K.|year=2011|title=The relative effectiveness of human tutoring, intelligent tutuoring systems and other tutoring systems|journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=46|issue=4|pages=197–221|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf|doi=10.1080/00461520.2011.611369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DSSAM Model''' (Dynamic Stream Simulation and Assessment Model) is a [[computer simulation]] developed for the [[Truckee River]] to analyze [[water pollution|water quality]] impacts from [[land use]] and [[wastewater]] management decisions in the Truckee River Basin. This area includes the cities of [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and [[Sparks, Nevada]] as well as the [[Lake Tahoe]] Basin. The model is historically and alternatively called the ''Earth Metrics Truckee River Model''.  Since original development in 1984-1986 under contract to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA),&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; the model has been refined and successive versions have been dubbed DSSAM II and DSSAM III.  This [[hydrology transport model]] is based upon a pollutant loading metric called ''[[Total maximum daily load]] (TMDL).'' The success of this flagship model contributed to the Agency’s broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of most river systems in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=April 1991 |title=Guidance for Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=00001KIO.TXT |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 440/4-91-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Truckee River has a length of over {{convert|115|mi|km}} and drains an area of approximately 3120 square miles,&lt;ref&gt; John Warwick, ''Truckee River spill model,'' University of Nevada-Reno (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; not counting the extent of its [[Lake Tahoe]] sub-basin. The DSSAM model establishes numerous stations along the entire river extent as well as a considerable number of monitoring points inside the  [[Great Basin]]'s [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], the receiving waters of this closed hydrological system.  Although the region is sparsely populated, it is important because Lake Tahoe is visited by 20 million persons per annum and Truckee River water quality affects at least two endangered species: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]].

==Development history==
[[File:Pyramid Lake sat.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite photo of  [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]], September 1994]]
Impetus to derive a quantitative prediction model arose from a trend of historically decreasing river flow rates coupled with jurisdictional and tribal conflicts over water rights as well as concern for river biota.  When expansion of the Reno-Sparks Wastewater Treatment Plant was proposed, the EPA decided to fund a large scale research effort to create  simulation software and a parallel program to collect field data in the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake.  For river stations water quality measurements were made in the [[benthic zone]] as well as the topic zone; in the case of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]] boats were used to collect grab samples at varying depths and locations.  Earth Metrics conducted the software development for the first generation [[computer model]] and collected field data on water quality and flow rates in the Truckee River.  After model calibration, runs were made to evaluate impacts of alternative land use controls and discharge parameters for treated [[effluent]]. 

The DSSAM Model is constructed to allow dynamic decay of most pollutants; for example, total nitrogen and phosphorus are allowed to be consumed by benthic [[alga]]e in each time step, and the algal communities are given a separate population dynamic in each river reach (e.g.metabolic rate based upon river temperature).  Sources throughout the watershed include non-point agricultural and urban stormwater as well as a multiplicity of point source discharges of treated municipal wastewater effluent.

Subsequent to the first generation of DSSAM  model development, calibration and application, later refinements were made.  These augmentations to model functionality focussed on increased flexibility in modeling the [[diel]] cycle and also allowed inclusion of analyzing particulate nitrogen and phosphorus.  In developing DSSAM III several changes in the model operation and scope were performed.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, J.T., C.L. Caupp, and H.M. Runke, '' Evaluation of water quality using DSSAM III under various conditions of nutrient loadings from municipal wastewater and agricultural sources: Truckee River, Nevada''.. Bureau of Water Quality Planning, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Carson City, Nevada (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cui-ui spawn (USFWS).jpg|thumb|right|[[spawn (biology)|Spawning]] [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]]]] --&gt;
Numerous different uses of the model have been made including (a)analysis of public policies for urban [[stormwater]] runoff, (b) researching agricultural methods for [[surface runoff]] minimization, (c) innovative solutions for non-point source control and d)engineering aspects of treated wastewater discharge.  Regarding stormwater runoff in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]], the specific elements within a new [[xeriscape]] ordinance were analyzed for efficacy using the model.  For the varied agricultural uses in the watershed, the model was run to understand the principal sources of adverse impact, and management practices were developed to reduce in river pollution. Use of the model has specifically been conducted to analyze survival of two [[endangered species]] found in the [[Truckee River]] and [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] (endangered 1967) and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] (threatened 1970).  When the model is used for [[surface runoff]] reaching a stream, this pollutant input can be viewed as a [[line source]] (e.g., a continuous linear source of pollution entering the waterway).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5370">'''Denitrifying bacteria''' are a diverse group of [[bacteria]] that encompass many different phyla. This group of bacteria, together with denitrifying fungi and archaea, is capable of performing [[denitrification]] as part of the [[nitrogen cycle]].&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt;  They [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]]ous [[Chemical compound|compounds]] using various enzymes, turning [[nitrogen oxide]]s back to nitrogen [[gas]] or [[nitrous oxide]].

== Diversity of denitrifying bacteria ==

There is a great diversity in bacteria capable of performing denitrification. Members of this group encompass most bacterial phyla and therefore possess a wide variety of physiological traits.&lt;ref name="Zumft"&gt;Zumft, W. G. (1997). ''Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification.'' Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 61(4), 533–616&lt;/ref&gt; Denitrifying bacteria have been identified in over 50 genera with over 125 different species and are estimated to represent 10-15% of bacteria population in water, soil and sediment.&lt;ref name="Eldor"&gt;Eldor, A. (2015). ''Soil microbiology, ecology, and biochemistry'' (4th ed.). Chapter 14 Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
Denitrifying include for example several species of ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Alkaligene]]s'' , ''[[Bacillus]]'' and others. 
The majority of denitrifying bacteria are facultative aerobic heterotrophs that switch from aerobic respiration to denitrification when oxygen as an available terminal electron acceptor (TEA) runs out. This forces the organism to use nitrate to be used as a TEA.&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt; Because the diversity of denitrifying bacteria is so large, this group can thrive in a wide range of habitats including some extreme environments such as environments that are highly saline and high in temperature.&lt;ref name=Zumft /&gt; Aerobic denitrifiers can conduct an aerobic respiratory process in which nitrate is converted gradually to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ), using nitrate reductase (Nar or Nao), nitrite reductase (Nir), nitric oxide reductase (Nor), and nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that aerobic denitrifiers mainly belong to α-, β- and γ-''Proteobacteria''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Bin|last2=Yang|first2=Kai|last3=Zhu|first3=Lei|last4=Jiang|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Hongyu|last6=Zhou|first6=Jun|last7=Zhang|first7=Huining|date=August 2015|title=Aerobic denitrification: A review of important advances of the last 30 years|journal=Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1007/s12257-015-0009-0|issn=1226-8372}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Denitrification mechanism ==

Denitrifying bacteria use denitrification to generate ATP.&lt;ref name="Bothe"&gt;Bothe, H., Ferguson, S., &amp; Newton, W. (2007). ''Biology of the nitrogen cycle.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common denitrification process is outlined below, with the nitrogen oxides being converted back to gaseous nitrogen:

2 NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 10 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 12 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The result is one molecule of nitrogen and six molecules of water. Denitrifying bacteria are a part of the N cycle, and consists of sending the N back into the atmosphere. 
The reaction above is the overall half reaction of the process of denitrification. The reaction can be further divided into different half reactions each requiring a specific enzyme. The transformation from nitrate to nitrite is performed by nitrate reductase (Nar)

NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitrite reductase (Nir) then converts nitrite into nitric oxide

2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 NO + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
 
Nitric oxide reductase (Nor) then converts nitric oxide into nitrous oxide

2 NO + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) terminates the reaction by converting nitrous oxide into dinitrogen
 
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

It is important to note that any of the products produced at any step can be exchanged with the soil environment.&lt;ref name="Bothe" /&gt;

== Denitrifying bacteria and the environment ==

The process of denitrification can lower the fertility of soil as nitrogen, a growth-limiting factor, is removed from the soil and lost to the atmosphere. This loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere can eventually be regained via introduced nutrients, as part of the nitrogen cycle.  Some nitrogen may also be [[nitrogen fixation|fixated]] by species of [[nitrifying bacteria]] and the [[cyanobacteria]]. Another important environmental issue concerning denitrification is the fact that the process tends to produce large amounts of by-products. Examples of by-products are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). NO is an ozone depleting species and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is a potent greenhouse gas which can contribute to global warming.&lt;ref name=Eldor /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">'''Digital self-defense''' is the use of [[self-defense]] strategies by [[Internet]] users to ensure [[digital security]]; that is to say, the protection of confidential [[personal electronic information]].&lt;ref&gt;“Components of Security”, http://nms.csail.mit.edu/~snoeren/stp307/ppt/sld002.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet security]] software provides initial protection by setting up a [[firewall (computing)|firewall]], as well as scanning computers for [[malware]], [[viruses]], [[Trojan horses]], [[computer worm|worms]] and [[spyware]].  However information at most risk includes personal details such as [[birthdate]]s, [[phone number]]s, [[bank account]] and [[schooling]] details, [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious affiliation]]s, [[email address]]es and [[password]]s.  This information is often openly revealed in [[social networking]] sites leaving Internet users vulnerable to [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and possibly [[Internet crime]]. Mobile devices, especially those with [[Wi-Fi]], allow this information to be shared inadvertently.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital self-defense requires Internet users to take an active part in guarding their own personal information. Four key strategies are frequently suggested to assist that protection.

==Computer security==
Computer security in this context is referring to [[Internet security]] software. The ongoing security of private information requires frequent updating of virus and spyware definitions so that ongoing developments in malicious software cannot interfere with, or copy, private information.&lt;ref&gt;"Secure your computer", © Commonwealth of Australia 2010 and © Stay Smart Online. http://www.staysmartonline.gov.au/home_internet_users/secure_your_computer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Email Accounts and Usernames==

===Choice of Appropriate Email Account===
The practice of utilising more than one [[email]] account to separate personal and business usage from recreational usage is a strategy commonly used to manage personal privacy. The free and ready availability of email accounts from sites such as [[Yahoo]], [[Google]] or [[Hotmail]] allows the protection of personal identity through the use of different names to identify each email account. These [[throw-away account]]s can be discarded or replaced at will, providing another level of protection.

===Choice of Username===
A [[username]] is required to set up email accounts and to open accounts for various official, commercial, recreational and social networking sites.  In many cases, an email address may also be utilised as a username. Usernames that correlate with personal information such as names or nicknames are more at risk than ones that are cryptic or anonymous, particularly on social and recreational sites.

==Password Strength==
A [[password]] is a mandatory security measure that accompanies usernames. The use of personal data to construct passwords i.e. family members’ names, pet’s names or birth dates increases the risk to confidential information and are easier to crack than long complicated passwords so [[password strength]] is a key strategy for protecting personal information. A password can be weak or strong:a weak password is ''cutekittens'', a strong password is ''?lACpAs56IKMs''.

According to [[Microsoft]] an ideal password should be at least 14 characters in length and have letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers, where complexity is added by the inclusion of uppercase letters.&lt;ref&gt;"Create Strong Passwords", Microsoft Safety and Security Center. {{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214012154/http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managing Personal Information Using Privacy Options==
[[Social networking]] sites offer greater security risks to personal electronic information because sensitive, private or confidential information such as [[personal identifier]]s are routinely used to create public profiles.&lt;ref&gt;"Safer Social Networking". © Commonwealth of Australia 2010.http://www.cybersmart.gov.au/Parents/Brochures%20and%20posters%20and%20contacts/Cybersmart%20contacts.aspx#Information&lt;/ref&gt; Many websites give options to suppress the amount of personal information revealed through the customisation of privacy settings. However privacy settings can reset if changes to the website occur.&lt;ref&gt;“Protect yourself in the online, social network community”,  Creston News Advertiser, 11 Feb 2011. http://www.crestonnewsadvertiser.com/articles/ara/2011/02/11/8044960708/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity''''' (1997)&lt;ref name=dnw&gt;{{cite book |title=Disclosing New Worlds: Entrepreneurship, Democratic Action, and the Cultivation of Solidarity|author1=Charles Spinosa|author2=Fernando Flores|author3=Hubert L. Dreyfus|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press USA|isbn=0-262-19381-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize [[democracy]] by [[social constructionism]] via an [[argument]] style of [[world disclosure]] but which philosophy is distinct from:
*[[Relativism]] - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity.
*[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]] - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy
*[[Essentialism]] - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function.

Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent  technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as  [[peak oil]],  [[global warming]] and [[environmental degradation]]. The book is co-authored by [[Fernando Flores]],  [[Hubert Dreyfus]]  and Charles Spinosa (a consultant philosopher specializing in commercial innovation). They concentrate on three practical activities:

* [[social entrepreneurship]],
* [[active citizenship]] and
* [[solidarity|social solidarity]]

The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus  challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people  understand their  personal qualities and deal with their particular situations.

==Structure of the work==
'''[[World disclosure]]''' (German: Erschlossenheit, literally development or comprehension) is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] in his landmark book [[Being and Time]]. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as [[John Dewey]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people.

==Conclusion==
The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify thee types of actors:
* The entrepreneur
* The virtuous citizen 
* The culture figure

Each has to overcome [[resistance to change]], but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear [[strategy|strategic]] objective, but use different [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be "history makers" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant  of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people.

They promote a change to the overarching [[consumerism]] as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of [[sustainable development]]  within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports [[human equality]]

'''''Euro-Sinica''''' is a scholarly series, published by the European academic publisher [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]. The series focuses primarily on intercultural and transcultural studies, including intellectual history, of Europe and China.

The monograph series was founded by Adrian Hsia, of [[McGill University]], following the first Sino-German symposium on intercultural relations immediately after the opening of China subsequent to the Cultural Revolution. The symposium was co-organized by Hsia and Professor Guenther Debon, University of Heidelberg, and its proceedings entitled ''Goethe und China, China und Goethe'' (1985) were published as volume one of the series. Later on, the prominent Chinese novelist and scholar [[Qian Zhongshu]] wrote the Chinese title of Euro-Sinica in his beautiful calligraphy which constitutes a part of the book cover since volume three. So far, twelve volumes have been published in English, French, and German, covering the three domains mentioned above.

In this series of intellectual probings, the terms "Europe" and "China" are not to be understood geo-politically, but rather culturally. Wherever a European language is used as the official language, such a country is considered to belong to the European cultural group. In a similar vein, wherever Chinese ideograms are used and the tenets of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]] are followed, these countries are regarded as the Sinic group. Studies on both cultural groups are also included in the monograph series. The third domain of Euro-Sinica constitutes analyses of ethnic Chinese artists and thinkers living in the West.

'''Extraterrestrial life''',&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Where "extraterrestrial" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''extra'' ("beyond", "not of") and ''[[wikt:terrestris|terrestris]]'' ("of [[Earth]]", "belonging to Earth").&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''alien life''' (or, if it is a [[Sentience|sentient]] or relatively complex [[Individual#Biology|individual]], an "extraterrestrial" or "alien"), is [[life]] that occurs outside of Earth and that probably did not originate from [[Earth]].

The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as [[exobiology]].

Since the mid-20th century, there has been an ongoing search for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence|search for extraterrestrial intelligent life]].

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of [[science fiction]]. Over the years, science fiction communicated scientific ideas, imagined a wide range of possibilities, and influenced public interest in and perspectives of extraterrestrial life. One shared space is the debate over the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence.  Some encourage aggressive methods to try for contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others—citing the tendency of technologically advanced human societies to enslave or wipe out less advanced societies—argue that it may be dangerous to actively call attention to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |title=Scientists in US are urged to seek contact with aliens |work=BBC News |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity?

Alien life, such as [[microorganism]]s, has been hypothesized to exist in the [[Solar System]] and throughout the universe.

===Evolution===
A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes "Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-10-31-aliens-may-be-more-us-we-think |title=Aliens may be more like us than we think |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [[Planetary habitability|niches a planet]] contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary exobiology: Towards the qualitative assessment of biological potential on exoplanets |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |first1=David S. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Sean |last2=Large |date=25 October 2017 |doi=10.1017/S1473550417000349 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemical basis==
{{Main article|Biochemistry|Hypothetical types of biochemistry|Water#Effects on life}}
Life on Earth requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on [[terrestrial planet]]s with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bond |first1=Jade C. |last2=O'Brien |first2=David P. |last3=Lauretta |first3=Dante S. |title=The Compositional Diversity of Extrasolar Terrestrial Planets.

It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid [[hydrocarbon]], such as [[methane]], [[ethane]] or [[propane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.nap.edu/read/11919/chapter/8#74 |chapter=6.2.2: Nonpolar Solvents |title=The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems |publisher=The National Academies Press |author=National Research Council |page=74 |date=2007 |doi=10.17226/11919 |isbn=978-0-309-10484-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 29 [[chemical element]]s play an active positive role in living organisms on Earth.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/catalog/46493 |chapter=Ultratrace Minerals |title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins |first1=Forrest H. |last1=Nielsen |editor1-first=Maurice E. |editor1-last=Shils |editor2-first=Moshe |editor2-last=Shike |pages=283–303 |edition=9th |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-683-30769-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 95% of living matter is built upon only [[CHNOPS|six elements]]: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]].

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins.

According to NASA's 2015 Astrobiology Strategy, "Life on other worlds is most likely to include microbes, and any complex living system elsewhere is likely to have arisen from and be founded upon microbial life. Important insights on the limits of microbial life can be gleaned from studies of microbes on modern Earth, as well as their ubiquity and ancestral characteristics."&lt;ref name="NASA strategy 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nai.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2015/10/NASA_Astrobiology_Strategy_2015_151008.pdf |title=NASA Astrobiology Strategy 2015 |publisher=NASA |editor1-first=Lindsay |editor1-last=Hays |page=65 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the [[Solar System]], it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere ([[Exogenesis (astrobiology)|exogenesis]]). The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Anaxagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras and the Origin of Panspermia Theory |publisher=iUniverse |first=Margaret R. |last=O'Leary |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-595-49596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] (1834),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Analysis of the Alais meteorite and implications about life in other worlds |journal=[[Liebigs Annalen|Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]] |first=Jöns Jacob |last=Berzelius |author-link=Jöns Jacob Berzelius |volume=10 |pages=134–135 |date=1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] (1871),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The British Association Meeting at Edinburgh |journal=Nature |first=William |last=Thomson |author-link=William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin |volume=4 |issue=92 |pages=261–278 |date=August 1871 |doi=10.1038/004261a0 |bibcode=1871Natur...4..261. |quote=We must regard it as probably to the highest degree that there are countless seed-bearing meteoritic stones moving through space. |pmc=2070380}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1879)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Darwin's Contribution to the Development of the Panspermia Theory |journal=Astrobiology |first=René |last=Demets |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=946–950 |date=October 2012 |doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0790 |pmid=23078643 |bibcode=2012AsBio..12..946D}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, somewhat later, by [[Svante Arrhenius]] (1903).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakingev00arrhrich |title=Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |first=Svante |last=Arrhenius |others=trans.

[[Sir Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001) and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for [[macroevolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hoyle.org.uk/resources/virusesfromspacecompressed.pdf |title=Viruses from Space and Related Matters |publisher=University College Cardiff Press |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |first2=Chandra |last2=Wickramasinghe |first3=John |last3=Watson |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-906449-93-6 |bibcode=1986vfsr.book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.
The Nobel prize winner [[Francis Crick]], along with [[Leslie Orgel]] proposed that seeds of life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,&lt;ref name="Crick_Orgel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Crick |first=F.

In the early 20th century, Venus was often thought to be similar to Earth in terms of habitability, but observations since the beginning of the [[Space Age]] have revealed that Venus's surface is inhospitable to Earth-like life. However, between an altitude of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it has been speculated that thermoacidophilic  [[extremophile]] [[microorganisms]] might exist in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2843-acidic-clouds-of-venus-could-harbour-life.html |title=Acidic clouds of Venus could harbour life |work=New Scientist |first=Stuart |last=Clark |date=26 September 2003 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redfern, Martin (25 May 2004).

Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.&lt;ref name="Tritt2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze-Makuch2001"/&gt; [[Hydrothermal vent]]s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the ice and could be capable of supporting multicellular [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="EuropaPlanetary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |title=Projects: Europa Mission Campaign |publisher=The Planetary Society |first=Louis |last=Friedman |date=14 December 2005 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002508/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/explore_europa/update_12142005.html |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Europa Capable of Supporting Life, Scientist Says |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |year=2009 |publisher=Universe Today |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/08/europa-capable-of-supporting-life-scientist-says/ |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/huge-lakes-of-water-may-exist-under-europas-ice/ |title=Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice |series=Bad Astronomy Blog |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/scientists-find-evidence-for-great-lake-on-europa/ |title=Scientists Find Evidence for "Great Lake" on Europa and Potential New Habitat for Life |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models of heat retention and heating via [[radioactive decay]] in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]], [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]] may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100&amp;nbsp;km thick.&lt;ref name="Hussmann Sohl et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2006.06.005| last1 = Hussmann| first1 = Hauke| last2 = Sohl| first2 = Frank| last3 = Spohn| first3 = Tilman| date = November 2006| title = Subsurface oceans and deep interiors of medium-sized outer planet satellites and large trans-neptunian objects| journal = [[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]| volume = 185| issue = 1| pages = 258–273| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225019299| bibcode = 2006Icar..185..258H| ref = {{sfnRef|Hussmann Sohl et al.|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water.

The rover landed on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name="Gale Crater2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gale Crater3"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute – Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained  from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]].&lt;ref name="ColorCatalog"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name="NG-20120829"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar Found In Space |journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=29 August 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20120829"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweet!

In 1961, [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]  [[Frank Drake]] devised the [[Drake equation]] as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |title=Chapter 3 — Philosophy: "Solving the Drake Equation |accessdate=24 July 2015 |date=December 2002 |publisher=SETI League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drake equation is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [[Milky Way]]  [[galaxy]]. The equation is best understood not as an equation in the strictly mathematical sense, but to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere.&lt;ref name='Burchell'&gt;{{cite journal |title=W(h)ither the Drake equation? |last=Burchell |first=M. J. |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=243–250 |date=2006 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=597376&amp;fileId=S1473550406003107 |doi=10.1017/S1473550406003107 |bibcode=2006IJAsB...5..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Drake equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''N'' = the number of Milky Way galaxy [[civilization]]s already capable of communicating across [[interplanetary space]]

and
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:''L'' = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

&lt;math&gt;10{,}000 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 \cdot 10{,}000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="NOVA"&gt;{{cite web |last=Aguirre |first=L. |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Drake Equation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/drake.html |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: What does a Martian look like? |title=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |first1=Jack |last1=Cohen |author1-link=Jack Cohen (scientist) |first2=Ian |last2=Stewart |author2-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-09-187927-3|title-link=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led critics to label the equation a [[guesstimate]], or even meaningless.

Based on observations from the ''[[Hubble Space Telescope]]'', there are between 125 and 250 billion galaxies in the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/how-many-galaxies/ |title=How many galaxies are there in the universe? |last=Temming |first=M. |work=Sky &amp; Telescope |date=18 July 2014 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least ten percent of all Sun-like stars have a system of planets,&lt;ref name="marcyprogth05"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G. |last1=Marcy |first2=R. |last2=Butler |first3=D. |last3=Fischer |display-authors=etal |title=Observed Properties of Exoplanets: Masses, Orbits and Metallicities |journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement |year=2005 |volume=158 |issue= |pages=24–42 |url=http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS/158/24 |doi=10.1143/PTPS.158.24 |arxiv=astro-ph/0505003 |bibcode=2005PThPS.158...24M |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002085400/http://ptp.ipap.jp/link?PTPS%2F158%2F24 |archivedate=2 October 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. there are {{val|6.25|e=18}} stars with planets orbiting them in the observable universe. Even if it is assumed that only one out of a billion of these stars has planets supporting life, there would be some 6.25 billion life-supporting planetary systems in the observable universe.

A 2013 study based on results from the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'']] spacecraft estimated that the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billion exoplanets.&lt;ref name="Swift2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Characterizing the Cool KOIs.

The apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for such civilizations is known as the [[Fermi paradox]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/space/the-flip-side-of-optimism-about-life-on-other-planets.html |date=3 August 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main article|Cosmic pluralism}}
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous "worlds" in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html |title=Who discovered that the Sun was a Star? |publisher=Stanford Solar Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical.&lt;ref name=crowe1999&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4TZPlihVUoC |title=The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750–1900 |first=Michael J. |last=Crowe |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-486-40675-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin D. |last=Wiker |date=4 November 2002 |title=Alien Ideas: Christianity and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |work=Crisis Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030210140752/http://www.crisismagazine.com/november2002/feature7.htm |archivedate=10 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion |first=Robert |last=Irwin |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-86064-983-7 |page=204 &amp; 209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Muslim writers like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] and [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] supported cosmic pluralism on the basis of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name =Weintraub&gt;David A. Weintraub (2014). "Islam," ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161-168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Copernican revolution]]s, and later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in his 1686 work ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds |publisher=University of California Press |first=Bernard le Bovier |last=de Fontenelle |others=trans. H. A. Hargreaves |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-520-91058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and astronomers such as [[William Herschel]]. The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html |title=Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that "if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in "Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds" (1647).
In "The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: "We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested "our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s "Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed "cosmic pluralism" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===
[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canals]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experiments as to the actuality of the "Canals" observed on Mars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first1=J. E. |last1=Evans |first2=E. W. |last2=Maunder |author2-link=Edward Walter Maunder |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=488–499 |date=June 1903 |doi=10.1093/mnras/63.8.488 |bibcode=1903MNRAS..63..488E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in 1895, American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] published his book ''Mars,'' followed by ''Mars and its Canals'' in 1906, proposing that the canals were the work of a long-gone civilization.&lt;ref name="Wallace1907"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm |title=Is Mars Habitable? A Critical Examination of Professor Lowell's Book "Mars and Its Canals," With an Alternative Explanation |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |first=Alfred Russel |last=Wallace |date=1907 |oclc=8257449}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of life on Mars led British writer [[H. G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="chambers"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |year=1999 |doi= |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the "Martian invasion" of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

Most [[unidentified flying object]]s or [[List of UFO sightings|UFO sightings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anne |last=Cross |title=The Flexibility of Scientific Rhetoric: A Case Study of UFO Researchers |journal=Qualitiative Sociology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=3–34 |doi=10.1023/B:QUAS.0000015542.28438.41 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be readily explained as sightings of Earth-based aircraft, known [[astronomical object]]s, or as [[hoax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Philippe |last=Ailleris |date=January–February 2011 |title=The lure of local SETI: Fifty years of field experiments |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=68 |issue=1–2 |pages=2–15 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.12.011 |bibcode=2011AcAau..68....2A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a certain fraction of the public believe that UFOs might actually be of extraterrestrial origin, and, indeed, the notion has had influence on popular culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably "[[Sector Four|Area 51]]" and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, "All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, "The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet |url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=6 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |archivedate=24 November 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says |url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/ |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is "no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt; The response noted "odds are pretty high" that there may be life on other planets but "the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved."&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson"/&gt;

In 2013, the [[exoplanet]] [[Kepler-62f]] was discovered, along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]]. A related [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6132.toc special issue] of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', published earlier, described the discovery of the exoplanets.&lt;ref name="SCI-20130503"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Special Issue: Exoplanets |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/exoplanets/ |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2014, the discovery of the Earth-size exoplanet [[Kepler-186f]], 500 light-years from [[Earth]], was publicly announced;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140417"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Scientists Find an 'Earth Twin', or Maybe a Cousin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/science/space/scientists-find-an-earth-twin-or-maybe-a-cousin.html |date=17 April 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the first Earth-size planet to be discovered in the [[habitable zone]] and it has been hypothesized that there may be liquid water on its surface.

On 20 July 2015, British physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] and Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], along with the [[SETI Institute]], announced a well-funded effort, called the [[Breakthrough Initiatives]], to expand efforts to search for extraterrestrial life.  The group contracted the services of the 100-meter Robert C.

'''Optical fabrication and testing''' spans an enormous range of manufacturing procedures and [[optics|optical]] test configurations. 

The manufacture of a conventional spherical [[lens (optics)|lens]] typically begins with the generation of the optic's rough shape by [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] a glass blank.&lt;ref name=OPN&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface finishing of complex optics |first=Aric B. |last=Shorey |author2=Golini, Don |author3=Kordonski, William  |journal=Optics and Photonics News |publisher=Optical Society of America |volume=18 |issue=10 |date=October 2007 |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done, for example, with ring tools. Next, the lens surface is [[polishing|polished]] to its final form. Typically this is done by [[lapping]]—rotating and rubbing the rough lens surface against a tool with the desired surface shape, with a mixture of abrasives and fluid in between. 
Typically a carved pitch tool is used to polish the surface of a lens.  The mixture of abrasive is called slurry and it is typically made from cerium or zirconium oxide in water with lubricants added to facilitate pitch tool movement without sticking to the lens. The particle size in the slurry is adjusted to get the desired shape and finish.  

During polishing, the lens may be tested to confirm that the desired shape is being produced, and to ensure that the final shape has the correct form to within the allowed precision. The deviation of an optical surface from the correct shape is typically expressed in fractions of a [[wavelength]], for some convenient wavelength of light (perhaps the wavelength at which the lens is to be used, or a visible wavelength for which a source is available). Inexpensive lenses may have deviations of form as large as several wavelengths (λ, 2λ, etc.). More typical industrial lenses would have deviations no larger than a quarter wavelength (λ/4). Precision lenses for use in applications such as [[laser]]s, [[interferometer]]s, and [[holography]] have surfaces with a tenth of a wavelength (λ/10) tolerance or better. In addition to surface profile, a lens must meet requirements for surface quality (scratches, pits, specks, etc.) and accuracy of dimensions.

'''Feature geometry''' is a [[Phonology|phonological]] theory which represents [[distinctive features]] as a structured hierarchy rather than a matrix or a set. Feature geometry grew out of [[autosegmental phonology]], which emphasizes the autonomous nature of distinctive features and the non-uniform relationships among them. Feature geometry recognizes that some sets of features often pattern together in phonological and phonotactic generalizations, while others rarely interact. Feature geometry thus formally encodes groups of features under nodes in a tree: features that commonly pattern together are said to share a parent node, and operations on this set can be encoded as operation on the parent node.

One node in feature geometries is the Laryngeal node. The Laryngeal node is an organizing node that dominates the features of the [[Distinctive feature#Laryngeal features|larynx]], usually taken to be [voice], [constricted glottis], and [spread glottis]. It is common for these three features to pattern together in the phonology of the world's languages to the exclusion of every other feature, and in feature geometry, this follows from the tree representation. Similarly, feature geometries generally include a Place node that is the dominant node of the [[Distinctive feature#Place features|place features]], which also often pattern together. Feature geometry is easily compatible with theories of [[underspecification]] and can represent incomplete segments by missing nodes.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Root node is the topmost node of the feature tree and works as the formal organizing unit of the segment, and in some frameworks encodes the major class features such as [consonantal], [sonorant], and [approximant]. Some features such as [nasal] and [lateral] are sometimes dependent of the root node, or sometimes of a Supralaryngeal node along with Place. Other features such as [anterior] and [distributed] are usually dependent from the Coronal place feature.

The first formal model of feature geometry was introduced in print by [[Nick Clements|George N. Clements]] in 1985, drawing on unpublished work by K.P. Mohanon and Joan Mascaró. Another precursor to feature geometry was proposed by Roger Lass in 1976, in which he proposed a laryngeal feature submatrix within a distinctive feature matrix. Other important models have been proposed by Elizabeth Sagey (1986), John J. McCarthy (1988), and Clements &amp; Hume (1995). Models vary widely in the number of the hierarchical nodes and in how consonant and vowel features are treated.

Feature geometry has attracted formal and conceptual criticism. In 2003 [[Charles Reiss]] argued that feature geometry is insufficiently powerful to account for a class of phonological rules that involve dependencies between segments, such as partial and total identity and nonidentity. Feature geometry is unable to encode these properties. In 2008 [[Jeff Mielke]] argued that feature geometry merely recapitulated physiological organization, and that since the influence of articulation on [[sound changes|sound change]] will independently create patterns in the behavior of features, feature geometry recapitulates diachrony and is redundant as a theory of the mental organisation of phonology.

A '''gallery grave''' is a form of [[megalithic]] tomb built primarily during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} in [[Europe]] in which the main [[Long gallery|gallery]] of the tomb is entered without first passing through an [[antechamber]] or [[hallway]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=9}}{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}} There are at least four major types of gallery grave (complex, [[transepted gallery grave|transepted]], segmented, and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge-shaped]]), and they may be covered with an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]") or rock mound (or "[[cairn]]").

==About gallery graves==
Archeologist T. Douglas Price argues that the gallery grave was a form of community burial site. Those placed in a gallery grave were most likely members of the same family or hamlet, and probably were intended to reinforce the sense of community.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=185}}

Gallery graves may be straight, or they may form an [[Ell (architecture)|ell]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} In some cases, a burial chamber exists at the end of the gallery.{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=70}} The walls of gallery graves were built of [[Megalithic architectural elements#Orthostat|orthostats]], slab-like stones set upright in the earth.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=49}} They were roofed with multiple flat stones, although the burial chamber (if one existed) was usually roofed with a single large stone.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Multiple burials could occur all at one time, the grave could be reopened several times to accept new burials, or the grave could remain open over an extended period of time to accept multiple burials.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=99}}

[[File:Bézier - Plan de la roche-aux-fées.png|thumb|Drawing of the plan of the segmented gallery grave at La Roche-aux-Fées in France. Capstones (forming the ceiling) are represented by dotted lines.]]
Burials in gallery graves were made in the gallery itself, or in small burial chambers opening off the gallery.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} This is known as a "complex gallery grave".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When the adjacent burial chambers are paired, the structure is known as a "[[transepted gallery grave]]".{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}}{{sfn|Daniel|2013|page=40}} Gallery graves may also have their galleries subdivided by interior stone slabs.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}{{sfn|Roe|1970|page=139}} These are known as "segmented gallery graves".{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} When two parallel galleries lead to a single terminal burial chamber, this is known as a "parallel gallery grave".{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}}

Some gallery graves were not rectangular in shape, but rather narrowed toward the rear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} These are known as [[wedge-shaped gallery grave]]s.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} The ceilings of wedge-shaped gallery graves often sloped toward the rear,{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} and a sill of stone set some distance inside the away from the entrance{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} or one or two slabs set upright in the earth{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} defined a sort of antechamber. The wedge-shaped gallery grave was usually topped by a [[cairn]] (covering of stones) rather than an earthen mound (or "[[tumulus]]"),{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} although an earthen mound was sometimes used.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|pages=46-47}} The cross-sectional shape of the cairn could be round, oval, or D-shaped, and often a [[Megalithic architectural elements#Kerb or peristalith|kerb]] (ring of stone) was used to help [[Revetment|revet]] the cairn and keep it in place.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}}{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}} Some wedge-shaped gallery graves had curved rear walls, while others were linear.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} A few had the terminal burial chamber at the rear of the gallery, although this was usually blocked off.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves sometimes had a set of outer walls. These could be parallel to the inner walls, or they could be set at an even stronger angle (emphasizing the wedge-like nature of the tomb).{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}} Wedge-shaped gallery graves usually faced west, and often had a pair of upright stone slabs linking the inner and outer walls at the entrance.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=46}}

The tumulus (or "barrow") covering a gallery grave may be [[oval barrow|ovate]] or [[long barrow|long]].{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|page=9}} The sides of the tumulus may be parallel or not.{{sfn|Chadwick|Fox|Dickins|2013|pages=5, 9}} The tumulus was designed so that the end of the gallery (or the terminal burial chamber, if one existed) was at the center of the tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} A tumulus may contain several gallery graves radiating outward from the center.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|page=101}} Since the earth atop the gallery grave was only loosely piled up, it often washed away due to erosion. Many gallery graves today lie exposed to the air, when originally they would have lain deep within a tumulus.{{sfn|Wilder|1924|pages=101-102}}

===Transepted===
'''Transepted gallery graves''' have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the [[Loire]] valley of France, south west [[Great Britain]] and in [[Ireland]] and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another.

===Wedge-shaped===
[[File:Altair Burial Tomb, Schull, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|[[Altar Wedge Tomb]], County Cork]]
[[File:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|thumb|[[Glantane East]] Wedge Tomb, County Cork, Ireland]]
A '''wedge-shaped [[gallery grave]]''' or '''wedge tomb''' is a type of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[chamber tomb]]. They are so named because the burial chamber narrows at one end (usually decreasing both in height and width from west to east), producing a wedge shape in elevation. An [[antechamber]] is separated from the burial area by a simple [[jamb]] or sill, and the doorway generally faces west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= BBC History | year= 2004 | title= Irish Neolithic Tombs'' | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3181673| accessdate=2006-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinguishing characteristic of wedge tombs is the double-walling of the gallery. They were often covered by [[cairn]]s, which could be round, oval or D-shaped, often with a [[Megalithic architectural elements|kerb]] to revet it. More are low sized, usually about 1.5 metres high, and are generally found on mountainsides, about three-quarters the way up.

Wedge tombs were built between the Irish late  [[Neolithic]] and middle [[Bronze Age]]s (about 2500 to 2000BC). Today, between 500 and 550 known wedge tombs survive in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= iol.ie | year= | title= ''A Brief Guide To Irish Archaeological Sites'' | url=http://www.iol.ie/~sec/sites.htm#Wedge%20Tombs| accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found predominantly in the west and north west of the island.


===Dating===
Along with the [[dolmen]] and [[passage grave]], the gallery grave is the most common megalithic tomb in western Europe.{{sfn|Price|2013|page=184}}{{sfn|Piggott|1965|page=61}}

Gallery graves were usually constructed during the Neolithic Age, which began about 10,200 BC and ended in Europe about 3,200 BC.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Some, however, were constructed in the Middle and Late [[Bronze Age]], about 2,300 BC to 600 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|page=598}} Dating of some gallery graves is difficult, as the tombs may have been constructed in the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, but reopened and used for burials until the Late Bronze Age.{{sfn|Barber|Altena|1999|page=47}}

===Gallery vs. passage grave===
The difference between a complex gallery grave and a [[passage grave]] (which also has smaller burial chambers opening off the main passage) is two-fold.  First, the gallery grave gallery will be as high and wide as the side burial chambers, while in a passage grave the passage is not as high or wide as the burial chambers.  Second, gallery graves are usually topped by a V-shaped tumulus, while passage graves are almost always covered by a round tumulus.{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}}

==Recognized gallery graves==
[[File:17. Labbacallee Wedge Tomb, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|Interior of Labbacallee, a wedge-shaped gallery grave in Ireland.]]
Archeologists Ian Shaw and Robert Jameson argued in 1999 that the best-researched gallery graves are the [[Severn-Cotswold tomb]]s in [[Wales]] and [[South West England]] in the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Shaw|Jameson|1999|page=247}} Other important gallery graves include:

* [[Giants' grave]] in [[Sardinia]]
* [[Glantane East]] wedge-shaped tomb in Ireland
* [[Naveta]] grave in [[Menorca]]
* [[Seine-Oise-Marne culture]] ''allées couverte'' in northern [[France]] and southern [[Belgium]]

In [[architecture]],  a '''gargoyle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɑr|ɡ|ɔɪ|l}}) is a carved or formed [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]]&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down [[masonry]] walls and eroding the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[flying buttress]]es were used, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.&lt;ref name="Wonderopolis"&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Gargoyle? |url=https://wonderopolis.org/wonder/what-is-a-gargoyle |website=Wonderopolis |accessdate=19 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term originates from the [[French language|French]] ''gargouille,'' which in English is likely to mean "throat" or is otherwise known as the "gullet";&lt;ref name="Hargreaves 1990 p. 51" /&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary" /&gt; cf. [[Latin]] ''gurgulio, gula, gargula'' ("gullet" or "throat") and similar words derived from the root ''gar,'' "to swallow", which represented the gurgling sound of water (e.g., [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''garganta,'' "throat"; ''gárgola,'' "gargoyle"). It is also connected to the French verb ''gargariser,'' which shares a Latin root with the verb "gargle"&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary" /&gt; and is likely imitative in origin.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 2015" /&gt; The [[Italian language|Italian]] word for gargoyle is ''doccione'' or ''gronda sporgente,''  an architecturally precise phrase which means "protruding gutter. (Italian also uses ''gargolla'' o ''garguglia'', when it has a grotesque shape)

When not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the correct term for such a sculpture is a [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesque]], chimera, or [[Boss (architecture)|boss]]. There are also regional variations, such as the [[hunky punk]]. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to frighten off and protect those that it guards, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.

== Legend of the Gargouille ==
A French legend that sprang up around the name of [[Romanus of Rouen|St. Romanus]] ({{lang-fr|Romain}}; [[floruit|fl.]] {{Circa}} 631 – 641 AD), the former chancellor of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Clotaire II]] who was made [[bishop of Rouen]], relates how he delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called ''[[Gargouille]]'' or ''Goji''.&lt;ref name="Butler Thurston Attwater 1956 p. 183" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Herbermann Pace Pallen Shahan 1913 p. 209" /&gt;  La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth.  Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or he captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection.&lt;ref name="Cipa 2009" /&gt; In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the [[reliquary]] of the saint was carried in procession (see details at [[Rouen]]).&lt;ref name="Hodder 1881 p. 46" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Archaeological Association 1939 p. 361" /&gt;

== History ==
The term ''gargoyle'' is most often applied to [[medieval]] work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In [[Ancient Egypt]]ian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head.&lt;ref name="Clarke Engelbach 1930" /&gt; Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on [[Greek temple]]s, carved or modelled in the [[marble sculpture|marble]] or [[terracotta]] [[cymatium]] of the [[cornice (architecture)|cornice]].&lt;ref name="Dinsmoor Anderson 1950" /&gt; An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]].  Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.&lt;ref name="Willemsen 1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Swaddling 1980" /&gt;

Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras.&lt;ref name="Fudgé 2016 p. 91" /&gt; According to French architect and author [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], himself one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Hourihane 2012 p. 642" /&gt; the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on [[Laon Cathedral]] c. 1200–1220.&lt;ref name="Weinstock 2016 p. 248" /&gt; One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.

Both ornamented and unornamented water spouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the [[Rain gutter|guttering]] roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed.  This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. In 1724, the London Building Act passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] made the use of downpipes compulsory on all new construction.&lt;ref name="Holy Horrors" /&gt;

== Catholic Church ==
The primary use of the gargoyle was to illustrate [[evil]] through the form of the gargoyle,{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} while another theory posits that grotesques in architecture were [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] devices.&lt;ref name="Tschen-Emmons 2015 p. 72" /&gt; In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rainspouts, [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of his monastery's cloister:&lt;ref name="Di Renzo 1995 p. 1" /&gt;

{{quotation|What are these fantastic monsters doing in the cloisters before the eyes of the brothers as they read? What is the meaning of these unclean monkeys, these strange savage lions, and monsters? To what purpose are here placed these creatures, half beast, half man, or these spotted tigers? I see several bodies with one head and several heads with one body. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's head, there a fish with a quadruped's head, then again an animal half horse, half goat... Surely if we do not blush for such absurdities, we should at least regret what we have spent on them.&lt;ref name="Leclercq 1963" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nathan 1961 p. 74" /&gt;
}}
According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in ''Gargoylaes, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture'', "There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning."&lt;ref name="Bridaham 1930 p. xii" /&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Animal ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used animal-shaped waterspouts.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|11}} During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people.  Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas.  Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France.  In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection.&lt;ref name="Varner 2008" /&gt;

Human qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals—that is, the animals were [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]]. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the [[rhinoceros]] and the [[hippopotamus]]) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at [[Laon Cathedral]]) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in Medieval times.&lt;ref name="Benton 1997" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

The '''Holmdel Horn Antenna''' is a large microwave [[horn antenna]] that was used as a [[satellite communication]] antenna and [[radio telescope]] during the 1960s at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], United States.&lt;ref name="Crawford"/&gt;  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1988 because of its association with the research work of two [[radio astronomer]]s, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt; In 1965 while using this antenna, Penzias and Wilson discovered the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) that permeates the universe.&lt;ref name="Penzias"&gt;{{cite journal

It provided the evidence that confirmed [[George Gamow]]'s and [[Georges Lemaître]]'s "[[Big Bang]]" theory of the creation of the universe. This helped change the science of cosmology, the study of the history of the universe, from a field for unlimited theoretical speculation into a discipline of direct observation. In 1978 Penzias and Wilson received the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Chown, "A Cosmic Relic in Three Degrees," New Scientist, September 29, 1988, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The [[horn antenna]] at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, was constructed in 1959 to support [[Project Echo]]&amp;mdash;the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s passive communications satellites,&lt;ref&gt;[[J.S. Hey]], ''The Evolution of Radio Astronomy'' (New York: Neale Watson Academic Publications, Inc., 1973), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt; which used large earth orbiting aluminized plastic balloons as reflectors to bounce radio signals from one point on the Earth to another.

The antenna is 50 feet (15 m) in length with a [[radiating aperture]] of 20 by 20 feet (6 by 6 m) and is constructed of [[aluminum]]. The antenna's elevation wheel, which surrounds the midsection of the horn, is 30 feet (10 m) in diameter and supports the weight of the structure by means of rollers mounted on a base frame. All axial or thrust loads are taken by a large ball bearing at the narrow apex end of the horn. The horn continues through this bearing into the equipment building or cab. The ability to locate receiver equipment at the horn apex, thus eliminating the noise contribution of a connecting line, is an important feature of the antenna. A [[radiometry|radiometer]] for measuring the intensity of radiant energy is located in the cab.

The triangular base frame of the antenna is made from structural steel. It rotates on wheels about a center [[pintle]] ball bearing on a turntable track 30 feet (10 m) in diameter. The track consists of stress-relieved, planed steel plates which are individually adjusted to produce a track which is flat to about 1/64&amp;nbsp;inch (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm). The faces of the wheels are cone-shaped to minimize contact friction. A tangential force of 100 pounds (400 N) is sufficient to start the antenna rotating on the turntable. The antenna beam can be directed to any part of the sky using the turntable for [[azimuth]] adjustments and the elevation wheel to change the [[elevation angle]] or altitude above the horizon.

With the exception of the steel base frame, which was made by a local steel company, the antenna was fabricated and assembled by the Holmdel Laboratory shops under the direction of Mr. H. W. Anderson, who also collaborated on the design. Assistance in the design was also given by Messrs. R. O'Regan and S. A. Darby. Construction of the antenna was completed under the direction of [[Arthur B. Crawford|A. B. Crawford]] from [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]], United States.

When not in use, the turntable azimuth [[sprocket]] drive is disengaged, allowing the structure to "weathervane" and seek a position of minimum wind resistance. The antenna was designed to withstand winds of 100 miles per hour (160&amp;nbsp;km/h) and the entire structure weighs 18 short tons (16 tonnes).

A plastic clapboarded utility shed 10 by 20 feet (3 by 6 m), with two windows, a double door and a sheet metal roof, is located on the ground next to the antenna. This structure houses equipment and controls for the antenna and is included as a part of the designation as a National Historic Landmark. The antenna has not been used for several decades.

==Technical==
This type of antenna is called a [[Horn antenna#Horn-reflector antenna|Hogg or horn-reflector antenna]], invented by Alfred C. Beck and [[Harald T.

A Hogg horn combines several characteristics useful for radio astronomy. It is extremely [[broadband|broad-band]], has calculable [[aperture efficiency]], and the walls of the horn shield it from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis. The back and [[sidelobe|side lobes]] are therefore so minimal that scarcely any thermal energy is received from the ground. Consequently, it is an ideal radio telescope for accurate measurements of low levels of weak background radiation. The antenna has a [[Antenna gain|gain]] of about 43.3 dBi and a beamwidth of about 1.5° at 2.39&amp;nbsp;GHz and an [[aperture efficiency]] of 76%.&lt;ref name="Crawford" /&gt;

==Ibadah==
In Arabic ''ibadah'' is connected with related words such as "Ubudiyyah" ("[[slavery]]"), and has connotations of obedience, submission, and humility. The word linguistically means "obedience with submission".&lt;ref&gt;al-Qamoos al-Muhit&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], ''ibadah'' is usually translated as "worship"  and means  obedience, submission, and devotion to [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Qur'an 51:56|url=http://quran.com/51/56}} [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-51/verse-56/ Quran Surah Adh-Dhaariyat ( Verse 56 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt;

Ibadat include what are known as the "[[Five Pillars of Islam|pillars of Islam]]": 
* profession of faith ([[Shahada|shahadah]]), translated as "''There is no god other than [[Allah]]. Muhammad is the messenger of [[Allah]]"'';&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* ritual prayer ([[Salah|salat]]), observed five times every day at prescribed times, with prescribed preparations (ritual cleaning), prescribed movements (standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting) and prescribed verses, phrases;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* alms giving ([[Zakat|zakah]]) -- customarily 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount  known as&amp;nbsp;''[[nisab]]'',&amp;nbsp;which is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions;&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt;
* fasting ([[Fasting in Islam|sawm]]) -- the obstention from eating and drinking during daylight hours -- especially during the&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic holy month]]&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;[[Ramadan]];&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; 
* pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] ([[hajj]])&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; -- the annual&amp;nbsp;[[Islam|Islamic]]&amp;nbsp;[[pilgrimage]] to the most holy city of the Muslims, and a&amp;nbsp;[[Fard|mandatory religious duty]]&amp;nbsp;for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult&amp;nbsp;[[Muslim|Muslims]]&amp;nbsp;who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey, and can support their family during their absence.  
According to Oxford Islamic Studies, "because they are of central importance to the Muslim community, the ibadat form the first subject matter of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and most collections of prophetic traditions ([[hadith]])."&lt;ref name="OIS" /&gt; The subject of ibadat is especially important in Islam (according to author Faleel Jamaldeen) because without these religious laws, "Muslims would likely create their own rituals and prayers, and the religion of Islam would falter and eventually disappear."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Islamic_Finance_For_Dummies.html?id=T7ImTjBd1gQC|title=Islamic Finance For Dummies|last=Jamaldeen|first=Faleel|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's IV&amp;V Program was established in 1993 as part of an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission critical software. NASA's IV&amp;V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle Challenger Accident].

Since then, NASA's IV&amp;V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&amp;V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&amp;V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&amp;V. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's primary business, software IV&amp;V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&amp;V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).

NASA's IV&amp;V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.

== Affiliations ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the ERC is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.

== Projects ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&amp;V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&amp;V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&amp;V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.

== Educator Resource Center ==
Thanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.  The on-site student outreach program brings over 2,000 youth to the facility annually to experience workshops on robotics, rocketry, aviation, and other STEM topics.  The ERC also runs numerous student STEM competitions in the fields of robotics and aviation.  Starting in 2012 the ERC became the partner for the FIRST LEGO League competition and has overseen a rapid growth in [http://WVRoboticsAlliance.org robotic competitions] that now include over 100 teams at 10 tournaments statewide each fall.

The '''International Research Center for Traditional Polyphony''' ('''IRCTP''' or '''Polyphonic Center''') is an academic organization focused on the study of the phenomenon of traditional [[vocal]] [[polyphony]]. It is a part of [[Tbilisi Vano Sarajishvili State Conservatory]]. Establishment of IRCTP was announced during the First International Symposium of Traditional Polyphony in 2002, and it was logistically established by the order of the Rector of [[Tbilisi State Conservatory]] in February 2003. Its director is Rusudan Tsurtsumia. The head of its International Bureau is [[Joseph Jordania]]. Central activity of the Polyphonic Center is organizing [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]], with subsequent publication of the presented papers, fostering dissemination of the knowledge on human musical cultures and establishing close professional contacts between ethnomusicologists interested in study of the phenomenon of traditional [[choral singing]].

==History ==
[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] has been known among ethnomusicologists as the country with extremely rich traditions of [[vocal]] [[polyphony]] since the 1920s. Study of vocal polyphony has been one of the central issues for Georgian ethnomusicology from the second half of the 19th century. In 1972 [[Union of Composers]] of [[Soviet Union]] organized the conference dedicated to traditional polyphony in Georgia (this was the very first conference in the world, fully dedicated to traditional polyphony). The ongoing series of [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|conferences]] dedicated to the problems of traditional polyphony, with the wide participation of the experts from Soviet Union, Europe and America, were organized in 1984, 1986 and 1988. The following conference (scheduled in 1990) was initially postponed and later canceled due to the political instability in post-soviet Georgia. The series of biannual conferences on traditional polyphony were revived in 1998 and 2000, leading to the organizing of the First International Symposium on Traditional Polyphony in 2002. The first symposium was preceded by proclamation of Georgian traditional polyphony among the '''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''' by [[UNESCO]] in 2001. Representative of '''UNESCO''' attended the Symposium, providing support of '''UNESCO'''. The Polyphonic Centre has been supported during the recent years by the Presidents of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and [[Mikhail Saakashvili]]. For several years the Polyphonic Centre was also supported by the Japanese government.
There has been a steady increase in interest towards the study of traditional [[polyphony]] ([[choral singing]]) during the recent years. In the 1970s there were two initial conferences organized on this subject, in the 1980s four conference, in the 1990s three conferences, and during the first decade of the 21st century nine conferences had been organized in several countries (apart from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in [[Taiwan]] in 2002, in Austria in 2005 and 2008, in [[Portugal]] in 2007). A centre for the study of European traditional polyphony was established at [[Vienna University]] in 2005, and the study group on multipart music of [[ICTM]] was established in 2009 and organized a conference in [[Sardinia]], Italy in 2010. The earliest international organization to dedicate its activity entirely to study of traditional choral singing was '''Polifonies Vivante''', organized in France during the 1991-1994 by [[Simha Arom]].

==International symposia==
[[International]] [[Academic conference|symposia]] on the problems of traditional polyphony had been organized biannually from 2002. The last one was held on September 26 - October 1, 2016. All of them had been organized in late September - early October, at the Tbilisi State Conservatory. The geography of representation of scholars from different countries of the world had been steadily increasing. A group of international expert-ethnomusicologists, including [[Simha Arom]] from France, Dieter Christensen from the United States, Franz Fodermayr from Austria, Polo Vallejo from Spain, had been participating in virtually every symposia, together with ethnomusicologists from different countries (including experts from China, Japan, Australia, Canada, eastern and western [[Europe]], [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]]. The general program of the symposia is stable and contains twelve themes, covering wide range of research topics, including problems of [[vocal]] and [[instrumental]] polyphony, [[Folk music|folk]] and [[church music]], regional styles, elements of [[musical language]], [[social]] and [[gender]] aspects, history, links with [[popular music]]al styles. Participating scholars are traditionally provided by the hosts with hotel accommodation, internal transport and food during the Symposium. In 2010 for the first time a special theme was added (''vocal polyphony is Asia''). 2012 symposium (September 24–29) had the special theme ''comparative research in traditional polyphony'', 2014 Symposium main theme was ''Polyphony in Minority Music'' (September 22–26, 2014), and 2016 symposium was dedicated to the geographic dynamics of traditional polyphony (September 26 - October 1, 2016). Next symposium is planning to a later date: October 29 - November 3, 2018.

==Publications==
The most important publication of the IRCTP is the [[proceedings]] of the [[biannual]] [[Academic conference|symposia]]. They are usually prepared under the editorship of Rusudan Tsurtsumia and [[Joseph Jordania]]. All the papers of the previous symposia are freely available on the website of the IRCTP on both Georgian and English languages &lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.polyphony.ge/en/proceedings/ Papers presented at the Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulletins are another periodic publication of the IRCTP &lt;ref&gt;[http://polyphony.ge/en/category/publications-2/bulletin/ Bulletins of the Polyphonic Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Centre also published several collections of the articles, including '''Seventeen Arguments on Georgian Polyphony''' and numerous audio and video materials.

[[File:CourtGavel.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Philosopher]]s of law ask "what is law, and what should it be?"]]

'''Jurisprudence''' or '''legal theory''' is the theoretical study of [[law]], principally by [[philosophy of law|philosophers]] but, from the twentieth century, also by [[social science|social scientists]]. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as [[jurist]]s or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of [[Reason#Logical reasoning methods and argumentation|legal reasoning]], [[list of national legal systems|legal systems]], [[Law#Legal institutions|legal institutions]], and the role of law in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/jurisprudence|title=Jurisprudence|last=Staff|first=LII|date=2007-08-06|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the [[natural law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and the [[Public international law|law of nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=Black's law dictionary|year=2009|publisher=West|location=Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA|isbn=0-314-19949-7|pages=Jurisprudence entry|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt; General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.&lt;ref name="Shiner"&gt;Shiner, "Philosophy of Law", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

This article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient [[#Natural law|natural law]], as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have.&lt;ref name="Shiner" /&gt; Secondly, 'clarificatory' or [[#Analytic jurisprudence|analytic jurisprudence]] rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"/&gt; It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, ''legal positivism'', holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts.&lt;ref name="Soper_CDoP"&gt;Soper, "Legal Positivism", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; And ''legal realism'' argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, [[#Normative jurisprudence|normative jurisprudence]] is concerned with "evaluative" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question "What is law?", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.

== Etymology ==
The English word is based on the Latin maxim ''jurisprudentia'': ''juris'' is the [[genitive]] form of ''jus'' meaning "law", and ''prudentia'' means "prudence" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd edition 1989&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when the word ''prudence'' had the meaning of "knowledge of or skill in a matter". The word may have come via the French ''jurisprudence'', which is attested earlier.

== History ==
Ancient Indian jurisprudence is available in various [[Dharmaśāstra]] texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mmak/resent_article/JusticeKatjusLec.pdf|title=ANCIENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE|first=Markandey|last=Katju|year=2010|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jurisprudence already had this meaning{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in [[Ancient Rome]] even if at its origins the discipline was a (''periti'') in the ''[[Ius|jus]]'' of ''[[mos maiorum]]'' (traditional law), a body of [[oral law]]s and customs verbally transmitted "by father to son". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.

Their sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive ''Institutiones'' (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of ''prudentes''. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and [[Sabinians]]. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.

After the 3rd century, ''Juris prudentia'' became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]] was born.

=={{Anchor|Natural law}}Natural law==
In its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.

Another approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.
# '''The Strong Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it is not properly called a "law" at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: ''[[Lex iniusta non est lex|lex iniusta non est lex']] (an unjust law is no law at all).'' 
# '''The Weak Natural Law Thesis''' holds that if a human law fails to be backed-up by decisive reasons, then it can still be called a "law", but it must be recognised as a defective law. 
Notions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that "an unjust law is no law at all", but as [[John Finnis]], the most important of modern natural barristers{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical [[Thomism|Thomist]] position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of [[justice]], beginning in the West with [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]].

===Aristotle===
[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]], by [[Francesco Hayez]]]]
Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Like his philosophical forefathers [[Socrates]] and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαίον φυσικόν'', [[Latin]] ''[[ius naturale]]''). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa, ''Thomism and Aristotelianism''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (= Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages,&lt;ref&gt;H. Rackham, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Loeb Classical Library; J. A. K. Thomson, trans. (revised by Hugh Tedennick), ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt; though more recent translations render them more literally.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sachs, trans., ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Focus Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls "political justice" derives from his discussion of "the just" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics" Bk. II ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term "justice" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence Irwin, trans. ''Nicomachean Ethics, 2nd Ed.'', Hackett Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them "just" in the sense of "general justice;" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue.&lt;ref&gt;"Nicomachean Ethics", Bk. V, ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt; "Particular" or "partial justice", by contrast, is the part of "general justice" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', Bk. V, ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref&gt;Shellens, "Aristotle on Natural Law," 75–81&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas]] was the most influential Western medieval legal [[scholar]]]]
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Thomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition, known as "Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis". He is the foremost classical proponent of [[natural theology]], and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The work for which he is best known is the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. One of the thirty-five [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many [[Institutions named after Thomas Aquinas|institutions of learning]] have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God's plan for the universe. Man needs this, for without it he would totally lack direction.
* Natural law is the "participation" in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason.
* [[Divine law]] is revealed in the scriptures and is God's positive law for mankind.
* [[Human law]] is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pojman]], ''Ethics'' ([[Belmont, California|Belmont]], [[California|CA]]: Wadsworth Publishing Company, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural law, of course, is based on "first principles":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''...&amp;nbsp;this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this&amp;nbsp;...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FS/FS094.html#FSQ94A2THEP1|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
{{Main|School of Salamanca|ius gentium}}
[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was perhaps the first to develop a theory of ''[[ius gentium]]'' (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text ''De iure belli ac pacis'' by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. James Brown Scott, cited in Cavallar, The Rights of Strangers: theories of international hospitality, the global community, and political justice since Vitoria, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.&lt;ref&gt;Koskenniemi: International Law and raison d'état: Rethinking the Prehistory of International Law in Kingsbury &amp; Strausmann, The Roman Foundations of the Law of Nations, p. 297–339&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Suárez]], regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of ''ius gentium''. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished ''ius inter gentes'' from ''ius intra gentes''. ''Ius inter gentes'' (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, ''ius intra gentes'', or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
In his treatise ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, (1651)]]'', Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a [[social contract]]arian&lt;ref&gt;Basically meaning: the people of a society are prepared give up some rights to a government in order to receive social order.&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a [[state of nature]] to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The [[English Civil War]] and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

===Lon Fuller===
{{Main|Lon L. Fuller}}
Writing after [[World War II]], Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.

===John Finnis===
{{Main|John Finnis}}
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other "side". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book ''[[Natural Law and Natural Rights]]'' (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.

=={{Anchor|Analytic jurisprudence}}Analytic jurisprudence==
{{Main|Analytic jurisprudence}}

Analytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be.&lt;ref name="Hart_1958"&gt;See H L A Hart, 'Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals' (1958) 71 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 593&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] famously argued in ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1739) [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ Etext] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820100015/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that people invariably slip between describing that the world ''is'' a certain way to saying therefore we ''ought'' to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we ''ought'' to do something merely because something ''is'' the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world ''is'' must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative ''ought'' questions.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: "What are laws?"; "What is ''the'' law?"; "What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?"; and "What is the relationship between law and morality?" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical School===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Carl von Savigny, ''On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence'' (Abraham A. Hayward trans., 1831)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.

===Sociological Jurisprudence===
{{Main|Sociology of Law}}
The effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, [[Hermann Kantorowicz]] and [[Eugen Ehrlich]]) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where [[Roscoe Pound]], for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, [[Julius Stone]] strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas.  In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.

===Legal positivism===
{{Main|Legal positivism}}
Positivism simply means that law is something that is "posited": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is ''just'' by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.
* What the law ''is'' ([[lex lata]]) - is determined by historical social practice (resulting in rules)
* What the law ''ought to be'' ([[lex ferenda]]) - is determined by moral considerations.

====Bentham and Austin====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham's]] utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the twentieth century]]
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham|John Austin (legal philosopher)}}
One of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for [[democracy]], and strong [[atheist]]. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]. Austin was the first chair of law at the new [[University of London]] from 1829. Austin's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer to "what is law?" was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref&gt;John Austin, ''The Providence of Jurisprudence Determined'' (1831)&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.

====Hans Kelsen====
{{Main|Hans Kelsen}}
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His [[Pure Theory of Law]] aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm ([[Grundnorm]])'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
{{Main|H. L. A. Hart}}
In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-876122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the professor of jurisprudence at [[Oxford University]], Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.

Rules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The "rule of recognition" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |title=The University of Edinburgh |access-date=24 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601221401/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/staff/neilmaccormick_51.aspx |archive-date=1 June 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published ''Institutions of Law'', 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and [[Joseph Raz]].

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called ''exclusive legal positivism'', and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled ''inclusive legal positivism'', a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.

====Joseph Raz====
{{Main|Joseph Raz}}
Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

Joseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979) Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;ch. 2, Joseph Raz, ''The Authority of Law'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal realism===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] was a self-styled legal realist]]
{{Main|Legal realism}}
Legal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include [[Roscoe Pound]], [[Karl N. Llewellyn|Karl Llewellyn]] and Justice [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]]). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Jurisprudence". West's Encyclopedia of American Law. Ed. Jeffrey Lehman, Shirelle
Phelps. Detroit: Thomson/Gale, 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt; The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of [[Axel Hägerström]].

Despite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including [[critical legal studies]], [[feminist legal theory]], [[critical race theory]], [[sociology of law]] and [[law and economics]].&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;[[Kristoffel Grechenig]] &amp; Martin Gelter, The Transatlantic Divergence in Legal Thought: American Law and Economics vs. German Doctrinalism, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1161168 ''Hastings International and Comparative Law Review 2008, vol. 31, p. 295–360''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical legal studies====
[[Critical legal studies]] are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered "the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective".&lt;ref name = Hunt86&gt;Alan Hunt, "The Theory of Critical Legal Studies," Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1986): 1-45, esp. 1, 5. See [http://ojls.oxfordjournals.org/content/6/1/1.extract]. DOI, 10.1093/ojls/6.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, "Critical Legal Studies", ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical rationalism===
[[Karl Popper]] originated the theory of [[Jurisprudence#critical rationalism|critical rationalism]]. According to [[Reinhold Zippelius]] many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, "daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, Rechtsphilosophie, 6. Aufl. 2011 Vorwort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal interpretivism===
{{Main|Interpretivism (legal)}}

Contemporary philosopher of law [[Ronald Dworkin]] has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, "Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin", ''Modern Law Review'', vol. 69 no. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'' (1986) [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin attacked [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no-one'' in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin's ''integrity theory of law'', has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''. But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
{{Main|Therapeutic jurisprudence}}

Consequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. [[Therapeutic jurisprudence]] ("TJ") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses [[social science]] methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.&lt;ref&gt;David B Wexler, Michael L Perlin, Michel Vols et al. 'Editorial: Current Issues in Therapeutic Jurisprudence' (2016) 16(3) ''QUT Law Review'' pp. 1-3. ISSN: Online- 2201-7275 https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/692/616&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{Anchor|Normative jurisprudence}}Normative jurisprudence==
{{Main|Political philosophy}}

In addition to the question, "What is law?", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or "evaluative" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to [[sanctions (law)|punishment]], and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.

===Virtue jurisprudence===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'']]
{{Main|Virtue jurisprudence}}
Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
{{Main|Deontological ethics}}
Deontology is "the theory of duty or moral obligation."&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

===Utilitarianism===

{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{See also|Lysander Spooner}}
Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for [[Utilitarianism (book)|utilitarian]] philosophy through the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ Utilitarianism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505231025/http://metalibri.incubadora.fapesp.br/portal/authors/m/john-stuart-mill/utilitarianism/ |date=5 May 2007 }} at Metalibri Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt;

===John Rawls===
{{Main|John Rawls|A Theory of Justice}}
John Rawls was an [[United States|American]] philosopher, a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and [[libertarian theories of law]].

'''Mathematical methods''' are integral to the study of '''electronics'''.

==Mathematics in Electronics==
Electronics Engineering careers usually include courses in [[Calculus]] (single and [[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]), [[Complex analysis|Complex Analysis]], [[Differential Equations]] (both [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[Partial differential equation|partial]]), [[Linear Algebra]] and [[Probability]]. [[Fourier Analysis]] and [[Z-transform|Z-Transforms]] are also subjects which are usually included in electrical engineering programs.

==Basic applications==
A number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks.  These include
*[[Faraday's law of induction]]: Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage (emf) to be "induced" in the coil. 
*[[Gauss's law|Gauss's Law]]:  The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity.
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law]]: the sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node or the sum of total current at a junction is zero
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]: the directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a circuit must be zero.
*[[Ohm's law]]: the voltage across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current flowing through it.at constant temperature.
*[[Norton's theorem]]: any two-terminal collection of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.
*[[Thevenin's theorem]]: any two-terminal combination of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.
*[[Millman's Theorem|Millman's theorem]]: the voltage on the ends of branches in parallel is equal to the sum of the currents flowing in every branch divided by the total equivalent conductance.
* See also [[Analysis of resistive circuits]].

Circuit analysis is the study of methods to solve linear systems for an unknown variable.

*[[Circuit analysis]]

==Components==
There are many electronic components currently used and they all have their own uses and particular rules and methods for use.

*[[Electronic components]]

==Complex numbers==
If you apply a voltage across a capacitor, it 'charges up' by storing the electrical charge as an electrical field inside the device. This means that while the voltage across the capacitor remains initially small, a large current flows. Later, the current flow is smaller because the capacity is filled, and the voltage raises across the device.

A similar though opposite situation occurs in an inductor; the applied voltage remains high with low current as a magnetic field is generated, and later becomes small with high current when the magnetic field is at maximum.

The voltage and current of these two types of devices are therefore out of phase, they do not rise and fall together as simple resistor networks do. The mathematical model that matches this situation is that of complex numbers, using an imaginary component to describe the stored energy.

==Signal analysis==
* [[Fourier analysis]]. Deconstructing a [[Wave|periodic]] waveform into its constituent frequencies; see also: [[Fourier theorem]], [[Fourier transform]].
* [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]].
*[[Information theory]]. Sets fundamental limits on how information can be transmitted or processed by any system.

[[File:Metapopulation (1).svg|thumb|Metapopulations are important in fisheries. The local population (1.) serves as a source for interbreeding with surrounding subspecies populations (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c).The populations are normally spatially separated and independent but spatial overlap during breeding times allows for [[gene flow]] between the populations.]]
A '''metapopulation''' consists of a group of spatially separated populations of the same [[species]] which interact at some level. The term metapopulation was coined by [[Richard Levins]] in 1969 to describe a model of [[population dynamics]] of insect pests in agricultural fields, but the idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially [[habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]]. In Levins' own words, it consists of "a population of populations".&lt;ref name=Levins1969&gt;{{citation  | last = Levins | first =  R.  | year = 1969  | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control  | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America  | volume = 15  | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metapopulation is generally considered to consist of several distinct populations together with areas of suitable habitat which are currently unoccupied. In classical metapopulation theory, each population cycles in relative independence of the other populations and eventually goes extinct as a consequence of demographic [[stochastic]]ity (fluctuations in population size due to random [[demographic]] events); the smaller the population, the more chances of inbreeding depression and prone to extinction.

Although individual populations have finite life-spans, the metapopulation as a whole is often stable because immigrants from one population (which may, for example, be experiencing a population boom) are likely to re-colonize habitat which has been left open by the extinction of another population. They may also emigrate to a small population and rescue that population from extinction (called the ''rescue effect''). Such a rescue effect may occur because declining populations leave niche opportunities open to the "rescuers".

The development of metapopulation theory, in conjunction with the development of [[source-sink dynamics]], emphasised the importance of connectivity between seemingly isolated populations. Although no single population may be able to guarantee the long-term survival of a given species, the combined effect of many populations may be able to do this.

Metapopulation theory was first developed for terrestrial ecosystems, and subsequently applied to the marine realm.&lt;ref name="Kritzer06"&gt;Kritzer, JP &amp; Sale, PF (eds) (2006) Marine metapopulations, Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries science, the term "sub-population" is equivalent to the metapopulation science term "local population". Most marine examples are provided by relatively sedentary species occupying discrete [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches of habitat]], with both local recruitment and recruitment from other local populations in the larger metapopulation. Kritzer &amp; Sale have argued against strict application of the metapopulation definitional criteria that extinction risks to local populations must be non-negligible.&lt;ref name="Kritzer06"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

Finnish biologist [[Ilkka Hanski]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] was an important contributor to metapopulation theory.

== Predation and oscillations ==

The first experiments with [[predation]] and [[spatial heterogeneity]] were conducted by [[Georgii Gause|G.F. Gause]] in the 1930s, based on the [[Lotka-Volterra equation]], which was formulated in the mid-1920s, but no further application had been conducted.&lt;ref name="Real91"&gt;Real, Leslie A. and Brown, James H. 1991. Foundations of Ecology: Classic papers with commentaries. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lotka-Volterra equation suggested that the relationship between predators and their prey would result in population [[oscillations]] over time based on the initial densities of predator and prey. Gause's early experiments to prove the predicted oscillations of this theory failed because the predator–prey interactions were not influenced by immigration. However, once immigration was introduced, the [[population cycle]]s accurately depicted the oscillations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra equation, with the peaks in prey abundance shifted slightly to the left of the peaks of the predator densities. Huffaker's experiments expanded on those of Gause by examining how both the factors of migration and spatial heterogeneity lead to predator–prey oscillations.

== Huffaker's experiments on predator–prey interactions (1958) ==

In order to study predation and population oscillations, Huffaker used mite species, one being the predator and the other being the prey.&lt;ref name=Huffaker1958&gt;{{citation  | last = Huffaker | first =  C.B.  | year = 1958  | title = Experimental Studies on Predation: Dispersion factors and predator–prey oscillations  | journal = Hilgardia  | volume = 27  | issue = 343  | pages = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up a controlled experiment using oranges, which the prey fed on, as the spatially structured habitat in which the predator and prey would interact.&lt;ref name=Legendre1989&gt;{{citation  | last1 = Legendre | first1 = P.  | last2 = Fortin | first2 = M.J.  | year = 1989  | title = Spatial pattern and ecological analysis  | journal = Plant Ecology  | volume = 80  | issue = 2  | pages = 107  | doi = 10.1007/BF00048036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Huffaker experienced difficulties similar to those of Gause in creating a stable predator–prey interaction. By using oranges only, the prey species quickly became extinct followed consequently with predator extinction. However, he discovered that by modifying the spatial structure of the habitat, he could manipulate the population dynamics and allow the overall survival rate for both species to increase. He did this by altering the distance between the prey and oranges (their food), establishing barriers to predator movement, and creating corridors for the prey to disperse.&lt;ref name="Real91"/&gt; These changes resulted in increased habitat patches and in turn provided more areas for the prey to seek temporary protection. When the prey would become extinct locally at one habitat patch, they were able to reestablish by migrating to new patches before being attacked by predators. This habitat spatial structure of patches allowed for coexistence between the predator and prey species and promoted a stable population oscillation model.&lt;ref name=Kareiva1987&gt;{{citation  | last = Kareiva | first =  P.  | year = 1987  | title = Habitat Fragmentation and the Stability of Predator–Prey Interactions  | journal = Nature  | volume = 326  | issue = 6111  | pages = 388  | doi = 10.1038/326388a0 |bibcode = 1987Natur.326..388K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term metapopulation had not yet been coined, the environmental factors of [[spatial heterogeneity]] and habitat patchiness would later describe the conditions of a metapopulation relating to how groups of spatially separated populations of species interact with one another. Huffaker's experiment is significant because it showed how metapopulations can directly affect the predator–prey interactions and in turn influence population dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, A. et al. 1997. Metapopulation Dynamics of a Persisting Predator–Prey system.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Levins model ==

Levins' original model applied to a metapopulation distributed over many patches of suitable habitat with significantly less interaction between patches than within a patch. Population dynamics within a patch were simplified to the point where only presence and absence were considered. Each patch in his model is either populated or not.

Let ''N'' be the fraction of patches occupied at a given time. During a time ''dt'', each occupied patch can become unoccupied with an extinction probability ''edt''. Additionally, 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''N'' of the patches are unoccupied. Assuming a constant rate ''c'' of [[propagule]] generation from each of the ''N'' occupied patches, during a time ''dt'', each unoccupied patch can become occupied with a colonization probability ''cNdt'' . Accordingly, the time rate of change of occupied patches, ''dN/dt'', is

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = cN(1-N) - eN.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is mathematically equivalent to the [[logistic function|logistic model]], with a carrying capacity ''K'' given by

: &lt;math&gt; K = 1 - \frac{e}{c}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and growth rate ''r''

: &lt;math&gt; r = c - e.\,&lt;/math&gt;

At equilibrium, therefore, some fraction of the species's habitat will always be unoccupied.

== Stochasticity and metapopulations ==

Huffaker's&lt;ref name="Huffaker1958" /&gt; studies of spatial structure and species interactions are an example of early experimentation in metapopulation dynamics. Since the experiments of Huffaker&lt;ref name="Huffaker1958"/&gt; and Levins,&lt;ref name="Levins1969" /&gt; models have been created which integrate stochastic factors. These models have shown that the combination of environmental variability (stochasticity) and relatively small migration rates cause indefinite or unpredictable persistence. However, Huffaker's experiment almost guaranteed infinite persistence because of the controlled immigration variable.

== Stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) ==

One major drawback of the Levins model is that it is [[deterministic]], whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are [[stochastic]]. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed [[habitats]], and the [[minimum viable population|viability of their populations]], i.e., how likely they are to become [[extinct]] in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A simple way to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the [[contact process (mathematics)|contact process]]. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for [[patch dynamics]]. At a given [[percolation threshold]], [[habitat fragmentation]] effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keymer J.E |author2=P.A. Marquet |author3=J.X. Velasco‐Hernández |author4=S.A. Levin | date=November 2000 |title=Extinction Thresholds and Metapopulation Persistence in Dynamic Landscapes|journal=The American Naturalist |volume=156 |pages= 478–4945 | doi=10.1086/303407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[conservation biology]] purposes, metapopulation models must include (a) the finite nature of metapopulations (how many patches are suitable for habitat), and (b) the [[probability theory|probabilistic]] nature of extinction and colonisation. Also, note that in order to apply these models, the extinctions and colonisations of the patches must be asynchronous.

== Microhabitat patches (MHPs) and bacterial metapopulations ==

[[Image:ecoli metapopulation.jpg|thumb|E. coli metapopulation on-chip.]]

By combining [[nanotechnology]] with [[landscape ecology]], a habitat landscape can be nanofabricated on-chip by building a collection of nanofabricated bacterial habitats, and connecting them by corridors in different topological arrangements and with nano-scale channels providing them with the local [[ecosystem service]] of habitat renewal. These landscapes of MHPs can be used as physical implementations of an [[adaptive landscape]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Keymer J.E. |author2=P. Galajda |author3=C. Muldoon R. |author4=R. Austin  |last-author-amp=yes | date=November 2006 |title=Bacterial metapopulations in nanofabricated landscapes|journal=PNAS |volume=103 |issue=46 |pages= 17290–295 |pmc= 1635019|doi=10.1073/pnas.0607971103 |bibcode=2006PNAS..10317290K |pmid=17090676}}&lt;/ref&gt; by generating a spatial mosaic of patches of opportunity distributed in space and time. The patchy nature of these fluidic landscapes allows for the study of adapting bacterial cells in a metapopulation system operating on-chip within a synthetic ecosystem. The metapopulation biology and [[evolutionary ecology]] of these bacterial systems, in these synthetic ecosystems, can be addressed using experimental [[biophysics]].

== Life history evolution ==
Metapopulation models have been used to explain life-history evolution, such as the [[ecological stability]] of [[Metamorphosis#Amphibian metamorphosis|amphibian metamorphosis]] in small [[vernal pools|vernal ponds]]. Alternative ecological strategies have evolved. For example, some salamanders forgo metamorphosis and sexually mature as aquatic [[Neoteny|neotenes]]. The seasonal duration of wetlands and the migratory range of the species determines which ponds are connected and if they form a metapopulation. The duration of the life history stages of amphibians relative to the duration of the vernal pool before it dries up regulates the ecological development of metapopulations connecting aquatic patches to terrestrial patches.&lt;ref name="Petranka07"&gt;{{Citation |last = Petranka |first = J.

'''Music acquisition''' is a theory or a term that has not yet been clearly or concisely defined, although there has been research done and attempts to prove that acquiring music, like language, is cognitively possible over time. Furthermore, the process of actually and gradually acquiring music has been carefully looked at yet not with enough information or cases to form a concrete definition or states with confidence that music acquisition is impossible or definitely possible. This theory itself is influenced by the concept and studies done on [[Language acquisition]] which is defined as the processes in which people acquire over time the cognitive ability to perceive and comprehend any language, but also, use and produce language as one form of expression. Some research conveys that the definition or attributes used for expression through language can also be used for expression through music or musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adrono|first1=T.

The '''Donders Centre for Cognition''' (former '''Nijmegen Institute for Cognition and Information''') is a [[research institute]] for [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] and [[information technology]]. It was founded in 1986 as an integral part of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] in The Netherlands.

The DCC maintains strong ties with the nearby Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging (former [[F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging]]) in, among other collaborations, a highly-interdisciplinary research master in cognitive neuroscience.

A '''pack hunter''' or '''social predator''' is a [[predator]]y [[animal]] which hunts its [[prey]] by working together with other members of its [[species]].&lt;ref name="Bshary"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bshary R., Hohner A., Ait-el-Djoudi K., Fricke H. | year=2006 | title=Interspecific communicative and coordinated hunting between groupers and giant moray eels in the Red Sea | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040431 | journal=[[PLOS Biology]] | volume=4 | page=431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally animals hunting in this way are closely related, and with the exceptions of humans and chimpanzees where only males normally hunt, all individuals in a family group contribute to hunting. When hunting cooperation is across two or more species, the broader term '''cooperative hunting''' is commonly used.

A well known pack hunter is the [[gray wolf]]; humans too can be considered pack hunters. Other pack hunting mammals include [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[lion]]s, [[dwarf mongoose|dwarf]] and [[banded mongoose]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s. Avian social predators include the [[Harris's hawk]], [[butcherbird]]s, three of four [[kookaburra]] species and many [[helmetshrike]]s. There are a few cold-blooded pack hunters including simple [[arthropods]] such as [[army ant]]s, the [[goldsaddle goatfish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Strübin | first1=Carine | last2=Steinegger | first2=Marc | last3=Bshary | first3=Redouan | year=2011 | title=On Group Living and Collaborative Hunting in the Yellow Saddle Goatfish (''Parupeneus cyclostomus'') | journal=Ethology | volume=117 | issue=11| pages=961–969 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01966.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally [[crocodilia|crocodiles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herpetology/herpbiology/bartram.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Pack hunting is typically associated with [[cooperative breeding]] and its concentration in the [[Afrotropical Region]] is a reflection of this.&lt;ref name="temporal"&gt;For a brief explanation see {{cite journal | last1=Rubenstein | first1=Dustin R. | last2=Lovette | first2=Irby J. | year=| title=Temporal Environmental Variability Drives the Evolution of Cooperative Breeding in Birds | journal=Current Biology | volume=17 | pages=1414–1419 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.032 | pmid=17702577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pack hunters are found in the southern African [[savanna]]s, with a notable absence in [[tropical rainforest]]s and with the exception of the wolf and [[coyote]], higher [[latitude]]s.&lt;ref name="temporal"/&gt; It is thought that either on the ancient and poor soils of the southern African savanna it is not possible for individual predators to find adequate food,&lt;ref&gt;See McMahon T. A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'' {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the environment’s inherent unpredictability due to [[El Niño Southern Oscillation|ENSO]]  or [[Indian Ocean Dipole|IOD]] events means that in very bad conditions it will not be possible to raise the young necessary to prevent declining populations from adult mortality. It is also argued that Africa's large area of continuous flat and open country, which was even more extensive while rainforest contracted during glacial periods of the Quaternary, may have helped encourage pack hunting to become much more common than on any other continent.&lt;ref&gt;Box, Hilary O.; Gibson, Kathleen R. (editors); ''Mammalian Social Learning: Comparative and Ecological Perspectives, Issue 72''; p. 266. {{ISBN|9780521031950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared pack hunting history is thought to be the main conduit through which [[humans]] formed a mutual relationship with dogs (that is, [[domestication]]), as both species are highly social and inter-dependent. Humans easily take over the dominance hierarchy of dogs as subordinates instinctively follow the “alpha” individual and dogs are accustomed to living very close together&lt;ref&gt;[[Jared Diamond|Diamond, Jared]]; ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]''; p. 155. {{ISBN|0393317552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of cooperative hunting ==
[[File:Transient Orcas (3727711709).jpg|thumb|Transient [[orca]]s]]

Understanding how cooperative hunting could evolve requires considering the circumstances that would make it beneficial.

=== Evolutionary models ===

==== Conventional model: Packer and Ruttan Game Theory ====
In 1988, the ecologists [[Craig Packer]] and Lore Ruttan surveyed the breadth of documented instances of cooperative hunting to make a [[evolutionary game theory|game-theoretical]] model to explain under what circumstances cooperative hunting evolves. In their model, individuals can choose one of four hunting strategies:&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''cooperator'' engages prey both when it is alone or with a companion.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[Cheating (biology)|cheater]]'' only engages when it is the first to find prey, but lets another individual make the kill if it arrives second.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''[[scavenger]]'' never hunts and waits for another individual to make a kill.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;
*A ''solitary'' avoids others and always hunts alone.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

Each of these strategies has a certain efficiency based on the size and number of prey that can be captured in a hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

The model shows that cooperative hunting for a single large prey is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS)—a strategy that an individual adopts because failure to do so reduces its fitness—only when solitary hunting is much less efficient. This is usually due to a prey species being too large to be taken down by an individual, meaning hunting efficiency is low and hunting cost is high. In this case, the increased benefit in hunting efficiency from cooperation must compensate for the division of available meat among cooperators. Furthermore, cooperatively hunting groups are prone to invasion by cheaters and scavengers who avoid the drawbacks of hunting, so the added benefit of cooperative hunting must also outweigh these costs. Otherwise, cheating and scavenging can also be evolutionarily stable strategies. The proportion of these strategies increases in larger groups, since only a certain number of individuals are required to help make the kill, allowing others to directly benefit without participating in the hunt.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

When a species hunts a single prey small enough to be monopolized by an individual, cooperative hunting is rarely ever an ESS since group members are in essence competing for a single meal. Unless individual prey tracking and capture efficiency is extremely low, solitary hunting is always be the dominant strategy since solitaries don't have to share their kill. Cheaters and scavengers never prosper in this situation, since the original captor monopolized all the food. The model predicts that the only way cooperative hunting is an ESS for single small prey is if the predators are already constrained to live in groups—so they must share what they get in order to keep the group stable.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

On the other hand, cooperative hunting is always an ESS when attacking multiple prey, both large and small. This is because cooperators no longer have to pay costs of dividing meat if they can each make their own kill. Another benefit is that when prey is sufficiently large it can be shared among cooperators if one member was unable to make a kill. Moreover, cheaters and scavengers only do well when hunting costs are very high, since they forgo the chance to get their own prey. In these parts of the model, cooperative hunting is always favorable, as long as there is some form of increase in net efficiency over solitary hunting. However, in their body of research, Packer and Ruttan found very few instances of this clear advantage over solitaries. They concluded that cooperative hunting in multiple prey situations is more likely to be a result of pre-existing social bonds rather than an evolutionary [[adaptation]], but that this hunting behavior is still important for establishing the social fabric of the group.&lt;ref name="Packer 1988" /&gt;

==== Revised model: Boesch's chimpanzees ====
[[File:Gombe Stream NP Mutter kletternd.jpg|thumb|upright|A female [[chimpanzee]] must carry her young through the trees, meaning it could be put in danger if she decides to pursue prey.]]

In 1994, [[Christophe Boesch]] condensed Packer and Ruttan's model to two basic conditions and added a crucial third component based on his study of chimpanzees (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') in the [[Taï National Park]] of [[Cote d'Ivoire]]:

#For hunting to evolve, in single individuals the rewards for hunting (meat intake) exceed the costs of hunting (energy used up, injury, illness).
#For cooperative hunting to evolve, in single hunters the net gain (benefits - costs) of hunting together exceed the net gain of hunting alone.
#For cooperative hunting to remain stable, there must be some mechanism to prevent cheaters and scavengers from taking an unfair portion of the meat. Following his study of the Taï chimpanzees, Boesch showed that the meat is distributed in a manner proportional to an individual’s contribution to the hunt.&lt;ref name="Boesch 1994"/&gt;  This social mechanism is thought to prevent cheaters from destabilizing the cooperative hunting paradigm by getting more than the net benefit of hunters.  Additionally, this meat-sharing behavior is not related to the social hierarchy of the group, suggesting that it depends solely on participation in the hunt.

Curiously, in female Taï chimpanzees, cheating has become an ESS because there are substantially more costs associated with hunting, including the risk of dropping infants from trees and injuring them. Therefore, it pays females to be a bystander rather than hunt; in fact, the male strategy allows the female strategy to be stable provided the males provision their female partner with food.

On the other hand, in the chimpanzees of [[Gombe Stream National Park]] in [[Tanzania]], cooperative hunting is not a stable strategy. The predator-prey interactions differ in Gombe chimpanzees in a way that has prevented cooperative hunting from evolving.  Both Taï and Gombe chimps hunt small [[red colobus]] monkeys that live in trees; however, the trees are much smaller at Gombe such that it is very easy for one chimp to capture its prey.  At Taï, the trees are much taller (by about 30–40 meters), and it thus takes a larger effort to capture the prey. This disparity in height would favor the evolution of cooperative hunting at Taï where multiple chimps can help one another out and not at Gombe where the benefits of cooperative hunting do not outweigh the costs of meat-sharing. In fact, single hunters gain much more meat than cooperative hunters in the Gombe population.  It is therefore plausible that cooperative hunting evolved at Taï as a response to the more difficult distribution of monkeys in taller trees.

The results above suggest that social living in chimps may not be a necessary prerequisite for the evolution of cooperative hunting; instead, the distribution of resources is a critical determining factor.

=== Importance of resource distribution ===

The distribution of prey species is often the determining factor for whether populations hunt cooperatively. When prey is abundant throughout a habitat, cooperative hunting is not an effective strategy.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; Solitary hunters can easily find food on their own and do not share their kill. This case arises when prey is small enough to be captured by an individual. In contrast, when patches of prey are focused in small areas of a habitat, predators are likely to live in groups to coordinate large attacks and kill more prey.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; This strategy illustrates the importance of group living in establishing cooperative hunting efforts. In this respect, cooperative hunting is not just a function of the species, but also of its environment. Consequentially, cooperative hunting most likely evolved in areas with scarce prey distribution, and patterns of this behavior are likely to vary with seasonal fluctuation of available resources.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt;

Even species that are normally considered solitary hunters have been shown to engage in cooperative hunting when the distribution of prey makes it difficult for solitary hunters to be successful. For example, in [[aplomado falcon]]s individuals generally hunt alone when searching for [[insect]]s, as these hunts are simple and these insects are easy to find. However, the aplomado falcons generally hunt cooperatively when targeting smaller [[rodent]]s and [[bird]]s, as these hunts are lengthy and require high-speed chases. Thus, the decision to hunt cooperatively is often dependent upon the resource distribution in certain species.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; 

=== Implications on sociality ===
When resources are distributed in a way that supports group living, populations may develop social groups. Cooperative hunting is often a major feature of these groups, and it has been theorized that it is a primary basis for the evolution of sociality in the order [[Carnivora]].&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; While alternate theories have concluded that cooperative hunting may not be as important of a factor as [[territory (animal)|territory]] sharing and mutual protection of [[offspring]], they still agree that it plays an important role in developing social groups.&lt;ref name="Packer 1990" /&gt; For example, as a result of cooperative hunting, aplomado falcons defend the nest together and share the food with offspring after the hunt.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; Cooperative hunting has thus proven to hold certain social groups together since it can be disadvantageous to hunt alone in particular situations. Future research may quantify the contribution of cooperative hunting to the evolution of sociality, as it is currently difficult to ascertain how much cooperative hunting is a cause or a consequence of social behavior.

== Adaptive significance ==
When an environment allows it, cooperative hunting can offer species a range of adaptive advantages not normally available through solitary hunting.

=== Adaptive advantages of cooperative hunting ===
There are two main goals to cooperative hunting in social carnivores: taking down large prey species through a coordinated effort and subsequently protecting their kill from scavengers.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; A common goal in cooperatively hunting pairs is to coordinate the separation of a mother and her offspring, facilitaing an easier kill that a solitary hunter could not make. Cooperative hunting is also important in species that prey on larger animals, such as [[African hunting dog]]s, as it allows them to make a kill in a safer, more efficient manner. After the kill has been made, the hunters restrict meat access to those involved in the hunt to protect their food from scavengers. This includes both strictly scavenging species and members of their own species who do not participate in the hunt. In these ways, cooperative hunting confers adaptive advantages by affording species a means to make more efficient kills and by ensuring they get the maximum amount of food possible from their kill.

Another advantage of cooperative hunting is that attacking in a group allows more opportunities to make a kill before the prey scatters and gets away.&lt;ref name="MacDonald" /&gt; There is also the potential to confuse the prey species so they may run into another hunter approaching from a different direction. Group attacks are particularly advantageous when prey live in concentrated groups, as hunters have a hard time tracking prey in territories outside the preferred habitat.

Higher success in prey capture has been demonstrated in wild dogs,&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt; [[bottlenose dolphins]] and other [[cetacea]]ns,&lt;ref name ="Gazda"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gazda S.K., Connor R.C., Edgar R.K., Cox F. | year=2005 | title=A division of labour with role specialization in group-hunting bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'') off Cedar Key, Florida | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume=272 | pages=135–140 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2937 | pmid=15695203 | pmc=1634948}}&lt;/ref&gt; falcons, and [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] due to cooperative hunting.  For example, aplomado falcons increase their efficiency of capture when hunting in pairs because the pairs are twice as successful as hunting alone.&lt;ref name="Hector" /&gt; As a result, the high overall success rate of cooperative hunting leads to higher per capita meat intake even in large groups.&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Watts, D. P.; Mitani J. C. | year=2002 | title=Hunting behavior of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda | doi=10.1023/a:1013270606320 | journal=International Journal of Primatology | volume=23 | pages=1–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics of group size ===
Many populations capable of forming cooperative hunting groups may not necessarily do so if their group is too small or too large for this behavior to be favorable. Group size is an important indicator of specific instances of cooperative hunting, as the prey must be large enough and the hunting group small enough to provide enough food for all individuals. Another important consideration is that when groups grow larger, there is a greater chance that individuals will engage in a cheater strategy. If there is consistently too much cheating in a group, individuals will prefer to hunt alone so they do not have to share their meal with [[free rider problem|freeloaders]].

There may be costs that set an upper limit on group size.&lt;ref name ="Creel 1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Creel, S. | year=1997 | title=Cooperative hunting and group size: assumptions and currencies | journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=54 | pages=1319–1324 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1997.0481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net benefits increase as a function of pack size, as more animals in a group are theoretically able to obtain more meat.  However, in African wild dogs, researchers found that the most common group size was not the group size that maximized net benefits.&lt;ref name="Creel 1997" /&gt; Instead, because larger packs must travel farther to get more food, there are travelling costs associated with larger groups. Thus, African wild dogs optimize a more appropriate currency: the amount of meat gained per dog per kilometer traveled, instead of the amount of meat gained per dog per day as the latter does not take into account the costs of hunting.  This research successfully demonstrates that varying ecological variables are responsible for the difference in optimum group size among cooperatively hunting animals.

== Animal roles in cooperative hunting ==
Division of labor, which involves each team member performing a subtask to complete an objective, has been found in many species. It has been shown that animals that forage and hunt cooperatively in groups often adopt specialized roles during a [[hunting|hunting event]], which can vary widely among different species.  Division of labor among cooperatively hunting species occurs along a continuum, ranging from species in which individuals never differentiate into specific roles to species in which individuals specialize into different roles that they always perform throughout their lifetime.

=== African wild dogs ===
[[File:Wild dog Lycaon pictus feeding.jpg|thumb|[[African wild dogs]] eating the spoils of their hunt]]

African wild dogs participate in an intense rally ceremony before hunting. Its function is to ensure that all the members are alert and ready to hunt. They then all trot together and participate in a chase during which they pursue and harass the prey.  Instead of immediately attacking the prey, which could result in small prey immediately fleeing and large prey forming a defensive pinwheel and charging, the dogs form a defensive formation. Despite their coordinated formation, there is no clear role specialization in this species, as all individuals perform essentially the same function.&lt;ref name="Creel 1995" /&gt;

[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|Canadian Gray Wolves surrounding a bison]]

===Alaskan wolves===
Co-operation between wolves in a pack is most visible in their hunting strategy, and is highly effective. A wolf pack may trail a herd of elk, caribou or other large prey for days, looking for an animal that displays any sign of weakness, before making its move. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the pack heads towards their prey, chasing it down and then surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mech, L. David |title=The wolves of Denali |date=2003 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0816629595 |pages=196–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the attack begins the wolves have specific roles in the hunt, based on age, gender and social standing, as well as its particular experience and abilities. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haber |first1=Gordon |last2=Holleman |first2=Marybeth |title=Among wolves : Gordon Haber's insights into Alaska's most misunderstood animal |date=2013 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=9781602232181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aplomado falcons ===

[[Aplomado falcon]]s monitor each other's movements during hunts. Males and females always perform the same task in every situation.  They begin perched together and the males initiate and give a sharp "chirp" vocalization to signal for the female to follow suit.  When chasing birds on the ground, the females follow right behind the birds in the bushes and the males swoop in from overhead to make the kill. Within these pairs, males and females are consistently assigned to a particular role.&lt;ref name ="Hector" /&gt;

=== Bottlenose dolphins ===

Individual role specialization has also been observed in bottlenose dolphins.  The bottlenose dolphins form groups of three to six. One dolphin acts as the “driver” and herds the fish in circles towards the “barrier dolphins” who are tightly grouped together to form a barrier.  The driver performs fluke-slaps to cause the fish to leap into the air.  As the fish begin to leap, the driver moves next to the barrier dolphins, who all catch the fish in the air with their mouths open. Stefanie Gazda and colleagues predict that this role specialization is more common in [[marine biology|marine]] than [[terrestrial animals|terrestrial]] animals due to a higher variability in prey diversity, [[biomass]], and predator mobility in the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name ="Gazda" /&gt; One specific type of cooperative feeding behavior is [[mud ring feeding]].

[[File:DOLPHIN FIGURE (1).jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.5|A team of [[dolphins]] each fill a specialized role to make fish jump in the air. In this vulnerable position, they are easy prey for the dolphin team. ]]

=== Lions ===
Cooperative hunting strategy in [[lions]] is based on groups of three to seven individuals split into two highly specialized roles, centers and wings, which coordinate their movement to encircle and ambush the prey. In a line of lions, the outside individuals, also known as the wings, first run out to the sides of the intended target while the center lies in an ambush position. As the wings slowly encircle their mark, they drive the prey towards the waiting center—often one of the older and heavier individuals in the group—who then pounces to make the kill. Each individual in the group learns its preferred role during youth, whether it be center or wing. A child does not necessarily perform the same position as its mother since it learns through observing other lionesses in the pride. Individuals have also been shown to perform positions other than their natural place depending on whether another individual has already filled their role. Despite this plasticity, hunting success is greatest when every individual in the group can perform its specialized role.&lt;ref name ="Stander"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Stander P.E. | year=1992 | title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=29 | pages=445–454 | doi=10.1007/bf00170175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chimpanzees ===
In Taï, chimpanzee, individuals participate as a driver, blocker, chaser, or ambusher.  Drivers follow the prey without trying to catch up with it.  Blockers place themselves in a tree to block the progression of the prey.  Chasers move quickly after the prey to catch up with it.  Finally, ambushers anticipate the escape route of the prey long enough in advance to force it back towards the chasers or down into the lower canopy.  Blocking and ambushing are thought to require much more cognitive effort in anticipating the future movements of the prey, and they are thus rewarded with a larger proportion of meat after a successful hunt. These two roles correlate positively with the age of the chimpanzee as the cognitive function necessary to perform these tasks is thought to increase with age. Furthermore, individuals can change roles during the same hunt or maintain their same role during the entire process.&lt;ref name ="Boesch 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Boesch C | year=2002 | title=Cooperative hunting roles among taï chimpanzees | journal=Human Nature | volume=13 | pages=27–46 | doi=10.1007/s12110-002-1013-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further examples ==
In addition to the well-documented examples of pack hunting in social carnivores, the behaviour is found in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

===Fossa===
[[File:Cryptoprocta ferox.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The usually solitary fossa sometimes hunts cooperatively.]]
[[Fossa (animal)|Fossa (''Cryptoprocta ferox'')]] are the first documented example of cooperative hunting in solitary species, as fossa are some of the least social carnivores.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  The fossa is the largest member of [[Madagascar]] [[mongoose]]s.  They are carnivorous, feeding mostly on small [[lemurs]] and [[tenrecs]].  Prey size may have been important for the evolution of cooperative hunting in fossa because one of their main sources of prey (larger lemurs) has recently gone extinct.  Larger lemurs (20-120 pounds), such as giant sloth lemurs, were abundant on Madagascar until 500–1500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Luhrs"  /&gt;  Cooperative hunting was common to take down a prey of this size.  However, since extinction was relatively recent, cooperative hunting may have persisted even after their prey size diminished.

===Spiders===
Stegodyphid spiders (Genus ''[[Stegodyphus]]'') have been shown to act cooperatively to trap and collect insect prey species.&lt;ref name ="Packer 1988" /&gt; These social arachnids cooperate both by spinning communal webs on which to catch prey and by moving together to catch large prey in the field, such as grasshoppers.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ward P.I., Enders M.M. | year=1985 | title="Conflict and Cooperation in the Group Feeding of the Social Spider" ''Stegodyphus mimosarum'' | journal=Behavior | volume=94 | pages=167–182 | doi=10.1163/156853985x00325}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spiders do not monopolize certain parts of the web, meaning any individual can use a variety of locations to lie in wait for prey. When prey is captured in the field, it usually requires at least two spiders to be brought back to the nest to be shared among the rest of the colony.

=== Humans ===
[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Hunting Buffalo - Walters 371940190.jpg|thumb|''Hunting Buffalo'' by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]], c. 1859]]

Research at Lamalera village in [[Indonesia]] has shown how cooperative hunting can develop in pre-industrial societies. This village relies on traditional whale hunting techniques for its livelihood.&lt;ref name="Alvard"/&gt;  Because whale hunting requires more than one individual, it benefits the villagers to hunt cooperatively. The hunting men cooperate either as crew members, corporate members, or craftsmen. Each performs a different duty and receives a different share of whale meat. Alvard echoes other research by suggesting that these shared norms of meat distribution sustains cooperative hunting and prevents the rise of cheaters.&lt;ref name ="Alvard"/&gt;

This research also details the importance of biological relatedness amongst a cooperative hunting group. [[Kin selection]] favours traits or behaviours that promote the survival of relatives. At Lamalera, only kin that are of the same lineage (that all descend from male relatives or all descend from female relatives) hunt together. The researchers suggest that this allows an unambiguous identification of the relatedness of other group members. 

=== Crocodylians ===
Research conducted by Vladmir Dinets has indicated that crocodylians regularly engage in cooperative hunting behavior, including highly-organized game drives. Behaviours noted by Dinets include forming tight "bait balls" when hunting fish and being able to anticipate the location and actions of other crocodiles without being able to see them for an ambush. Dinets suggests this may make crocodiles some of a small group of animals that can cooperate in such sophisticated ways.&lt;ref name="croc"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dinets, V. | year=2014 | title=Apparent coordination and collaboration in cooperatively hunting crocodilians | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=27 | pages=244–250 | doi=10.1080/03949370.2014.915432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groupers]] (''Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri'') and [[giant moray]] eels (''Gymnothorax javanicus'') provide compelling evidence for interspecific cooperative hunting.  Groupers visit moray eels at their resting places and provide visual signals (such as a head shake) to engage morays in the hunt. These associations are non-random and appear to be motivated by the hunger level of the groupers.  Groupers were able to capture prey five times more quickly with morays present because the eels could sneak through crevices and corner prey items; additionally, morays that hunted alone were never successful because they did not have a grouper present to lead them to the prey. Thus, the hunting success of groupers and giant moray eels is greater for both species than when hunting alone.&lt;ref name ="Bshary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vail"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vail, A.L.; Manica, A.; Bshary, R. |year=2013 |title=Referential gestures in fish collaborative hunting |journal=Nature Communications |volume=4 |pages=1765 |doi=10.1038/ncomms2781 |pmid=23612306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[PageRank]] algorithm has several applications in  biochemistry. ("PageRank" is an [[algorithm]] used in [[Google Search]] for ranking websites in their results, but it has been adopted for other purposes also. According to Google, PageRank works by "counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is," the underlying assumption being that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/competition/howgooglesearchworks.html|title=Facts about Google and Competition |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131332/https://www.google.com/competition/howgooglesearchworks.html|archivedate=4 November 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Application in analyzing protein networks ==

The relative importance-measuring property of the PageRank link analysis algorithm could be used to identify new possible drug targets in proteins.&lt;ref name="elso"&gt;Iván G, Grolmusz V (2011). "When the Web meets the cell: using personalized PageRank for analyzing protein interaction networks". Bioinformatics 27 (3): 405–7. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq680]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''PageRank-based algorithm could identify important protein targets''' in the pathogen organism better than a method considering only the number of incoming edges (in-degree) of a node in the metabolic network. The reason for this is that some already known, important protein targets do not have a high degree (are not hubs) and also, perturbing some hubs could result in unwanted physiological effects.&lt;ref&gt;Russell RB, Aloy P (2008). "Targeting and tinkering with interaction networks". Nat Chem Biol 4: 666–673.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18936751]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The clinical use of most antibiotics result in a mutation of the pathogen organism leading to their resistance against the drug. Therefore, development of new drugs is always needed. A potential first step in developing new drugs against currently threatening diseases (e.g. tubercolosis) is to find new drug targets in the causative agent of the disease, i.e. the pathogen microorganism, let it be either a bacterium, or a protozoan parasite. After finding the target protein in the bacterium (or protozoan parasite), one could design small molecular drug compounds that bind to the protein and inhibit it.

Public availability of biological network data&lt;ref&gt;Prasad TSK, Kandasamy K, Pandey A (2009). "Human protein reference database and human proteinpedia as discovery tools for systems biology". Methods Mol Biol 577: 67–79.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19718509]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zanzoni A, Montecchi-Palazzi L, Quondam M, Ausiello G, Helmer-Citterich M, et al. (2002). "Mint: a molecular interaction database". FEBS Lett 513: 135–140.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=FEBS+Lett+513%3A+135%E2%80%93140]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenarios I, Salwinski L, Duan XJ, Higney P, Kim SM, et al. (2002). "Dip, the database of interacting proteins: a research tool for studying cellular networks of protein interactions". Nucleic Acids Res 30: 303–305.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC99070/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farkas IJ, Korcsmaros T, Kovacs IA, Mihalik A, Palotai R, et al. (2011). "Network-based tools for the identification of novel drug targets". Sci Signal 4: pt3.[http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;4/173/pt3/DC1]&lt;/ref&gt; makes the process of searching for new drug targets easier than it was before. By using the available metabolic networks, it is possible to find important nodes with link analysis algorithms, like PageRank. In a recently published paper,&lt;ref name="hetedik"&gt;Bánky D, Iván G, Grolmusz V (2013). "Equal Opportunity for Low-Degree Network Nodes: A PageRank-Based Method for Protein Target Identification in Metabolic Graphs". PLoS ONE 8(1): e54204.[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054204]&lt;/ref&gt; biochemical reactions are treated as nodes of the metabolic network. In this directed network, reaction A has a directed edge towards reaction B if the product of the former enters the latter reaction as a substrate or co-factor.

To select important nodes that could serve as drug targets, we might think of selecting high in-degree nodes (hubs; nodes with many incoming edges). It was shown however[2], that targeting hub proteins with many vital functions may unintentionally harm the living cell as well. A PageRank-based scoring method could detect important nodes that are not hubs and therefore might be better drug targets.

The PageRank of a node A is the stationary limit probability distribution that the random walker is at node A.&lt;ref name="elso" /&gt; In its original application, the personalization vector w captured the personal interest of a web-surfer: interesting websites to a surfer appeared with a higher probability in the distribution given in vector w.&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt; In this metabolic network, w is personalized to proteins; w is larger for those proteins that appear in higher concentrations in the proteomics analysis of certain diseases. This personalized PageRank may identify other related proteins to the disease.&lt;ref name="elso" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt;

However, by using only the personalized PageRank to identify important nodes, hubs still get a high score on average.&lt;ref&gt;Fortunato S, Boguna M, Flammini A, Menczer F (2008). "Approximating pagerank from in-degree". Lecture Notes in Computer Science  4936: 59–71.[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-78808-9_6]&lt;/ref&gt; To find non-hub important nodes instead, we should consider scoring the nodes by their "relativized personalized PageRank"; i.e. their personalized PageRank scores over the number of edges pointing towards them (over their in-degree):
The relativized personalized PageRank (rPPR(v)) for a node v is given by:

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
rPPR(v)=\frac{PPageRank(v)}{d_v}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

where PpageRank(v) is the personalized PageRank score of node v, and d_(v) is its in-degree. It was shown, that by using this method, numerous already validated drug targets can be found (e.g. in the Mycobacterium tubercolosis), therefore, new, currently unknown targets might be detected as well.&lt;ref name="hetedik" /&gt;

'''Paleolimnology''' ({{lang-el|paleon}}=old, ''limne''=lake, ''logos''=study) is a scientific subdiscipline closely related to both [[limnology]] and [[paleoecology]].  Palaeolimnological studies are concerned with reconstructing the [[paleoenvironment]]s of inland waters ([[lake]]s and [[streams]]; [[freshwater]], [[brackish]], or [[saline water|saline]]) – and especially changes associated with such events as [[climatic change]], human impacts (e.g., [[eutrophication]], or [[acid rain|acidification]]), and internal ontogenic processes.

Paleolimnological studies are commonly based on meticulous analyses of [[sediment]] cores, including the [[Physical property|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]] and [[mineralogy|mineralogical]] properties of sediments, and diverse [[biology|biological]] records (e.g., fossil [[diatoms]], [[cladocera]], [[ostracodes]], [[molluscs]], [[pollen]], [[pigments]], or [[chironomid]]s). One of the primary sources for recent paleolimnological research is the Journal of Paleolimnology.

==History==

===Lake ontogeny===
Most early paleolimnological studies focused especially on the biological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]] of lakes, and the role of internal lake processes in directing lake development.  Although [[Einar Naumann]] had speculated that the productivity of lakes should gradually decrease due to leaching of catchment soils, [[August Thienemann]] suggested that the reverse process likely occurred.  Early midge records seemed to support Thienemann's view.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, I. R. 1987.  Chironomidae (Diptera) in paleoecology. Quaternary Science Reviews 6: 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson]] &amp; Wollack suggested that following an initial oligotrophic stage lakes would achieve and maintain a trophic equilibrium.  They also stressed parallels between the early development of lake communities, and the sigmoid growth phase of animal communities – implying that the apparent early developmental processes in lakes were dominated by colonization effects, and lags due to the limited reproductive potential of the colonising organisms.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;

In a classic paper, [[Raymond Lindeman]]&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R. L. 1942. The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23, 399–418.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined a hypothetical developmental sequence, with lakes progressively developing through [[Oligotrophic lake|oligotrophic]], [[mesotrophic lake|mesotrophic]], and [[eutrophic]] stages, before senescing to a [[dystrophic lake|dystrophic]] stage and filling completely with sediment. A climax forest community would eventually be established on the peaty fill of the former lake basin.  These ideas were further elaborated by [[Edward Smith Deevey, Jr.|Ed Deevey]],&lt;ref&gt;Deevey, E. S., Jr. 1955. The obliteration of the hypolimmon. Mem. Ist. Ital. Idrobiol., Suppl 8, 9–38.&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested that lake development was dominated by a process of morphometric [[eutrophication]].  As the [[hypolimnion]] of lakes gradually filled with sediments, [[oxygen]] depletion would promote the release of iron-bound [[phosphorus]] to the overlying water. This process of internal fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, further accelerating the in-filling process.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. 2006. Chironomid overview. pp.360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science, Vo1. 1, Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

Deevey and Lindemann's ideas were widely, if uncritically, accepted.  Although these ideas are still widely held by some limnologists, they were effectively refuted in 1957 by Deevey's student [[Daniel A. Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, D.A. 1957. On the sigmoid growth phase in the history of Linsley Pond. American Journal of Science 255: 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Whiteside&lt;ref&gt;Whiteside. M. C. 1983. The mythical concept of eutrophication. Hydrobiologia 103, 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt;  also criticized Deevey and Lindemann's proposal, and palaeolimnologists now consider that a host of external  factors are equally or more important as regulators of lake development and productivity.  Indeed, late-glacial climatic oscillations (e.g., the [[Younger Dryas]]) appear to have been accompanied by parallel changes in productivity, illustrating that 1) lake development is not a unidirectional process, and 2) climatic change can have a profound effect on lake communities.

==Limnic Environment==
[[Limnology]] is study of inland water bodies including: lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, wetlands and more.&lt;ref name="limnology book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander J|last2=Goldman|first2=Charles R|title=Limnology|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-07-023673-8|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological properties===

====Anthropogenic eutrophication, acidification, and climate change====
Interest in paleolimnology eventually shifted from esoteric questions of lake ontogeny to applied investigations of human impact. Torgny Wiederholm and Bill Warwick, for example, used [[chironomid]] fossils to assess the impacts of increased nutrient loading (anthropogenic [[eutrophication]]) on lake communities. Their studies reveal pronounced changes in the bottom fauna of North American and European lakes, a consequence of severe oxygen depletion in the eutrophied lakes.

From 1980 to 1990 the primary focus of paleolimnologists efforts shifted to understanding the role of human impacts ([[acid rain]]) versus natural processes (e.g., soil leaching) as drivers of [[pH]] change in northern lakes.&lt;ref&gt;Battarbee, R. W. 1984. Diatom analysis and the acidification of lakes. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 305: 451–477.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[pH]]-sensitivity of [[diatom]] communities had been recognised since at least the 1930s, when [[Friedrich Hustedt]] developed a classification for diatoms, based on their apparent pH preferences. [[Gunnar Nygaard (phycologist)|Gunnar Nygaard]] subsequently developed a series of diatom pH indices. By calibrating these indices to pH, [[Jouko Meriläinen]] introduced the first diatom-pH transfer function.  Using diatom and [[chrysophyte]] fossil records, research groups led by Rick Battarbee (UK), Ingemar Renberg (Sweden), Don Charles (US), John Kingston (US), and John Smol (Canada) were able to clearly demonstrate that many northern lakes had rapidly acidified, in parallel with increased industry and emissions.  Although lakes also showed a tendency to acidify slightly during their early (late-glacial) history, the pH of most lakes had remained stable for several thousand years prior to their recent, anthropogenic acidification.

In recent years palaeolimnologists have recognised that climate is a dominant force in aquatic ecosystem processes, and have begun to use lacustrine records to reconstruct [[paleoclimate]]s.  Sensitive records of climate change have been developed from a variety of indicators including, for example, paleotemperature reconstructions derived from [[chironomid]] fossils, and palaeosalinity records inferred from [[diatoms]].

==== Freshwater [http://extension.usu.edu/waterquality/whats-in-your-water/aquatic_macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates] ====
Freshwater macroinvertebrates ([[invertebrate]]s that can be see by naked eye; &gt; 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) are a very diverse group of small animals present in [[river]]s, streams, lakes and wetlands. These animals include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, annelids and arachnids. They comprise a functionally and taxonomically diverse group that plays an important role in linking the food web in the [[aquatic ecosystem]]. They serve as a main source of food for the fishes and they depend on different types of algae and bacteria for the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=J. Iwan|last2=Sayer|first2=Carl D.|title=DOES THE FISH–INVERTEBRATE–PERIPHYTON CASCADE PRECIPITATE PLANT LOSS IN SHALLOW LAKES?|journal=Ecology|date=August 2003|volume=84|issue=8|pages=2155–2167|doi=10.1890/02-0422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most aquatic macro-invertebrates are small while some are quite large such as freshwater crayfish. They are very sensitive to different physical and chemical conditions and respond to it accordingly due to their limited mobility. For example, their community will change when a pollutant enters into the water or due to the change of [[water quality]]. Therefore, the water body which is rich with a macro-invertebrate community can be used to provide an estimate of water body health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Marc|title=Water: Facts without Myths|journal=Water|date=7 August 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3–4|doi=10.3390/w1010003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Macro invertebrates termed "benthos" inhabit surfaces of vegetation, rocks and other aquatic sediments. They are widely distributed in the aquatic environment and present at a range of trophic levels. Most  macroinvertebrates taxa are dependent on a range of [[abiotic factor]]s and [[biotic factor]]s and therefore community structure can be used to represent the local ecosystem. These factors may be the availability and quality of food, [[pH]], [[temperature]], salinity, land use pattern and [[water flow]] etc. These factors are interconnected and influence each other. For example, any change in the land use affects the riparian vegetation that may be increased or decreased which changes the inputs into the aquatic ecosystem, affecting the abundance and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citejournal|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|last2=Gresens|first2=Susan|last3=Kenney|first3=Melissa|last4=Sutton-Grier|first4=Ariana|title=Benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality: The intersection of science and policy|journal=Terrestrial Arthropod Reviews|date=1 January 2009|volume=2|issue=2|pages=99–128|doi=10.1163/187498209X12525675906077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all of these reasons, macroinvertabrates are considered as one of the best indicators of water quality.

===== Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates =====
Taxonomic groups of macroinvertebrates vary in their tolerance to changes in the aquatic environment.

===== Macroinvertebrates as an indicator of [[water quality]] =====
Macroinvertebrateas are commonly and widely distributed in many types of water bodies and respond with a range of sensitivities to many kinds of stressors. They are commonly used for toxicity testing and ecological assessments in water bodies and many of them complete their life cycles in a single water body so they are exposed directly to physical, chemical, and biological stressors and they also integrate the long and short term changes. When a freshwater source is degraded, the most sensitive invertebrate species are lost initially, followed by species more tolerant to pollution.These species either sustain their existence or their number decreases in response to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=M.T|first1=Barbour|title=USEPA Rapid Bioassessment Protocols For Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, 1–35|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Macro-invertebrates are an essential part of the food chain. Their strategies for feeding can be clustered into several "functional feeding" groups. For example, shedders feed on leaves and woody materials, some depends on the vegetation growing in the water body. Examples of shredders are amphipods, isopods, freshwater crayfish, and caddisfly larvae.

==Paleoclimate proxies==
Paleoclimatology (or the study of past climates) uses proxy data in order to relate elements collected in modern-day samples to suggest the climatic conditions of the past.

===Sediment cores===
Sediment cores are one of the primary tools for studying paleolimnology because of the role in which lake and river sediments play in preserving biological information.&lt;ref name="sediment book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birks|first1=H. John. B.|last2=Lotter|first2=Andre F.|last3=Juggins|first3=Steve|last4=Smol|first4=John P.|title=Tracking Environmental Change Using Lake Sediments: Data Handling and Numerical Techniques|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-007-2744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolimnologists collect [[Core sample|sediment cores]] and observe various proxy indicators in order to reconstruct past limnology of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Some of these indicators include geochemical markers and isotopic data which are found within the various sections of the sediment core.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; In order to calibrate data, a group of around 40 or more calibration lakes are used to reconstruct what the conditions of a new core are likely to reflect.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; The use of these calibration lakes is necessary to identify dramatic differences in a newly collected core compared to normal variations which would be depicted in the calibration lakes. Through the use of sediment cores as a technique, paleolimnologists are able to use other proxies (such as pollen, charcoal, diatoms, chironomids, and other organic matter) in order to reconstruct the past climatic conditions of an area.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt; Lake sediment cores in particular offer a more comprehensive analysis of an area because of the continual accumulation of sediment as well as other organic matter like pollen and charcoal.

===Pollen records===
Pollen and spores can be analyzed within a lab setting to determine the family, genus, or species which the pollen grains belong. The overall taxonomic assemblage of pollen types reflects the surrounding vegetation of the lake.  [[Palynology|Pollen analysis]] is a major field in [[paleoecology]]. A range of statistical and qualitative treatment of pollen records can be used to reconstruct past vegetation and climate.&lt;ref name="sediment book"/&gt;

=== Diatoms ===
The taxonomic assemblages of [[diatom]]s reflect many aspects of the lake temperature, chemical, and nutrient environment.

=== Organic matter characteristics ===
Organic matter may be characterized in terms of 1) amount (accumulation rate, reflecting productivity), 2) origin (aquatic or terrestrial determined from the C:N ratio), 3) carbon isotopic composition (reflecting plant photosynthetic pathways of C3 vs C4 plants, and reflecting drought and/or aquatic productivity), 4) nitrogen isotopic composition (reflecting sources of nitrogen and nitrogen cycling). There are a range of biomarkers widely used, as well as compound-specific isotopic analyses.  [[Diagenesis]] is an important factor to consider in interpreting organic matter records.

===Chironomids===

==== [[Chironomids]] as a proxy of climate change: Paleolimnology and chironomids ====
One of the major factor that affects the flora and fauna of the earth is the change of climate at the local, regional and global scale. These changes are preserved over the period of time as a fossil record and through paleolimnological methods, these changes can be traced out and also helpful for the prediction of the future climate change. Chironomids are one of the best indicators of climate change. These are two winged flies and belongs to family Chironomidae with 500 to 15,000 species. Ecologically they are considered as [[Bottom feeder|bottom dwellers]] and are very responsive to any fluctuation in the surrounding environment. They are considered as a good indicator of [[salinity]], water depth, [[stream flow]], aquatic productivity, oxygen level, lake acidification, [[pollution]], [[Temperature|temperatur]]e, and overall [[ecosystem health]]. As the assemblage of chironomids is dependent on several [[environmental factor]]s, they can be easily related to those changing factors using a transfer function to connect a particular group of organisms to a specific [[environmental variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilyashuk|first1=Elena A.|last2=Ilyashuk|first2=Boris P.|last3=Tylmann|first3=Wojciech|last4=Koinig|first4=Karin A.|last5=Psenner|first5=Roland|title=Biodiversity dynamics of chironomid midges in high-altitude lakes of the Alps over the past two millennia|journal=Insect Conservation and Diversity|date=1 November 2015|volume=8|issue=6|pages=547–561|doi=10.1111/icad.12137|language=en|issn=1752-4598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake deposits have a rich diversity of fossilized insects that trace back to middle Paleozoic era and more abundance can be found in the Quaternary period.Among aquatic invertebrates, different families of aquatic fly larvae can be traced out in the lake sediments of Quaternary era. Among them, Chironomids are of greatest ecological importance due to their diverse habitat in the aquatic ecosystem, feeding habitat, important component in the food web and above all their usage as a plaeolimnological studies because their head capsule and feeding structures are fossilized in the lake sediments.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew S.|title=Paleolimnology : the history and evolution of lake systems|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195133530|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chironomids complete their larval stage in the water and its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] continues up to several years while adult life span is very short. They have an important role in the degradation of material in the aquatic ecosystem and serve as an important part of the food web during their whole life cycle.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smol|first1=edited by Reinhard Pienitz and Marianne S.V. Douglas and John P.|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|date=2004|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-2126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Climate change ====
According to [[IPCC]] (2007) reports one of the vital aspect of environment is the continuous climate change due several factors over the period of time which is influential in shaping the biodiversity.
Macroinvertebrates, especially chironomids have been considered as an important [[Indicator organism|indicator]] of the [[climate change]] especially temperature due to their presence in the abundance in the [[lake sediment]] as a fossil. There is a strong correlation between the chironomids assemblage and the water temperature, lake depth, salinity and, nutrients of the lake.Lake water levels over the past time period can be inferred from the chironomids assemblage due to their correlation.It is due to the fact that climate change resulted in the water level change of the lake that is related to change in the pattern of chironomids distribution and abundance.Their strong correlation helps to build the information about the evaporation and precipitation in the past. Past climate change is reconstructed based on the paleolimnology with the help of different [[fossilized]] records especially the lake sediments that helps to find out the regional and local climate change. It is important to differentiate between the impacts that a lake store due to the regional and local level [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; 

Recent studies in [[Arctic]] shows that [[biodiversity]] affect more due to the arctic warming than other associated factors like human alteration and [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RAHEL|first1=FRANK J.|last2=OLDEN|first2=JULIAN D.|title=Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species|journal=Conservation Biology|date=June 2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Himalayan region water bodies are not only affected by the anthropogenic disturbances but also impacted by the different types of pollutants that are transferred to this area over a longer distance.It is vital to understand all the associated factors acting on the aquatic biodiversity while analyzing the impact of climate change over the past years with the help of lake sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=C.M|last2=Sharma|first2=S|last3=Gurung|first3=S|last4=Bajracharya|first4=R.M|last5=Jüttner|first5=I|last6=Pradhan|first6=N.S|title=Global Climatic Change and High Altitude Lakes: Impacts on Aquatic Biodiversity and Pollution Status|journal=Natural Resources Management: Reviews and Research in the Himalayan Watersheds|date=2009|issue=44(977)|pages=103–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to consider that the impact and intensity of different changes due to climate change may have totally different affect on different [[ecosystems]] depending upon its sensitivity to that change &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beniston|first1=Martin|title=Climatic Change in Mountain Regions: A Review of Possible Impacts | journal=Climatic Change|date=2003|volume=59|issue=1/2|pages=5–31|doi=10.1023/A:1024458411589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Factors influencing chironomids distribution and abundance ====
There are several factors that has been affecting the abundance and distribution pattern of [[Chironomids]] over the past years.Therefore, it is important to be careful while making interpretations from their fossil records.There are several debates for the last many years on the impact of temperature on their abundance and diversity along with other associated factors. For the correct interpretation of the [[Fossil|fossil records]], it is important to understand all the associated factors of an ecosystem.In order to understand the different forces that have been affecting the [[fossil]] data of lake, it important to reconstruct [[Physical property|physical]], chemical and the [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient]] content of the lakes that actually shapes the communities.
Their distribution and abundance is highly influenced by the combination of human disturbance and change in the climate. Both of them influence the catchment area that resulted into the changing of [[Aquatic vegetation|vegetation]], [[hydrology]], and nutrients cycle. Any change at the regional level especially the temperature affects the water quality at the local scale and then at the end it affect the [[habitat]] that is species-specific.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

==== Chironomids and reconstruction of quantitative change in [[Holocene Epoch|Holocene climate]] ====
There is ongoing debate about the main factor that controls the distribution and abundance of chironomids.Several factors are considered as the controlling factor especially temperature that in turn control other supporting factors including Ph, [[salinity]], nutrient flow and productivity especially in the late [[Pleistocene]]/Holocene timer period. For many years research has been carried out on the relationship between temperature and chironomids distribution pattern due to its influence on its emergence. Chironomids are directly and indirectly affected by [[temperature]] during the whole life cycle including their larval emergence, growth, feeding and [[Insect reproduction|reproduction]].&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; According to Eggermont and Heiri (2012) there is indirect impact of temperature on different physic chemical aspects of water resulted into determination of their distribution and abundance. There is also a strong relationship between the chironomids abundance, [[emergence]] and distribution with the mean temperature of the air and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=Hilde|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|title=The chironomid-temperature relationship: expression in nature and palaeoenvironmental implications|journal=Biological Reviews|date=May 2012|volume=87|issue=2|pages=430–456|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00206.x|pmid=22032243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a research conducted by Gunten et al., 2007 at [[Lakes in Switzerland|high altitude lake]] Lej da la Tscheppain Switzerland, seasonal temperature reconstruction can be done with the help of independent chironomids and diatoms.Any change in the assemblage of chironomids reflects change in the temperature and duration of ice cover of that specific water body due to climate change. According to their findings, chironomids respond mostly to the change in the [[Temperature|summer temperature]], so seasonal variation in temperature can be inferred from different cores of the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Gunten|first1=Lucien|last2=Heiri|first2=Oliver|last3=Bigler|first3=Christian|last4=van Leeuwen|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Casty|first5=Carlo|last6=Lotter|first6=Andr?

'''Pan evaporation''' is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Standard methods ==
A variety of evaporation pans are used throughout the world. There are formulas for converting from one type of pan to another and to measures representative of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| quotes =| author =Bosman, HH| date =October 1990| year =| month =| title =Methods to Convert American Class A-Pan and Symon's Tank Evaporation to That of a Representative Environment| journal =[[Water SA]]| volume =16| issue =4| pages =227–236| issn =| pmid =| doi =| id =| url =http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| language =| format =| accessdate =| laysummary =| laysource =| laydate =| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080407063141/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| archivedate =2008-04-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, research has been done about the installation practices of evaporation pans so that they can make more reliable and repeatable measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Class A evaporation pan===
In the United States, the [[National Weather Service]] has standardized its measurements on the '''Class A evaporation pan''', a cylinder with a diameter of 47.5 in (120.7&amp;nbsp;cm) that has a depth of 10 in (25&amp;nbsp;cm). The pan rests on a carefully leveled, wooden base and is often enclosed by a chain link fence to prevent animals drinking from it.  Evaporation is measured daily as the depth of water (in inches) evaporates from the pan. The measurement day begins with the pan filled to exactly two inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) from the pan top. At the end of 24 hours, the amount of water to refill the pan to exactly two inches from its top is measured.

If precipitation occurs in the 24-hour period, it is taken into account in calculating the evaporation. Sometimes precipitation is greater than evaporation, and measured increments of water must be dipped from the pan. Evaporation cannot be measured in a Class A pan when the pan's water surface is frozen.

The Class A Evaporation Pan is of limited use on days with rainfall events of &gt;30mm (203mm rain gauge) unless it is emptied more than once per 24hours. Analysis of the daily rainfall and evaporation readings in areas with regular heavy rainfall events shows that almost without fail, on days with rainfall in excess of 30mm (203mm Rain Gauge) the daily evaporation is spuriously higher than other days in the same month where conditions more receptive to evaporation prevailed.

The most common and obvious error is in daily rainfall events of &gt;55mm (203mm rain gauge) where the Class A Evaporation pan will likely overflow.

The less obvious, and therefore more concerning, is the influence of heavy or intense rainfall causing spuriously high daily evaporation totals without obvious overflow.

=== Sunken Colorado pan ===
The '''sunken Colorado pan''' is square, 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) on a side and 0.5 m (18 in.) deep and made of unpainted galvanized iron.  As the name suggests, it is buried in the ground to within about 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2 in.) of its rim. Evaporation from a Sunken Colorado Pan can be compared with a Class A pan using conversion constants. The pan coefficient, on an annual basis, is about 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;

==Decreasing Trend of Pan Evaporation==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}

Over the last 50 or so years, pan evaporation has been carefully monitored.  For decades, pan evaporation measurements were not analyzed critically for long term trends. But in the 1990s scientists reported that the rate of evaporation was falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roderick, Michael L.  |author2=Graham D.

It is currently theorized that, all other things being equal,  as the [[global warming|global climate warms]] evaporation would increase proportionately and as a result, the [[hydrological cycle]] in its most general sense is bound to accelerate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck CLIMATE CHANGE: Is the Hydrological Cycle Accelerating? - Ohmura* and Wild 298 (5597): 1345 - Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401105008/http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck |date=2007-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The downward trend of pan evaporation has since also been linked to a phenomenon called [[global dimming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dimming_trans.shtml BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3310_sun.html NOVA | Transcripts | Dimming the Sun | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Wild et al. and Pinker et al. found that the "dimming" trend had reversed since about 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=154 | title=Global Dimming may have a brighter future | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories suggest that measurements have not taken the local environment into account. Since the local moisture level has increased in the local terrain, less water evaporates from the pan. This leads to false measurements and must be compensated for in the data analysis. Models accounting for additional local terrain moisture match global estimates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pages.jh.edu/news_info/news/home98/nov98/paradox.html | title=Environmental Engineers Unravel 'Evaporation Paradox' | accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lake Evaporation vs. Pan Evaporation==
Pan evaporation is used to estimate the evaporation from lakes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaporation from a natural body of water is usually at a lower rate because the body of water does not have metal sides that get hot with the sun, and while light penetration in a pan is essentially uniform, light penetration in natural bodies of water will decrease as depth increases.  Most textbooks suggest multiplying the pan evaporation by 0.75 to correct for this.[cite?]
&lt;!-- ==Ocean Evaporation vs. Pan Evaporation== 
Seems to be an inverse relationship ---&gt;

==Relationship to Hydrological Cycle==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}
"It is generally agreed that the evaporation from pans has been decreasing for the past half century over many regions of the Earth. However, the significance of this negative trend, as regards terrestrial evaporation, is still somewhat controversial, and its implications for the global hydrologic cycle remain unclear. The controversy stems from the alternative views that these evaporative changes resulted, either from global radiative dimming, or from the complementary relationship between pan and terrestrial evaporation. Actually, these factors are not mutually exclusive but act concurrently."

'''Passive fluency''' is where a person can [[Fluency|fluently]] read and audibly understand a [[language]] whilst not having the ability to fluently speak or write the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Leap | first= W. | date= 1988 | title= Indian language renewal | journal= Human Organization | publisher= | volume= 47 | issue= 4 | pages= 283–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive fluency is often brought about by being raised in one language (which becomes the person's passive language) and being schooled in another language (which becomes the person's native language).&lt;ref name = "basham"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Basham | first = Charlotte | last2 = Fathman | first2 = Ann | date = 19 December 2008 | title = The Latent Speaker: Attaining Adult Fluency in an Endangered Language | journal = International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 577–597 | doi = 10.1080/13670050802149192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are passively fluent in a language are often [[latent speakers]] who were raised in an environment where the language was spoken but did not become native speakers.&lt;ref name = "basham" /&gt;

==Language Attitudes regarding "Passive Bilinguals"==
A more common term for this phenomenon is 'passive bilingualism'. Grosjean argues that there has been a monolingual bias regarding who is considered a 'bilingual', where people who do not have equal competence in all their languages are judges not speaking properly. 'Balanced bilinguals' are, in fact, very rare, and the fluency of a bilingual in his/ her languages is domain- specific: it depends on what they need the languages for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grosjean|first1=François|title=Bilingual : Life and Reality|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Massachusetts|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that speakers may not admit to their fluency in their passive language, despite the fact that there are social (extralinguistic) factors underlying their different competencies.

==A Need for Passive Bilinguals in Basque Country==
Karlos Cid Abasolo discusses that passive bilingualism would be a minimum requirement for the co- official status of Basque and Spanish to become a working reality. As there are currently many monolingual Spanish speakers, and no monolingual Basque speakers, there is not yet a situation where an individual fluent in Basque could speak in his/ her mother tongue, regardless of the domain, circumstance  or interlocutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasolo|first1=Karlos Cid|title=Bilingüísmo, monolingüísmo y sesquilingüismo en la Comunidad Autónoma Vasca|journal=Revista de Filología Románica|date=2009|volume=26|pages=229–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">The '''Petersen matrix''' is a comprehensive description of systems of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] used to model [[chemical reactor|reactors]] for [[Biodegradability prediction|pollution control]] (engineered [[decomposition]]) as well as in [[environmental systems]]. It has got as many columns as the number of relevant involved components ([[chemicals]], [[pollutants]], [[biomass]]es, [[gases]]) and as many rows as the number of involved [[Chemical process|processes]] (biochemical reactions and physical degradation). One further column is added to host the description of the [[kinetics (chemistry)|kinetics]] of each transformation ([[rate equation]]).&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=David L.|title=Practical wastewater treatment|year=2006|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-471-78044-1|pages=288|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471780448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fang&gt;{{cite book|last=Fang|first=editor, Herbert H.P.|title=Environmental anaerobic technology : applications and new developments|year=2010|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|isbn=9781848165427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matrix structure ==
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all process } i:\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}\dot{\rho_j} = 0 \;,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric relation]].

Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{for all component } j: \frac{\partial C_j}{\partial t} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{ij} r_i \; ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; are the reaction rates of each process.

== Example ==
A system of a third [[Order of reaction|order reaction]] followed by a [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzyme reaction.

:&lt;chem&gt;
{A} + 2B -&gt; S
&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;
{E} + S &lt;=&gt;[k_f][k_r] ES -&gt;[k_\mathrm{cat}] {E} + P
&lt;/chem&gt;

where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S (S = AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
Production rates for each substance is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d [\ce A]}{d t} &amp;= -k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce B]}{d t} &amp;= -2 k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2
\\
\frac{d [\ce S]}{d t} &amp;= k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2 - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce E]}{d t} &amp;= - k_f[\ce E][\ce S] + k_r[\ce{ES}] + k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\\
\frac{d [\ce ES]}{d t} &amp;= k_f[\ce E][\ce S] - k_r[\ce{ES}] - k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]
\\
\frac{d [\ce P]}{d t} &amp;= k_\ce{cat}[\ce ES]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Petersen matrix reads as
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{Diagonal split header|Process | Components&lt;br/&gt;(kmol/m³)}} !! A !! B !! S !! E !! ES !! P !! Reaction rate  
|-
| P1: 2nd order formation of S from A and B || -1 || -2 || +1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_1[\ce A][\ce B]^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P2: Formation of ES from E and S|| 0 || 0 || -1 || -1 || +1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_f[\ce E][\ce S]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P3: Back decomposition of ES into E and S|| 0 || 0 || +1 || +1 || -1 || 0 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_r[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| P4: Forward decomposition of ES into E and P || 0 || 0 || 0 || +1 || -1 || +1 || &lt;math chem&gt; k_\ce{cat}[\ce{ES}]&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The Petersen matrix can be used to write the system's rate equation

:&lt;math chem&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix} 
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce A] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce B] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce S] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce E] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce{ES}] \\
     \frac{d}{d t}[\ce P]
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
    +1 &amp; -1 &amp; +1 &amp; 0  \\
    0 &amp; -1 &amp; +1 &amp; +1  \\
    0 &amp; +1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1  \\

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement – Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

“It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.”&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict management—preventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers — [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense — shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, “contracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international market”.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventive—and business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, “achievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calm”.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">The '''Ramsey–Lewis method''' is a method for defining terms found in [[theory|theoretical framework]]s (such as in [[scientific theory|scientific theories]]), credited to [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsey|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using this method, a set of theoretical terms appearing in a [[theory]] can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself.

==Overview==
A [[scientific theory]] which attempts to describe "[[electron]]s" is inherently abstract, as no one has ever observed an electron directly. Thus, the origin and content of the concept of "electron" is questionable. What does the word exactly signify? Ramsey and Lewis proposed that the meaning of the term "electron" is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it, via all its assertions about electrons. Electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true.

However, some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as "charge" or "spin". For instance, "Electrons attract [[proton]]s" and "Electrons have negative charge" employ the terms "protons" and "negative charge" (with the latter also implicitly using the concept of "charge"). These properties are formalized, statements (such as [[Causality|conditionals]]) are formed using them, and those statements taken together are the [[definition]] of the term.

Consider a sentence such as "There's an electron in the sink." This means something along the lines of: "There exist some properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ( one for every theoretical property involved in the scientific theory, with 'electronhood' (which roughly corresponds to the [[essence]] of an [[electron]] included as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) such that... (a statement in the scientific theory, but with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; substituted for the specific terms such as 'charge', 'is an electron', etc. employed by the theory), and there is something in the sink that has ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;."

The process of converting the narrative form of a scientific theory into [[second-order logic]] is commonly called "Ramsification" (sometimes also spelled "Ramseyfication").

Example: Suppose there are only three principles in our scientific theory about electrons (those principles can be seen to be statements involving the properties):

A1. Electrons (things that have P1) have charge (P2).

A2. Things with charge (P2) tickle you.

A3. Electrons (things that have P1) cause lightning.

Furthermore, we include the property of "electronhood", as outlined above, to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the property of "charge" to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Then the meaning of a sentence such as "I have an electron in my pocket" is Ramsified into:

"There are properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that (things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; also have ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tickle you, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cause lightning, and there is a thing with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in my pocket)."

{{Complex systems}}
In [[computer science]], '''robustness''' is the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/pts/testcom2005/FernandezMP05.pdf |title=A Model-Based Approach for Robustness Testing |website=Dl.ifip.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;1990. IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, IEEE Std 610.12-1990 defines robustness as "The degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions"&lt;/ref&gt; and cope with erroneous input.&lt;ref name="IEEE"/&gt; Robustness can encompass many areas of computer science, such as [[Defensive programming|robust programming]], [[Overfitting|robust machine learning]], and [[Robust Security Network]]. Formal techniques, such as [[fuzz testing]], are essential to showing robustness since this type of testing involves invalid or unexpected inputs. Alternatively, [[fault injection]] can be used to test robustness. Various commercial products perform robustness testing of software analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~bakerjw/Publications/Baker%20et%20al%20(2008)%20Robustness,%20Structural%20Safety.pdf |title=doi:10.1016/j.strusafe.2006.11.004 |website=Stanford.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
In general, building robust systems that encompass every point of possible failure is difficult because of the vast quantity of possible inputs and input combinations.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/robust-systems.pdf |format=PDF |title=Building Robust Systems an essay |author=Gerald Jay Sussman |date=January 13, 2007 |website=Groups.csail.mit.edu |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since all inputs and input combinations would require too much time to test, developers cannot run through all cases exhaustively. Instead, the developer will try to generalize such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph |first=Joby |url=http://www.softwaretestingclub.com/profiles/blogs/importance-of-making |title=Importance of Making Generalized Testcases - Software Testing Club - An Online Software Testing Community |publisher=Software Testing Club |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, imagine inputting some [[Integer (computer science)|integer values]]. Some selected inputs might consist of a negative number, zero, and a positive number. When using these numbers to test software in this way, the developer generalizes the set of all reals into three numbers. This is a more efficient and manageable method, but more prone to failure. Generalizing test cases is an example of just one technique to deal with failure—specifically, failure due to invalid user input. Systems generally may also fail due to other reasons as well, such as disconnecting from a network.

Regardless, complex systems should still handle any errors encountered gracefully. There are many examples of such successful systems. Some of the most robust systems are evolvable and can be easily adapted to new situations.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
Programs and software are tools focused on a very specific task, and thus aren't generalized and flexible.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; However, observations in systems such as the [[internet]] or [[biological system]]s demonstrate adaptation to their environments. One of the ways biological systems adapt to environments is through the use of redundancy.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Many organs are redundant in humans. The [[kidney]] is one such example. [[Human]]s generally only need one kidney, but having a second kidney allows room for failure. This same principle may be taken to apply to software, but there are some challenges.
When applying the principle of redundancy to computer science, blindly adding code is not suggested. Blindly adding code introduces more errors, makes the system more complex, and renders it harder to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.sc.edu/~huhns/journalpapers/V6N2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Building Robust Systems an essay |author=Agents on the wEb : Robust Software |website=Cse.sc.edu |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code that doesn't provide any reinforcement to the already existing code is unwanted. The new code must instead possess equivalent [[function (engineering)|functionality]], so that if a function is broken, another providing the same function can replace it, using manual or automated [[software diversity]]. To do so, the new code must know how and when to accommodate the failure point.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; This means more [[logic]] needs to be added to the system. But as a system adds more logic, [[Software component#Software component|components]], and increases in size, it becomes more complex. Thus, when making a more redundant system, the system also becomes more complex and developers must consider balancing redundancy with complexity.

Currently, computer science practices do not focus on building robust systems.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Rather, they tend to focus on [[scalability]] and [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]]. One of the main reasons why there is no focus on robustness today is because it is hard to do in a general way.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt;

== Areas ==

=== Robust programming ===
Robust programming is a style of programming that focuses on handling unexpected termination and unexpected actions.&lt;ref name="robust_programming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/secprog/robust.html |title=Robust Programming |website=Nob.cs.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires code to handle these terminations and actions gracefully by displaying accurate and unambiguous [[error message]]s. These error messages allow the user to more easily debug the program.

==== Principles ====
''Paranoia'' - When building software, the programmer assumes users are out to break their code.&lt;ref name="robust_programming" /&gt; The programmer also assumes that his or her own written code may fail or work incorrectly.&lt;ref name="robust_programming" /&gt;

''Stupidity'' - The programmer assumes users will try incorrect, bogus and malformed inputs.&lt;ref name="robust_programming" /&gt; As a consequence, the programmer returns to the user an unambiguous, intuitive error message that does not require looking up error codes. The error message should try to be as accurate as possible without being misleading to the user, so that the problem can be fixed with ease.

''Dangerous implements'' - Users should not gain access to [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[data structure]]s, or [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] to data structures.&lt;ref name="robust_programming" /&gt; This information should be hidden from the user so that the user doesn't accidentally modify them and introduce a bug in the code. When such [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] are correctly built, users use them without finding loopholes to modify the interface. The interface should already be correctly implemented, so the user does not need to make modifications. The user therefore focuses solely on his or her own code.

''[[Assertion (software development)|Can't happen]]'' - Very often, code is modified and may introduce a possibility that an "impossible" case occurs. Impossible cases are therefore assumed to be highly unlikely instead.&lt;ref name="robust_programming" /&gt; The developer thinks about how to handle the case that is highly unlikely, and implements the handling accordingly.

===Robust machine learning===
Robust machine learning typically refers to the robustness of machine learning algorithms. For a machine learning algorithm to be considered robust, either the testing error has to be consistent with the training error, or the performance is stable after adding some noise to the dataset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=El Sayed Mahmoud |url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_definition_of_the_robustness_of_a_machine_learning_algorithm |title=What is the definition of the robustness of a machine learning algorithm? |publisher=ResearchGate |date= |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robust network design===
Robust network design is the study of network design in the face of variable or uncertain demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-math.mit.edu/~olver/thesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=Robust Network Design |website=Math.mit.edu |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense, robustness in network design is broad just like robustness in software design because of the vast possibilities of changes or inputs.

Scan lines are important in representations of image data, because many [[image file format]]s have special rules for data at the end of a scan line. For example, there may be a rule that each scan line starts on a particular boundary (such as a byte or word; see for example [[BMP file format]]). This means that even otherwise compatible raster data may need to be analyzed at the level of scan lines in order to convert between formats.

[[File:Arctic ice.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Broken pieces of Arctic sea ice with a snow cover.]]
'''Sea ice''' arises as [[seawater]] freezes. Because [[ice]] is less [[density|dense]] than water, it floats on the ocean's surface (as does [[fresh water]] ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"&gt;{{cite web |title= How Does Arctic Sea Ice Form and Decay? |publisher= NOAA |work= Arctic theme page |url= http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |last=Wadhams |first=Peter |date=1 Jan 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2005 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306040652/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |archive-date=2005-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite book |first=Willy F. |last=Weeks |title=On Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S55O6WzuL8C&amp;pg=PA2 |date=2010 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=978-1-60223-101-6 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shokr&amp;Sinha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shokr |first1=Mohammed |first2=Nirmal |last2=Sinha |title=Sea Ice - Physics and Remote Sensing |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-1119027898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the world's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth's [[polar region]]s: the [[Arctic ice pack]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Antarctic ice pack]] of the [[Southern Ocean]]. Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent, a natural process upon which depends the [[Arctic ecology]], including the [[Arctic sea ice ecology and history|ocean's ecosystems]]. Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with [[iceberg]]s, which are chunks of [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] or [[glacier]]s that [[Ice calving|calve]] into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.

== General features and dynamics ==
[[File:Sea ice Drawing General features.svg|thumb|upright=2|Hypothetical sea ice dynamics scenario showing some of the most common sea ice features.]]
Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. Sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift, and according to its age.

=== Fast ice versus drift (or pack) ice ===
Sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between [[shoal]]s or to grounded [[iceberg]]s). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, [[fast ice]] (from ''fastened''). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, [[drift ice]] occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the ''fast ice boundary''. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a ''shear zone'', a ''marginal ice zone'' and a ''central pack''.&lt;ref name="Lepp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Matti |last=Leppr̃anta |title=The Drift Of Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJwub7E6VDcC |date=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drift ice consists of ''floes'', individual pieces of sea ice {{convert|20|m|ft}} or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: ''small'' – {{convert|20 to 100|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''medium'' – {{convert|100 to 500|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''big'' – {{convert|500 to 2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''vast'' – {{convert|2 to 10|km|mi}}; and ''giant'' – more than {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC&gt;{{harvnb|NSIDC All About Sea Ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"&gt;{{harvnb|Environment Canada Ice Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pack ice'' is used either as a synonym to ''drift ice'',&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; The overall sea ice cover is termed the ''ice canopy'' from the perspective of submarine navigation.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Classification based on age ===
Another classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age, that is, on its development stages. These stages are: ''new ice'', ''nilas'', ''young ice'', ''first-year'' and ''old''.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

==== New ice, nilas and young ice ====
[[File:Nilas Sea Ice.JPG|thumb|Nilas in [[Baffin Bay]]]]
''New ice'' is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of [[frazil ice]] (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), [[slush]] (water saturated snow), or ''shuga'' (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as [[grease ice]] and [[pancake ice]], are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves.

''Nilas'' designates a sea ice crust up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in thickness. It bends without breaking around waves and swells. Nilas can be further subdivided into ''dark nilas'' – up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and very dark, and ''light nilas'' – over {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and lighter in color.

''Young ice'' is a transition stage between nilas and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, Young ice can be further subdivided into ''grey ice'' – {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness, and ''grey-white ice'' – {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action. In a compression regime, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).

==== First-year sea ice ====
[[File:FYvsSYvsMY.svg|thumb|Distinction between 1st year sea ice (FY), 2nd year (SY), multiyear (MY) and old ice.]]
''First-year sea ice'' is ice that is thicker than ''young ice'' but has no more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the ''new ice — nilas — young ice'' stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The thickness of this ice typically ranges from {{convert|0.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; First-year ice may be further divided into ''thin'' ({{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}}), ''medium'' ({{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}) and ''thick'' (&gt;{{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{harvnb|WMO Sea-Ice Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old sea ice ====
''Old sea ice'' is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season (''i.e.'' one summer). For this reason, this ice is generally thicker than first-year sea ice. Old ice is commonly divided into two types: ''second-year ice'', which has survived one melting season, and ''multiyear ice'', which has survived more than one. (In some sources,&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; ''old ice'' is more than 2-years old.) Multi-year ice is much more common in the [[Arctic]] than it is in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadhams2"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Wadhams |title=Ice in the Ocean |date=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5699-296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea ice is land-locked.

=== Driving forces ===
While [[fast ice]] is relatively stable (because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed), [[Drift ice|drift (or pack) ice]] undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice's typically wide variety of landscapes. Wind is thought to be the main driving force along with ocean currents.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; The [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] and sea ice surface tilt have also been invoked.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; These driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone. An [[Drift ice|ice floe]] converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of ''compression'' at the boundary between both. The ice cover may also undergo a state of ''tension'', resulting in divergence and fissure opening. If two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact, this will create a state of ''[[shear (geology)|shear]]''.

=== Deformation ===
Sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features:&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; 1) [[Finger rafting|Rafted ice]], when one piece is overriding another; 2) [[Pressure ridge (ice)|Pressure ridges]], a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the ''keel'') and upward (to make the ''sail''); and 3) ''[[Hummock]]'', an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A ''shear ridge'' is a pressure ridge that formed under shear – it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by compression.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; A ''new ridge'' is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a ''weathered ridge'' is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; [[Stamukha|Stamukhi]] are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between [[fast ice]] and the drifting pack ice.

''Level ice'' is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation, and is therefore relatively flat.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Leads and polynyas ===
[[Lead (sea ice)|Leads]] and [[polynyas]] are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing, and provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for the wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear – they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes – even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger – two types are recognized: 1) ''Sensible-heat polynyas'', caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) ''Latent-heat polynyas'', resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Formation==
{{main|Sea ice growth processes}}
[[File:Seaice.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of sea ice forming near [[St. Matthew Island]] in the Bering Sea.]]

Only the top layer of water needs to cool to the freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drgjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Only+the+top+layer+of+water+needs+to+cool+to+the+freezing+point#v=onepage&amp;q=Only%20the%20top%20layer%20of%20water%20needs%20to%20cool%20to%20the%20freezing%20point&amp;f=false|title=Microclimate and Local Climate|last=Barry|first=Roger G.|last2=Blanken|first2=Peter D.|date=2016-05-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316652336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convection of the surface layer involves the top {{convert|100|–|150|m|abbr=on}}, down to the [[pycnocline]] of increased density.

In calm water, the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than {{convert|0.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called [[frazil ice|frazil or grease ice]]. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called ''nilas''. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet, a process called ''congelation'' growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.

In rough water, fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The uppermost layer of the ocean is [[supercooling|supercooled]] to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as [[grease ice]]. Frazil ice formation may also be started by [[snow]]fall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called [[pancake ice]]. These float on the [[ocean surface]], and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.

If sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level, sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow/sea water. This is particularly common around [[Antarctica]].

[[Russia]]n scientist [[Vladimir Wiese|Vladimir Vize]] (1886–1954) devoted his life to study the Arctic ice pack and developed the ''Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions Theory'', for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles. He applied this theory in the field in the [[Kara Sea]], which led to the discovery of [[Vize Island]].

==Yearly freeze and melt cycle==

[[Image:Arctic-ice-with-labels.png|thumb|Volume of arctic sea ice over time using a polar coordinate system draw method (time goes counter clockwise; one cycle per year)]]

The annual freeze and melt cycle is set by the annual cycle of solar insolation and of ocean and atmospheric temperature, and of variability in this annual cycle.

In the Arctic, the area of ocean covered by sea ice increases over winter from a minimum in September to a maximum in March or sometimes February, before melting over the summer. In the Antarctic, where the seasons are reversed, the annual minimum is typically in February and the annual maximum in September or October, and the presence of sea ice abutting the calving fronts of [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]] has been shown to influence glacier flow and potentially the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Chad A.|last2=Young|first2=Duncan A.|last3=Gwyther|first3=David E.|last4=Galton-Fenzi|first4=Benjamin K.|last5=Blankenship|first5=Donald D.|date=2018-09-06|title=Seasonal dynamics of Totten Ice Shelf controlled by sea ice buttressing|url=https://www.the-cryosphere.net/12/2869/2018/|journal=The Cryosphere|language=English|volume=12|issue=9|pages=2869–2882|doi=10.5194/tc-12-2869-2018|issn=1994-0416|via=|bibcode=2018TCry...12.2869G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massom|first=Robert A.|last2=Scambos|first2=Theodore A.|last3=Bennetts|first3=Luke G.|last4=Reid|first4=Phillip|last5=Squire|first5=Vernon A.|last6=Stammerjohn|first6=Sharon E.|date=2018|title=Antarctic ice shelf disintegration triggered by sea ice loss and ocean swell|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0212-1|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=558|issue=7710|pages=383–389|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0212-1|pmid=29899449|issn=0028-0836|via=|bibcode=2018Natur.558..383M}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growth and melt rate are also affected by the state of the ice itself. During growth, the ice thickening due to freezing (as opposed to dynamics) is itself dependent on the thickness, so that the ice growth slows as the ice thickens.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; Likewise, during melt, thinner sea ice melts faster. This leads to different behaviour between multiyear and first year ice. In addition, [[melt pond]]s on the ice surface during the melt season lower the [[albedo]] such that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to a feedback where melt is accelerated. The presence of melt ponds is affected by the [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the sea ice- i.e. whether meltwater can drain- and the [[topography]] of the sea ice surface, i.e. the presence of natural basins for the melt ponds to form in. First year ice is flatter than multiyear ice due to the lack of dynamic ridging, so ponds tend to have greater area. They also have lower albedo since they are on thinner ice, which blocks less of the solar radiation from reaching the dark ocean below.

Changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time. A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes' retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Satellite study of sea ice began in 1979, and became a much more reliable measure of long-term changes in sea ice. In comparison to the extended record, the sea-ice extent in the polar region by September 2007 was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950–1970 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6|last=Polyak |first=Leonid|author2=Richard B.

[[Arctic]] sea ice extent ice hit an all-time low in September 2012, when the ice was determined to cover only 24% of the Arctic Ocean, offsetting the previous low of 29% in 2007. Predictions of when the first [[Arctic sea ice decline#Ice-free summer|"ice free" Arctic summer]] might occur vary.

[[Antarctic sea ice]] extent gradually increased in the period of satellite observations, which began in 1979, until a rapid decline in southern hemisphere spring of 2016.

==Relationship to global warming and climate change==
[[File:Ponds on the Ocean, ICESCAPE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the [[Arctic]]. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two.]]
Sea ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species, particularly the [[polar bear]], whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the Earth's temperature gets warmer. Furthermore, the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool, since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment. At this, sea ice's relationship with global warming is cyclical; the ice helps to maintain cool climates, but as the global temperature increases, the ice melts, and is less effective in keeping those climates cold. The bright, shiny surface ([[albedo]]) of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. As the sea ice melts, its surface area shrinks, diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun's heat. As the ice melts it lowers the albedo thus causing more heat to be absorbed by the Earth and further increase the amount of melting ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |title=Albedo |work=Climate Education Modules for K-12 |publisher=NC State University |access-date=2017-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529115402/https://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |archivedate=29 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the size of the [[ice floes]] is affected by the seasons, even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice, and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool, this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming. As a result, the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the planet.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

Furthermore, sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. In the [[freezing]] process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice. This salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice, creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes. This concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water's [[density]], and this cold, denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator, while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles. This is referred to as "[[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] motion", and is a regularly occurring process.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Modelling==
In order to gain a better understanding about the variability, numerical sea ice models are used to perform [[Sensitivity analysis|sensitivity studies]]. The two main ingredients are the [[ice dynamics]] and the thermodynamical properties (see [[Sea ice emissivity modelling]], [[Sea ice growth processes]] and [[Sea ice thickness]]).

Many [[global climate model]]s (GCMs) have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the [[Ice-albedo feedback]] correctly. Examples include:
* The Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model is a numerical model of sea ice designed for climate studies and operational oceanography developed at [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. It is coupled to the ocean general circulation model OPA (Ocean Parallélisé) and is freely available as a part of the [[Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean]].
* The [[MIT General Circulation Model]] is a [[Global climate model|global circulation model]] developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] includes a package for sea-ice. The code is freely available there.
* The [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] develops the Community Sea Ice Model.
* The [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] has a project called Los Alamos Sea Ice Model. The project is [[open source]] and designed as a component of GCM, although it provides a standalone mode.
* The Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model developed at [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] uses an [[unstructured grid]].

The [[Coupled model intercomparison project]] offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean interface where the sea ice may occur.

In addition to global modeling, various regional models deal with sea ice. Regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for [[process study|process studies]].

==Ecology==
{{main|Sympagic ecology}}

Sea ice is part of the Earth's [[biosphere]]. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic organisms]] such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the [[Bald notothen]], fed upon in turn by larger animals such as [[Emperor penguins]] and [[Minke whales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |title=Sea Ice Ecology |website=Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment (SIPEX) |publisher=Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems CRC |accessdate=23 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320075657/http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |archive-date=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7275">'''Sperm-mediated gene transfer''' (SMGT) is a transgenic technique that transfers [[genes]] based on the ability of [[sperm cells]] to spontaneously bind to and internalize exogenous [[DNA]] and transport it into an oocyte during fertilization to produce genetically modified animals.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Exogenous DNA refers to DNA that originates outside of the organism. Transgenic animals have been obtained using SMGT, but the efficiency of this technique is low. Low efficiency is mainly due to low uptake of exogenous DNA by the spermatozoa, reducing the chances of fertilizing the oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In order to successfully produce transgenic animals by SMGT, the spermatozoa must attach the exogenous DNA into the head and these transfected spermatozoa must maintain their functionality to fertilize the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Genetically modified animals produced by SMGT are useful for research in biomedical, agricultural, and veterinary fields of study. SMGT could also be useful in generating animals as models for human diseases or lead to future discoveries relating to human gene therapy.

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Mechanism==

The method for SMGT uses the sperm cell, a natural vector of genetic material, to transport exogenous DNA. The exogenous DNA molecules bind to the cell membrane of the head of the sperm cell. This binding and internalization of the DNA is not a random event. The exogenous DNA interacts with the DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) that are present on the surface of the sperm cell.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Spermatozoa]] are naturally protected against the intrusion of exogenous DNA molecules by an inhibitory factor present in mammals’ seminal fluid. This factor blocks the binding of sperm cells and exogenous DNA because in the presence of the inhibitory factor, DBPs lose their ability to bind to exogenous DNA. In the absence of this inhibitory factor, DBPs on sperm cells are able to interact with DNA and can then translocate the DNA into the cell. Therefore, the seminal fluid must be removed from the sperm samples by extensive washing immediately after [[ejaculation]].&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; After the DNA is internalized, the exogenous DNA must be integrated into the genome. There are various mechanisms suggested for DNA integration, including integrating DNA at oocyte activation, at nucleus decondensation, or at the formation of the pronulcei, but all of these suggested mechanisms imply that the integration of DNA happens after the penetration of the sperm cell into the oocyte.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

==Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer Controversy==

Sperm-mediated gene transfer is considered controversial because despite the successes, it has not yet become established as a reliable form of genetic manipulation. Skepticism arises based on the assumption that evolutionary chaos could arise if sperm cells could act as vectors for exogenous DNA.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Reasonable assumption tells us that because reproductive tracts contain free DNA molecules, sperm cells should be highly resistant to the risk of picking up exogenous DNA molecules. SMGT has been demonstrated experimentally and followed the assumption that nature has barriers against SMGT. These barriers are not always absolute and could explain the inconsistent experimental outcomes of SMGT.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; If there are natural barriers against SMGT, then the successes may only represent unusual cases in which the barriers failed. Two barriers have been identified; the inhibitory factor in seminal fluid that prevents binding to foreign DNA molecules and a sperm endogenous nuclease activity that is triggered upon interaction of sperm cells with foreign DNA molecules.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; These protections give reason to believe that unintentional interactions between sperm and exogenous genetic sequences is kept to a minimal. These barriers allow for protection against the threat that every fertilization event could become a potentially mutagenic one.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

==Applications of Sperm-Mediated Gene Transfer==

=== Animal Transgenesis ===

Transgenic animals have been produced successfully using gene transfer techniques such as sperm-mediated gene transfer. Though this production has been successful, the efficiency of the process is low. Low efficiency of SMGT in the production of transgenic animals is mainly due to poor uptake of the exogenous DNA by the sperm cells, thus reducing the number of fertilized oocytes with transfected spermatozoa.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; From 1989 to 2004, there were over 30 claims for the production of viable transgenic animals using SMGT, but only about 25 percent of these demonstrated a transmission of the transgenes beyond the F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; This transmission is required in order to claim usable animal transgenesis. According to previous studies, numerous animal species, including mammals, birds, insects, and fish, have been found susceptible to SMGT techniques, thus indicating that SMGT has broad applicability across a wide variety of Metazoan species.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Currently, despite the low frequency of transmission of transgenes, the frequency of phenotype modifications and overall animal transgenesis has been as high as 80 percent in some experiments.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Gene Therapy ===

The potential use of sperm-mediated gene transfer for embryo somatic gene therapy is a possibility for future research. Embryo somatic gene therapy would be advantageous because there seems to be an inverse correlation between the age of the patient and the effectiveness of gene therapy. Therefore, the possibility of gene therapy treatment before irreversible damage occurs would be ideal.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A majority of the experiments that report successful SMGT provide evidence of post-fertilization transfer and maintenance of transgenes.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; SMGT has potential advantages of being a simple and cost-effective method of gene therapy, especially in contrast with pronuclear microinjection, another transgenic technique. Nevertheless, despite some successes and its potential utility, SMGT is not yet established as a reliable form of genetic modification.&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Split-brain''' is a lay term to describe the result when the [[corpus callosum]] connecting the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemispheres of the brain]] is severed to some degree. It is an association of symptoms produced by disruption of or interference with the connection between the hemispheres of the brain. The surgical operation to produce this condition ([[corpus callosotomy]]) involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat refractory [[epilepsy]]. Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the severity and violence of [[epileptic seizures]]. Before using callosotomies, epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.

After the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate perception, concepts, and impulses to act. Having two "brains" in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. When one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side did not). He also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shaken her violently, at which point his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand. However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, one hemisphere usually overrides the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Psychology Gateways to Mind and Behavior|publisher = |year = |isbn = 9781111833633|location = |pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When split-brain patients are shown an image only in the left half of each eye's visual field, they cannot vocally name what they have seen. This is because the image seen in the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain (see [[optic tract]]), and most people's speech-control center is on the left side of the brain. Communication between the two sides is inhibited, so the patient cannot say out loud the name of that which the right side of the brain is seeing. A similar effect occurs if a split-brain patient touches an object with only the left hand while receiving no visual cues in the right visual field; the patient will be unable to name the object, as each cerebral hemisphere of the primary [[somatosensory cortex]] only contains a tactile representation of the opposite side of the body. If the speech-control center is on the right side of the brain, the same effect can be achieved by presenting the image or object to only the right visual field or hand.

The same effect occurs for visual pairs and reasoning. For example, a patient with split brain is shown a picture of a chicken foot and a snowy field in separate visual fields and asked to choose from a list of words the best association with the pictures. The patient would choose a chicken to associate with the chicken foot and a shovel to associate with the snow; however, when asked to reason why the patient chose the shovel, the response would relate to the chicken (e.g. "the shovel is for cleaning out the chicken coop").&lt;ref&gt;http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/capsules/experience_bleu06.html&lt;/ref&gt;


== History ==

In the 1950's, research on people with certain brain injuries made it possible to suspect that the "language center" in the brain was commonly situated in the left hemisphere. One had observed that people with lesions in two specific areas on the left hemisphere lost their ability to talk, for example. [[Roger Sperry]] and his colleague pioneered research. In his early work on animal subjects, Sperry made many noteworthy discoveries.  The results of these studies over the next thirty years later led to Roger Sperry being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981. Sperry received the prize for his discoveries concerning the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. With the help of so-called "split brain" patients, he carried out experiments, and for the first time in history, knowledge about the left and right hemispheres was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Split Brain Experiments|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s Sperry was later joined by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] a psychobiology Ph.D. student in his work on split-brain research at [[Caltech]] in Pasadena, California. Even though Sperry is considered the founder of split-brain research, Gazzaniga's clear summaries of their collaborative work are consistently cited in psychology texts. In Sperry and Gazzaniga's "The Split Brain in Man" experiment published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1967 they wanted to explore the extent to which two halves of the human brain were able to function independently and whether or not they had separate and unique abilities. They wanted to examine how perceptual and intellectual skills were affected in someone with a split-brain. At Caltech, Gazzaniga worked with Sperry on the effects of split-brain surgery on perception, vision and other brain functions. The surgery, which was a treatment for severe epilepsy, involved severing the corpus callosum, which carries signals between the left-brain hemisphere, the seat of speech and analytical capacity, and the right-brain hemisphere, which helps recognize visual patterns. At the time this article was written, only ten patients had undergone the surgery to sever their corpus callosum ([[corpus callosotomy]]). Four of these patients had consented to participate in Sperry and Gazzaniga's research. After the corpus callosum severing, all four participants' personality, intelligence, and emotions appeared to be unaffected. However,the testing done by Sperry and Gazzaniga showed the subjects demonstrated unusual mental abilities. The researchers created three types of tests to analyze the range of cognitive capabilities of the split-brain subjects. The first was to test their visual stimulation abilities, the second test was a tactile stimulation situation and the third tested auditory abilities.

=== Visual test ===

The first test started with a board that had a horizontal row of lights. The subject was told to sit in front of the board and stare at a point in the middle of the lights, then the bulbs would flash across both the right and left visual fields. When the patients were asked to describe afterward what they saw, they said that only the lights on the right side of the board had lit up. Next when Sperry and Gazzaniga flashed the lights on the right side of the board on the subjects left side of their visual field, they claimed to not have seen any lights at all. When the experimenters conducted the test again, they asked the subjects to point to the lights that lit up. Although subjects had only reported seeing the lights flash on the right, they actually pointed to all the lights in both visual fields. This showed that both brain hemispheres had seen the lights and were equally competent in visual perception. The subjects did not say they saw the lights when they flashed in the left visual field even though they did see them because the center for speech is located in the brain’s left hemisphere. This test supports the idea that in order to say one has seen something, the region of the brain associated with speech must be able to communicate with areas of the brain that process the visual information.

=== Tactile test ===

In a second experiment Sperry and Gazzaniga placed a small object in the subject's right or left hand, without being able to see (or hear) it. Placed in the right hand, the isolated left hemisphere perceived the object and could easily describe and name it. However, placed in the left hand, the isolated right hemisphere could not name or describe the object. Questioning this result, the researchers found that the subjects ''could'' later match it from several similar objects; tactile sensations limited to the right hemisphere were accurately perceived but could not be verbalized. This further demonstrated the apparent location (or lateralization) of language functions in the left hemisphere.

=== Combination of both tests ===

In the last test the experimenters combined both the tactile and visual test. They presented subjects with a picture of an object to only their right hemisphere, and subjects were unable to name it or describe it. There were no verbal responses to the picture at all. If the subject however was able to reach under the screen with their left hand to touch various objects, they were able to pick the one that had been shown in the picture. The subjects were also reported to be able to pick out objects that were related to the picture presented, if that object was not under the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gazzaniga|first=Michael|title=The Split Brain in Man|journal=Scientific American|year=1967|volume=217|issue=2|pages=24–29|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1038/scientificamerican0867-24|accessdate=28 April 2014|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0867-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sperry and Gazzaniga went on to conduct other tests to shed light on the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere as well as auditory and emotional reactions as well. The significance of the findings of these tests by Sperry and Gazzaniga were extremely telling and important to the psychology world. Their findings showed that the two halves of the brain have numerous functions and specialized skills. They concluded that each hemisphere really has its own functions. One's left hemisphere of the brain is thought to be better at writing, speaking, mathematical calculation, reading, and is the primary area for language. The right hemisphere is seen to possess capabilities for problem solving, recognizing faces, symbolic reasoning, art, and spatial relationships.

Roger Sperry continued this line of research up until his death in 1994. Michael Gazzaniga still is researching the split-brain. Their findings have been rarely critiqued and disputed, however a popular belief that some people are more "right-brained" or "left-brained" has developed. In the mid 1980s Jarre Levy, a psychobiologist at the University of Chicago, had set out and been in the forefront of scientists who wanted to dispel the notion we have two functioning brains. She believes that because each hemisphere has separate functions that they must integrate their abilities instead of separating them. Levy also claims that no human activity uses only one side of the brain. In 1998 a French study by Hommet and Billiard was published that questioned Sperry and Gazzaniga's study that severing the corpus callosum actually divides the hemispheres of the brain. They found that children born without a corpus callosum demonstrated that information was being transmitted between hemispheres, and concluded that subcortical connections must be present in these children with this rare brain malformation. They are unclear about whether these connections are present in split-brain patients though. Another study by Parsons, Gabrieli, Phelps, and Gazzaniga in 1998 demonstrated that split-brain patients may commonly perceive the world differently from the rest of us. Their study suggested that communication between brain hemispheres is necessary for imaging or simulating in your mind the movements of others.  Morin's research on inner speech in 2001 suggested that an alternative for interpretation of [[commissurotomy]] according to which split-brain patients exhibit two uneven streams of self-awareness: a "complete" one in the left hemisphere and a "primitive" one in the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hock|first=Roger R.|title=Forty Studies that Changed Psychology: Explorations into the History of Research|publisher=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0-13-114729-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hemispheric specialization ==

The two hemispheres of the [[cerebral cortex]] are linked by the corpus callosum, through which they communicate and coordinate actions and decisions. Communication and coordination between the two hemispheres is essential because each hemisphere has some separate functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Juliet|title=The Neuroscience of Mindfulness|url=http://www.mindfulnet.org/page25.htm|publisher=Midfulnet|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right hemisphere of the cortex excels at nonverbal and spatial tasks, whereas the left hemisphere is more dominant in verbal tasks, such as speaking and writing. The right hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the left side of the body. In a cognitive sense the right hemisphere is responsible for recognition of objects and timing, and in an emotional sense it is responsible for empathy, humour and depression. On the other hand, the left hemisphere controls the primary sensory functions of the right side of the body and is responsible for scientific and maths skills, and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witelson|first=Sandra F|author2=Wazir Pallie|title=Left Hemisphere Specialization for Language in the Newborn|journal=Neuroanatomical Evidence of Asymmetry|year=1973|volume=96|issue=3|pages=641–646|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/context/96/3/641.extract|accessdate=28 April 2014|doi=10.1093/brain/96.3.641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of specialised brain function by an area remains under investigation. It is claimed that the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere is "analytic" or "logical" while the right hemisphere is "holistic" or "intuitive".&lt;ref&gt;http://bama.ua.edu/~st497/pdf/rightorleftbrain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many simple tasks, especially comprehension of inputs, require functions that are specific to both the right and left hemispheres and together form a one direction systematised way of creating an output{{clarify|date=June 2016}} through the communication and coordination that occurs between hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borod|first=Joan|author2=Fani Andelman |author3=Loraine K Obler |author4=James Tweedy |author5=Joan Wilkowitz |title=Right Hemisphere Specialization for the Identification of Emotional Words and Sentences|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=1992|volume=30|issue=9|pages=827–844|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(92)90086-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role of the corpus callosum ===

The corpus callosum is a structure in the brain along the [[longitudinal fissure]] that facilitates much of the communication between the two hemispheres and its main function is in allowing for communication between the brain's right and left hemispheres. This structure is composed of [[white matter]]: millions of [[axon]]s that have their [[dendrite]]s and [[terminal button]]s projecting in both the right and left hemisphere. However, there is evidence that the corpus callosum may also have some inhibitory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Shea R. P. | authorlink2 = Michael Corballis, Corballis  | year = 2003 | title = Binocular rivalry in split-brain observers | url = http://journalofvision.org/3/10/3 | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 610–615 | doi=10.1167/3.10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-mortem research on human and monkey brains show that the corpus callosum is functionally organised. It proves that the right hemisphere is superior for detecting faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooshagian|first=Eric|title=Anatomy of the Corpus Callosum reveals its Function|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2008|volume=28|issue=7|pages=1535–1536|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5426-07.2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation results in modality-specific regions of the corpus callosum that are responsible for the transfer of different types of information. Research has revealed that the anterior midbody transfers motor information, the posterior midbody transfers somatosensory information, the isthmus transfers auditory information and the splenium transfers visual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Risse GL, Gates J, Lund G, Maxwell R, Rubens A | year = 1989 | title = Inter-hemispheric transfer in patients with incomplete section of the corpus callosum: anatomic verification with magnetic resonance imaging | url = | journal = Arch Neurol | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 437–43 | doi=10.1001/archneur.1989.00520400097026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although much of the interhemispheric transfer occurs at the corpus callosum, there are trace amounts of transfer via subcortical pathways.

Studies of the effects on the visual pathway on split-brained patients has revealed that there is a redundancy gain (the ability of target detection to benefit from multiple copies of the target) in simple reaction time. In a simple response to visual stimuli, split-brained patients experience a faster reaction time to bilateral stimuli than predicted by model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corballis M. C. |author2=Corballis P. M. |author3=Fabri M. | year = 2003 | title = Redundancy gain in simple reaction time following partial and complete callosotomy | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 71–81 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(03)00152-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A model proposed by Iacoboni et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iacoboni M. |author2=Fried I. |author3=Zaidel E. | year = 1994 | title = Callosal transmission time before and after partial commissurotomy | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 2521–2524 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199412000-00029}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests split-brained patients experience asynchronous activity that causes a stronger signal, and thus a decreased reaction time. Iacoboni also suggests there exists dual attention in split-brained patients, which is implying that each cerebral hemisphere has its own attentional system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arguin M. |author2=Lassonde M. |author3=Quattrini A. |author4=Del Pesce M. |author5=Foschi N. |author6=Papo I. | year = 2000 | title = Divided visuo-spatial attention systems with total and anterior callosotomy | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 283–291 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach taken by Reuter-Lorenz et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reuter-Lorenz P.

It is important to note that the simple reaction time in split-brained patients, even with enhanced redundancy gain, is slower than the reaction time of normal adults.

=== Functional plasticity ===

Following a stroke or other injury to the brain, functional deficiencies are common. The deficits are expected to be in areas related to the part of the brain that has been damaged; if a stroke has occurred in the motor cortex, deficits may include paralysis, abnormal posture, or abnormal movement synergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nudo R. J. |author2=Plautz E. J. |author3=Frost S. B. | year = 2001 | title = Role of adaptive plasticity in recovery of function after damage to motor cortex. [Review] | url = | journal = Muscle &amp; Nerve | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1019 | doi=10.1002/mus.1104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant recovery occurs during the first several weeks after the injury. However, recovery is generally thought not to continue past 6 months. If a specific region of the brain is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be transferred and taken over by a neighbouring region. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies; however, much more plasticity can be seen in infant patients receiving a [[hemispherectomy]], which suggests that the opposite hemisphere can adapt some functions typically performed by its opposite pair. In a study done by Anderson, it proved a correlation between the severity of the injury, the age of the individual and their cognitive performance. It was evident that there was more neuroplasticity in older children, even if their injury was extremely severe, than infants who suffered moderate brain injury.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005 1374–1382"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Vicki|author2=Cathy Catroppa |author3=Sue Morse |author4=Flora Haritou |author5=Jeffrey Rosenfeld |title=Functional Plasticity or Vulnerability after Early Brain Injury|journal=Pediatrics|year=2005|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1374–1382|doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some incidents of any moderate to severe brain injury, it mostly causes developmental impairments and in some of the most severe injuries it can cause a profound impact on their development that can lead to long-term cognitive effects. In the aging brain, it is extremely uncommon for neuroplasticity to occur; "olfactory bulb and hippocampus are two regions of the mammalian brain in which mutations preventing adult neurogenesis were never beneficial, or simply never occurred" (Anderson, 2005).&lt;ref name="Anderson 2005 1374–1382"/&gt;

=== Corpus callosotomy ===

[[Corpus callosotomy]] is a surgical procedure that sections the corpus callosum, resulting in either the partial or complete disconnection between the two hemispheres. It is typically used as a last resort measure in treatment of intractable [[epilepsy]]. The modern procedure typically involves only the anterior third of the corpus callosum; however, if the epileptic seizures continue, the following third is lesioned prior to the remaining third if the seizures persist. This results in a complete callosotomy in which most of the information transfer between hemispheres is lost.

Due to the functional mapping of the corpus callosum, a partial callosotomy has less detrimental effects because it leaves parts of the corpus callosum intact. There is little functional plasticity observed in partial and complete callosotomies on adults, the most neuroplasticity is seen in young children but not in infants.&lt;ref name="Concha 2006 1090–1099"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Concha|first=Luis|author2=Donald Gross |author3=Matt Wheatley |author4=Christian Beaulieu |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Time-Dependent Axonal and Myelin Degradation after Corpus Callosotomy in Epilepsy Patients|journal=NeuroImage|year=2006|volume=32|issue=3|pages=1090–1099|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.04.187 |pmid=16765064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that when the corpus callosum is severed during an experimental procedure, the experimenter can ask each side of the brain the same question and receive two different answers. When the experimenter asks the right visual field/left hemisphere what they see the participant will respond verbally, whereas if the experimenter asks the left visual field/right hemisphere what they see the participant will not be able to respond verbally but will pick up the appropriate object with their left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raven|first=Peter|title=Biology|year=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780073383071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===

It is known that the right and the left hemisphere have different functions when it comes to memory. The right hemisphere is better at being able to recognise objects and faces, recall knowledge that the individual has already learned, or recall images already seen. The left hemisphere is better at mental manipulation, language production, and semantic priming but was more susceptible to memory confusion than the right hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe 1995 157–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Janet|author2=Margaret Funnell |author3=Michael Gazzanuga |title=Right-Hemisphere Memory Superiority:Studies of Split-brain Patient|journal=Psychological Science|year=1995|volume=6|issue=3|pages=157–164|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00325.x|jstor=40063008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main issue for individuals that have undergone a callosotomy is that because the function of memory is split into two major systems, the individual is more likely to become confused between knowledge they already know and information that they have only inferred.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe 1995 157–164"/&gt;

In tests, memory in either hemisphere of split-brained patients is generally lower than normal, though better than in patients with amnesia, suggesting that the forebrain commissures are important for the formation of some kinds of memory. This suggests that posterior callosal sections that include the hippocampal commissures cause a mild memory deficit (in standardised free-field testing) involving recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Tramo MJ, Baynes K, Fendrich R, Mangun GR, Phelps EA, Reuter- Lorenz PA, Gazzaniga MS (1995): Hemispheric specialization and interhemispheric integration: Insights from experiments with commissurotomy patients. In: Epilepsy and the Corpus Callosum 2. Reeves AG, Roberts DW, eds. New York: Plenum, pp. 263-295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control ===

In general, split-brained patients behave in a coordinated, purposeful and consistent manner, despite the independent, parallel, usually different and occasionally conflicting processing of the same information from the environment by the two disconnected hemispheres. When two hemispheres receive competing stimuli at the same time, the response mode tends to determine which hemisphere controls behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Levy J, Trevarthen C (IC)76: Metacontrol of hemispheric function in human split-brain patients. J Exp Psvchol (HP&amp;P) 2:299-312 Reeves AG, Roberts DW, eds. (1995): Epilepsy and the Corpus Callosum 2. New York: Plenum&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, split-brained patients are indistinguishable from normal adults. This is due to the compensatory phenomena; split-brained patients progressively acquire a variety of strategies to get around their interhemispheric transfer deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mark L|title=Other Multiplicity|url=http://www.legiontheory.com/split-brain.html|publisher=Dr. Mark and Rana Manning|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue that can happen with their body control is that one side of the body is doing the opposite of the other side called the intermanual effect.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017|reason=Behavioural Brain Research

=== Attention ===

Experiments on covert orienting of spatial attention using the Posner paradigm confirm the existence of two different attentional systems in the two hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;Zaidel E (1994): Interhemispheric transfer in the split brain: Long term status following complete cerebral commissurotomy. In: Human Laterality, Davidson RH, Hugdahl K, eds.

== Case studies of split-brain patients ==

=== Patient W.J. ===
Patient W.J.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, A. D. (n.d.). Discovering the unique individuals behind split-brain patient anonymity. Doctoral dissertation, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, NC. Retrieved from http://people.uncw.edu/puente/405/PDFpapers/Split-brain%20Patients.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was the first patient to undergo a full corpus callosotomy in 1962, after experiencing fifteen years of convulsions resulting from [[grand mal seizure]]s. He was a World War II paratrooper who was injured at 30 years old during a bombing raid jump over the Netherlands, and again in a prison camp following his first injury. After returning home, he began to suffer from blackouts in which he would not remember what he was doing or where, and how or when he got there. At age 37, he suffered his first generalised [[convulsion]]. One of his worst episodes occurred in 1953, when he suffered a series of convulsions lasting for many days. During these convulsions, his left side would go numb and he would recover quickly, but after the series of convulsions, he never regained complete feeling on his left side.

Before his surgery, both hemispheres functioned and interacted normally, his sensory and motor functions were normal aside from slight [[hypesthesia]], and he could correctly identify and understand visual stimuli presented to both sides of his visual field. During his surgery in 1962, his surgeons determined that no [[massa intermedia]] had developed, and he had undergone [[atrophy]] in the part of the right frontal lobe exposed during the procedure. His operation was a success, in that it led to decreases in the frequency and intensity of his seizures.

One of the experiments involving JW attempted to determine each hemisphere's ability to perform simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. On each trial, an arithmetic problem was presented in the center of the screen followed by a central cross hair. After studying the problem, a number posing as the answer was presented to each hemisphere exclusively by JW's vision fixated on a central cross hair. Probes (stimuli) were then presented for 150 ms to either the left visual field/right hemisphere (LVF/RH) or to the right visual field/left hemisphere (RVF/LH). The position of the probe fell outside any zone of naso-temporal overlap (binocular vision) to ensure that stimuli were perceived only by the hemisphere [[contralateral]] to the visual field of the stimuli. JW was instructed to press a certain key if the probe was the correct solution and another key if the probe was the incorrect solution. Results showed that the effects of visual field was significant with performance of the left hemisphere being better than that of the right hemisphere; the left hemisphere correctly chose the correct answer on all four arithmetic operations approximately 90% of the time while the right hemisphere was at chance. These results suggest left hemisphere specialisation for calculation.

J.W. was further tested to determine after-effects on his [[self-recognition]] and familiar facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Turk D. J. |author2=Heatherton T.

These images were ranging from 0–100% "JW", with the 0% images being of Dr. Michael Gazzaniga, and the 100% images being of J.W. himself. What researchers found supported the idea that there are cortical networks in the left hemisphere that play an important role in execution of the self-recognition process.

=== Patient VP ===

Patient VP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funnell M. G. |author2=Corballis P. M. |author3=Gazzaniga M.

Although the callosotomy was reported to be complete, follow-up MRI in 1984 revealed spared fibers in the rostrum and splenium. The spared rostral fibers constituted approximately 1.8% of the total cross-sectional area of the corpus callosum and the spared splenial fibers constituted approximately 1% of the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; VP's postsurgery intelligence and memory quotients were within normal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gazzaniga MS, Nass R, Reeves A, Roberts D | year = 1984 | title = Neurologic perspectives on right hemisphere language following surgical section of the corpus callosum | url = | journal = Semin Neurol | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 126–35 | doi=10.1055/s-2008-1041542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the experiments involving VP attempted to investigate systematically the types of visual information that could be transferred via VP's spared splenial fibers. The first experiment was designed to assess VP's ability to make between-field perceptual judgements about simultaneously presented pairs of stimuli. The stimuli were presented in varying positions with respect to the horizontal and vertical midline with VP's vision fixated on a central crosshair. The judgements were based on differences in colour, shape or size. The testing procedure was the same for all three types of stimuli; after presentation of each pair, VP verbally responded "yes" if the two items in the pair were identical and "no" if they were not. The results show that there was no perceptual transfer for colour, size or shape with binomial tests showing that VP's accuracy was not greater than chance.

A second experiment involving VP attempted to investigate what aspects of words transferred between the two hemispheres. The set up was similar to the previous experiment, with VP's vision fixated on a central cross hair. A word pair was presented with one word on each side of the cross-hair for 150 ms. The words presented were in one of four categories: words that looked and sounded like rhymes (e.g. tire and fire), words that looked as if they should rhyme but did not (e.g. cough and dough), words that did not look as if they should rhyme but did (e.g. bake and ache), and words that neither looked nor sounded like rhymes (e.g. keys and fort). After presentation of each word pair, VP responded "yes" if the two words rhymed and "no" if they did not. VP's performance was above chance and she was able to distinguish among the different conditions. When the word pairs did not sound like rhymes, VP was able to say accurately that the words did not rhyme, regardless of whether or not they looked as if they should rhyme. When the words did rhyme, VP was more likely to say they rhymed, particularly if the words also looked as if they should rhyme.

Although VP showed no evidence for transfer of colour, shape or size, there was evidence for transfer of word information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gazzaniga M. S. | year = 2000 | title = Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 7| pages = 1293–1326 | doi = 10.1093/brain/123.7.1293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the speculation that the transfer of word information involves fibres in the ventroposterior region of the [[splenium]]—the same region in which V.P. had callosal sparing. V.P. is able to integrate words presented to both visual fields, creating a concept that is not suggested by either word. For example, she combines "head" and "stone" to form the integrated concept of a tombstone.

=== Kim Peek ===
[[Kim Peek]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Treffert D. A. |author2=Christensen D. D. | year = 2006 | title = Inside the mind of a savant | url = | journal = Scientific American Mind | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 52–55 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0606-50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was arguably the most well-known [[savant syndrome|savant]]. He was born on November 11, 1951 with an enlarged head, [[encephalocele]], a malformed cerebellum, and an absence of a corpus callosum and both the anterior and posterior commissures. He was able to memorize over 9,000 books, and information from approximately 15 subject areas. These include: world/American history, sports, movies, geography, actors and actresses, the Bible, church history, literature, classical music, area codes/zip codes of the United States, television stations serving these areas, and step by step directions within any major U.S. city. Despite these abilities, he had an IQ of 87, was not diagnosed as autistic, and was unable to button his shirt, and had difficulties performing everyday tasks. The missing structures of his brain have yet to be linked to his increased abilities, but they can be linked to his ability to read pages of a book in 8–10 seconds. He was able to split his vision &lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;Brogaard, B. (2012, November 6). The superhuman mind: Split brains. Retrieved April 26, 2014, from Psychology Today website: http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/split-brains&lt;/ref&gt; so that each eye reads its corresponding page, allowing him to read both pages at once. He also had developed language areas in both hemispheres, something very uncommon in split-brain patients. [[Language]] &lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt; is processed in areas of the temporal lobe, most commonly on the left side of the head, and involves a [[contralateral]] transfer of information before the brain can process what is being read. In Peek's case, there was no transfer ability—this is what led to his development of language centers in each hemisphere. Many believe this is the reason behind his extremely fast reading capabilities.

While Peek did not undergo corpus callosotomy, he is considered a natural split-brain patient and is critical to understanding the importance of the corpus callosum. Kim Peek died in 2009.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

'''Tadesse Meskela''' is the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]] of Ethiopia and was featured in the documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]''. He is a proponent of [[Fair trade|fair-trade]], and speaks publicly in support of it around the world. 

He grew up in the countryside outside Addis Ababa, Bishoftu. Tadesse Meskela studied his way out of poverty and eventually made it to university. By the early 1990s he was working for the state Agricultural Bureau. He attended a two-month co-operative training placement in Japan and was inspired to develop a cooperative union system to help Ethiopian coffee farmers attain a fairer recompense for their produce. The Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union was established in 1999. In the year 2004, the union has facilitated the constructed of four new schools, seventeen additional classrooms, four health centres, two clean water supply stations, and in terms of dividends, $2 million has been given back to the farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7017">'''Virtual prototyping''' is a method in the process of product development. It involves using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-automated design]] (CAutoD) and [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) software to validate a design before committing to making a physical [[prototype]]. This is done by creating (usually 3D) computer generated geometrical shapes (parts) and either combining them into an "assembly" and testing different mechanical motions, fit and function. The assembly or individual parts could be opened in CAE software to simulate the behavior of the product in the real world.

==Background==
The product design and development process used to rely primarily on engineers' experience and judgment in producing an initial concept design. A physical prototype was then constructed and tested in order to evaluate its performance. Without any way to evaluate its performance in advance, the initial prototype was highly unlikely to meet expectations. Engineers usually had to re-design the initial concept multiple times to address weaknesses that were revealed in physical testing.

==Move towards virtual prototypes==
Today, manufacturers are under pressure to reduce time to market and optimize products to higher levels of performance and reliability. A much higher number of products are being developed in the form of virtual prototypes in which engineering simulation software is used to predict performance prior to constructing physical prototypes. Engineers can quickly explore the performance of thousands of design alternatives without investing the time and money required to build physical prototypes. The ability to explore a wide range of design alternatives leads to improvements in performance and design quality. Yet the time required to bring the product to market is usually reduced substantially because virtual prototypes can be produced much faster than physical prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = James C., Jr. | last1 = Schaaf | first2 = Faye Lynn | last2 =Thompson | title = Systems Concept Development with Virtual Prototyping | citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.2308 | conference = 29th conference on Winter simulation | pages = 941–947 | date = 1997 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = LaCourse | url = http://www.cadalyst.com/manufacturing/virtual-prototyping-pays-9774 | title = Virtual Prototyping Pays Off | journal = Cadalyst Magazine | date = May 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Tim | last = Ghazaleh | url = http://pcdandf.com/cms/images/stories/mag/0411/0411ghazaleh.pdf | title = Virtual Prototyping | journal = Printed Circuit Design &amp; Manufacture Magazine | date = November 1, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Von Thomas | last = Otto | url = http://www.digital-engineering-magazin.de/blaetterkataloge/2010_06/flash.html#/17/ | title = Endlich umfassend simulieren | journal = Digital Engineering | volume = 6/10 | date = July–August 2010 | access-date = 2010-10-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110102211840/http://www.digital-engineering-magazin.de/blaetterkataloge/2010_06/flash.html#/17/ | archive-date = 2011-01-02 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End-to-end prototyping==
End-to-end prototyping accounts fully for how a product or a component is manufactured and assembled, and it links the consequences of those processes to performance. Early availability of such physically realistic virtual prototypes allows testing and performance confirmation to take place as design decisions are made; enabling the acceleration of the design activity and providing more insight on the relationship between manufacturing and performance than can be achieved by building and testing physical prototypes.  The benefits include reduced costs in both design and manufacturing as physical prototyping and testing is dramatically reduced/eliminated and lean but robust manufacturing processes are selected.&lt;ref&gt;Fouad El Khaldi, Raymond Ni, Pierre Culiere, Peter Ullrich, Carlos Terres Aboitiz. [http://www.esi-group.com/products/crash-impact-safety/virtual-performance-solution-1/white-papers/Technical_paper_Virtual_Prototyping_Automotive.pdf "Recent Integration Achievements in Virtual Prototyping for the Automo bile Industry"]. ''ESI-group.com''; ESI Group.

==Effects==
The research firm Aberdeen Group&lt;!-- Until there's a name change filed, we use corporate name, not marketing name--&gt; reports that best-in-class manufacturers, who make extensive use of simulation early in the design process, hit revenue, cost, and launch date and quality targets for 86% or more of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Aberdeen Group (October 2006). [http://www.reden.nl/bestanden/Aberdeen_Simulation_Driven_Design.pdf "Simulation-Driven Design Benchmark Report: Getting It Right the First Time"]. p. i. October 2006.  Retrieved 2010-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Best-in-class manufacturers of the most complex products get to market 158 days earlier with $1.9 million lower costs than all other manufacturers. Best-in-class manufacturers of the simplest products get to market 21 days earlier with $21,000 fewer product development costs.&lt;ref&gt;Aberdeen, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Fisker Automotive]] used virtual prototyping to design the rear structure and other areas of its Karma plug-in hybrid to ensure the integrity of the fuel tank in a rear end crash as required for [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] (FMVSS) 301 certification.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://articles.sae.org/11735/ Fisker reduces number of prototypes, cuts time to market with Virtual Performance Solution]," ''Automotive Engineering International'', January, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agilent Technologies]] used virtual prototyping to design cooling systems for the calibration head for a new high-speed [[oscilloscope]].&lt;ref&gt;Matt Richter, "[http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2013/10/hot-box Simulation techniques help cool the calibration head for the world's fastest real-time oscilloscope]," ''R&amp;D Magazine'', October, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miele]] used virtual prototyping to improve the development of its washer-disinfector machines by simulating their operational characteristics early in the [[design cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;"A Better Way to Make Medical Instruments Come Clean," ''Medical Design Technology'', October, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Several CAE software solutions (for example, [[Working Model]] and SimWise) offer the possibility to check the benefits of virtual prototyping even for students and small companies, and collection of case studies are available since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Lista Studio, "[http://www.lista.it/atnet/index.htm Lista Studio's Case Studies]".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-bracing''' is a [[structural engineering]] practice where the lateral load on a building is reduced by transferring the load into the exterior columns. 

X-bracing was used in the construction of the 1908 [[Singer Building]], then the tallest building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the Singer Building Construction: Its Progress from Foundation to Flag Pole | publisher=Trow Press | author=Semsch, Otto Francis | year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skyscrapers by engineer [[Fazlur Khan]], such as the 1969 [[John Hancock Center]], have a distinctive X-bracing exterior, allowing for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mir (2001), ''Art of the Skyscraper: the Genius of Fazlur Khan'', Rizzoli International Publications, {{ISBN|0-8478-2370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
