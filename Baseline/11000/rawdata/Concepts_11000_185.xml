      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].

== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;É¡&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''{{lang|la|Audi alteram partem}}''' (or '''{{lang|la|audiatur et altera pars}}''') is a [[Latin]] [[List of Latin phrases|phrase]] meaning "listen to the other side", or "let the other side be heard as well".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/audi+alteram+partem audi alteram partem: Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/Audialterampartem.aspx Audi alteram partem's entry in the duhaime.org legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Audi alteram partem" is considered to be a principle of [[fundamental justice]] or [[Equity (law)|equity]] or the principle of natural justice in most [[legal system]]s. This principle includes the rights of a party or his lawyers to confront the [[witness]]es against him, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly.

The phrase has come to be used as the motto for various political and judicial organisations, and is also the origin of the name of the German carmaker [[Audi]].

==History of use==
As a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, "Hear both sides" was treated as part of common wisdom by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] dramatists.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Aeschylus]], ''[[The Eumenides]]'' 431, 435&lt;/ref&gt; A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a [[hadith]] indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard.&lt;ref&gt; Imam Abu Dawud. 2008. ''Sunan Abu Dawud Vol. 3 (Translated to English by Ahmad Hasan)''. Riyadh: Darussalam,, Hadith No. 3575, Grade: Hasan &lt;/ref&gt; The principle was referred to by the [[International Court of Justice]] in the ''Nuclear Tests'' case, referring to [[France]]'s non-appearance at judgment.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/58/6093.pdf Nuclear Tests (Australia c. France)]'', C. I. J., December 20, 1974, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]''. The principle is used in [[labour law]] matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.

==Other uses==

The Political Interest Society of the [[University of Melbourne]] uses the phrase as its motto.&lt;ref&gt;http://umsu.unimelb.edu.au/clubs/political-interest-society/&lt;/ref&gt; The All-Campus Judicial Council of the [[University of Rochester]] has used the phrase as its motto since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://sa.rochester.edu/sa/acjc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also the origin of the name of [[Germany|German]] carmaker [[Audi]]. Founder [[August Horch]] had left his previous company, [[Motorwagenwerke]], after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the ''August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH''. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German [[Reichsgericht]] (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.&lt;ref name="chronicle2"&gt;[http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html Audi History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209000116/http://www.audiusa.com/us/brand/en/about/main/history.html |date=9 February 2010 }} audiusa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, "Father&amp;nbsp;â  ''audiatur et altera pars''...&amp;nbsp;wouldn't it be a good idea to call it ''audi'' instead of ''horch''?"&lt;ref&gt;August Horch: "Ich baute Autos â Vom Schmiedelehrling zum Autoindustriellen", SchÃ¼tzen-Verlag Berlin 1937&lt;/ref&gt; "Horch!" in German means "Hark!" or "hear", which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of "audire" â "to listen" â in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as ''Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A hub of tourism, many private banks service the city and maintain underground bunkers and storage facilities for gold at the foothills of the [[Swiss Alps]].]]{{Culture of Switzerland}}'''Banking in Switzerland''' began in the early 18th century through [[Switzerland]]'s merchant trade and has, over the centuries, grown into a complex, regulated, and international industry. Along with the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Swiss chocolate]], watchmaking and mountaineering, banking is seen as [[Culture of Switzerland|emblematic of Switzerland]]. Switzerland has a [[Banking in Switzerland#Banking secrecy|long, kindred history of banking secrecy]] and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s. Started as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934 with the passage of the landmark federal law, the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks]].   &lt;!--This article's banking secrecy section is mean't to be the *most comprehensive treatment of Swiss banking secrecy* on Wikipedia, everything else should be directed or redirected appropriately. --&gt;&lt;!--There is a purposeful lack of citations in the lede of this article as per WP:WHENNOTCITE. The standard allows the lead to remain relatively cite-less if all the information is sourced in the main body. If there is something not cited in the lead AND not cited in the body, please a {{citation needed}} next to it so it can be addressed.--&gt;

Controversial protection of foreign accounts and assets during [[World War II]] sparked a series of proposed financial regulations seeking to temper bank secrecy to little success. Switzerland, considered the "grandfather of bank secrecy", has been one of the largest [[Offshore financial centre|offshore financial centers]] and [[tax haven]]s in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks#Revisions|an international push]] to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of proposed roll backs. Disclosing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks "have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that [[Non-disclosure agreement|observed by doctors or priests]]".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Since 1934, banking secrecy laws have been violated by four people: [[Christoph Meili]] (1997), [[Bradley Birkenfeld]] (2007), [[Rudolf Elmer]] (2011), and [[HervÃ© Falciani]] (2014). After insurmountable professional setbacks, all the men were either fired or resigned from their banks, served with federal arrest warrants and fined.

The [[Swiss Bankers Association]] (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held [[United States dollar|US$]]6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland's main lingual hubs, [[Geneva]] (for French), [[Lugano]] (for Italian), and [[ZÃ¼rich]] (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The three largest banksâ[[UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Julius Baer Group|Julius BÃ¤r]]âare all regulated by the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority]] (FINMA), and the [[Swiss National Bank]] (NSB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the [[Economy of Switzerland|Swiss economy]] and society. According to the [[OECD|Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[Banking in Switzerland#Bibliography|Financial Secrecy Index: Narrative Report on Switzerland (2018)]], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Banking in Switzerland [[Banking in Switzerland#In popular culture|has been portrayed]], to varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture, books, movies, and television shows.

'''Beatriz Nascimento''' (12 July 1942-28 January 1995) was an [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] academic and activist. She was an influential participant of the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] from its beginnings in the 1960s until her death. Through her academic research, she evaluated the importance of ''[[quilombos]]'' as autonomous spaces for people of African descent during the colonial period and challenged the political environment and racial policies of the government toward Afro-Brazilians. Her scholarship on the invisibility of black women, and particularly non-Anglo women of the [[African diaspora]] had an international impact on research regarding the complexities of the black experience and lack of attention focused on Afro-Latinas in transnational feminism. 

==Early life==
Maria Beatriz do Nascimento was born on 12 July 1942 in [[Aracaju]], [[Sergipe]], Brazil to Rubina Pereira Nascimento and Francisco Xavier do Nascimento. Her father was a mason and her mother raised their ten children. Nascimento was their eighth child. Around 1949, the family migrated south and settled in the [[Cordovil]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After completing her secondary schooling, she enrolled at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] (UFRJ), graduating with a bachelor's degree in history in 1971. During her schooling, she became involved in the [[Black Movement of Brazil]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento Negro}}). Beginning as a student organizer, Nascimento was a co-founder of several associations and attended numerous conferences and public forum discussions on blackness and racial politics.{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

==Career==
Upon graduating, Nascimento began working as an intern at the [[Brazilian National Archives]] and continued her education, studying at the [[Fluminense Federal University]] (UFF). She married Jose do Rosario Freitas Gomes and the couple subsequently had a daughter, BethÃ¢nia Gomes. While at UFF, she was involved in the founding of the Andre RebouÃ§as Working Group, which had a significant effect on the resurgence of black identity and the politicization of race under the [[Brazilian military government]] from 1974 to 1985.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} Her research during this period centered on [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies in three of the surviving  ''[[quilombos|quilombo communities]]'' (African-Brazilian Maroon societies) in [[Minas Gerais]]. Conducting interviews and evaluating archival materials, Nascimento came to recognize ''quilombos'' as "autonomous black spaces of liberation".{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

In 1977, Nascimento was one of the speakers at the ''Quinzena do Negro'' (Black Fortnight), organized by Eduardo Oliveira e Oliveira at the [[University of SÃ£o Paulo]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} The conference was pivotal in Nascimento's development, and was where she secured her place as an anchor in the Black Movement,{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=11}} through her introduction of theoretical ideas about the significance of ''quilombos'' for [[Afro-Brazilians]] and the intersection of race and gender in the political environment for black women in Brazil. She also strongly criticized the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] for its racist policies. In 1978, she joined the [[Movimento Negro Unificado Contra a DiscriminaÃ§Ã£o Racial]] (Unified Black Movement, or MNU) and over the next decade worked with Raquel Gerber, a filmmaker, on a documentary which would become one of her most important legacies.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} 

Nascimento completed her graduate studies at UFF in 1981 and began a master's degree program at UFRJ studying communications with {{ill|Muniz SodrÃ©|es}}, a noted Brazilian sociologist and journalist.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She taught history at the Rome State School ({{lang-pt|ColÃ©gio Estadual Roma}}), in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana]]{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=27}}{{sfn|Torres|1995}} and published articles in various newspapers and journals like ''Estudos Afro-AsiÃ¡ticos'' (Afro-Asian Studies), ''[[Folha de SÃ£o Paulo]]'', ''Revista Cultura Vozes'' (Culture Voices Magazine), and ''Revista do PatrimÃ´nio HistÃ³rico'' (Historical Patrimony Magazine), while serving on the editorial board of ''Boletim do CentenÃ¡rio da AboliÃ§Ã£o e RepÃºblica'' (Centennial Bulletin of Abolition and the Republic).{{sfn|Ratts|2006|pp=27â28}} In 1989, Nascimento and Gerber released ''[[Ori (film)|Ori]]'',{{sfn|Smith|2016}} their documentary about the relationship between Africa and Brazil and the Black Movement in the country.{{sfn|Ratts|2006|p=28}}

==Death and legacy==
Nascimento was murdered on 28 January 1995 during a domestic dispute between Aurea and AntÃ´nio Jorge Amorim Viana, known as Danone.{{sfn|Torres|1995}} The murderer, Danone, believed that Nascimento had counseled his wife, Aurea to leave him because of their violent relationship.{{sfn|Torres|1995}}{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} At the time of her death Nascimento and Gomes had separated, and she was in relationship with Roberto Rosemburg, her common law spouse.{{sfn|Smith|2016}} She was buried on 30 January 1995 at the [[CemitÃ©rio de SÃ£o JoÃ£o Batista]].{{sfn|Gramado|1995}} Nascimento impacted international scholarship on black women, calling into question their invisibility because of patriarchy and colonialism, but also because of the over-emphasis on the English-speaking diaspora among academics{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}} and the language barriers to intellectual discourse from non-Anglo scholars.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=74}} Nascimento caused feminist scholars to recognize the need for expanding research to encompass Afro-Latinas for a deeper understanding of the complexities impacting the African diaspora.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=85}} AlÃ©x Ratts published a biography on Nascimento and her career, ''Eu Sou AtlÃ¢ntica'' in 2007.{{sfn|Smith|2016|p=72}}

[[Image:Book cover Beyond Freedom and Dignity.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971), spent eighteen weeks on the ''New York Times'' Best-Seller list.]]

'''''Beyond Freedom and Dignity''''' is a 1971 book by American [[psychologist]] [[B. F. Skinner]].  Skinner argues that entrenched belief in [[free will]] and the moral [[autonomy]] of the individual (which Skinner referred to as "dignity") hinders the prospect of using scientific methods to modify behavior for the purpose of building a happier and better-organized society.

''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' may be summarized as an attempt to promote Skinner's philosophy of science, the technology of human behavior, his conception of determinism, and what Skinner calls "cultural engineering".

==Synopsis==
The book is organized into nine chapters.

===A Technology of Behavior===
In this chapter Skinner proposes that a technology of behavior is possible and that it can be used to help solve currently pressing human issues such as over-population and warfare. "Almost all major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of human behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. page 24 Hardback edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom===
In this chapter Skinner offers a more precise definition of [[Freedom of will|freedom]], one that allows for his conception of [[determinism]], and speaks to the conventional notion of freedom. Skinner argues against "autonomous man".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity. p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that the forces of Freedom and Dignity have led to many positive advances in the human condition, but may now be hindering the advance of a technology of human behavior: "[the literature of freedom and dignity] has been successful in reducing the aversive stimuli used in intentional control, but it has made the mistake of defining freedom in terms of states of mind or feelings..."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dignity===
Dignity is the process by which people are given credit for their actions,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity, p. 58 "We recognise a person's dignity or worth when we give him credit for what he has done"&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively punished for them under the notion of responsibility. Skinner's analysis rejects both as "dignity" &amp;ndash; a false notion of inner causality which removes both credit for action and blame for misdeeds, "the achievements for which a person himself is to be given credit seem to approach zero.".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that credit is typically a function of the conspicuousness of control. We give less or no credit, or blame, to those who are overtly coached, compelled, prompted or otherwise not appearing to be producing actions spontaneously.

===Punishment===
Skinner saw punishment as the [[logical consequence]] of an unscientific analysis of behavior as well as the tradition of "freedom and dignity". Since individuals are seen to be making choices they are then able to be punished for those choices. Since Skinner denies the existence of free will, he therefore argued against punishment which he saw to be ineffective in controlling behavior.

===Alternatives to Punishment===
Skinner notes that the previous solutions to punishment are often not very useful and may create additional problems. Permissiveness, the metaphor of mid-wifery (or [[maieutics]]), "guidance", a dependence on things, "changing minds", all contain either problems or faulty assumptions about what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;"The fundamental mistake made by all those who choose weak methods of control is to assume that the balance of control is left to the individual, when in fact it is left to other conditions." p.99 - Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner argues that this misunderstanding of control championed by the defenders of freedom and dignity "encourage[s] the misuse of controlling practices and block progress towards a more effective technology of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Values===
Skinner notes a 'prescientific' view of man allows for personal achievement. The 'scientific view' moves human action to be explained by species evolution and environmental history.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.101&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner speaks to feelings about what is right, as well as popular notions of "good". Skinner translates popular words and phrases around value issues into his view of contingencies of reinforcement. Skinner notes that even if the technology of behavior produces "goods" to improve human life, they expose environmental control, which is offensive to the "freedom and dignity" perspective.&lt;ref&gt;"A technology of behavior is available...but the defenders of freedom oppose its use." Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Evolution of a Culture===
Skinner suggests that cultural evolution is a way to describe the aggregate of (operant) behavior. A culture is a collection of behavior, or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.131&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner addresses "[[social Darwinism]]" and argues that as a justification of the subordination of other nations or of war competition with others is a small part of natural selection. A much more important part is competition with the physical environment itself.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner relates the idea of cultural evolution back to the question of values: whose values are to survive?

===The Design of a Culture===
Skinner notes that cultural design is not new, but is already existing and on-going.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. . 145&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that most discussions of current problems are dominated by metaphors, concerns for feelings and states of mind which do not illuminate possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.148&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that [[behavior modification]] is ethically neutral &lt;ref&gt;p.150 "Such a technology is ethically neutral. It can be used by villain or saint." Skinner, B.F. Beyond Freedom and Dignity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner notes that [[Utopia]]n speculations, like his novel ''[[Walden Two]]'' are a kind of cultural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Although Skinner mentions Plato, Augustine and was presumably inspired by Bacon's Atlantic and does not explicitly mention Walden Two in this reference. p.153 Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.&lt;/ref&gt; He then devotes much of the rest of this chapter to addressing the criticisms and complaints against cultural engineering.

===What is Man?===
Skinner again addresses the notion of the individual, and discusses how aspects of a person's character could be assigned to environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity.  p.186 aggression, industry, attention are addressed specifically&lt;/ref&gt; He also covers cognition, problem solving, self-control and counters some arguments or possible misconceptions. Skinner notes that his analysis does not "leave an empty organism".&lt;ref&gt;"A great deal goes on inside the organism" Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. p195&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner addresses the issue of mechanical models of human action, which are better addressed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa's Radical Behaviorism deals with the misunderstanding of Skinner's analysis as "mechanistic" in some detail&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner notes that, "The evolution of a culture is a gigantic effort in [[Self control|self-control]]." and ends with, "A scientific view of man offers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man."

==''Walden Two''==
''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' is consistent with ''[[Walden Two]]'', a 1948 novel by Skinner, depicting a utopian community based on his ideas regarding behavior modification. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' Skinner extends his argument for explicit cultural engineering of which ''Walden Two'' may be seen as an example.

==Criticisms==
[[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] criticized Skinner's methods and conclusions. Chomsky's 1971 essay "The Case Against B.F. Skinner" responded to ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', arguing against [[behaviorism]] and its claim to scientific status.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. The Case Against B.F.Skinner http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19711230.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Skinner's denial of human dignity, Chomsky said, "It would be absurd to conclude merely from the fact that freedom is limited, that âautonomous manâ is an illusion (...) It would be hard to conceive of a more striking failure to comprehend even the rudiments of scientific thinking ".&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, The case against B.F. Skinner (1971) 17:11 The New York review of books December 30, 1971. See also Eric Folot, "Human Dignity (Part 1): Its Critics" http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2354171 and http://www.legavox.fr/blog/ethos/dignite-humaine-partie-detracteurs-12702.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics include [[Ayn Rand]], whose 1971 article "The Stimulus and the Response" is an extended attack on ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' and a commentary on the significance of its reception.

John Staddon criticized Skinner's contention that punishment is ineffective and free-will an unnecessary concept, arguing that "Punishment doesn't always abolish freedom -- and freedom is not just absence of punishment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/5124 Staddon, J. (1995) "On responsibility and punishment" in ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88-94.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''BoveriâSutton chromosome theory''' (also known as the '''chromosome theory of inheritance''' or the '''SuttonâBoveri theory''') is a fundamental unifying theory of [[genetics]] which identifies [[chromosome]]s as the carriers of [[genes|genetic material]].&lt;ref name=GNN&gt;[http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1902_Boveri_Sutton.php 1902: Theodor Boveri (1862-1915) and Walter Sutton (1877-1916) propose that chromosomes bear hereditary factors in accordance with Mendelian laws] Genetics and Genomics Timeline.

S. (2007). Biology 9th Ed. McGraw Hill Higher Education, Boston, MA, USA. {{ISBN|978-0-07-325839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correctly explains the mechanism underlying the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]] by identifying chromosomes with the paired [[allele|factors]] (particles) required by Mendel's laws. It also states that chromosomes are linear structures with [[gene]]s located at specific sites called [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] along them.&lt;ref name=holmgren/&gt;

It states simply that chromosomes, which are seen in all dividing cells and pass from one generation to the next, are the basis for all genetic inheritance.
Over a period of time random mutation
creates changes in the DNA sequence of a gene. Genes are located on chromosomes.

The chromosome theory of inheritance is credited to papers by [[Walter Sutton]] in 1902&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902).
 [http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/reprint/4/1/24 On the morphology of the chromosome group in ''Brachystola magna.''] Biol. Bull. 4: 24-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1903,&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1903). [http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/reprint/4/5/231 The chromosomes in heredity.] Biol. Bull. 4: 231-251. Partial reproduction in: Classic Papers in Genetics (1959) (Peters, J.A., ed.). Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, pp. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to independent work by [[Theodor Boveri]] during roughly the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Boveri, T.H. (1904). Ergebnisse Ã¼ber die Konstitution der chromatischen Substanz des Zelkerns. Fisher, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; Boveri was studying [[sea urchin]]s, in which he found that all the chromosomes had to be present for proper [[embryonic development]] to take place. Sutton's work with [[grasshopper]]s showed that chromosomes occur in matched pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes which separate during meiosis and "may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

This groundbreaking work led [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E.B. Wilson]] in his classic text to name the chromosome theory of inheritance the "Sutton-Boveri Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.B. (1925). ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', 3rd edition. Macmillan, New York. p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was close to both men, since the young Sutton was his student and the prominent Boveri was his friend (in fact, Wilson dedicated the afore-mentioned book to Boveri). Although the naming precedence is now often reversed to "Boveri-Sutton", there are some who argue that Boveri didn't actually articulate the theory until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, L.A.-C.P. (1999). [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=s1415-47571999000200022&amp;script=sci_arttext Did Sutton and Boveri propose the so-called Sutton-Boveri chromosome hypothesis?] Genet. Mol. Biol. [online]. Vol.22, n.2, pp. 261-272 [Retrieved 2011-03-03].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verification==
The proposal that chromosomes carried the factors of Mendelian inheritance was initially controversial, but in 1913 it gained strong support when [[Eleanor Carothers]] documented definitive evidence of [[independent assortment]] of chromosomes in a species of grasshopper.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, E.W. and Crow, J. F.  [http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/160/1/1 100 Years Ago: Walter Sutton and the Chromosome Theory of Heredity] ''Genetics,'' Vol. 160, 1-4, January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate continued, however, until 1915 when [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s work on inheritance and [[genetic linkage]] in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' provided incontrovertible evidence for the proposal.&lt;ref name=GNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=mader/&gt; The unifying theory stated that inheritance patterns may be generally explained by assuming that genes are located in specific sites on chromosomes.

'''Brenda Cherry''' (born March 19, 1958), is an American Civil Rights Activist from [[Paris, Texas]]. 

Cherry is the President and co-founder of Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, a non-profit [[civil rights organization]] located in Paris, Texas. Founded in 2003, CCFRE co-sponsored events with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], Lone Star Legal Aid, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Dept Intervene on Racial Tensions in Paris, TX (Public Meeting 1.29)|url=http://www.pr.com/press-release/128805|publisher=PR.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal aid rally draws crowd|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_f4ce57b9-0e1a-5d4c-bc0d-85c9819316a6.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Cherry grew up in Blossom Texas. Her late father, Zeb Reynolds, was a farmer, and her mother, Irene Whitney, was a domestic worker.  She began school at T.G. Givens, which was then, a segregated school in Paris, Texas. She had to be bused 10 miles to the school even though there was a local school district in the town where she lived.  After the schools were forced to integrate, she attended the formerly "whites only" school in Blossom. Cherry graduated from [[Prairiland High School]] in [[Pattonville, Texas]]. She went on to attend [[Paris Junior College]] and [[East Texas State University]]. Cherry worked as a Licensed Vocational Nurse for 9 years before becoming a civil rights activist. Cherry has two daughters, Shauncia Cherry and Tiffany Cherry, and one son, Rico Lewis.

=== Schoolyard assault ===
On October 23, 2003, an 11-year-old black student was reportedly attacked by a principal at [[Crockett Middle School]] in Paris, Texas. The child was removed from the school and sent to a detention center. Cherry, along with a small group of people, including the childâs mother and grandfather, staged a protest in front of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest: Mother claims son beaten|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_aedc00d4-a144-5f26-8dac-3ec73fad0179.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curbside Protest|url= http://theparisnews.com/article_9034f8b8-af93-51ad-991e-0be9af4bd6a7.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the protest, the child was released from the detention center. This event marked the beginning of several future protest demonstrations in the town.

[[Shaquanda Cotton]] was an African-American student that attended Paris High School in Paris, Texas. On March 16, 2006, Cotton, aged 14, was arrested for allegedly shoving a school hall monitor. 
Having no prior criminal history, Cotton was tried and sentenced to up to 7 years in the [[Texas Youth Commission]]. During the same time frame, the judge in the case, Chuck Superville, sentenced a Caucasian 14-year-old girl who had a prior criminal history to probation after committing the confirmed crime of arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge keeps juvenile on probation|url=http://theparisnews.com/news/article_51118b41-045a-5e58-98e2-5fa7ffa0ca34.html|publisher=TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Darwin Campbell with ''[[African-American News and Issues]]'' broke the story, which garnered attention to Cottonâs sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1-Willie Lynch and Jim Crow Join Forces in Lamar County to Destroy Black Youth |url=http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |publisher=African American News and Issues |accessdate=19 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105060808/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-03-22/lead2.htm |archivedate=5 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After serving a year and one month in prison, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' story written by Howard Witt led the case to national exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To some in Paris, sinister past is back. |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703120170mar12,0,1435953.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large protest led by comedian [[Rickey Smiley]] was held at the Lamar County Courthouse in Paris, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smiley: "It is time for a new movement." |url= http://theparisnews.com/news/article_0379c3d6-6538-5d24-a001-6427071e6af6.html|publisher= TheParisNews.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately two weeks after the ''Tribune'' article and protest, ShaQuanda was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl in prison for shove gets released early |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0703310265mar31,0,4450616.story|publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry was interviewed by the [[BBC]] regarding Cotton, and the case was included in a BBC documentary by United Kingdom reporter Julian O'Halloran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Fourteen, and at the heart of a race row |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/7064473.stm|publisher= BBC News|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Julian|last=O'Halloran|date=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brandon McClelland ===
[[File:1parisrally.jpg|thumb|Rally for Brandon McClelland in Paris, Texas]]

[[Death of Brandon McClelland|Brandon McClelland]] was a 24-year-old African American male who lived in Paris, Texas. On September 16, 2008, his body was found partially dismembered and mutilated on a farm road approximately 17 miles from his home. The local newspaper, ''The Paris News'', reported the death as a hit-and-run by an unknown truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hit-run death still under investigation |url=  http://theparisnews.com/news/article_d11c225c-529d-5b19-ba81-3c9d45a5feee.html |publisher= The Paris News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activism of Cherry and the Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality, the case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was his death a hate crime? |url=  http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-05/news/0810040299_1_civil-rights-paris-unknown-driver |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Two charged with murder after black man dragged to death in troubled Paris, Texas |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-081212-paris-witt,0,3694385.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dispute about whether McClelland was dragged under the truck or behind it, and while awaiting autopsy reports, ''[[USA Today]]'' interviewed Cherry. "Authorities have not seriously considered the possibility that this was a hate crime. There's a problem in Paris, Texas. I don't see a difference in getting dragged behind a truck and getting dragged under a truck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Another dragging death in Texas raises tensions |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-10-24-164308463_x.htm |publisher= USA Today|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Jeff|last=Carlton|date=25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation revealed that McClelland was last seen alive with two Caucasian men, Shannon Finley and Charles Ryan Crostley, both of whom had extensive criminal history. ''[[Anderson Cooper 360Â°]]'' reported that the two men were charged with killing McClelland and both subsequently plead "not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The turbulent racial history of Paris, Texas |url=   http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/07/27/the-turbulent-racial-history-of-paris-texas/ |publisher= Anderson Cooper 360|accessdate=19 August 2012|date=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special prosecutor Toby Shook cited lack of evidence to the case, and the murder charges were dropped in June 2009. The two men were released. [[CBS News]] quoted Cherry, "His body was dragged and nobody gets charged? Even if a trucker came forward, that's all it takes? Even the trucker's not charged? If you hit someone, you don't get charged? Nobody gets charged with this? It's not surprising, but it's sad. It appears that a black man's life means nothing here in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Charges dropped in Texas Dragging Death |url=   http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5065180.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple protests have been led by Cherry, along with Jim Blackwell and the New Black Panther Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Jasper-style lynching in Paris Texas? |url=   http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_5348.shtml |publisher= Final Call|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Protesters clash over Texas Dragging Death |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-5176952.html |publisher= CBS News|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains an open murder investigation.

=== Brandarian Thomas ===
Brandarian Thomas was a 14-year-old African American student at Travis Junior High School in Paris, Texas. In June 2008, Police handcuffed and arrested Thomas at his home for allegedly "touching a female student's butt and crotch" in class. Thomas denied the accusations. Thomas' mother contacted Cherry, who convinced her to take the case to trial rather than accept a plea deal. ''[[Texas Observer]]'' reporter Forrest Wilder documented the case. Cherry views the Cotton and Thomas prosecutions as extreme examples of a larger pattern of racial discrimination in Paris public schools. Cherry stated, "The black kids are punished more often, more harshly. I think they go to extremes; they punish them for little things. A lot of times, they see a black kid as more menacing." Though prosecutors offered a plea deal to Thomas (two years of probation in exchange for a guilty plea), Cherry helped convince Thomas' mother to take the matter to trial in front of the same judge who heard the Cotton case. "It's ridiculous," Cherry stated. "He was 14. You're going to ruin his life because you can't make him plead guilty?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Too black for school?

=== Cornelius Gill ===
Cornelius Gill was an 18-year-old African American high school student in Paris, Texas.  On November 11, 2009, Gill was picking up pecans when he was approached by a Paris police officer who questioned him about a stolen car that had been found a few blocks away. Gill refused to be questioned and said a curse word. The officer arrested Gill and placed him in handcuffs behind his back. When another police car pulled up, Gill was lifted and body slammed face down onto the vehicle. Cherry witnessed a portion of the incident and she, along with Gill's mother, filed a complaint with the Paris Police Department. Cherry obtained the video of the incident. Gill was sentenced to 100 days in jail by Judge Chuck Superville. Although the video footage shows no evidence of such, the officer claimed Gill assaulted him while placing him in the patrol car. Gill was charged with Assault of a Public Servant and Resisting Arrest. The complaint resulted in a suspension of the officer, but the suspension was lifted when the officer appealed. The case resulted in an outcry from civilians regarding police brutality and unnecessary force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Video of Black Teen's Arrest leads to more Paris Texas controversy |url= http://www.wiredprnews.com/2010/07/16/video-of-black-teens-arrest-leads-to-more-paris-texas-controversy_2010071612646.html|publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Small Texas Town Seized by Racial Controversy |url= http://www.blackradionetwork.com/small_texas_town_seized_by_racial_controversy |publisher= Minority News| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Released of Paris arrest incident |url= http://www.kxii.com/news/headlines/98466019.html |publisher= KXII.com|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', Cherry stated that the ruling sends a message to local police that they can do whatever they want. "What's going to stop the officer from doing that again and again? It makes me fearful," she said. The dash cam video was released after Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality filed an open records request. "We're already in a bad situation here in Paris, and this just makes it worse," Cherry stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Police Brutality VIDEO: SHOCKING Texas Incident Caught on Tape |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/cornelius-gill/1 |publisher= The Huffington Post| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bobby Yates ===
Bobby Yates was a 51-year-old African American man in Paris, Texas. Yates was paralyzed from the waist down due to a gunshot wound during a hunting accident approximately 20 years earlier. His lower body was removed from his hips down due to an infection. On a late night in 2008, Yates made a 911 call to the local police stating that he had been beaten by a 16-year-old white female and two adult males who were at his home that refused to leave. When the police came, the female claimed that Yates had sexually assaulted her. The two males were with her the entire time. The police sided with the female, and Yates was later arrested and charged with sexual assault. Cherry along with her organization held protests and filed complaints on Yates' behalf. After 3 years of legal action, the sexual assault charge was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Lower Body Amputee Accused of Sexual Assault: Group Claims Racism is Factor |url=   http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/04/24/lower-body-amputee-accused-of-sexual-assault-group-claims-racism-is-factor_2011042418764.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Paris, Texas: âMississippi 50 Years Agoâ |url= http://www.texasobserver.org/forrestforthetrees/paris-texas-mississippi-50-years-agol |publisher= Texas Observer |accessdate= 19 August 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aaron Hart ===
Aaron Hart was an 18-year-old mentally retarded youth with an IQ of 47 when he was arrested and charged with sexual assault. Hart had been playing with a 5-year-old child and they exposed and touched each other's private parts. At trial, Hart's court-appointed attorney called no witnesses on Hart's behalf and failed to obtain an independent doctor for a competency hearing. Judge Eric Clifford sentenced Hart to 100 years in prison on June 10, 2009, claiming that he had no other choice. Within the same time frame, Clifford had sentenced a defendant charged with the same offense, and without a disability, to four years in prison. Hart was allegedly sexually assaulted while awaiting trial in Lamar County Jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Aaron Hart allegedly sexually assaulted in jail |url= http://crimesandjustice.com/aaron-hart-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-jail |publisher= Crimes and Justice |accessdate= 19 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130121103611/http://crimesandjustice.com/aaron-hart-allegedly-sexually-assaulted-jail |archivedate= 21 January 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials look into alleged assault in jail |url= http://theparisnews.com/news/article_19602e8d-c803-520d-aac6-c25522d2b689.html|publisher= The Paris News| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry and her organization advocated on Hart's behalf. Numerous protest marches were held, led by CCFRE and Jim Blackwell of the Tarrant County Local Organizing Committee. The case gained national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mentally Retarded Texas teen serving 100-year prison term for sex assault of boy |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_for_monapr06,0,5597484.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is just horrible," stated Cherry in a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article after Judge Clifford made his ruling. "How could the judge not take his mental ability into consideration?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge won't reconsider 100-year prison term |url=  http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/08/nation/na-paris8|work= Los Angeles Times| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart was given a new trial on appeal. Hart ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 10 years in prison where he remains.

=== Turner Industries ===
[[File:Brenda Cherry and Turner men.jpg|thumb|left|Brenda Cherry with Turner Industries employees in Louisiana]]
Turner Industries is a privately owned industrial plant with facilities in several cities and states including Paris, Texas. In February 2009, Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality received complaints and photos regarding a noose, racist graffiti, Confederate flags, and salary and advancement discrimination against black workers in the Turner Industries Paris plant. Activism led to a federal investigation by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism bedevils Texas town |url=  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-paris_webfeb25,0,4203830.story |work= The Chicago Tribune| accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Factory employees file federal racial discrimination, harassment complaint |url=  http://www.kxii.com/home/headlines/41178052.html |publisher= KXII.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings led to a federal lawsuit which was settled out of court, as well as changes in Turner Industries employment practices. Cherry stated, "One of my biggest concerns regarding the racist graffiti, noose, and other things found at the plant is the mentality of those who put it there. Those same people serve on juries, and some go on to have supervisory positions or other positions of authority." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noose, Racist Graffiti Proves Efforts Must Continue to Expose 'Ghosts' and Truths About Paris Racism |url=http://www.lonestarpowerpages.com/feb-21-2009---special-report.html |publisher= LoneStarPowerPages.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turner Industries investigation was one of the largest civil rights investigations ever undertaken in the State of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nooses, Swastikas, Racist Graffiti Harass Employees of Texas Company â EEOC |url= http://www.bvblackspin.com/2010/04/15/nooses-swastikas-racist-graffitti-harass-black-employees-of-te/ |publisher= Black Spin| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roping and bullying of autistic student ===
On April 20, 2011, a 14-year-old African American autistic student was taken by an 18-year-old Caucasian student into the greenhouse at Paris High School. The 18-year-old threw a rope over a beam and placed the other end around the waist of the 14-year-old. He kicked his feet and beat his hand with a stick until bloody when the 14-year-old attempted to get free. The girlfriend of the 18-year-old student stood laughing and recorded the incident with her cell phone. When the group returned to class, a male teacher took the recording and erased it. After the school refused to discipline the 18-year-old and his girlfriend, or the teacher who erased the evidence, Cherry and CCFRE advocated on behalf of the mother, Tina Washington, and her son. The county attorney refused to charge the 18-year-old student even though it was a felony offense. Several protests were led by Cherry and Jim Blackwell regarding the incident. The case is currently under investigation by the [[U.S. Department of Education]], Office for Civil Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Autistic Teen roped by another student, Recording erased by Teacher |url=     http://www.wiredprnews.com/2011/07/24/autistic-teen-roped-by-another-student-recording-erased-by-teacher_2011072420998.html |publisher= WiredPRNews.com| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
Concerned Citizens for Racial Equality co-sponsored a community reconciliation meeting with the U.S. Department of Justice which was featured in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. "I'm here to talk about racism. I don't see any sense in playing games, pretending it doesn't exist," stated Cherry. "When you go in the schools and see mostly black kids sitting in detentionâit's racism. In court, we get high bonds, we get longer sentences. If that's not racism, what is it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hard truth, but little reconciliation in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-paris-web31,0,922958.story |publisher= The Chicago Tribune|accessdate=19 August 2012|first=Howard|last=Witt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Organizations to hold community forum on school discipline in Paris, Texas |url=  http://www.aclutx.org/2010/11/30/organizations-to-hold-community-forum-on-school-discipline-in-paris-texas/ |publisher= American Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This town is being forced to look at things they never wanted to look at before," stated Cherry in an excerpt from ''[[Newsweek]]''. Cherry, along with Lone Star Legal Aid, a local nonprofit law firm, compiled statistics showing that the Paris Independent School District punished black kids eight times more often than white ones, even though blacks make up a minority of the population. The U.S. Department of Education ruled that there wasn't enough evidence to attribute the discrepancy to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Problems in Paris, Texas |url=    http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/01/30/problems-in-paris-texas.html |publisher= Newsweek Magazine| accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Cherry, "I think we are probably stuck in 1930 right about now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17355">A '''catch-22''' is a [[paradoxical]] situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Catch-22 | journal=Random House Dictionary | publisher=Random House | year=2012 | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/catch-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OALD&gt;"[http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/catch-22 Catch 22]", ''Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary'', accessed 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Joseph Heller]], who used it in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]''.

An example is:
: "How am I supposed to gain experience [to find a good job] if I'm constantly turned down for not having any?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Jacquelyn|title=When an Employer Requires Experience and You Have None|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/05/09/when-an-employer-requires-experience-and-you-have-none/#66ba99c22878|website=Forbes|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it (''e.g'', a bank will never issue someone a loan if they ''need'' the money). One connotation of the term is that the creators of the "catch-22" situation have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.

== Origin and meaning ==

[[Joseph Heller]] coined the term in his 1961 novel ''[[Catch-22]]'', which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in [[World War II]]. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes "Catch-22" to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanityâhoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missionsâdemonstrates his own sanity in creating the request and thus cannot be declared insane. This phrase also means a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beidler|first1=Philip D.|title=Scriptures for a Generation: What We Were Reading in the '60s|date=1995|isbn=978-0820317878|page=162|quote=It is Catch-22: Dr. Daneeka explains how anybody who is crazy has a right to ask to be removed from combat status but how anybody who asks is revealing a rational concern for his own safety that makes him not crazy;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"You mean there's a catch?"

"Sure there's a catch," Doc Daneeka replied. "Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."

There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. [[Orr (Catch-22)|Orr]] was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane, he had to fly them. If he flew them, he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to, he was sane and had to. [[John Yossarian|Yossarian]] was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.|4 = }}

Different formulations of "Catch-22" appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian (the pilot) is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his [[commanding officer]] tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer's superiors.&lt;ref name=Henriksen&gt;Margot A. Henriksen, ''Dr. Strangelove's America: Society and Culture in the Atomic Age''; University of California Press, 1997; {{ISBN|0-520-08310-5}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=KGrsQOIQgeYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 250].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/topic/joseph-heller Joseph Heller]", ''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'', accessed via Answers.com, 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo /&gt;

{{quotation|"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Yossarian shouted at her in bewildered, furious protest. "How did you know it was Catch-22? Who the hell told you it was Catch-22?"

"The soldiers with the hard white hats and clubs. The girls were crying. 'Did we do anything wrong?' they said. The men said no and pushed them away out the door with the ends of their clubs. 'Then why are you chasing us out?' the girls said. 'Catch 22,' the men said. All they kept saying was 'Catch-22, Catch-22.' What does it mean, Catch 22? What is Catch-22?"

"Didn't they show it to you?" Yossarian demanded, stamping about in anger and distress. "Didn't you even make them read it?"

"They don't have to show us Catch-22," the old woman answered. "The law says they don't have to."

"What law says they don't have to?"

"Catch-22."}}

According to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman's narrative defines "Catch-22" more directly as the "brutal operation of power", stripping away the "bogus sophistication" of the earlier scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Gregson, ''Character and Satire in Post War Fiction''; London: Continuum, 2006; {{ISBN|9781441130006}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e0qqaRTVt_sC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 38].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances in the novel ===

Besides referring to an unsolvable logical [[dilemma]], Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters that he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of [[Private First Class]] after any promotion. Through [[courts-martial]] for going [[AWOL]], he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.

At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.

At one point, Captain Black attempts to press Milo into depriving [[Major Major Major Major|Major Major]] of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, "You're not against Catch-22, are you?"

In chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.

=== Significance of the number 22 ===

{{main|Catch-22#Explanation of the novel's title|Catch-22}}
Heller originally wanted to call the phrase (and hence, the book) by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for [[euphony]]. The title was originally ''Catch-18'', but Heller changed it after the popular ''[[Mila 18]]'' was published a short time beforehand.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt;

== Usage ==

The term "catch-22" has filtered into common usage in the English language.&lt;ref name=OALD /&gt; In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669372/A-classic-by-any-other-name.html A classic by any other name]", ''The Telegraph'', 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

James E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a "catch-22" has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, then, who deals with organizations understands the bureaucratic logic of Catch-22. In high school or college, for example, students can participate in student government, a form of self-government and democracy that allows them to decide whatever they want, just so long as the principal or dean of students approves. This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen's first encounter with organizations that may profess 'open' and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that exempts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.&lt;ref name=CombsNimmo&gt;James E. Combs &amp; Dan D. Nimmo, ''The Comedy of Democracy''; Westport, CT: Praeger (Greenwood Publishing Group), 1996; {{ISBN|0-275-94979-6}}; p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VJw9OdBFgmgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 152].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along with George Orwell's "[[doublethink]]", "Catch-22" has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, "[http://thesmartset.com/article/article07181101.aspx 22 Going on 50: Half a century later, the world is full of Catch-22s]"; ''The Smart Set'', 20 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant type of definition of [[alternative medicine]] has been termed a catch-22. In a 1998 editorial co-authored by [[Marcia Angell]], a former editor of the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'', argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine â conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments."&lt;ref name= Angell1998&gt;{{cite journal |title= Alternative medicine--The risks of untested and unregulated remedies |last1= Angell |first1= M. |last2= Kassirer |first2= J.P. |authorlink= Marcia Angell |journal= [[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume= 339 |issue= 12 |pages= 839â41 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9738094 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199809173391210 |ref= harv|displayauthors= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition has been described by [[Robert L. Park]] as a logical catch-22 which ensures that any [[Portal:Complementary and alternative medicine|Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)]] method which is proven to work "would no longer be CAM, it would simply be medicine."&lt;ref name=Park_Catch-22&gt;[[Robert L. Park|Park, Robert L.]], [http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN02/wn032902.html Alternative Medicine: The Clinton Commission's Catch-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic ==

The [[Archetype|archetypal]] ''catch-22'', as formulated by [[Joseph Heller|Heller]], involves the case of [[John Yossarian]], a [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Forces]] [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]], who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron's [[flight surgeon]] and found "unfit to fly". "Unfit" would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be [[Insanity|mad]] to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must ''request'' the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared "unfit".

The "Catch-22" is that "anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy".&lt;ref name="Heller1999" /&gt; Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation ''are'' sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.

Therefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.

A logical formulation of this situation is:
{{Aligned table |cols=4
 |col1style=width:3.0em;text-align:center; |col2style=padding-right:1.0em; |col3style=width:47.0em;line-height:1.35em;padding-right:1.5em;
 | 1. | &lt;math&gt;(E \rightarrow (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | For a person to be excused from flying (E) on the grounds of insanity, they must both be insane (I) and have requested an evaluation (R). | ([[premise]])
 | 2. | &lt;math&gt;(I \rightarrow \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | An insane person (I) does not request an evaluation (Â¬R) because they do not realize they are insane. | (premise)
 | 3. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg I \lor \neg R)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Either a person is not insane (Â¬I) or does not request an evaluation (Â¬R). | {{nowrap|(2. and [[Material implication (rule of inference)|material implication]])}}
 | 4. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg (I \land R))&lt;/math&gt;
      | No person can be both insane (I) and request an evaluation (R). | (3. and [[De Morgan's laws]])
 | 5. | &lt;math&gt;(\neg E)&lt;/math&gt;
      | Therefore, no person can be excused from flying (Â¬E) because no person can be both insane and have requested an evaluation. | (4., 1. and ''[[modus tollens]]'')
}}

The philosopher [[Laurence Goldstein (philosopher)|Laurence Goldstein]] argues that the "airman's dilemma" is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a "vacuous biconditional" that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Goldstein, "[http://philpapers.org/rec/GOLTBR The Barber, Russell's paradox, catch-22, God, contradiction and more: A defence of a Wittgensteinian conception of contradiction]"; in ''The law of non-contradiction: new philosophical essays'', ed. Graham Priest, Jc Beall &amp; Bradley Armour-Garb; Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The catch is this: what looks like a statement of the conditions under which an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions reduces not to the statement

:(i) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if Cont' (where 'Cont' is a contradiction)  
 
(which could be a mean way of disguising an unpleasant truth), but to the worthlessly empty announcement 
 
:(ii) 'An airman can be excused flying dangerous missions if and only if it is not the case that an airman can be excused flying dangerous missions' 
 
If the catch were (i), that would not be so badâan airman would at least be able to discover that under no circumstances could he avoid combat duty. But Catch-22 is worseâa welter of words that amounts to nothing; it is without content, it conveys no information at all.}}

'''Coal pollution mitigation''', often referred to by the term '''clean coal''', is a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the pollution and other environmental effects normally associated with the burning (though not the [[coal mining|mining]] or processing) of [[coal]], which is widely regarded as the dirtiest of the common fuels for industrial processes and power generation.&lt;ref name="NatGeoMyth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches attempt to mitigate emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and other [[greenhouse gas]]es, and [[naturally occurring radioactive material|radioactive material]]s, that arise from the use of coal, mainly for electrical power generation, using [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|various technologies]]. Historical efforts to reduce coal pollution focused on [[flue-gas desulfurization]] starting in the 1850s and clean burn technologies.  These efforts have been very successful in countries with strong environmental regulation, such as the US, where emissions of acid-rain causing compounds and particulates have been reduced by up to 90%&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; since 1995. More recent developments include [[carbon capture and storage]], which pumps and stores CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions underground, and [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) involve [[coal gasification]], which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |title=Countries betting tech can clean up coal  â IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher=CNN International |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718230924/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |archivedate=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20090716/daily-wrap-july-16-energy.htm |publisher= International Business Times |title= Daily Wrap Up for July 16 â Energy |date= July 16, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/environment/divided-views-over-clean-coal-pilot-project-20090708-ddf5.html |publisher= The Age |title= Divided views over 'clean coal' pilot project |date= July 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17 | location=Melbourne | first=Adam | last=Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25738096-11949,00.html |publisher= The Australian |title= Make-or-break summit as G8 gamble on climate and economy  |date= July 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/cleancoal/86-93program.html |title= The 1986â93 Clean Coal Technology Program |publisher= US Department of Energy|date= 21 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 22 clean coal demonstration projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy since 2003, none are in operation as of February 2017, having been abandoned or delayed due to capital budget overruns or discontinued because of excessive operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Power Initiative|url=https://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative|website=Energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Since the 1970s, various policy and regulatory measures have driven coal pollution mitigation.  In the US, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] was the primary driving force in reducing particulate emissions and acid rain from coal combustion. As regulations have increased the demand for coal pollution mitigation technologies, costs have fallen and performance has improved.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Technologies: Accelerating Commercial and Policy Drivers for Deployment|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Clean_Coal_CIAB_2008.pdf|website=www.iea.org|publisher=International Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread deployment of pollution-control equipment to reduce [[sulphur dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and dust emissions is just one example that brought cleaner air to many countries. The desire to tackle rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions to address [[climate change]] later introduced [[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)]].&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

Within the United States, [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] technologies, also sometimes referred to as carbon capture and sequestration, are mainly being developed in response to regulations by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]âmost notably the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]âand in anticipation of legislation that seeks to mitigate [[climate change]].

[[Loan guarantees]] and [[tax incentives]] have a long history of use in [[Australia]], [[Member state of the European Union|EU countries]] and the US to encourage the introduction of coal pollution mitigation and other technologies to reduce environmental impact.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

==Environmental impact of coal==
{{See also|Environmental impact of the coal industry}}

=== Greenhouse gasses ===
{{main|Greenhouse gas}}

Combustion of coal--which is mostly carbon--produces carbon dioxide as a product of combustion.  According to the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a significant contributor to [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]). For 1 ton of coal burned, 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/co2_article/co2.html|title= Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal, Energy Information Administration, Quarterly Coal Report, JanuaryâApril 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon sequestration]] technology has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 | title=AWWA warns Congress about {{CO2}} injection concerns | publisher=American Water Works }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 25.5% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[world energy consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is used.&lt;ref name="ncseonline.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress â IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion By-products===
By-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal.  Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals.  When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e [[particulate matter]] or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Since air is mostly [[nitrogen]], combustion of coal often leads to production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. [[Sulfur  dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are primary causes of [[acid rain]].  For many years--before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat-- it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal.  These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations.
It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process.   For example, various techniques are used in a [[coal preparation plant]] to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning.  During combustion, [[fluidized bed combustion]] is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.  After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an [[electrostatic precipitator]] and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with [[Flue-gas desulfurization]].  Trace amounts of [[radionuclide]]s are more difficult to remove.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Coal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the USA and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |author=Alex Gabbard |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2013 found that Mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.

==Potential financial impact==
Whether carbon capture and storage technology is adopted worldwide will ââ¦depend less on science than on economics. Cleaning coal is very expensive.â &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123751110892790871|title=Coal Hard Facts: Cleaning It Won't Be Dirt Cheap|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-20|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of converting a single coal-fired power plant===
Conversion of a conventional coal-fired power plant is done by injecting the {{CO2}} into [[ammonium carbonate]] after which it is then transported and deposited underground (preferably in soil beneath the sea).&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|website=National Geographic|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injection process however is by far the most expensive. Besides the cost of the equipment and the ammonium carbonate, the coal-fired power plant also needs to use 30% of its generated heat to do the injection (parasitic load). A test-setup has been done in the American Electric Power Mountaineer coal-burning power plant.

One solution to reduce this thermal loss/parasitic load is to burn the pulverised load with [[pure oxygen]] instead of air.&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"/&gt;

===Cost implications for new coal-fired power plants===
Newly built coal-fired power plants can be made to immediately use gasification of the coal prior to combustion. This makes it much easier to separate off the {{CO2}} from the exhaust fumes, making the process cheaper. This gasification process is done in new coal-burning power plants such as the coal-burning power plant at [[Tianjin]], called "[[GreenGen]]".

===Costs for US-wide conversion===
The projected nationwide costs for the implementing of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in coal-fired power plants in the USA (presumably using a conventional tactic, see above) can be found in the Wall Street Journal article. Credit Suisse Group says $15 billion needs to be invested in CCS over the next 10 years for it to play an important role in climate change. The [[International Energy Agency]] says $20 billion is needed. The [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] says the number is as high as $30 billion. Those figures dwarf the actual investments to date.

In the US, the Bush administration spent about $2.5 billion on [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|a range of mitigation technologies]] â a large amount, but far less than the amounts previously suggested. CCS proponents say both the government and the private sector need to step up their investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|title=US News, Why clean coal is years away|last=|first=|date=2009-03-17|newspaper=US News|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329044452/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|archive-date=2009-03-29|dead-url=yes|work=|via=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential financial benefits ===
The coal industry in the US has the potential to make billions of dollars if clean coal technologies are pursued. It is estimated that from 2000 to 2020 the industry could make up to $15 billion in reduced fuel costs, $25 billion in avoided environmental costs, and $32 billion from exporting the equipment and licensing for use in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bezdek|first=Roger H.|last2=Wendling|first2=Robert M.|date=2013-03-01|title=The return on investment of the clean coal technology program in the USA|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009615|journal=Energy Policy|series=Decades of Diesel|volume=54|pages=104â112|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political support==
{{Expand section|cover more countries' viewpoints|date=February 2017}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, carbon capture and storage was often referred to by then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] as a possible way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (The previous [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] had stated that [[nuclear power]] was a better alternative, as CCS technology may not prove to be economically feasible.)

=== Canada ===
In 2014 SaskPower a provincial-owned electric utility finished renovations on Boundary Damâs boiler number 3 making it the worlds first post-combustion carbon capture storage facility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energyblog.nationalgeographic.com/2014/10/02/worlds-first-full-scale-clean-coal-plant-opens-in-canada/|title=Worldâs First Full-Scale âCleanâ Coal Plant Opens in Canada|last=Danko|first=Pete|date=2014-10-02|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation project ended up costing a little over $1.2 billion and can scrub out CO2 and other toxin from up to 90 percent of the flue gas that it emits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===China ===
Since 2006, China keeps releasing more {{CO2}} than [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|any other country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/business/china-davos-climate-change.html|title=Chinaâs Emissions: More Than U.S. Plus Europe, and Still Rising|website=[[The New York Times]]|language=en|date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinese-coal-fuels-rise-in-global-carbon-emissions-2j0kvrd2z|title=Chinese coal fuels rise in global carbon emissions|website=[[The Times]]|language=en|date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2017/10/24/yes-the-u-s-leads-all-countries-in-reducing-carbon-emissions/#69229dfc3535|title=Yes, The U.S. Leads All Countries In Reducing Carbon Emissions|website=[[Forbes]]|language=en|date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2|title=World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|date=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition|title=China now no. 1 in CO2 emissions; USA in second position|website=PBL [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]]|language=en|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in China are focusing on increasing efficiency of burning coal so they can get more power out of less coal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101780-chinas-drive-to-clean-up-its-coal-power-one-plant-at-a-time/|title=Chinaâs drive to clean up its coal power, one plant at a time|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that new high efficiency power plants could reduce CO2 emission by 7% because they won't have to burn as much coal to get the same amount of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|catastrophic failure of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan that resulted from the [[2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami]], and the [[Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|subsequent widespread public opposition against nuclear power]], high energy, lower emission (HELE) coal power plants were increasingly favored by the [[ShinzÅ Abe]]-led government to recoup lost energy capacity from the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan and to replace aging coal and oil-fired power plants, while meeting 2030 emission targets of the [[Paris Agreement]]. 45 HELE power plants have been planned, purportedly to employ [[integrated gasification fuel cell cycle]], a further development of integrated gasification combined cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-31/japan-coal-power-plants/8224302|title=Japanese government planning to build 45 new coal fired power stations to diversify supply|last=McHugh|first=Babs|date=2017-02-23|access-date=2017-02-23|location=|newspaper=ABC Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/want-to-burn-coal-and-save-the-planet-japan-touts-a-solution|title=Want to Burn Coal and Save the Planet?

Japan had adopted prior pilot projects on IGCC coal power plants in the early-1990s and late-2000s.

=== United States ===
In the United States, "clean coal" was mentioned by former President [[George W. Bush]] on several occasions, including his 2007 [[State of the Union Address]]. Bush's position was that carbon capture and storage technologies should be encouraged as one means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|US Presidential campaign for 2008]], both candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] expressed interest in the development of CCS technologies as part of an overall comprehensive energy plan. The development of pollution mitigation technologies could also create export business for the United States or any other country working on it.

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]], signed in 2009 by President Obama, allocated $3.4 billion for advanced carbon capture and storage technologies, including demonstration projects.

Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that "we should strive to have new electricity generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables,â and former Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu|Dr. Steven Chu]] has said that âIt is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage", noting that even if the U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not.

During the first [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 United States presidential election debate]], [[Mitt Romney]] expressed his support for clean coal, and claimed that current federal policies were hampering the coal industry.&lt;ref name="npr2012-10-03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate|title=Transcript And Audio: First Obama-Romney Debate|date=2012-10-03|publisher=[[Federal News Service]]|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the approach==
Environmentalists such as [[Dan Becker]], director of the [[Sierra Club]]'s Global Warming and Energy Program, believes that the term "clean coal" is misleading: "There is no such thing as clean coal and there never will be. It's an [[oxymoron]]." The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry.

Complaints focus on the environmental impacts of [[coal mining|coal extraction]], high costs to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester carbon]], and uncertainty of how to manage end result [[air pollution|pollutants]] and [[radionuclide]]s. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in reservoirs, aquifers, ''etc.'', is indefinite/permanent.

The palaeontologist and influential environmental activist [[Tim Flannery]] made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations.

Critics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants.

[[The Climate Reality Project|The Reality Coalition]], a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[League of Conservation Voters]], ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called "clean coal".

[[Greenpeace]] is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one [[waste stream]] to another. According to [[Greenpeace USA]]'s Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] speaking in 2012, "even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; âclean coalâ is a distraction from that."

== Clean coal ==
The term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the [[carbon capture and storage]] process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as  [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=March 30, 2017|title=Dear Donald Trump: 'Clean coal' doesn't exist|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/30/clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no/|accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior terminology===
The industry term "clean coal" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use.

U.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|title=The definition of clean coal Â«  Behind The Plug|publisher=|access-date=2012-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221052204/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|archive-date=2013-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before being adopted in this fashion, historically "clean coal" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped. The term appeared in a speech to mine workers in 1918, in context indicating coal that was "free of dirt and impurities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |title="Clean coal" history lesson |access-date=2012-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831064249/http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |archive-date=2012-08-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, prior to World War II, clean coal (also called "smokeless coal") generally referred to [[anthracite]] and high-grade [[bituminous coal]], used for cooking and home heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wva-usa.com/history/mthope/smokeless.php "Smokeless Coal,"] WVa-USA.com, accessed May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conquest of the Desert''' ({{lang-es|Conquista del desierto}}) was a military campaign directed mainly by General [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in the 1870s with the intent to establish [[Argentina|Argentine]] dominance over [[Patagonia]], which was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous peoples]]. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of [[Chile]]an expansion there.

Argentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. [[White people|Ethnic European]] settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a [[breadbasket]] that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"&gt;''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902,'' George V. Rauch, p. 47, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roca&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/13/argentinian-founding-father-genocide-row |title=Argentinian founding father recast as genocidal murderer |first=Rory |last=Carroll |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the [[Occupation of AraucanÃ­a]].

The Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists have described the Conquest as bringing civilisation, while revisionists have labelled it a [[genocide]].

==Background==
The arrival of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonists]] on the shores of the [[RÃ­o de la Plata]] and the foundation of the city of [[Buenos Aires]] during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the [[Spain|Spanish]] and the local Indian tribes, mainly the [[QuerandÃ­]] (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for [[cattle]] raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.

[[File:Mauricio rugendas - el malon.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Mapuches during a [[malÃ³n]] raid]]
The [[frontier]] dividing the colonial farms and the Indian territories gradually moved outwards from Buenos Aires; at the end of the 18th century, the [[Salado River (Buenos Aires)|Salado River]] was the boundary between the civilizations. Many Indians were forced &lt;!--?Explain--&gt; to abandon their tribes to work on the farms. Some assimilated or intermarried with the white population. The group known as [[gaucho]]s developed from working on the ranches.

After Argentina achieved independence in 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled over how to organize. Once these were settled, the government wanted to quickly occupy the lands claimed by the young republic (in part to prevent Chile from encroaching on it). It also wanted to increase the national agricultural production and offer new lands to prospective immigrants.

In 1833 [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in Buenos Aires Province and other military leaders in the [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]] region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time [[Chile]] had founded [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Magellan Strait]] in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in [[Patagonia]]. Later in 1861 Chile began the [[occupation of the AraucanÃ­a]], which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the [[Mapuche]] in their central region. This indigenous tribe had [[araucanization|strong language and cultural ties]] to the nomadic tribes on the east side of the [[Andes]], with whom they share the [[araucanization|same language]].

In 1872 the indigenous leader [[CufulcurÃ¡|CalfucurÃ¡]] and his 6,000 followers attacked the cities of [[General Alvear, Mendoza|General Alvear]], [[Veinticinco de Mayo, Buenos Aires|Veinticinco de Mayo]] and [[Nueve de Julio, Buenos Aires Province|Nueve de Julio]]. They killed 300 settlers and drove off 200,000 head of cattle. These events were a catalyst for the government to mount the Conquest of the Desert.

The Indians drove the stolen cattle from the incursions (''[[malÃ³n|malones]]'') to Chile through the [[Camino de los chilenos|Rastrillada de los chilenos]] and traded them for goods. The historian George V. Rauch notes evidence that Chilean authorities knew about the origin of the cattle and consented to the trading in order to strengthen their influence over Patagonian territories. They expected eventually to occupy those lands in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch (1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alsina's campaign==
[[Image:Mapa ARGENTINA frontera.png|thumb|200px|right|Map of the advance of the Argentina frontier until the establishment of  [[zanja de Alsina]]]]
In 1875 [[Adolfo Alsina]], Minister of War under [[President of Argentina|President]] [[NicolÃ¡s Avellaneda]], presented the government with a plan which he later described as having the goal "to populate the desert, and not to destroy the Indians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm "ReseÃ±a sobre la historia de NeuquÃ©n"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501154410/http://www.neuquen.gov.ar/org/cultura/historiadeneuquen.htm |date=2006-05-01 }}, Government of the [[NeuquÃ©n Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step was to connect Buenos Aires and the ''Fortines'' (fortresses) with telegraph lines. The government signed a peace treaty with [[lonco|chieftain]] [[Juan JosÃ© Catriel]]. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain ''[[NamuncurÃ¡]]'' and 3,500 warriors, he attacked [[Tres Arroyos]], [[Tandil]], [[Azul, Buenos Aires|Azul]], and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and NamuncurÃ¡'s forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch )1999), ''The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Alsina attacked the Indians, forcing them to fall back, and leaving ''fortines'' on his way south to protect the conquered territories. He also constructed the 374&amp;nbsp;km long trench named [[zanja de Alsina]] ("Alsina's trench"). It was supposed to be a fortified border to the unconquered territories.  Three metres wide and two metres deep, it served as an obstacle to cattle drives by the Indians.

The Indians continued taking cattle from farms in the Buenos Aires Province and the south of the [[Mendoza Province]], but found it difficult to escape as the animals slowed their march. They had to confront the patrolling units that followed them. As the war went on, some Indians eventually signed peace treaties and settled among the "Christians" behind the lines of forts. Some tribes allied with the Argentine government, standing neutral or, less often, fighting for the Argentine army. In return, they were granted periodical shipments of cattle and food. After Alsina died in 1877, Julio Argentino Roca was appointed Minister of War, and decided to change the strategy.

==Roca's campaign==
[[File:Mapa ARGENTINA 1881.png|thumb|190px|The changing state of Argentina]] 
[[Julio Argentino Roca]], in contrast to Alsina, believed that the only solution against the Indian threat was to extinguish, subdue or expel them.

{{Quote|Our self-respect as a virile people obliges us to put down as soon as possible, by reason or by force, this handful of savages who destroy our wealth and prevent us from definitely occupying, in the name of law, progress and our own security, the richest and most fertile lands of the Republic.|Julio Argentino Roca|&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: Kenneth M. Roth. ''Annihilating Difference: The Anthropology of Genocide''. University of California Press, 2002. Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the end of 1878 he started the first sweep to "clean" the area between the Alsina trench and the [[RÃ­o Negro (Argentina)|Negro river]] by continuous and systematic attacks on the Indian settlements. On 6 December 1878, elements of the PuÃ¡n Division under Colonel Teodoro GarcÃ­a clashed with a war party at the LihuÃ© Calel heights. In a brief but hard fought battle, 50 Indians were killed, 270 captured, and 33 settlers were freed.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 45, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous armed encounters would follow, until by December 1878, over 4,000 Indians had been captured and 400 killed, 150 settlers freed and 15,000 head of cattle recovered.&lt;ref name="Boundary Dispute With Chile 1902, p. 45"/&gt;

With 6,000 soldiers armed with new [[Remington Rolling Block rifle|breech-loading Remington rifles]], in 1879 he began the second sweep reaching [[Choele Choel]] in two months, after killing 1,313 Indians and capturing over 15,000.&lt;ref name="fifteenthousand"/&gt; From other points, southbound companies made their way down to the Negro River and the [[NeuquÃ©n River]], a northern tributary of the Negro River. Together, both rivers marked the natural frontier from the [[Andes]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm "Poblamiento Pampeano"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227080911/http://www.mce.lapampa.gov.ar/archivohistorico/PAGES/m_ind_frontera.htm |date=2005-12-27 }} â Ministry of Culture of the [[la Pampa Province]] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack led to a large migration of Mapuches into the zone around [[Curarrehue]] and [[PucÃ³n]], Chile.

Many settlements were built on the basin of these two rivers, as well as a number on the [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado River]]. By sea, some settlements were erected on the southern basin of the [[Chubut River]] mainly by [[Welsh people|Welsh colonists]] in [[y Wladfa]].

==The final campaign==
Roca followed NicolÃ¡s Avellaneda as [[President of Argentina|president]]. He thought it was imperative to conquer the territory south of the [[RÃ­o Negro (Argentina)|Negro River]] as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign under the control of Colonel [[Conrado Villegas]].

Within a year Villegas conquered the [[NeuquÃ©n Province]] (he reached the [[Limay River]]). The campaign continued to push the Indian resistance further south, to fight the last battle on October 18, 1884. The last rebel group of over 3,000 members under the command of chieftains Inacayal and Foyel surrendered two months later in present [[Chubut Province]].

==Border clashes==
To counteract the Argentine conquest of Patagonia, the Chileans supplied arms, ammunition and horses to their Indian Mapuche allies.&lt;ref&gt;5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982, Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 1883, a 10-man section of a platoon of the Argentine Army in pursuit of a large Indian war party, ran into an ambush in the PulmarÃ­ Valley set up by Chilean soldiers, and in the engagement that followed Captain Emilio Crouzeilles along with Lieutenant Nicolas Lazcano and several privates were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Historia de las misiones salesianas en La Pampa, RepÃºblica Argentina
, Volume 1, Lorenzo Massa, p. 169, Editorial Don Bosco, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 1883, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan DÃ­az, at the head of a 16-man Argentine infantry detachment, was trailing a war party of 100 to 150 Indians. Upon reaching PulmarÃ­ Valley, they were surrounded by the Indians and around 50 Chilean soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the Argentine soldiers skillfully outfought their attackers, including a bayonet charge mounted by the Chilean detachment.&lt;ref&gt;The Argentine Military and the Boundary Dispute With Chile, 1870-1902, George V. Rauch, p. 49, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 1883, according to Argentine Army Major Manuel Prado, 150-200 Indians armed with Winchesters and [[MartiniâHenry]] rifles attacked an Argentine Army detachment operating on the Argentine-Chilean border, and in a four-hour engagement killed or wounded 22 Argentine soldiers at a cost of some 100 warriors.

==Historical controversy==
{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}
Historian Jens Andermann has noted that contemporary sources on the campaign indicate that the Conquest was intended by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government to exterminate the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Argentina|indigenous tribes]], and thus attempt genocide.&lt;ref name="genocide"&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/llc/subjects/span_lat_amer/span_lat_amer_staff/ja Andermann, Jens].  [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ibamuseum/texts/Andermann02.htm ''Argentine Literature and the 'Conquest of the Desert', 1872-1896''], [[Birkbeck, University of London]]. Quote: "It is this sudden acceleration, this abrupt change from the discourse of 'defensive warfare' and 'merciful civilization' to that of 'offensive warfare' and of genocide, which is perhaps the most distinctive mark of the literature of the Argentine frontier."&lt;/ref&gt; First-hand accounts state that Argentine troops killed prisoners and committed "mass executions".&lt;ref name=genocide /&gt; The 15,000 Indians taken captive "became servants or prisoners and were prevented from having children."&lt;ref name=fifteenthousand /&gt;&lt;ref name=roca /&gt;

Apologists perceive the campaign as intending to conquer specifically those groups of Indians that refused to submit to Argentine law and frequently carried out brutal attacks on frontier civilian settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''State Building and Political Movements in Argentina, 1860-1916''. Stanford University Press, 2002, pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; In these attacks, Indians stole many horses and cattle, killed men defending their livestock and captured women and children to become the [[slaves]] and/or forced brides of Indian warriors.&lt;ref&gt;''Argentina: Countries of the World,'' Erika Wittekind, p. 67, ABDO, 01/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Captive Women: Oblivion And Memory In Argentina,'' [[Susana Rotker]], p.32, University of Minnesota Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' alleged in 2011 that two education officials lost their jobs due to the controversy over the Conquest of the Desert: It alleged that Juan JosÃ© Cresto was forced to resign as a director of the Argentine National Historical Museum because he "said the Indians were violent parasites who attacked farms and kidnapped women"&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; and Beatriz Horn, a history teacher in [[La Pampa Province]], was fired for "telling a radio station that Roca deserved praise for putting Indians to flight and opening Argentina's frontier to European settlers."&lt;ref name=roca /&gt; Argentine news sources, however, report Juan JosÃ© Cresto lost his job for being abusive and violent towards employees&lt;ref&gt;http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/03/25/s-03201.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the firing of Beatriz Horn was primarily due to her praise for the military dictator [[Leopoldo Galtieri]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lagaceta.com.ar/nota/380889/argentina/Actualidad_nacional.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|thumb|350px|Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone inscription]]

The '''Conscientious Objectors' Commemorative Stone''' is on the north side of [[Tavistock Square]], [[Bloomsbury]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]].

In 1994 a stone commemorating "men and women [[conscientious objector]]s all over the world and in every age" by Hugh Court&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppu.org.uk/memorials/peace/london/costone.html&lt;/ref&gt; was unveiled in Tavistock Square.

==Erection==
The erection of this massive slate stone to commemorate the struggle of conscientious objectors past and present was co-ordinated by the [[Peace Pledge Union]] (PPU) and unveiled by Sir [[Michael Tippett]], President of the PPU and a former Conscientious Objector, on 15 May 1994 in Tavistock Square. 

==History==
The idea of having a stone dedicated to conscientious objectors (COs) to war began in 1976 at the funeral of a conscientious objector, Joseph Brett, who had been imprisoned in 1916.  Bill McIlroy, then Secretary of the National Secular Society (NSS), officiated, and happened to remark that perhaps one day COs would be commemorated, as armed forces personnel are, both nationally and locally in the places where they lived.

Edna Mathieson, niece of Joseph Brett, and a member of the Inner London Education Authority (sub group of the Greater London Council), approached the GLC for help, and in 1981 the GLC Labour Group accepted the idea and the Greater London Regional Labour Party agreed.  But when, after the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the London Residuary Board took over the GLCâs commitments, agreement to a physical commemoration of COs was lost. Mathieson turned to Lambeth Council, and Lambeth initiated a competition in all London art schools for a suitable piece of sculpture, to be set up next to County Hall (GLC's headquarters), situated in Lambeth. Lambeth Council then found that, because of cuts, it could not afford to sponsor the arrangements for such a monument.

Finally, Mathieson approached the PPU, who agreed to help with the whole concept, including design, location and raising finances. Camden Council (its local council) was asked for permission to erect a stone in Tavistock Square. On 15 May 1993, International Conscientious Objectors' Day, a public appeal was launched by means of a letter in ''The Guardian'', headed by Sir Michael Tippett.

Granite had been considered as material, as it is the strongest stone â symbolic of those who refused against the odds to fight.  However, when the PPUâs architectural adviser, Hugh Court, and sculptor, Paul Wehrle, went to Cumbria in search of a stone, they were so attracted to a naturally shaped piece of grey-green volcanic slate, some 400 million years old and rather larger than the size originally envisaged, they chose that.

The PPU decided upon the form of words for the stone with an addition of âTheir foresight and courage give us hopeâ, written by a Dublin wordsmith.

==Annual act of remembrance==
In 1998 Mathieson pressed for the rest of Bill McIlroy's idea to be implemented - an annual event for the commemoration of all COs. A planning group was established at a Conway Hall meeting (in the Bertrand Russell Room) and Jess Hodgkins, a Unitarian, suggested the group be called the Right to Refuse to Kill Group (RRK). Ever since there has been an annual memorial event every year at noon on 15 May, International Conscientious Objectors' Day.

== Inscriptions ==
Around the left, top, and right edges:
{{quote|TO COMMEMORATE MEN &amp; WOMEN&lt;br /&gt;CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS TO MILITARY SERVICE&lt;br /&gt;ALL OVER THE WORLD &amp; IN EVERY AGE}}

In the centre:
{{quote|TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE&lt;br /&gt;ESTABLISHED AND&lt;br /&gt;ARE MAINTAINING&lt;br /&gt;THE RIGHT TO&lt;br /&gt;REFUSE TO KILL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their foresight and&lt;br /&gt;courage give us hope}}

Along the bottom edge:
{{quote|THIS STONE WAS DEDICATED ON 15 MAY 1994&lt;br /&gt;INTERNATIONAL CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS' DAY}}

==Nearby related public art==
Also in Tavistock Square is a statue of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], sculpted by [[Fredda Brilliant]] and installed in 1968 and a cherry tree planted in 1967 in memory of the victims of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear bombing]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].

With the Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone, the three features have led to the square unofficially being regarded by some as a peace park or garden.  Annual ceremonies are held at each of these memorials including International [[Conscientious Objectors]] Day, 15 May.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Cyclopean image''' is a single mental [[image]] of a scene created by the [[human brain|brain]] by combining two images received from the two [[human eye|eye]]s. The mental process behind construction of the Cyclopean image is crucial to [[Stereopsis|stereo vision]]. [[Autostereogram]]s take advantage of this process to trick the brain into forming an apparent Cyclopean image from seemingly random patterns.

Cyclopean image is named after the mythical [[Cyclops]] with a single eye. Literally it refers to the way stereo sighted viewers perceive the centre of their fused visual field as lying between the two physical eyes, as if seen by a cyclopean eye. Alternative terms for cyclopean eye include third central imaginary eye and binoculus.

The term ''cyclopean stimuli'' refers to a form of visual stimuli that is defined by binocular disparity alone. It was named after the one-eyed [[Cyclops]] of [[Homer]]âs [[Odyssey]] by [[Bela Julesz]].  Julesz was a Hungarian radar engineer.  He thought that [[stereopsis]] might help to discover hidden objects, this might be useful to find camouflaged objects.  The important aspect of this research that Julesz showed using random dot stereograms was that disparity is sufficient for stereopsis, where [[Charles Wheatstone]] had only shown that binocular disparity was necessary for stereopsis.  The Cyclops would not have been able to see a cyclopean stimulus, because having only one eye, he would not have been able to perceive binocular depth cues such as binocular disparity.

The '''Dark Enlightenment''', or the '''neoreactionary movement'''âalso known simply as '''neoreaction''' and abbreviated '''NRx''' by its proponentsâis an [[Anti-democratic thought|anti-democratic]] and [[reactionary]] movement that considers itself to be the antithesis to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It broadly rejects [[egalitarianism]] and the view that history shows inevitable progression towards greater liberty and enlightenment, thus it is in part a reaction against "[[Whig history|Whig historiography]]".&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pein|first=Corey|date=19 May 2014|title=Mouthbreathing Machiavellis Dream of a Silicon Reich|url=http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|newspaper=The Baffler|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209130630/http://thebaffler.com/blog/mouthbreathing-machiavellis|archivedate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TDT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett|first=Jamie|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jamiebartlett/100012093/meet-the-dark-enlightenment-sophisticated-neo-fascism-thats-spreading-fast-on-the-net/|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Meet The Dark Enlightenment: sophisticated neo-fascism that's spreading fast on the net|date=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement favors a return to older [[Social constructionism|societal constructs]] and forms of government, including support for [[monarchism]] and other forms of leadership such as a "neo[[Cameralism|cameralist]] CEO"&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/|title=Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement|date=10 February 2017|website=The Atlantic|last=Gray|first=Rosie}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448230/problems-mencius-moldbug-neoreaction|title=Against Mencius Moldbug's 'Neoreaction'|author=Steorts, Jason Lee|date=5 June 2017|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with a [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] or [[Economic nationalism|economic nationalist]] approach to economics.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Walther|url=http://spectator.org/blog/57516/dark-enlightenment-silly-not-scary|title=The Dark Enlightenment Is Silly Not Scary|website=[[The American Spectator]]|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents generally also espouse [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] views on such matters as [[gender role]]s, [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] and [[Human migration|migration]].

== Summary of core ideas &lt;!--'Neocameralism' redirects here--&gt; ==
[[File:Mencius Moldbug.jpg|thumb|[[Curtis Yarvin]], an early exponent of neoreactionary thought]]
Some of the impetus for the neoreactionary movement comes from libertarians like [[Peter Thiel]] as indicated by [[Nick Land]]'s essay "The Dark Enlightenment", which noted how libertarian thinkers at an April 2009 ''[[Cato Unbound]]'' discussion expressed skepticism about the compatibility of freedom and democracy.&lt;ref name="land-tde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/|title=The Dark Enlightenment|author=Land, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yarvin's preferred systemânamed '''neocameralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; after [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]'s system of [[Prussian cameralism]]&lt;ref name="unhappy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/81/125815/on-the-unhappy-consciousness-of-neoreactionaries/|title=On the Unhappy Consciousness of Neoreactionaries|author=Hui, Yuk|date=April 2017|publisher=e-flux}}&lt;/ref&gt;âis a system in which a business owns the country,&lt;ref name="behind"/&gt; which is structured as a joint stock corporation divvied up into shares and run by a CEO to maximize profit.&lt;ref name="bears"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leapleapleap.com/2015/06/bears-will-never-steal-your-car-reacting-to-the-neoreactionaries/|title=Bears Will Never Steal Your Car|author=Goodman, Matthew Shen|date=9 June 2015|publisher=Leap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Thiel and [[Patri Friedman]] have backed the [[Seasteading Institute]] as one possible way of building fiefdoms free of outside regulation and law.&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

Neoreactionary Michael Perilloux proposes that President [[Donald Trump]] seize more power by canceling the [[United States Constitution]], declaring [[martial law]] and replacing the government with [[The Trump Organization]].&lt;ref name="warmed"/&gt; Similarly, Google engineer [[Justine Tunney]] [[Justine Tunney#Petition to install a .22CEO of America.22|circulated a petition]] to appoint Google chairman [[Eric Schmidt]] as CEO of America.&lt;ref name="TB" /&gt;

Some neoreactionary futurists focus more on the use of technology to defeat the state, for example, through transhumanist [[accelerationism]] in which the select few free themselves from the bonds of the state by evolving into superintelligent human-computer hybrids.&lt;ref name="terrifying" /&gt; One proponent of such ideas is Michael Anissimov, an advocate of [[eugenics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Specter of Eugenics: IQ, White Supremacy, and Human Enhancement|author=Abbott, Benjamin|date=5 June 2013|publisher=Ethical Technology|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/abbott20130605}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in the words of Mark O'Connell "has in recent years basically cornered the [[white supremacy|white-supremacy]]â[[technological singularity|singularity]] crossover market" and become "something of a pariah from the transhumanist movement". Rejecting the notion that all humans are created equal, Anissimov believes that there are already [[race and intelligence|disparities in intelligence between existing races]] and that transhuman technologies will create further disparities in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/the-techno-libertarians-praying-for-dystopia.html|title=The Techno-Libertarians Praying for Dystopia|author=O'Connell, Mark|publisher=New York Magazine|date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that aristocratic systems are more financially stable and less wasteful than democratic or communist systems.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;

== History and etymology&lt;!--'Formalism (Yarvin)' redirects here--&gt;==
Dylan Matthews argues that neoreaction draws on the racialist, traditionalist and isolationist arguments of [[paleoconservatism]] as well as paleoconservatives' belief that the mainstream is trying to crush them. Differences between the two movements are that paleoconservatives are more religious and have more faith in the United States Constitution and republican ideals generally.&lt;ref name=warmed&gt;{{cite web|title=The alt-right is more than warmed-over white supremacy.

In 2007 and 2008, [[Curtis Yarvin]]âwriting under the [[pen name]] Mencius Moldbugâarticulated what would develop into Dark Enlightenment thinking. Yarvin's theories were later the subject of Nick Land, who first coined the term "Dark Enlightenment" in his essay of the same name.&lt;ref name="land-tde" /&gt; The term "Dark Enlightenment" is a play-on-words for the knowledge supposedly gained in the Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="TDT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon|last=Phillips|url=https://secure.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2014/fall/Troublesome-Sources|title=Troublesome Sources|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Fall 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Land: "Where the progressive enlightenment sees political ideals, the dark enlightenment sees appetites"&lt;ref name="land-tde"/&gt;âon the view that the tendency of sovereign power (in democracies) is to devour society.

Yarvin had originally called his ideology '''formalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a term inspired from [[legal formalism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A formalist manifesto|url = http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/04/formalist-manifesto-originally-posted.html|website = Unqualified Reservations|accessdate = 21 June 2015|date = 23 April 2007|last = Moldbug|first = Mencius}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Arnold Kling]] used the term "The Neo-Reactionaries" as a noun in July 2010 to describe Moldbug and fellows and the term was quickly adopted by the subculture.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: Geeks for Monarchy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/the_neo-reactio.html|first=Arnold|last=Kling|authorlink=Arnold Kling|title=The Neo-Reactionaries|work=EconLog|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|date=18 July 2010|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Riggio, the embryo of the neoreactionary movement lived in the community pages of [[LessWrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://social-epistemology.com/2016/09/23/the-violence-of-pure-reason-neoreaction-a-basilisk-adam-riggio/|title=The Violence of Pure Reason|author=Riggio, Adam|publisher=Social Epistemology Review &amp; Reply Collective|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social Matter'' is a major online publication and thought machine for neoreaction.&lt;ref name=risealt&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Rise of the Alt-Right Movement|author=Summers, Ryan T.|journal=Media and Communication Studies Summer Fellows|url=http://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=media_com_sum|date=2017|number=11| page=6 | quote=The ideology is also enthralled with hyper-masculine visions of men. In Post-Anathema, a Tumblr page, common images depict soldiers with guns, tanks, spacecraft, and Greek Gods.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoreactionaries have often declined reporters' requests for interviews, explaining that journalistsâas [[Manufacturing Consent|manufacturers of consent]]âare their mortal enemy. When ''[[The Atlantic]]'' political affairs reporter [[Rosie Gray]] attempted to interview neoreactionary leaders, Yarvin suggested she instead "speak directly to my WH [[Cut-out (espionage)|cutout]] / [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] leader"âa sarcastic reference to widely reported yet unsubstantiated rumors that Yarvin had ties to [[White House Chief Strategist]] [[Steve Bannon]]âwhile Nick B. Steves told her she was ill-suited to write about neo-reaction because "115 IQ people are not generally well equipped to summarize 160 IQ people".&lt;ref name=behind/&gt;

== Relation to other movements ==
=== Relation to the alt-right ===
Some consider the Dark Enlightenment as an early school of thought in the [[alt-right]],&lt;ref name="qz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali|title=How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt Right Movement|last=Gray|first=Rosie|date=28 December 2015|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as its most theoretically minded branch.&lt;ref name=warmed/&gt; In particular, one philosopher with Landian ideas, [[Jason Reza Jorjani]], co-founded AltRight.com and spoke at the 2016 [[National Policy Institute]] conference led by white supremacist [[Richard B. Spencer|Richard Spencer]].&lt;ref name=goldhill&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1007144/the-neo-fascist-philosophy-that-underpins-both-the-alt-right-and-silicon-valley-technophiles/|title=The neo-fascist philosophy that underpins both the alt-right and Silicon Valley technophiles|author=Goldhill, Olivia|date=18 June 2017|publisher=Quartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have also labeled the Dark Enlightenment as "[[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]]"&lt;ref name="TDT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vocativ&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217072334/http://www.vocativ.com/12-2013/dark-enlightenment-creepy-internet-movement-youd-better-take-seriously/|url=http://www.vocativ.com/12-2013/dark-enlightenment-creepy-internet-movement-youd-better-take-seriously/|archivedate=17 December 2013|date=2 December 2013|first=Matt|last=Sigl|work=Vocativ|title=The Dark Enlightenment: The Creepy Internet Movement Youâd Better Take Seriously}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as "an acceleration of capitalism to a fascist point", although Land argues this is inaccurate because fascism "is a mass [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] movement".&lt;ref name=goldhill/&gt; Land states:&lt;ref name="behind" /&gt;{{quotation|NRx doesn't think the Alt-Right (in America) is very serious. It's an essentially Anti-Anglo-American philosophy, in its ([[Aleksandr Dugin|Duginist]]) core, which puts a firm ceiling on its potential. But then, the NRx analysis is that the age of the masses is virtually over. Riled-up populist movements are part of what is passing, rather than of what is slouching toward Bethlehem to be born.}}
James Kirchick notes that although neoreactionary thinkers disdain the masses and claim to despise populism and people more generally, what ties them to the rest of the alt-right is their unapologetically racist element, their shared [[misanthropy]] and their resentment of mismanagement by the ruling elites.&lt;ref name=terrifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-terrifying-online-brigades/|title=Trumpâs Terrifying Online Brigades|author=Kirchick, James|date=16 May 2016|publisher=Commentary Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duesterberg observes: "As a rule the alt right is scattered, anonymous and obscureâthriving, as the curious metaphor has it, in the 'dark corners of the internet.' By contrast, neoreaction is centralized and public: darkness enlightened".&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepointmag.com/2017/politics/final-fantasy-neoreactionary-politics-liberal-imagination|title=Final Fantasy|author=Duesterberg, James|publisher=The Point|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A criticism of neoreaction is that its pessimistic appraisal of [[progressivism]]'s results dismisses many advances that have been made, including greater freedom for women, racial minorities and homosexuals; increased security for the elderly and unemployed; greater access to health care by the poor; steep declines in world [[poverty]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/brin20131130|author=Brin, David|publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|date=30 November 2013|title="Neo-Reactionaries" drop all pretense: End democracy and bring back lords!}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved [[air quality]]; greater [[religious tolerance]] and [[racial integration]]; lower [[crime rate]]s; and an absence of [[world war]]s since 1945. They also point to the culture of London, whose population is 40 percent nonwhite; and the high standard of living and continental peace in the [[European Union]]. Another criticism is that [[Economic globalization#Global supply chain|global manufacturing patterns]] limit the economic independence that sovereign states can have from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sullivan, Andrew|date=30 April 2017|title=Why the reactionary right must be taken seriously|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/andrew-sullivan-why-the-reactionary-right-must-be-taken-seriously.html|publisher=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the critics who felt the Dark Enlightenment's pessimistic assessment was unsupported by economic data formed the Grey Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/19/eigenmorality-and-the-dark-enlightenment/|date=19 July 2014|publisher=TechCrunch|author=Evans, Jon|title=Eigenmorality And The Dark Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ryan T. Summers observes: "For the most part, neoreactionaries do not emphasize anti-Semitic views as other alt-right counterparts".&lt;ref name="risealt" /&gt;

The timing of onset of developmental regression can be established by repeated medical evaluations, prior photographs and home movies. Whether the neurologic decline is predominantly affecting the [[gray matter]] or the [[white matter]] of the brain needs to be ascertained.  Seizures or [[EEG]] changes, movement disorders, blindness with retinal changes, personality changes and [[dementia]] are features suggestive of [[grey matter]] involvement.&lt;ref name=brad/&gt;

'''Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration''' ('''DDR'''), or '''disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, reintegration and resettlement''' ('''DDRRR''') are applied strategies for executing successful [[peacekeeping]] operations, and is generally the strategy employed by all [[UN Peacekeeping Operations]] following civil wars. '''Disarmament''' entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.); '''demobilization''' entails the disbanding of armed groups; while '''reintegration''' describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, ensuring against the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict.

DDR is somewhat different from the blanket term "peacekeeping", in that DDR requires certain conditions to be effectively implemented. For demobilisation and reintegration to occur, there must first be a successful disarmament of armed groups. In general terms, parties to a conflict must be willing to negotiate a peace settlement and bring an end to the conflict. If there is no end in sight, or not all parties are willing to negotiate a peace, this will make it difficult to establish trust between each party. Disarmament measures must also be applied to all parties of a conflict. One case that highlights both these elements is that of [[Somalia]]. The [[UN]] and [[US]] began disarming selected armed groups but not all, and there was no peace agreement agreed or on-going. Those groups who had been disarmed were then targeted by groups who had not been disarmed, and the violence continued.

As mentioned above, trust is also a key factor of successful DDR, specifically in relation to disarming armed groups. Small scale acts may help engender trust on both sides, such as public appearances of group leaders together with international mediators. To strengthen trust, public bonfires of weapons taken from all parties to violence will show the disarming groups that the other groups are also handing over their weapons.

==Challenges of DDR==

One challenge or difficulty, as highlighted above, is that of forming trust between the different armed groups. If no peace agreement has already been reached but armed groups wish to start the DDR process, then the underlying issues that led to the violence in the first instance must be addressed. DDR cannot be approached as a purely technocratic exercise, and to not address the grievances of each group may seriously undermine or negatively influence the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/05679329608449368?instName=King%2527s+College+London|journal = The Adelphi Papers|pages = 5â8|volume = 36|issue = 303|doi = 10.1080/05679329608449368|first = Mats R.|last = Berdal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further challenges appear when we consider reintegration of ex-combatants. Unlike other aspects of peace agreements such as strengthening democratic institutions, introducing fair elections and governmental structures, the reintegration of ex-combatants back into civilian society may be difficult to accurately monitor. This in part is due to its social nature: how do you measure how ex-combatants have integrated with society? How can you measure the societal cohesion that DDR aims to promote throughout the affected region?

[[Civil war]] often involves high degrees of [[communal violence]], and this poses a particular challenge for fighters who may have joined armed groups that committed violent acts in the ex-combatants communities. Even if the individual ex-combatant in question did not commit violent acts against their own community, they may still face difficulties being accepted back if associated with a group that did. This may lead to disjointed familial ties, communal tensions, or ex-fighters choosing not to return home altogether. As such, it may be possible to successfully reintegrate fighters back into civilian society, but reintegrating them back into their own communities may be a much harder task.

==Requirements for successful DDR implementation==

There are 6 aspects to a successful DDR conversion:

# Reduction of military expenditure
# Reorientation of military research and development
# Conversion of the [[arms industry]]
# [[Demobilization]] and reintegration
# Redevelopment of troops
# Safe disposal and management of "surplus weapons"

Demobilization is one aspect of conversion.

==Conclusion==

To assess the impact of demobilization one has to consider the resources involved, the dynamic processes of production, redistribution and the different factors and actors in policy making and implementation. The ultimate objective of demobilization and reintegration efforts should be to improve the welfare of people. Demobilization of combatants frees human potential that can contribute to achieving these objectives.

It is the first of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. The term is also found in scriptures of [[Hinduism]], such as the [[Upanishads]], in discussions of [[moksha]] (spiritual liberation).&lt;ref name=olivellebu4414/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deussen1980p497"/&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
''Dukkha'' (Pali; Sanskrit ''duá¸¥kha'') is a term found in ancient Indian literature, meaning anything that is "uneasy, uncomfortable, unpleasant, difficult, causing pain or sadness".{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA324|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|pages=324â325}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a concept in Indian religions about the nature of life that innately includes the "unpleasant", "suffering," "pain," "sorrow", "distress", "grief" or "misery."{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483}}&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; The term ''Dukkha'' does not have a one word English translation, and embodies diverse aspects of unpleasant human experiences.&lt;ref name=peterharvey26/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhysdavids324/&gt; It is opposed to the word ''[[sukha]]'', meaning "happiness," "comfort" or "ease."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

The word is commonly explained as a derivation from Aryan terminology for an axle hole, referring to an axle hole which is not in the center and leads to a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. According to Winthrop Sargeant,{{quote|The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic, horse- and cattle-breeding people who travelled in horse- or ox-drawn vehicles. ''Su'' and ''dus'' are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word ''kha'', in later Sanskrit meaning "sky," "ether," or "space," was originally the word for "hole," particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryan's vehicles. Thus ''sukha'' â¦ meant, originally, "having a good axle hole," while ''duhkha'' meant "having a poor axle hole," leading to discomfort.{{sfn|Sargeant|2009|p=303}}}}

[[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], American [[vipassana]] teacher and writer, explains the etymology as follows:
{{quote|The word ''dukkha'' is made up of the prefix ''du'' and the root ''kha''. ''Du'' means âbadâ or âdifficult.â ''Kha'' means âempty.â âEmpty,â here, refers to several thingsâsome specific, others more general. One of the specific meanings refers to the empty axle hole of a wheel. If the axle fits badly into the center hole, we get a very bumpy ride. This is a good analogy for our ride through [[saá¹sÄra]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=289}}}}

However, according to [[Monier Monier-Williams]], the actual roots of the [[Pali]] term [[wikt:dukkha|''dukkha'']] appear to be [[Sanskrit]] [[wikt:à¤¦à¥à¤¸à¥-|à¤¦à¥à¤¸à¥-]] (''dus-'', "bad") + [[wikt:à¤¸à¥à¤¥à¤¾|à¤¸à¥à¤¥à¤¾]] (''stha'', "to stand").{{Sfn|Monier-Williams|1899|p=483, entry note:&amp;nbsp;|ps="according to grammarians properly written ''dush-kha'' and said to be from ''dus'' and ''kha'' [cf. ''su-khÃ¡'']; but more probably a PrÄkritized form for duá¸¥-stha'', q.v."}}  Regular phonological changes in the development of Sanskrit into the various [[Prakrit]]s led to a shift from ''dus-sthÄ'' to ''duá¸¥kha'' to ''dukkha''.

==Buddhism==
Contemporary translators of Buddhist texts use a variety of English words to convey the aspects of ''dukkha''. Early Western translators of Buddhist texts (before the 1970s) typically translated the Pali term ''dukkha'' as "suffering." Later translators have emphasized that "suffering" is too limited a translation for the term dukkha, and have preferred to either leave the term untranslated or to clarify that translation with terms such as anxiety, distress, frustration, unease, unsatisfactoriness, etc.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle locations 524-528}}{{sfn|Prebish|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2003}} Many contemporary teachers, scholars, and translators have used the term "unsatisfactoriness" to emphasize the subtlest aspects of dukkha.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|1998|p=38}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=61}}{{sfn|Smith|Novak|2009|loc=Kindle location 2769}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 932-934}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=6}} Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha'',{{refn|group=note|Contemporary translators have used a variety of English words to translate the term ''dukkha''; translators commonly use different words to translate aspects of the term. For example, ''dukkha'' has been translated as follows in many contexts:
* Suffering (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Gombrich, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ajahn Succito, Chogyam Trungpa, Rupert Gethin, Dalai Lama, ''et al.'')
* Pain (Harvey, Williams, Keown, Anderson, Huxter, Gombrich, et al)
* Unsatisfactoriness (Dalai Lama, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Rupert Gethin, ''et al.'')
* Stress [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]](&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.086.than.html bottom

* Misery
* Anxiety (Chogyam Trungpa, ''The Truth of Suffering'', pp.&amp;nbsp;8â10)
* Uneasiness (Chogyam Trungpa)
* Unease (Rupert Gethin)
* Unhappiness}}
and many translators prefer to leave the term untranslated.{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 542-550}}

Within the Buddhist sutras, dukkha is divided in three categories:
* ''Dukkha-dukkha'', the dukkha of painful experiences. This includes the physical and mental sufferings of [[JÄti (Buddhism)|birth]], [[JarÄmaraá¹a|aging]], [[ByÄdhi (Buddhism)|illness]], [[JarÄmaraá¹a|dying]]; distress from what is not desirable.
* ''Viparinama-dukkha'', the dukkha of pleasant or happy experiences changing to unpleasant when the causes and conditions that produced the pleasant experiences cease.
* ''Sankhara-dukkha'', the dukkha of conditioned experience. This includes "a basic unsatisfactoriness pervading all existence, all forms of life, because all forms of life are changing, impermanent and without any inner core or substance."&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1&gt;[http://www.beyondthenet.net/dhamma/fourNoble.htm ''The Four Noble Truths - By Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt; On this level, the term indicates a lack of satisfaction, a sense that things never measure up to our expectations or standards.

Various sutras sum up how life in this "mundane world" is regarded to be ''dukkha'', starting with ''[[saá¹sÄra|samsara]]'', the ongoing process of death and rebirth itself:{{refn|group=note|name="PW"|Paul Williams: "All rebirth is due to karma and is impermanent. Short of attaining enlightenment, in each rebirth one is born and dies, to be reborn elsewhere in accordance with the completely impersonal causal nature of one's own karma. The endless cycle of birth, rebirth, and redeath, is samsara."{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}}}
# [[JÄti (Buddhism)|Birth]] is dukkha, [[JarÄmaraá¹a|aging]] is dukkha, [[ByÄdhi (Buddhism)|illness]] is dukkha, [[JarÄmaraá¹a|death]] is dukkha; 
# Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are dukkha; 
# Association with the unbeloved is dukkha; separation from the loved is dukkha; 
# Not getting what is wanted is dukkha. 
# In conclusion, the five [[skandhas|clinging-aggregates]] are dukkha.

''Dukkha'' is one of the [[three marks of existence]], namely ''dukkha'' ("suffering"), ''[[anatta]]'' (not-self), ''[[anicca]]'' ("impermanence").

The Buddhist tradition emphasizes the importance of developing insight into the nature of ''dukkha'', the conditions that cause it, and how it can be overcome. This process is formulated in the teachings on the [[Four Noble Truths]].

==Hinduism==
In [[Hindu]] literature, the earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|á¹£}}ads]] â the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bá¹hadÄraá¹yaka}}]] and the [[Chandogya Upanishad|{{IAST|ChÄndogya}}]] â in all likelihood predate the advent of Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|See, e.g., [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1996), ''Upani{{IAST|á¹£}}ads'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), {{ISBN|978-0-19-283576-5}}, p. xxxvi: "The scholarly consensus, well-founded I think, is that the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|Bá¹hadÄraá¹yaka}}]] and the {{IAST|ChÄndogya}} are the two earliest [[Upanishads|Upani{{IAST|á¹£}}ads]]....  The two texts as we have them are, in all likelihood, pre-Buddhist; placing them in the seventh to sixth centuries BCE may be reasonable, give or take a century or so."}}  In these scriptures of Hinduism, the Sanskrit word ''du{{IAST|á¸¥}}kha'' (à¤¦à¥à¤à¤) appears in the sense of "suffering, sorrow, distress", and in the context of a spiritual pursuit and liberation through the knowledge of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul/self).&lt;ref name=olivellebu4414/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deussen1980p497"&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniá¹£ads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR497| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=482â485, 497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n281/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of sorrow and suffering, and self-knowledge as a means to overcome it, appears extensively with other terms in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniá¹£ads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC | year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|pages=112, 161, 176, 198, 202â203, 235, 455, etc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Duhkha'' also appears in many other middle and later post-Buddhist Upanishads such as the verse 6.20 of [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniá¹£ads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR326| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the [[Bhagavada Gita]], all in the context of [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Paul Deussen|title=Sixty Upaniá¹£ads of the Veda, Vol. 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mSpQo9q-tIC&amp;pg=PR305| year=1980| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (Reprinted)| isbn=978-81-208-1468-4|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Refn|group=note|See ''Bhagavad Gita'' verses 2.56, 5.6, 6.22-32, 10.4, 13.6-8, 14.16, 17.9, 18.8, etc; {{sfn|Sargeant|2009}}}} The term also appears in the foundational Sutras of the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], such as the opening lines of ''Samkhya karika'' of the [[Samkhya]] school.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/IshvarakRiShNasAnkyakArikA.pdf Samkhya karika] Compiled and indexed by Ferenc Ruzsa (2015), Sanskrit Documents Archives;&lt;br /&gt;Second Translation (Verse 1): Ferenc Ruzsa (1997), The triple suffering - A note on the Samkhya karika, Xth World Sanskrit Conference: Bangalore, University of Hungary, Budapest;&lt;br /&gt;Third Translation (all Verses): [https://archive.org/stream/hinduphilosophys00davi#page/12/mode/2up Samkhyakarika of Iswara Krishna] John Davis (Translator), Trubner, London, University of Toronto Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colebrookesktrans&gt;[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of Buddhism and Hinduism==
Both Hinduism and Buddhism emphasize that one overcomes ''du{{IAST|á¸¥}}kha'' through the development of understanding.{{refn|group=note|For a general discussion of the core Indian spiritual goal of developing transcendent "seeing," see, e.g., Hamilton, Sue (2000/2001), ''Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'', (Oxford: Oxford U. Press), pp. 9-10, {{ISBN|978-0-19-285374-5}}.}} However, the two religions widely differ in the nature of that understanding. Hinduism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of Atman (self, soul) and [[Brahman]], while Buddhism emphasizes the understanding and acceptance of [[Anatta]] (Anatman, non-self, non-soul) as each discusses the means to liberation from ''Dukkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 23â25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p34"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirvana in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SfPcAAAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78336-4|pages=34, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaussian adaptation (GA)''' (also referred to as normal or natural adaptation and sometimes abbreviated as NA) is an [[evolutionary algorithm]] designed for the maximization of manufacturing yield due to statistical deviation of component values of [[signal processing]] systems. In short, GA is a stochastic adaptive process where a number of samples of an ''n''-dimensional vector ''x''[''x''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')] are taken from a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]], ''N''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''M''), having mean ''m'' and [[covariance matrix|moment matrix]] ''M''. The samples are tested for fail or pass. The first- and second-order moments of the Gaussian restricted to the pass samples are ''m*'' and&amp;nbsp;''M*''.

The outcome of ''x'' as a pass sample is determined by a function ''s''(''x''), 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;â¤&amp;nbsp;1, such that ''s''(''x'') is the probability that x will be selected as a pass sample. The average probability of finding pass samples (yield) is

:&lt;math&gt; P(m) = \int s(x) N(x - m)\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Then the theorem of GA states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For any ''s''(''x'') and for any value of ''P&amp;nbsp;''&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q'', there always exist a Gaussian p. d. f. [ [[probability density function]] ] that is adapted for maximum dispersion. The necessary conditions for a local optimum are ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''* and ''M'' proportional to ''M''*. The dual problem is also solved: ''P'' is maximized while keeping the dispersion constant (KjellstrÃ¶m, 1991).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proofs of the theorem may be found in the papers by KjellstrÃ¶m, 1970, and KjellstrÃ¶m &amp; TaxÃ©n, 1981.

Since dispersion is defined as the exponential of entropy/disorder/[[average information]] it immediately follows that the theorem is valid also for those concepts. Altogether, this means that Gaussian adaptation may carry out a simultaneous maximisation of yield and [[average information]] (without any need for the yield or the [[average information]] to be defined as criterion functions).

'''The theorem is valid for all regions of acceptability and all Gaussian distributions'''. It may be used by cyclic repetition of random variation and selection (like the natural evolution). In every cycle a sufficiently large number of Gaussian distributed points are sampled and tested for membership in the region of acceptability. The centre of gravity of the Gaussian, ''m'', is then moved to the centre of gravity of the approved (selected) points, ''m''*. Thus, the process converges to a state of equilibrium fulfilling the theorem. A solution is always approximate because the centre of gravity is always determined for a limited number of points.

It was used for the first time in 1969 as a pure optimization algorithm making the regions of acceptability smaller and smaller (in analogy to [[simulated annealing]], Kirkpatrick 1983). Since 1970 it has been used for both ordinary optimization and yield maximization.

==Natural evolution and Gaussian adaptation==
It has also been compared to the natural evolution of populations of living organisms. In this case ''s''(''x'') is the probability that the individual having an array ''x'' of phenotypes will survive by giving offspring to the next generation; a definition of individual fitness given by Hartl 1981. The yield, ''P'', is replaced by the [[mean fitness]] determined as a mean over the set of individuals in a large population.

Phenotypes are often Gaussian distributed in a large population and a necessary condition for the natural evolution to be able to fulfill the theorem of Gaussian adaptation, with respect to all Gaussian quantitative characters, is that it may push the centre of gravity of the Gaussian to the centre of gravity of the selected individuals. This may be accomplished by the [[HardyâWeinberg law]]. This is possible because the theorem of Gaussian adaptation is valid for any region of acceptability independent of the structure (KjellstrÃ¶m, 1996).

In this case the rules of genetic variation such as crossover, inversion, transposition etcetera may be seen as random number generators for the phenotypes. So, in this sense Gaussian adaptation may be seen as a genetic algorithm.

==How to climb a mountain==
Mean fitness may be calculated provided that the distribution of parameters and the structure of the landscape is known. The real landscape is not known, but figure below shows a fictitious profile (blue) of a landscape along a line (x) in a room spanned by such parameters. The red curve is the mean based on the red bell curve at the bottom of  figure. It is obtained by letting the bell curve slide along the ''x''-axis, calculating the mean at every location. As can be seen, small peaks and pits are smoothed out. Thus, if evolution is started at A with a relatively small variance (the red bell curve), then climbing will take place on the red curve. The process may get stuck for millions of years at B or C, as long as the hollows to the right of these points remain, and the mutation rate is too small.

[[Image:Fraktal.gif]]

If the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the disorder or variance  may increase and the parameter(s) may become distributed like the green bell curve. Then the climbing will take place on the green curve, which is even more smoothed out. Because the hollows to the right of B and C have now disappeared, the process may continue up to the peaks at D. But of course the landscape puts a limit on the disorder or variability. Besides &amp;mdash; dependent on the landscape &amp;mdash; the process may become very jerky, and if the ratio between the time spent by the process at a local peak and the time of transition to the next peak is very high, it may as well look like a [[punctuated equilibrium]] as suggested by Gould (see Ridley).

==Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation==
Thus far the theory only considers mean values of continuous distributions corresponding to an infinite number of individuals. In reality however, the number of individuals is always limited, which gives rise to an uncertainty in the estimation of ''m'' and ''M'' (the moment matrix of the Gaussian). And this may also affect the efficiency of the process. Unfortunately very little is known about this, at least theoretically.

The implementation of normal adaptation on a computer is a fairly simple task. The adaptation of m may be done by one sample (individual) at a time, for example

: ''m''(''i'' + 1) = (1 â ''a'') ''m''(''i'') + ''ax''

where ''x'' is a pass sample, and ''a'' &lt; 1 a suitable constant so that the inverse of a represents the number of individuals in the population.

''M'' may in principle be updated after every step ''y'' leading to a feasible point

: ''x'' = ''m'' + ''y'' according to:

: ''M''(''i'' + 1) = (1 â 2''b'') ''M''(''i'') + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where ''y''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of ''y'' and ''b'' &lt;&lt; 1 is another suitable constant. In order to guarantee a suitable increase of [[average information]], ''y'' should be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with moment matrix ''Î¼''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', where the scalar ''Î¼'' &gt; 1 is used to increase [[average information]] ([[information entropy]], disorder, diversity) at a suitable rate. But ''M'' will never be used in the calculations. Instead we use the matrix ''W'' defined by ''WW''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''M''.

Thus, we have ''y'' = ''Wg'', where ''g'' is normally distributed with the moment matrix ''Î¼U'', and ''U'' is the unit matrix. ''W'' and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; may be updated by the formulas

: ''W'' = (1 â ''b'')''W'' + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;   and   ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 â ''b'')''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bgy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;

because multiplication gives

: ''M'' = (1 â 2''b'')''M'' + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where terms including ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been neglected. Thus, ''M'' will be indirectly adapted with good approximation. In practice it will suffice to update ''W'' only

: ''W''(''i'' + 1)  = (1 â ''b'')''W''(''i'') + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is the formula used in a simple 2-dimensional model of a brain satisfying the Hebbian rule of associative learning; see the next section (KjellstrÃ¶m, 1996 and 1999).

The figure below illustrates the effect of increased [[average information]] in a Gaussian p.d.f. used to climb a mountain Crest (the two lines represent the contour line). Both the red and green cluster have equal mean fitness, about 65%, but the green cluster has a much higher [[average information]] making the green process much more efficient. The effect of this adaptation is not very salient in a 2-dimensional case, but in a high-dimensional case, the efficiency of the search process may be increased by many orders of magnitude.

==The evolution in the brain==
In the brain the evolution of DNA-messages is supposed to be replaced by an evolution of signal patterns and the phenotypic landscape is replaced by a mental landscape, the complexity of which will hardly be second to the former. The metaphor with the mental landscape is based on the assumption that certain signal patterns give rise to a better well-being or performance. For instance, the control of a group of muscles leads to a better pronunciation of a word or performance of a piece of music.

In this simple model it is assumed that the brain consists of interconnected components that may add, multiply and delay signal values.
* A nerve cell kernel may add signal values,
* a synapse may multiply with a constant and
* An axon may delay values.
This is a basis of the theory of digital filters and neural networks consisting of components that may add, multiply and delay signalvalues and also of many brain models, Levine 1991.

In the figure below the brain stem is supposed to deliver Gaussian distributed signal patterns. This may be possible since certain neurons fire at random (Kandel et al.). The stem also constitutes a disordered structure surrounded by more ordered shells (BergstrÃ¶m, 1969), and according to the [[central limit theorem]] the sum of signals from many neurons may be Gaussian distributed. The triangular boxes represent synapses and the boxes with the + sign are cell kernels.

In the cortex signals are supposed to be tested for feasibility. When a signal is accepted the contact areas in the synapses are updated according to the formulas below in agreement with the Hebbian theory. The figure shows a 2-dimensional computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation according to the last formula in the preceding section.

[[Image:Schematic of a neural network executing the Gaussian adaptation algorithm.GIF]]

''m'' and ''W'' are updated according to:

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''1;   ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

As can be seen this is very much like a small brain ruled by the theory of [[Hebbian learning]] (KjellstrÃ¶m, 1996, 1999 and 2002).

==Gaussian adaptation and free will==
Gaussian adaptation as an evolutionary model of the brain obeying the [[Hebbian theory]] of associative learning offers an alternative view of [[free will]] due to the ability of the process to maximize the mean fitness of signal patterns in the brain by climbing a mental landscape in analogy with phenotypic evolution.

Such a random process gives us lots of freedom of choice, but hardly any will. An illusion of will may, however, emanate from the ability of the process to maximize mean fitness, making the process goal seeking. I. e., it prefers higher peaks in the landscape prior to lower, or better alternatives prior to worse. In this way an illusive will may appear. A similar view has been given by Zohar 1990. See also KjellstrÃ¶m 1999.

==A theorem of efficiency for random search==
The efficiency of Gaussian adaptation relies on the theory of information due to Claude E. Shannon (see [[information content]]). When an event occurs with probability ''P'', then the information &amp;minus;log(''P'') may be achieved. For instance, if the mean fitness is ''P'', the information gained for each individual selected for survival will be &amp;minus;log(''P'') â on the average - and the work/time needed to get  the information is proportional to 1/''P''. Thus, if efficiency, E, is defined as information divided by the work/time needed to get it we have:

: ''E'' = &amp;minus;''P'' log(''P'').

This function attains its maximum when ''P'' = 1/''e'' = 0.37. The same result has been obtained by Gaines with a different method.

''E'' = 0 if ''P'' = 0, for a process with infinite mutation rate, and if ''P'' = 1, for a process with mutation rate = 0 (provided that the process is alive).
This measure of efficiency is valid for a large class of [[random search]] processes provided that certain conditions are at hand.

1  The search should be statistically independent and equally efficient in different parameter directions. This condition may be approximately fulfilled when the moment matrix of the Gaussian has been adapted for maximum [[average information]] to some region of acceptability, because linear transformations of the whole process do not affect efficiency.

2   All individuals have equal cost and the derivative at ''P'' = 1 is &lt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Then, the following theorem may be proved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All measures of efficiency, that satisfy the conditions above, are asymptotically proportional to â''P'' log(''P/q'') when the number of dimensions increases, and are maximized by ''P'' = ''q'' exp(-1) (KjellstrÃ¶m, 1996 and 1999).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Efficiency.GIF]]

The figure above shows a possible efficiency function for a random search process such as Gaussian adaptation. To the left the process is most chaotic when ''P'' = 0, while there is perfect order to the right where ''P'' = 1.

In an example by Rechenberg, 1971, 1973, a random walk is pushed thru a corridor maximizing the parameter ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case the region of acceptability is defined as a (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional interval in the parameters ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but a ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-value below the last accepted will never be accepted. Since ''P'' can never exceed 0.5 in this case, the maximum speed towards higher ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-values is reached for ''P'' = 0.5/''e'' = 0.18, in agreement with the findings of Rechenberg.

A point of view that also may be of interest in this context is that no definition of information (other than that sampled points inside some region of acceptability gives information about the extension of the region) is needed for the proof of the theorem. Then, because, the formula may be interpreted as information divided by the work needed to get the information, this is also an indication that &amp;minus;log(''P'') is a good candidate for being a measure of information.

==The Stauffer and Grimson algorithm==
Gaussian adaptation has also been used for other purposes as for instance shadow removal by "The Stauffer-Grimson algorithm" which is equivalent to Gaussian adaptation as used in the section "Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation" above. In both cases the maximum likelihood method is used for estimation of mean values by adaptation at one sample at a time.

But there are differences. In the Stauffer-Grimson case the information is not used for the control of a random number generator for centering, maximization of mean fitness, [[average information]] or manufacturing yield. The adaptation of the moment matrix also differs very much as compared to "the evolution in the brain" above.

'''Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg''' (born August 2, 1929) is a German [[sociology|sociologist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[sexologist]], and writer further specializing into the fields of [[psychology]], [[Indo-European studies]], [[religious studies]], and philosophy, since 1980 also increasingly [[anthropology]]. As Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg uses these approaches in research particularly in the fields of [[sexology]], [[homophobia]], and [[prejudice|prejudice studies]], the US ''[[Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists]]'' (SOLGA; formerly ''Anthropology Research Group on Homosexuality'', ARGOH)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~dlrh/solga/index.html Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Anthropological Association]] ranked Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's works on homophobia as internationally outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/sol.1991.13.3.43 ''Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Newsletter'', October 1991, Vol. 13, No. 3: pp. 43â75]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg studied sociology, [[psychology]], ethnology, [[religious studies]], philosophy and ''Indogermanistik'' (an interdisciplinarian German subject, not identical with purely linguistic [[Indo-European studies]] in Anglophone countries, consisting of historical, sociological, cultural, religious, ethnological, philological, and linguistic study relating to [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] and Indo-European peoples and [[Indo-European languages]]) in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical and bibliographical notes on the inside dust jacket of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's book ''Tabu HomosexualitÃ¤t'' (1st ed.), on page 2 of her book ''Angst und Vorurteil'', and on page 2 of her book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg graduated at the [[University of Bonn]], receiving her ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister artium]]'' (comparable to a [[Master of Arts|Master's degree]] in the Anglo-American educational system) for her thesis ''HomosexualitÃ¤t und Transvestition im Schamanismus'' ("Homosexuality and transvestition in shamanism"). In 1970, she received her PhD for her doctoral dissertation on ''Sexuelle Abartigkeit im Urteil der abendlÃ¤ndischen Religions-, Geistes-, und Rechtsgeschichte im Zusammenhang mit der Gesellschaftsentwicklung'' ("The religious, philosophical, and legal construction of sexual deviance in interdependence with the development of Western society").

After university studies Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg became a scientific assistant at the Sociological Institute of Bonn University, and worked as a sociologist, writer, and independent journalist, holding memberships in a number of scientific and political organizations. She was a leading member of ''[[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]]''. During the late 1980s, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member of the [[Bundestag|German-parliament]] commissioned ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', an inquiry commission researching into the disease's social, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, a cooperation which spawned her 1989 book ''Angst und Vorurteil'' (see below).

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is married and lives in Germany.

== Fields of interest &amp; influences ==

=== "Ethno-sociologist" ===

A label commonly applied to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is that of an "ethno-sociologist", even though that is not to limit her approaches exclusively to non-Western cultures. Her inclusion of ethnological, cross-cultural approaches serves as one device of many that she uses to globally study and analyze mankind's nature and nurture as well as the differences and interdependencies between the two, aiming for a global perspective also applicable in modern industrialized societies.

=== Fields of interest ===

Following the ideology-critical and identity-critical approach of [[Frankfurt School]]'s Critical Theory, the emphasis of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's mostly [[post-structuralism|post-structural]] and [[deconstructionism|deconstructionist]] work (see [[social constructionism]] and [[social constructivism]]) on socio-psychological prejudice studies lies on the socio-cultural, socio-historical, and socio-psychological research into issues such as Western repression of sensuality (''Leibfeindlichkeit'') in Indo-European cultures, and extends into research on topics such as deviant sexuality, homophobia, misogyny, gender roles, and patriarchy.

=== Deconstructivism &amp; essentialism ===

Most of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's research is dedicated to cultural deconstruction of ethnocentric Western prejudices, analyzing their origins and later derivations in history, and emphasizes that this cultural nurture also determining social identities must not be misunderstood as man's essentialist human nature. According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, [[Positivism#Criticisms|positivist]] misinterpretation of ethnocentric prejudices as human nature is one of the key maladies of Western civilization, known to Critical Theory as society's [[Absolute (philosophy)|totality]] also influencing much of Western scientific output. For instance, gays were throughout most of Western history said to be effeminate ''by their nature'', while this common stereotype also influenced social identities and behaviors of individual homosexuals, and these resulting identities and behaviors were in turn taken by society as justifying evidence for their prejudice.

Only two of her works, ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''Der pÃ¤dophile Impuls'' (1985/88) deal with anthropological research into the essential cross-cultural and cross-species nature of two particular sexual attractions beyond common Western stereotypes, paederasty (which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg defines as "male same-sex paedophilia"&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the German edition (1986) of [[Theo Sandfort]]'s Dutch study published in English as ''The sexual aspect of paedosexual relations: The experience of 25 boys with men'' (1981, 1st reprint 1983, 2nd reprint 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;) in ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and paedophilia (defined as "sexual contact between fertile adults and infertile juveniles" based upon preference for these activities on behalf of the adult side, rather than situational offences&lt;ref&gt;''Der pÃ¤dophile Impuls â Wie lernt ein junger Mensch SexualitÃ¤t?''. (1985/88)&lt;/ref&gt;) in general in ''Der pÃ¤dophile Impuls''.

=== Influences ===

In her publications on prejudice studies, both general and specifically sexual deviance-related, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg incorporates influences of [[Frankfurt School|Critical Theory]] (especially the theory of ''[[Authoritarian personality]]'', also see [[Right-wing authoritarianism]]), ''[[Labeling theory]]'' by [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Howard S. Becker]], ''[[social identity|Social identity theory]]'' by [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]], ''[[Frustration aggression theory|Frustration-Aggression hypothesis]]'' by [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]], ''[[observational learning|Social learning theory]]'' by [[Albert Bandura]], ''[[dispositif]]'' and ''[[discourse analysis]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]], and the concept of ''[[wikt:derivation|derivation]]'' in the sociological sense of the term by [[Vilfredo Pareto]], denoting an irrational, ideological after-the-fact rationalization. Other notable influences include [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]] (though only acknowledged by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg as a summary source for a century of scholarly Central European and Scandinavian ''Indogermanistik'' publications prior to Gimbutas), the concepts of ''[[magical thinking]]'' by [[James George Frazer]] and of ''the [[numinous]]'' by [[Rudolf Otto]].

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's definition of prejudice is largely identical to [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''Verblendungszusammenhang'', by which Adorno denotes socially constructed "delusions" (''Verblendungen'') based upon traditional socio-cultural and socio-psychological conditions or relations (''VerhÃ¤ltnisse'') within Western society, but also takes influence from Foucault's ''dispositif'' or ''apparatus'', whereas according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, traditional ethnocentric prejudices easily adapt to social [[paradigm shift]]s throughout history in order to update their rationalizations according to dominant [[episteme]]s, with new derivations of the same old prejudices as the result. For example, during the Medieval Age, according to [[Benedictus Levita]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], same-sex activities were abhorred as the most deadliest sin of all, which was ''superbia'', i. e. the very pride to consider oneself above God and disobey His will as manifested in His most sacred commandments such as that ''sodomia'' (see [[sodomy]]), the common Medieval term for these activities, was considered identical to [[satanism]] and evil witchcraft, whereas when with the [[scientific revolution]] of Early Modernity the responsibility of priests towards sinners increasingly transformed into one of doctors and judges toward those now considered criminally insane, the rationale to keep the ban upon the very same activities along with the ostracization of those who committed such unspeakable "abominations" changed to emphasizing the alleged counter-naturality or perversion of their acts and pathologizing those who desired such.

Combining her influences, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's synthetized definition of ethnocentric, inherently Authoritarian prejudice is one of socially learned manifest, recurring [[intrusive thought]]s (''Zwangsvorstellungen'') that may spill over into [[Allport's Scale]] discrimination, including violent [[hate crime]]s, as a form of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive behavior]] (''Zwangshandlung''; also see [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms "distorted perception" (''verzerrte Wahrnehmung'', resembling [[Bob Altemeyer]]'s ''compartmentalized thinking'') of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of "natural order" and "society", and/or as protector of people they perceive as "victims" of the discriminated.

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural studies, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society. Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)|stratification]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures.

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations in Indo-European societies until the 20th century.

=== ''Angst und Vorurteil'' (1989) ===

{{main|Angst und Vorurteil}}

The book ''Angst und Vorurteil â AIDS-Ãngste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung'' was based on the work of the parliamentary inquiry commission ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', of which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member, that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the [[Cabinet Kohl III|Helmut Kohl administration]].

In ''Angst und Vorurteil'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in ''Tabu HomosexualitÃ¤t'' before, by pointing out in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' further aspects she had already brushed on in ''Der pÃ¤dophile Impuls'' four years earlier.

On the other hand, in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re-inforcement of traditional Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice largely builds on Critical Theory and its concept of the Authoritarian personality, but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, Labeling theory, Social identity theory, Frustration-Aggression hypothesis, Social learning theory, and Foucault's ''dispositif'' and discourse analysis.

'''Helen Peterson''' (native name: Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, August 3, 1915 â July 10, 2000) was a [[Cheyenne]]-[[Lakota people|Lakota]] activist and lobbyist. She was the first director of the Denver Commission on Human Relations. She was the second Native American woman to become director of the [[National Congress of American Indians]] at a time when the government wanted to discharge their treaty obligations to the tribes by eliminating their tribal governments through the [[Indian termination policy]] and forcing the tribe members to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate]] into the mainstream culture. She authored a resolution on Native American education, which was ratified at the second Inter-American Indian Conference, held in [[Cuzco, Peru]]. She created a model program for summer school programs on ethnic studies, which was used throughout the United States. In 1986, Peterson was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] and the following year, her papers were donated to the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Anthropological Archives]].

==Early life==
Helen Louise White was born on August 3 1915 on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in [[Bennett County, South Dakota]] to Lucy (nÃ©e Henderson) and Robert B. White.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=178}}{{sfn|South Dakota Birth Index|1915}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1920|p=12-B}} She was given the native name Wa-Cinn-Ya-Win-Pi-Mi, meaning "woman to trust and depend on".{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} The family lived in northern Nebraska and White attended [[Hay Springs, Nebraska|Hay Springs]] High School, graduating in 1932. She went on to further her education at [[Chadron State College]], studying business education.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} On August 29 1935, White married Richard F. Peterson in [[Garden County, Nebraska]]{{sfn|Nebraska Marriage Records|1935|p=188}} and she worked at the U.S. Land Use [[Resettlement Administration]] to pay their way through school.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} Richard enlisted in the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|war effort]] and Peterson had their only child, R. Max, soon after. In 1942, the couple divorced and Peterson moved with her mother to [[Denver]].{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}}

==Career==
Peterson began work at the [[University of Denver]] as the executive director of the Rocky Mountain Council of Inter-American Affairs. In 1948, she was hired by the newly elected mayor, [[J. Quigg Newton]], to work on the Commission on Community Telations. The mayor had a goal of desegregating the community and to do that, he needed voters willing to change the [[municipal charter]]. {{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} Working with [[Bernie Valdez]], Director of the Denver Welfare Department, Peterson attempted to build bridges between the established [[Latin American]] citizens and the new [[migrant farm workers]] who had come to work on the [[beetroot]] farms. She went door to door in [[Hispanic]] neighborhoods, registering voters and organizing the community. Peterson developed cultural programs and met with city leaders to provide lecture series on issues, such as fair labor and housing laws. At the end of the year, she was made the director of the Committee on Human Relations,{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=179}} the first person to hold the post.{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} In that capacity, she led a drive to hire minority workers and assisted the mayor in passing anti-discriminatory employment and housing regulations.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=180}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} In 1949, she was asked to go to Peru as an advisor to the United States delegation attending the Second Inter-American Indian Conference.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|pp=179â180}}{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}} She authored a resolution to improve education for indigenous people, which was ratified by the conference.{{sfn|Schultz|2000|p=670}}

In 1953, Peterson was urged by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to move to [[Washington, D. C.]] and help reorganize the [[National Congress of American Indians]] (NCAI).{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}}{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=180}} The organization, founded in 1944 to fight against the government's [[Indian termination policy]] was in disarray, on the verge of bankruptcy, and was facing pressure from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] for its dissolution.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} Because of Peterson's experience in organizing minority programs, she was able to slow the [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilationist]] aims of Congress and assist tribes in asserting their own [[sovereign right]]s.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=110}}{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=285}} Peterson was hired to replace Frank George, who had in turn replaced [[Ruth Muskrat Bronson]] as executive director.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=74}} 

Early in 1954, Peterson scheduled an emergency conference with tribal leaders to discuss termination. The meeting was the largest gathering of protest that had ever been assembled by American Indians,{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=99}} and was scheduled in response to the passage of [[House concurrent resolution 108]], which called for the end of federal responsibility for selected tribes, which were to be debated beginning on February 15, 1954.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=111â113}} She and her mother prepared the materials for the conference on a hand cranked [[mimeograph machine]] in her basement.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=99}} Another bill was introduced that year to eliminate [[Competence (law)|competency]] restrictions on land transactions and required Peterson to mobilize tribal leaders to wire their congressmen to defeat the bill. At issue was whether property patents would be assigned by [[Dawes Act|allotment]] directly to tribal members who had no real knowledge of property values or laws governing transfer, or whether the deeds to allotted property were held in trust until allottees actually had an understanding of property ownership and fair market value.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=116â117}} Her efforts in advancing Native Americans and fighting against discriminatory legislation was recognized by the [[American Indian Exposition]] of [[Anadarko, Oklahoma]], which named her the "Outstanding Indian of 1955".{{sfn|''Edwardsville Intelligencer''|1955|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Neosho Daily News''|1955|p=1}}

As NCAI made progress in slowing termination,{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=118}} Peterson helped develop new tactics to protect Native rights, such as creating a summer school program with [[D'Arcy McNickle]] in 1956 for ethnic studies{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}} and convincing [[NBC]] to air a program on the policy and its effect on the [[Klamath Tribes]] in 1957.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=120}} In 1958, Peterson and NCAI president [[Joseph R. Garry]] went to [[Puerto Rico]] to study the methods of [[Operation Bootstrap]], which had transformed the economic relationship between the island and the United States government. They were hopeful that the program could be mirrored for Native Americans to become self-sufficient, but legislators refused to act.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=122â123}} In 1960, at the invitation of Sol Tax, an anthropologist, Peterson met with McNickle and John Rainer to prepare materials for a conference to be held in Chicago the following year. Largely drafted by McNickle the, "Declaration of Indian Purpose" for the 1961 American Indian Chicago Conference contained provisions for a reversal of the termination policy to be replaced by programs focused on development of economic, educational, social and legal nature. The declaration also called for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to be replaced by a Commission of six members, half of whom were Native American, to evaluate issues effecting tribes.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=134â135}} As the conference date neared in June 1961, factions emerged. Some felt that the organized NCAI operated more in the manner of a non-Indian reform association, rather than one that used traditional methods to address problems, whereas others felt that its focus did not adequately represent the issues of tribal identity and reservation realities.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=137}} By August, the factionalism which had become apparent in planning the convention, created calls for restructuring the NCAI and Peterson resigned.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}}

Returning to Denver in 1962, Peterson again took up the post as the director of the Commission on Community Relations.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}}  The [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956]] caused a large influx of Native Americans to the Denver area, but Congress had failed to sufficiently fund the program.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=182}} Peterson's office tried to fill the gap by providing social and employment services, as well as job training for Denver's Native American community.{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=286}} Though no longer employed at the NCAI, controversy continued and her replacement, Robert Burnette, accused both Peterson and Garry of mismanagement during their tenure.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=143}} The dispute between Burnette and his supporters and Peterson and hers, continued through the 1960s dividing the NCAI membership. Burnette was forced out in 1964 and replaced by [[Vine Deloria Jr.]], who had the difficult task of trying to bring the organization back to financial stability and heal the factionalism.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|pp=148â149}} After eight years, of directing the Commission, Peterson accepted a position with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), working as a field liaison officer and coordinator with the [[United States Customs Service]] in Denver.{{sfn|Beaton|2012|p=286}} In 1971, she returned to Washington, D. C. and served as the assistant for the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. In 1978, the BIA transferred her to serve as a tribal government services officer in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Focusing on treaty obligations and Indian health, she worked to ensure that federal, state, local and tribal governments worked together in serving the American Indian community.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=183}} She remained with the BIA until her retirement in 1985.{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}}

The year after her retirement, Peterson was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]].{{sfn|Colorado Women's Hall of Fame|1986}} The following year, her papers were donated to the [[National Anthropological Archives]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. When the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] Archive Center was created in 2007, her papers were transferred there.{{sfn|Smithsonian American Indian Archives|1992}} Upon her retirement, Peterson devoted her time to local and regional projects in and around Portland for the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} She remained an active member in the NCAI through the early 1990s, participating in the 1993 [[Albuquerque]] conference held at the [[University of New Mexico]] on developing inter-tribal relationships.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=150}}

==Death and legacy==
Peterson died on July 10, 2000 in a nursing home in [[Vancouver, Washington]].{{sfn|''The Denver Post''|2000}} Peterson is credited with having led NCAI to stop, or at least slow, the termination movement while she served as director of NCAI.{{sfn|Cowger|1999|p=142}} The ethnic studies program that she and McNickle developed for [[Colorado College]] between 1956 and 1970 became a model for universities throughout the United States.{{sfn|Varnell|1999|p=181}}

'''''Ignotum per ignotius''''' ([[Latin]] for "the unknown by the more unknown") describes an explanation that is less familiar than the concept it would explain.

An example would be: "The oven felt hot because of [[Fourier's Law]]." It is unlikely that a person unfamiliar with the hotness of ovens would be enlightened by a reference to a fundamental law of physics. Of course, such a person might exist in theory, so ''ignotum per ignotius'' is not strictly a logical fallacy; it is just a criticism of an argument on rhetorical grounds, stating that such an argument is not useful in a particular context.

==''Ignotum per Ã¦que ignotum''==
'''''Ignotum per Ã¦que ignotum''''', meaning "the unknown by the equally unknown", is a related form of [[fallacy]] in which one attempts to prove something unknown by deducing it from something else that is also not known to be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]], ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', Day 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inattentional blindness''', also known as '''perceptual blindness''', is a psychological lack of attention that is not associated with any vision defects or deficits. It may be further defined as the event in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. When it simply becomes impossible for one to attend to all the stimuli in a given situation, a temporary '''blindness effect''' can take place as a result; that is, individuals fail to see objects or stimuli that are unexpected and quite often salient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The term was coined by Arien Mack and [[Irvin Rock]] in 1992 and was used as the title of their book of the same name, published by [[MIT Press|MIT press]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt; in which they describe the discovery of the phenomenon and include a collection of procedures used in describing it.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"/&gt; A famous study that demonstrated inattentional blindness asked participants whether or not they noticed a gorilla walking through the scene of a visual task they had been given.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simons |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Chabris |first2=Christopher F. |title=Gorillas in our midst: sustained inattentional blindness for dynamic events |journal=Perception |year=1999 |volume=28 |pages=1059â1074 |url=http://www.chabris.com/Simons1999.pdf |doi=10.1068/p2952 |pmid=10694957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on inattentional blindness suggests that the phenomenon can occur in any individual, independent of [[Cognition|cognitive]] deficits. However, recent evidence shows that patients with ADHD performed better attentionally when engaging in inattentional blindness tasks than control patients did,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossman |first1=Ephraim S. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Yaakov S.

==Defining criteria==
The following criteria are required to classify an event as an inattentional blindness episode: 1) the observer must fail to notice a visual object or event, 2) the object or event must be fully visible, 3) observers must be able to readily identify the object if they are consciously perceiving it,&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rock | first1 = I. | last2 = Linnet | first2 = C. M. | last3 = Grant | first3 = P. I. | last4 = Mack | first4 = A. | year = 1992 | title = Perception without Attention: Results of a new method | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 502â534 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90017-v| pmid = 1473333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 4) the event must be unexpected and the failure to see the object or event must be due to the engagement of attention on other aspects of the visual scene and not due to aspects of the visual stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992"/&gt; Individuals who experience inattentional blindness are usually unaware of this effect, which can play a subsequent role on behavior.

Inattentional blindness is related to but distinct from other failures of visual awareness such as [[change blindness]], [[repetition blindness]], [[visual masking]], and [[attentional blink]]. The key aspect of inattentional blindess which makes it distinct from other failures in [[awareness]] rests on the fact that the undetected stimulus is unexpected.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt; It is the unexpected nature of said stimulus that differentiates inattentional blindness from failures of awareness such as attentional failures like the aforementioned attentional blink. It is critical to acknowledge that occurrences of inattentional blindness are attributed to the failure to consciously attend to an item in the visual field as opposed the absence of [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|cognitive processing]].

Findings such as inattentional blindness â the failure to notice a fully visible but unexpected object because attention was engaged on another task, event, or object â has changed views on how the brain stores and integrates visual information, and has led to further questioning and investigation of the brain and importantly of [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes.

===Cognitive capture=== &lt;!-- Anchor for redirect: [Cognitive capture]. --&gt;
''Cognitive capture'' or, ''cognitive tunneling'', is an inattentional blindness phenomenon in which the observer is too focused on instrumentation, task at hand, internal thought, etc. and not on the present environment. For example, while driving, a driver focused on the speedometer and not on the road is suffering from cognitive capture.{{efn|Note: The term has also been applied to the "cognitive capture" of government [[regulatory agencies]] by the industries they are charged with regulating.  The regulators may be seen as being so "captured" by the industry that they focus all their energy on the welfare of the industry and not on the welfare of the public.  This concept may interact with "cognitive dissonance" to explain why people create local cultures that reflect some of the values in their local community, while completely ignoring others.}}

==The cognition debate: early vs. late selection of attention==
One of the most foremost conflicts among researchers of inattentional blindness surrounds the [[Information processing theory#Cognitive processes|processing]] of unattended stimuli. More specifically, there is disagreement in the literature about exactly how much processing of a visual scene is completed before selection dictates which stimuli will be [[Consciousness|consciously]] perceived, and which will not be (i.e. inattentional blindness). There exists two basic schools of thought on the issue â those who believe selection occurs early in the perceptual process, and those who believe it occurs only after significant processing.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spinks | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = J. X. | last3 = Fox | first3 = P. T. | last4 = Gao | first4 = J-H. | last5 = Tan | first5 = L. H. | year = 2004 | title = More workload on the central executive of working [[memory]], less attention capture by novel visual distractors: evidence from an fMRI study | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 517â524 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early selection theorists propose that perception of stimuli is a limited process requiring selection to proceed. This suggests that the decision to attend to specific stimuli occurs early in processing, soon after the rudimentary study of physical features; only those selected stimuli are then fully processed. On the other hand, proponents of late selection theories argue that [[perception]] is an unlimited operation, and all stimuli in a visual scene are [[Parallel processing (psychology)|processed simultaneously]]. In this case, selection of relevant information is done after full processing of all stimuli.&lt;ref name="Lavie1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lavie | first1 = N. | last2 = Tsal | first2 = Y. | year = 1994 | title = Perceptual load as a major determinant of the locus of selection in visual attention | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 183â197 | doi=10.3758/bf03213897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While early research on the topic was heavily focused on early selection, research since the late 1970s has been shifted mainly to the late selection theories. This change resulted primarily from a shift in paradigms used to study inattentional blindness which revealed new aspects of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman, D.]], &amp; Treisman, A. (1984). [https://web.archive.org/web/20160604214805/https://faculty.washington.edu/jpalmer/files/forCM/FilteringPaperNewRefs/kahneman_treisman1984.pdf "Changing views of attention and automacity"]. In R. Parasuraman &amp; D.R Davies (Eds.), ''Varieties of Attention'' (pp. 29-61). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Today, late selection theories are generally accepted, and continue to be the focus of the majority of research concerning inattentional blindness.

===Evidence for late selection===
A significant body of research has been gathered in support of late selection in the perception of visual stimuli.

One of the popular ways of investigating late selection is to assess the [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] properties (i.e. influencing subsequent acts&lt;ref name="Mack2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Inattentional blindness: Looking without seeing | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 180â184 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.01256|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pcg/225/documents/InattentionalBLindness2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of unattended stimuli. Often used to demonstrate such effects is the stem completion task. While there exist a few variations, these studies generally consist of showing participants the first few letters of words, and asking them to complete the string of letters to form an English word.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt; It has been demonstrated that observers are significantly more likely to complete word fragments with the unattended stimuli presented in a trial than with another similar word.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"&gt;Mack, A. and Rock, I. (1998). ''Inattentional Blindness'', MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; This effect holds when stimuli are not words, but instead objects. When photos of objects are shown too quickly for participants to identify, subsequent presentation of those items lead to significantly faster identification in comparison to novel objects.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt;

A notable study by Mack and Rock has also revealed that showing a word stimulus differing from the participant's name by one letter did not generally call conscious attention. By simply changing a character, transforming the presented word into the observer's first name, the now highly meaningful stimulus is significantly more likely to be attended to. This suggests that the stimuli are being extensively processed, at least enough to analyze their meaning. These results point to the fact that attentional selection may be determined late in processing.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt;

The evidence outlined above suggests that even when stimuli are not processed to the level of conscious attention, they are nonetheless perceptually and cognitively processed, and can indeed exert effects on subsequent behavior.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mack |first1=A. |year=2001 |title=Inattentional blindness: Reply to commentaries |url=http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2494.pdf |journal=Psyche |volume=7 |issue=16 |pages=1â7 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072048/http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2494.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/MACIBR-2 MACIBR-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence for early selection===
While the evidence supporting late selection hypotheses is significant and has been consistently reproduced, there also exists a body of research suggesting that unattended stimuli in fact may not receive significant processing.

For example, in an [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) study by Rees and colleagues, brain activity was recorded while participants completed a perceptual task. Here they examined the neural processing of meaningful (words) and meaningless (consonant string) stimuli both when attended to, and when these same items were unattended. While no difference in activation patterns were found between the groups when the stimuli were unattended, differences in neural processing were observed for meaningful versus meaningless stimuli to which participants overtly attended. This pattern of results suggests that ignored stimuli are not processed to the level of meaning, i.e. less extensively than attended stimuli.&lt;ref name=Rees1999&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rees | first1 = G. | last2 = Russell | first2 = C. | last3 = Firth | first3 = C. | last4 = Driver | first4 = J. | year = 1999 | title = Inattentional blindness versus inattentional amnesia | url = | journal = Science | volume = 286 | issue = | pages = 849â860 |doi=10.1126/science.286.5449.2504 |pmid=10617465  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants do not seem to be detecting meaning in stimuli to which they are not consciously attending.

==Theories==

===Perceptual load===
This particular hypothesis bridges the gap between the early and late selection theories. Authors integrate the viewpoint of early selection stating that perception is a limited process (i.e. cognitive resources are limited), and that of the late selection theories assuming perception as an automatic process.&lt;ref name="Lavie1994" /&gt; This view proposes that the level of processing which occurs for any one stimulus is dependent on the current perceptual load. That is, if the current task is attentionally demanding and its processing exhausts all the available resources, little remains available to process other non-target stimuli in the visual field. Alternatively, if processing requires a small amount of attentional resources, perceptual load is low and attention is inescapably directed to the non-target stimuli.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"/&gt;

The effects of perceptual load on the occurrence of inattentional blindness is demonstrated in a study by Fougnie and Marois. Here, participants were asked to complete a memory task involving either the simple maintenance of verbal stimuli, or the rearrangement of this material, a more cognitively demanding exercise. While subjects were completing the assigned task, an unexpected visual stimulus was presented. Results revealed that unexpected stimuli were more likely to be missed during manipulation of information than in the more simple rehearsal task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fougnie | first1 = D. | last2 = Marois | first2 = R. | year = 2007 | title = Executive working memory load induces inattentional blindness | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 142â147 | doi=10.3758/bf03194041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar type of study, fMRI recordings were done while subjects took part in either low-demand or high-demand subtraction tasks. While performing these exercises, novel visual distractors were presented. When task demands were low and used a smaller portion of the finite resources, distractors captured attention and sparked visual analysis as shown by brain activation in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]]. These results, however, did not hold when perceptual load was high; in this condition, distractors were significantly less often attended to and processed.&lt;ref name="Spinks2004"/&gt;

Thus, higher perceptual load, and therefore more significant use of attentional resources, appears to increase the likelihood of inattentional blindness episodes.

===Inattentional amnesia===
The theory of inattentional amnesia provides an alternative in the explanation of inattentional blindness in suggesting that the phenomenon does not stem from failures in capture of attention or in actual perception of stimuli, but instead from a failure in memory. The unnoticed stimuli in a visual scene are attended to and consciously perceived, but are rapidly forgotten rendering them impossible to report.&lt;ref name=Simons2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simons | first1 = D. J. | year = 2000 | title = Attentional capture and inattentional blindness | url = ftp://grey.colorado.edu/pub/oreilly/teach/prosem_highvis/Simons00.pdf | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 147â155 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01455-8|pmid=10740279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, inattentional amnesia refers to the failure in creating a lasting explicit memory: by the time a subject is asked to recall seeing an item, their memory for the stimulus has vanished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, J.M. (1999). "Inattentional amnesia". In V. Coltheart (Ed.), ''Fleeting Memories'' (pp.71-94). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is difficult to tease apart a failure in perception from one in memory, some research has attempted to shed light on the issue. In a now-classic study of inattentional blindness, a woman carrying an umbrella through a scene goes unnoticed. Despite stopping the video while she is walking through and immediately asking participants to identify which of two people they have seen â leaving as little delay as possible between presentation and report â observers very often fail to correctly identify the woman with the umbrella. No differences in performance were identified whether the video was stopped immediately after the unexpected event or moments later. These findings would seem to oppose the idea of inattentional amnesia, however advocates of the theory could always contend that the memory test simply came too late and that the memory had already been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becklen | first1 = R. | last2 = Cervone | first2 = D. | year = 1983 | title = Selective looking and the noticing of unexpected events | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 601â608 | doi=10.3758/bf03198284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expectation===
The very phenomenon of inattentional blindness is defined by a lack of expectation for the unattended stimulus. Some researchers believe that it is not inattention that produces blindness, but in fact the aforementioned lack of expectation for the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt; Proponents of this theory often state that classic methods for testing inattentional blindness are not manipulating attention per se, but instead the expectation for the presentation of a visual item.&lt;ref name=Braun2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun |first1=J |year=2001 |title=It's great but not necessarily about attention |journal=Psyche |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=1â7 |url=http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2500.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208072757/http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2500.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/BRAIGB BRAIGB]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies investigating the effect of expectation on episodes of inattentional blindness have shown that once observers are made aware of the importance of the stimuli to be presented, for example stating that one will later be tested on it, the phenomenon essentially disappears.&lt;ref name="Mack1998"/&gt; While admitting to possible ambiguities in methodology, Mack, one of the foremost researchers in the field, holds strongly that inattentional blindness stems predominantly from a failure of attentional capture. She points out that if expectation does not mediate instances of very closely linked phenomena such as [[attentional blink]] and [[change blindness]] (whereby participants have difficulty identifying the changing object even when they are explicitly told to look for it), it is unlikely that inattentional blindness can be explained solely by a lack of expectation for stimulus presentation.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt;

===Perceptual cycle===
The perceptual cycle framework has been used as another theoretical basis for inattentional blindness. The perceptual cycle framework describes attention capture and awareness capture as occurring at two different stages of processing. Attention capture occurs when there is a shift in attention due to the salience of a stimuli, and awareness capture refers to the conscious acknowledgement of stimuli. Attentional sets are important because it is composed of characteristics of stimuli an individual is processing. Inattentional blindness occurs when there is an interaction between an individual's attentional set and the salience of the unexpected stimulus. Recognizing the unexpected stimulus can occur when the characteristics of the unexpected stimulus resembles the characteristics of the perceived stimuli. The attentional set theory of inattentional blindness has implications for false memories and eyewitness testimony. The perceptual cycle framework offers four major implications about inattentional blindness 1) environmental cues aid in the detection of stimuli by providing orienting cues but is not enough to produce awareness, 2) perception requires effortful sustained attention, interpretation, and reinterpretation, 3) implicit memory may precede conscious perception, and 4) visual stimuli that is not expected, explored, or interpreted may not be perceived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | title = What You See Is What You Set: Sustained Inattentional Blindness and the Capture of Awareness|journal=Psychological Review|pages= 217â242| doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.112.1.217 | year = 2005 | last1 = Most | first1 = Steven B. | last2 = Scholl | first2 = Brian J. | last3 = Simons | first3 = Daniel J. | last4 = Clifford | first4 = Erin R. | volume = 112 | issue = 1 |url = http://perception.research.yale.edu/papers/05-Most-EtAl-PsychRev.pdf |pmid=15631594 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bases for attentional blindness include top down and bottom up processing.

==Experiments==
To test for inattentional blindness, researchers ask participants to complete a primary task while an unexpected stimulus is presented. Afterwards, researchers ask participants if they saw anything unusual during the primary task. Arien Mack and Irvin Rock describe a series of experiments that demonstrated inattentional blindness in their 1998 book, ''Inattentional Blindness.''

===Invisible Gorilla Test===
{{further|The Invisible Gorilla}}
The best-known study demonstrating inattentional blindness is the Invisible Gorilla Test, conducted by [[Daniel Simons]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and [[Christopher Chabris]] of [[Harvard University]]. This study, a revised version of earlier studies conducted by Ulric Neisser, Neisser and Becklen in 1975, asked subjects to watch a short video of two groups of people (wearing black and white T-shirts) passing a basketball around. The subjects are told either to count the passes made by one of the teams or to keep count of bounce passes vs. aerial passes. In different versions of the video a woman walks through the scene carrying an umbrella (as discussed above) or wearing a full gorilla suit. After watching the video, the subjects are asked whether they noticed anything out of the ordinary taking place. In most groups, 50% of the subjects did not report seeing the gorilla (or the woman with the umbrella). Failure to perceive the anomalies is attributed to failure to attend to it while engaged in the difficult task of counting passes of the ball. These results indicate that the relationship between what is in one's visual field and perception is based much more on attention than was previously thought.&lt;ref name=Most2001&gt;{{cite journal |title=How not to be seen: the contribution of similarity and selective ignoring to sustained inattentional blindness |journal=Psychological Science |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=9â17 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11294235 |doi= 10.1111/1467-9280.00303 |url= |last1=Most |first1=S.

Out 228 participants of the tests, only 194 â those who did count the passes correctly â were used for statistical purposes further. The percentage was even as low as 8% in one of the 16 tests performed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/videos.html ''Change Blindness Study'']; "The Invisible Gorilla" online; retrieved ?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons |first1=D.

The basic Simons and Chabris study was reused on British television as a public safety advert designed to point out the potential dangers to cyclists caused by inattentional blindness in motorists. In the advert the gorilla is replaced by a moon-walking bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/16/transport-invisible-bear-cyclists-youtube |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh |title=Invisible bear makes cyclists safer|date=2008-11-16 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A real-world experiment===
In 1995, Officer Kenny Conley was chasing a shooting suspect. An undercover officer was in the same vicinity and was mistakenly taken down by other officers while Conley ran by and failed to notice. A jury later convicted Officer Conley of perjury and obstruction of justice, believing he had seen the fight and lied about it to protect fellow officers, yet he stood by his word that he had, in fact, not seen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kenneth Conley |publisher=National Registry of Exonerations |url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Chabris, Adam Weinberger, Matthew Fontaine and Daniel J. Simons took it upon themselves to see if this scenario was possible. They designed an experiment in which participants were asked to run about 30 feet behind an experimenter, and count how many times he touched his head. A fight was staged to appear about 8 meters off the path, and was visible for approximately 15 seconds. The procedure in its entirety lasted about 2 minutes and 45 seconds, and participants were then asked to report the number of times they had seen the experimenter touch his head with either hand (medium load), both hands (high load), or were not instructed to count at all (low load). After the run, participants were asked 3 questions: 1) If they had noticed the fight; 2) if they had noticed a juggler, and 3) if they had noticed someone dribbling a basketball. Questions 2) and 3) were control questions, and no one falsely reported these as true.

Participants were significantly more likely to notice the fight when the experiment was done during the day as opposed to in the dark. Additionally, sightings of the fight were most likely to be reported in the low load condition (72%) than in either the medium load (56%), or high load conditions (42%).&lt;ref name=fightclub&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chabris|first1=CF|last2=Weinberger|first2=A|last3=Fontaine|first3=M|last4=Simons|first4=DJ|doi=10.1068/i0436|PMC=3485775|title=You do not talk about Fight Club if you do not notice Fight Club: Inattentional blindness for a simulated real-world assault.|journal=i-Perception|date=2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=150â3|pmid=23145232}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results exemplify a real world occurrence of inattentional blindness, and provide evidence that officer Conley could indeed have missed the fight because his attention was focused elsewhere. Moreover, these results add to the body of knowledge suggesting that as perceptual load increases, less resources remain to process items not explicitly focused on, and in turn episodes of inattentional blindness become more frequent.

===Computer red cross experiment===
Another experiment was conducted by Steven Most, along with [[Daniel Simons]], Christopher Chabris and Brian Scholl. Instead of a basketball game, they used stimuli presented by computer displays. In this experiment objects moved randomly on a computer screen. Participants were instructed to attend to the black objects and ignore the white, or vice versa. After several trials, a red cross unexpectedly appeared and traveled across the display, remaining on the computer screen for five seconds. The results of the experiment showed that even though the cross was distinctive from the black and white objects both in color and shape, about a third of participants missed it. They had found that people may be attentionally tuned to certain perceptual dimensions, such as brightness or shape. Inattentional blindness is most likely to occur if the unexpected stimuli presented resembles the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carpenter | first1= Siri|year= 2001|title= Sights Unseen|journal= Monitor on Psychology|volume= 32 |issue =4 |page=54 | url = http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/blindness.aspx | accessdate=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clown on a unicycle ===
One interesting experiment displayed how cell phones contributed to inattentional blindness in basic tasks such as walking. The stimulus for this experiment was a brightly colored clown on a unicycle. The individuals participating in this experiment were divided into four sections. They were either talking on the phone, listening to an mp3 player, walking by themselves or walking in pairs. The study showed that individuals engaged in cell phone conversations were least likely to notice the clown. This experiment was designed by Ira E. Hyman, S. Matthew Boss, Breanne M. Wise, Kira E. Mckenzie and Jenna M. Caggiano at Western Washington University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.1638 | pages = 597â607 | title=Did you see the unicycling clown?

===Blindness despite fixation===
Daniel Memmert conducted an experiment which suggests that an individual can look directly at an object and still not perceive it. This experiment was based on the invisible gorilla experiment. The participants were children with an average age of 7.7 years. Participants watched a short video of a six-player basketball game (three with white shirts, three with black shirts). The participants were instructed to watch only the players wearing black shirts and to count the times the team passed the ball. During the video a person in a gorilla suit walks through the scene. The film was projected onto a large screen (3.2 m X 2.4 m) and the participants sat in a chair 6 meters from the screen. Participants' eye movement and fixations were recorded during the video, and afterward the participants answered a series of questions.

Only 40% of the participants reported seeing the gorilla. There was no significant difference in accuracy of the counting between the two groups. Analyzing the eye movement and fixation data showed no significant difference in time spent looking at the players (black or white) between the two groups. However, the 60% of participants who did not report seeing the gorilla spent an average of 25 frames (about one second) fixated on the gorilla, despite not perceiving it.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Memmert |first=D |title=The effects of eye movements, age, and expertise on inattentional blindness |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=620â7 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16487725 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.01.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more common example of blindness despite fixation is illustrated in the game of [[Three-card Monte]].

===Effects of expertise===
Another experiment conducted by Daniel Memmert tested the effects of different levels of expertise can have on inattentional blindness. The participants in this experiment included six different groups: Adult basketball experts with an average of twelve years of experience, junior basketball experts with an average of five years, children who had practiced the game for an average of two years, and novice counterparts for each age group. In this experiment the participants watched the invisible gorilla experiment video. The participants were instructed to watch only the players wearing white and to count the times the team passed the ball.

The results showed that experts did not count the passes more accurately than novices but did show that adult subjects were more accurate than the junior and child subjects. A much higher percentage of experts noticed the gorilla compared with novices and even the practiced children. 62% of the adult experts and 60% of the junior experts noticed the gorilla, suggesting that the difference between five and twelve years of experience has minimal effect on inattentional blindness. However, only 38% of the adult, 35% of the junior, and none of the child novices noticed the gorilla. Only 18% of the children with two years of practice noticed. This suggests that both age and experience can have a significant effect on inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006" /&gt;

==Limitations of perception or memory?==
Arien Mack and Irvin Rock's concluded in 1998 that no conscious perception can occur without attention.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; Evidence through research on inattentional blindness contemplates that it may be possible that inattentional blindness reflects a problem with memory rather than with perception.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; It is argued that at least some instances of inattentional blindness are better characterized as memory failures than perceptual failures. The extent to which unattended stimuli fail to engage perceptual processing is an empirical question that the combination of inattentional blindness and other various measures of processing can be used to address.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992" /&gt;

The theory behind inattentional blindness research suggests that we consciously experience only those objects and events to which we directly attend.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; That means that the vast majority of information in our field of vision goes unnoticed. Thus if we miss the target stimulus in an experiment, but are later told about the existence of the stimulus, this sufficient awareness allows participants to report and recall the stimulus now that attention has been allocated to it.&lt;ref name="Rock, 1992" /&gt; Mack and Rock, and their colleagues discovered a striking array of visual events to which people are inattentionally blind.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; However the debate arises whether this inattentional blindness was due to memory or perceptual processing limitations.

Mack and Rock note that explanations for inattentional blindness can reflect a basic failure of perceptual processes to be engaged by unattended stimuli. Or that it may reflect a failure of memorial processes to encode information about unattended stimuli. It is important to note that the memory failure does not have to do with forgetting something that has been encoded by losing access to the memory of the stimulus from time of presentation to time of retrieval, rather that the failure is attributed to information not being encoded when the stimulus was present.&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt; It seems that inattentional blindness can be explained by both memory and perceptual failures because in experimental research participants may fail to report what was on display due to failures in encoded information (memory) or a failure in perceptually processed information (perception).&lt;ref name=Mack1998 /&gt;

==Neuropsychological analogies==
There are similarities in the types of unconscious processing apparent in inattentional blindness and in neuropsychological syndromes such as visual neglect and extinction. The analogy between these phenomenon's seems to generate more questions as well as answers. These answers are fundamental for our understanding of the relationship between attention, stimulus coding and behavior.

===Visual neglect===
[[File:Parietal lobe animation small.gif|thumb|left|Animation. Parietal lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere.]]

Research has shown that some aspects of the syndrome of unilateral '''visual neglect''' appear to be similar to normal subjects in a state of inattentional blindness. In neglect, patients with lesions to the [[parietal cortex]] fail to respond to and report stimuli presented on the side of space [[wikt:contralateral|contralateral]] to damage.&lt;ref name="Mack2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C. M. | last2 = Egeth | first2 = H. | year = 1997 | title = Perception without attention: Evidence of grouping under conditions of inattention | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 339â352 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.23.2.339}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they appear to be functionally blind to a range of stimuli. Since such lesions do not result in any sensory deficits, shortcomings have been explained in terms of a lack of attentional processing, for which the parietal cortex plays a large role.&lt;ref&gt;Rafal, R. (1998). "Neglect." In R. Parasuraman (Ed.), ''The Attentive Brain'' (pp.489-526). Cambridge. MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These phenomena draw strong parallels to one another, as in both cases stimuli are perceptible but unreported when unattended.

===Extinction===
In the phenomenon of '''extinction''', patients can report the presence of a single stimulus presented on the affected side, but then fail to detect it when a second stimulus is presented simultaneously on the "good" ([[wikt:ipsilateral|ipsilateral]]) side.&lt;ref name="humphreys,1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphreys | first1 = G.W. | last2 = Romani | first2 = C. | last3 = Olson | first3 = A. | last4 = Riddoch | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Duncan | first5 = J. | year = 1994 | title = Non-spatial extinction following lesions of the parietal lobe in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = | pages = 357â359 | doi=10.1038/372357a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the stimulus on the affected side seems to lose under conditions of attentional competition from stimuli in the ipsilesional field.&lt;ref name="humphreys,1994"/&gt; The consequence of this competition is that the extinguished items may not be detected.

Similar to studies of inattentional blindness, there is evidence of processing taking place in the neglected field. For example, there can be semantic priming from a stimulus presented in the neglected field, which affects responses to stimuli subsequently presented on the unimpaired side.&lt;ref name="MR"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mack | first1 = A. | last2 = Tang | first2 = B. | last3 = Tuma | first3 = R. | last4 = Rock | first4 = I. | year = 1992 | title = Perceptual organization and attention | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 475â501 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90016-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently in both neglect and inattentional blindness, there is some level processing of stimuli even when they are unattended.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; However one major difference between neuropsychological symptoms such as neglect and extinction, and inattentional blindness concerns the role of expectation.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; In inattentional blindness, subjects do not expect the unreported stimulus. In contrast, in neglect and extinction, patients may expect a stimulus to be presented on the affected side but still fail to report it when another it may be that expectation affects reportability but not the implicit processing of stimuli.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

Further explanations of the phenomenon of inattentional blindness include inattentional amnesia, inattentional agnosia and change blindness.

===Inattentional agnosia===
An explanation for this phenomenon is that observers see the critical object in their visual field but fail to process it extensively enough to retain it. Individuals experience '''inattentional agnosia''' after having seen the target stimuli but not consciously being able to identify what the stimuli is. It is possible that observers are not even able to identify that the stimuli they are seeing are coherent objects.&lt;ref&gt;Neisser, U. (1967). Cognitive psychology. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus observers perceive some representation of the stimuli but are actually unaware of what that stimulus is. It is because the stimulus is not encoded as a specific thing, that it later is not remembered. Individuals fail to report what the stimuli is after it has been removed. However, despite a lack in ability to fully process the stimuli, experiments have shown a priming effect of the critical stimuli. This priming effect indicates that the stimuli must have been processed to some degree, this occurs even if observers are unable to report what the stimuli is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yantis | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = Seeing is attending | url = | journal = Contemporary Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 314â316 | doi=10.1037/002042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change blindness===
Inattentional blindness is the failure to see a stimulus, such as an object that is present in a visual field. However, '''change blindness''' is the failure to notice something different about a visual display. Change blindness is a directly related to memory, individuals who experience the effects of change blindness fail to notice something different about a visual display from one moment to the next.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"&gt;Driver, J. (1998). "The neuropsychology of spatial attention." In H. Pashler (Ed.), ''Attention.'' (pp. 297-340). London: Taylor Francis&lt;/ref&gt; In experiments that test for this phenomenon participants are shown an image that is then followed by another duplicate image that has had a single change made to it. Participants are asked to compare and contrast the two images and identify what the change is. In inattentional blindness experiments, participants fail to identify some stimulus in a single display, a phenomenon that doesn't rely on memory the way change blindness does.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt; Inattentional blindness refers to an inability to identify an object all together whereas change blindness is a failure to compare a new image or display to one that was previously stored in memory.&lt;ref name="driver,1998"/&gt;

==Additional factors exhibiting effects on it==

===Age and expertise===
In 2006, Daniel Memmert conducted a series of studies in which he tested the how age and expertise of participants affect inattentional blindness. Using the gorilla video, he tested 6 different groups of participants. There were 2 groups of children (average age=7) half with no experience in basketball, and the other half with 2 years experience; 2 groups of juniors (average age=13) half with no experience in basketball, and the other half with 5 years of experience; and 2 groups of adults (average age = 24) half with no experience in basketball, the other half with over 12 years of experience. He then instructed all the groups to keep track of how many passes the people on the black team made.

Overall, the children with or without any basketball experience failed to perceive the gorilla more than the juniors or the adults. There were no significant difference between the inexperienced junior and adult groups, or between the experienced junior and adult groups.&lt;ref name="Memmert2006"/&gt; This pattern of results suggests that until the approximate age of 13, presumably because certain aspects of cognition are still under development, inattentional blindness occurrences are more frequent, but become consistent throughout the remainder of the life span.

Additionally, the juniors with basketball experience noticed the gorilla significantly more than the juniors with no basketball experience; and the group of experienced adults noticed the gorilla significantly more than the non-experienced adults. This suggests that if one has had much experience with the stimuli in a visual field, they are more likely to consciously perceive the unexpected object.

In 2011, Elizabeth Graham and Deborah Burke conducted a study that assessed whether or not older adults are more susceptible to inattentional blindness than younger adults by having 51 younger-aged participants (17 to 22 years) and 61 older-aged participants (61 to 81 years) watch the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo classic gorilla video]. Overall, they found that younger-aged participants were more likely to notice the unexpected gorilla than older-aged participants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Burke|first2=Deborah|title=Aging increases inattentional blindness to the gorilla in our midst.|journal=Psychology and Aging|date=2011|volume=26|issue=1|pages=162â166|doi=10.1037/a0020647|pmc=3062668|pmid=21261412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 study,&lt;ref name=stothart2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stothart|first1=Cary|last2=Boot|first2=Walter|last3=Simons|first3=Daniel|title=Using Mechanical Turk to Assess the Effects of Age and Spatial Proximity on Inattentional Blindness|journal=Collabra|date=1 October 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1525/collabra.26|url=http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study&lt;ref name=most2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Most |first1=Steven |last2=Simons |first2=Daniel |last3=Scholl |first3=Brian |last4=Chabris |first4=Christopher |title=Sustained inattentional blindness: The role of location in the detection of unexpected dynamic events |journal=Psyche |volume=6 |issue=14 |year=2000 |url=http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2471.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208151120/http://www.theassc.org/files/assc/2471.pdf |archivedate=8 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} [[PhilPapers]]: [http://philpapers.org/rec/MOSSIB MOSSIB]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.

===Similarity between stimuli===
A series of studies conducted to test how similarity can influence the [[perception]] of a present stimulus. In the study, they asked participants to fixate on a central point on a computer screen and count how many times either white or black letters bounced off the edges of the screen. The first 2 trials did not contain an unexpected event, but the third trial was the critical trial in which a cross that had the same dimensions as the letters and varied in colour (white/light gray/dark gray/black) moved from the right side of the screen to the left side and passed through the central point. The results revealed the following: during the critical event, the more similar the colour of the cross was to the colour of the attended letters, the more likely the participants were to perceive it, and the less similar the colour of the cross was to the attended colour decreased the likelihood of the cross being noticed. For the participants attending to the black letters, 94% perceived the black cross; 44% perceived the dark gray cross; 12% perceived the light gray cross, and only 6% perceived the white cross. Similarly, if the participant was attending to the white letters, they were more likely to notice the cross it was white (94%) than if it was light gray (75%), dark gray (56%), or black (0%).&lt;ref name=Most2001/&gt; This study demonstrates that the more similar an unexpected object is to the attended object, the more likely it is to be perceived, thus reducing the chance of inattentional blindness.

===Mindfulness===
A large experiment conducted on 794 participants by Schofield, Creswell and Denson&lt;ref name=schofield2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schofield|first1=Timothy P.|last2=Creswell|first2=J. David|last3=Denson|first3=Thomas F.|title=Brief mindfulness induction reduces inattentional blindness|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=2015|volume=37|pages=63â70|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2015.08.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timothy_Schofield/publication/281333314_Brief_mindfulness_induction_reduces_inattentional_blindness/links/55e5005608aede0b57358792/Brief-mindfulness-induction-reduces-inattentional-blindness.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;ev=pub_int_prw_xdl}}&lt;/ref&gt; found evidence that completing a brief mindfulness exercise reduced rates on inattentional blindness, but did not improve the depth of encoding of the unexpected distractor. Participants in this experiment engaged in a guided-audio task of mindfully eating a raisin, [[Mindfulness#meditation|a well-known task introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his mindfulness-based stress reduction program]], or listened to factual descriptions about raisins. The audio recordings used to manipulate mindful states in this experiment are freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schofield T. P., Creswell D., Denson T. F. | year = 2015 | title = Brief mindfulness induction reduces inattentional blindness | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 63â70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who completed the raisin-eating task had 41% greater odds of noticing an unexpected red cross that floated across the screen. Participants were then asked to select the shape that had unexpectedly appeared (i.e., the red cross) out of a line-up of 3 red and 3 green shapes. Those in the mindfulness condition were no better than those in the control condition at selecting the red cross out of the line-up. This was true regardless of whether or not detection of the unexpected distractor was statistically controlled. This experiment demonstrated that not only does mindfulness affect inattentional blindness, but that detailed encoding of the unexpected distractor can be dissociated from the detection of the unexpected distractor.

==Possible causes==
The research that has been done on inattentional blindness suggests that there are four possible causes for this phenomenon.  These include: conspicuity, mental workload, expectations, and capacity.&lt;ref name="Mack2003"/&gt;

=== Conspicuity===
Conspicuity refers to an object's ability to catch a person's attention. When something is conspicuous it is easily visible. There are two factors which determine conspicuity: sensory conspicuity and cognitive conspicuity. Sensory conspicuity factors are the physical properties an object has. If an item has bright colors, flashing lights, high contrast with environment, or other attention-grabbing physical properties it can attract a person's attention much easier. For example, people tend to notice objects that are bright colors or crazy patterns before they notice other objects. Cognitive conspicuity factors pertain to objects that are familiar to someone. People tend to notice objects faster if they have some meaning to their lives. For example, when a person hears his/her name, their attention is drawn to the person who said it. The [[cocktail party effect]] describes the cognitive conspicuity factor as well. When an object isn't conspicuous, it is easier to be inattentionally blind to it. People tend to notice items if they capture their attention in some way. If the object isn't visually prominent or relevant, there is a higher chance that a person will miss it.

=== Mental workload and working memory===
[[Mental workload]] is a person's cognitive resources. The amount of a person's workload can interfere with processing of other stimuli. When a person focuses a lot of attention on one stimulus, he/she focuses less attention on other stimuli. For example, talking on the phone while driving â the attention is mostly focused on the phone conversation, so there is less attention focused on driving. The mental workload could be anything from thinking about tasks that need to be done to tending to a baby in the backseat. When people have most of their attention focused on one thing, they are more vulnerable to inattentional blindness. However, the opposite is true as well. When a person has a very small mental workload â he/she is doing an everyday task â the task becomes automatic. Automatic processing can lessen one's mental workload, which can lead to a person to missing the unexpected stimuli.

[[Working memory]] also contributes to inattentional blindness. Cognitive psychologists have examined the relationship between working memory and inattention, but evidence is inconclusive. The rate of this phenomenon can be impacted by a number of factors. Researchers have found evidence for a number of components that may play a role. These include features of the object and the current task, where an individual's attention lies relative to the object, and mental workload as mentioned above. Researchers Kreitz, Furley, and Memmery in 2015, asserted that working memory capacity is not an indicator of susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Instead, it is a combination of what stimulus the attention is directed to as well as the individual's personal expectations. There are individual differences that can play a role, but some argue those disparities are separate from capacity for working memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kreitz |first1=Carina |last2=Furley |first2=Phillip |last3=Memmert |first3=Daniel |last4=Simons |first4=Daniel J. |title=The Influence of Attention Set, Working Memory Capacity, and Expectations on Inattentional Blindness |journal=Perception |date=April 2016 |volume=45 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/0301006615614465 |pages=386â399}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are researchers who consider differences between individuals and their working memory capacity to be a stronger determinant of inattentional blindness. Seegmiller, Watson, and Strayer in 2011 for example, studied individual differences in working memory capacity and how that overall impacted their attention on a given task. They utilized the same Invisible Gorilla video Simons and Chabris did (as mentioned above), but they additionally had participants complete a mathematics test to measure their capacity. From their results, they were able to find a high correlation between an individual's working memory capacity and their susceptibility to inattentional blindness. Those who were calculated to have a lower capacity, more often experienced the blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seegmiller|first=Janelle K.|date=May 2011|title=Individual differences in susceptibility to inattentional blindness|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=37|issue=3|doi=10.1037/a0022474|pages=785â791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow up study the same year, Kreitz and her team looked specifically at the cognitive abilities between individuals. Her team employed a variety of tasks, both static and dynamic, to compare the participants who had their cognitive capacity measured beforehand. Even though they included different tasks to test individuals, there was not a measurable relationship between the cognitive abilities of a participant and their attention performance. They did, however, find evidence to support the idea that noticing a certain stimuli was better in those demonstrating expertise in the task subject (referenced above). Overall, Kreitz concluded that cognitive/working memory capacity might not be an accurate measure for inattentional blindness. Instead, they determined that the rate of noticing might be both circumstantial and dependent on the requirements of the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kreitz|first1=Carina|last2=Furley|first2=Phillip|last3=Memmert|first3=Daniel|last4=Simons|first4=Daniel J.|title=Inattentional blindness and individual differences in cognitive abilities|journal=PLOS ONE|date=10 August 2015|volume=10|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0134675|page=e0134675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also researchers who subscribe to the idea that working memory does not play a measurable role in attentional blindness. This is different from the study by Kreitz and her team finding that individual differences in cognitive abilities might not be relative to noticing rates. Bredemeier and Simons conducted two studies in 2012. The first involved identifying the location of letters as well as counting how many times a group of shapes touched one another. These served as spatial and attention tasks respectively. The second study utilized the same tasks as the previous, but included a verbal one. Participants had to solve math problems and then remember a particular letter that followed each equation. From their results, the two researchers questioned if there was a relationship between noticing a particular stimuli and cognitive abilities. Instead of other factors contributing to the working memory of an individual's noticing, Bredemeier and Simons postulated that external variables establish the appearance of this relationship. Finally, the two researchers attempted to explain why studies were yielding conflicting results. The reason for why this research seems particularly inconclusive might be a result of disparities between the design of the actual research. Essentially, a variety of confounded variables might be prevalent across the studies when considering methodology and sampling processes. A more regulated, large-scale experiment could lead to more conclusive findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bredemeier|first1=Keith|last2=Simons|first2=Daniel J.|title=Working memory and inattentional blindness|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=6 January 2012|volume=19|issue=2|doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0204-8|pages=239â244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectation===
When a person expects certain things to happen, he/she tends to block out other possibilities. This can lead to inattentional blindness. For example, person X is looking for their friend at a concert, and that person knows their friend (person Y) was wearing a yellow jacket. In order to find person Y, person X looks around for people wearing yellow. It is easier to pick a color out of the crowd than a person. However, if person Y took off the jacket, there is a chance person X could walk right past person Y and not notice because he/she was looking for the yellow jacket. Because of expectations, experts are more prone to inattentional blindness than beginners. An expert knows what to expect when certain situations arise. Therefore, that expert will know what to look for. This could cause that person to miss out on other important details that he/she may not have been looking for.

=== Capacity===
Attentional capacity, or [[Salience (neuroscience)|neurological salience]], is a measure of how much attention must be focused to complete a task. For example, an expert pianist can play a piano without thinking much, but a beginner would have to consciously think of every note they hit. This capacity can be lessened by drugs, alcohol, fatigue, and age. With a small capacity, it is more possible to miss things. Therefore, if a person is drunk, he/she will probably miss more than a sober person would. If your attentional capacity is large, you are less likely to experience inattentional blindness.

==Benefits==
[[William James]] addressed the benefits of [[attention]] by saying, "Only those items which I notice shape my mind â without selective interest, experience is utter chaos".&lt;ref name="camc"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130205233859/http://www.camc.ca/en/SMS_40/Articles_270.html ''Inattentional Blindness: Let's Not Blame The Victim Just Yet'']; 18(1), 23-29; Canadian Aviation Maintenance Council (CAMC); 2002; retrieved ? &lt;!-- The original link with full text is dead and not stored on archive.org http://www.camc.ca/fr/SMS_40/Articles_270/8.html --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have a limited mental capacity that is incapable of attending to all the sights, sounds and other inputs that rush the senses every moment. Inattentional blindness is beneficial in the sense that it is a mechanism that has evolved with attention to help filter out irrelevant input, allowing only important information to reach consciousness.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; Several researchers, notably [[James J. Gibson]], have argued that, even before the [[retina]], perception begins in the ecology, which has turned perceptual processes into informational relationships in the environment through [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="beware"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707885104|title=Has evolution primed humans to "beware the beast"?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=104|issue=42|pages=16396â16397|year=2007|last1=Ohman|first1=A.|pmid=17925439|pmc=2034250}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows humans to focus our limited mental resources more efficiently in our environment. For example, New et al. maintain that survival required monitoring animals, both human and non-human, to become part of the evolutionary adaptiveness of the human species. They found that when participants were shown an image with a rapidly altering scene where the scene change included an animate or inanimate object that the participants were significantly better at identifying humans and animals. New et al. argue that better performance in detecting animals and humans is not a factor of acquired expertise, rather it is an evolved survival mechanism in human perception.&lt;ref name="beware"/&gt;

Inattentional blindness is also beneficial as a response to advertising overload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Ternay |first1=Guerric |title=Purposeful Blindness: How Customers Dodge Your Ads |url=https://boostcompanies.com/purposeful-blindness/ |publisher= BoostCompanies |accessdate= 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrelevant marketing makes it more likely for consumers to ignore initiatives that aim at capturing their attention. This phenomenon called 'purposeful blindness' has a compelling illustration regarding banner ads. [[Banner blindness]] shows that consumers can adopt fast and become good at ignoring marketing messages that are not relevant.

==Broader implications==
Although the bulk of inattentional blindness research has been conducted in laboratory studies, the phenomenon occurs in a variety of everyday contexts. Depending upon the context, the occurrence of inattentional blindness could range from embarrassing and/or humorous to potentially devastating.

===Safety===
Several recent studies of explicit attention capture have found that when observers are focused on some other object or event, they often experience inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name=Simons2000/&gt; This finding has potentially tragic implications for [[distracted driving]]. If a person's attention is focused elsewhere while driving, carrying on a conversation or text messaging, for example, they could fail to notice salient and distinctive objects, such as a stop sign, which could lead to serious injury and possibly even death. There have also been heinous incidents attributed to inattentional blindness behind the wheel. For example, a Pennsylvania highway crew accidentally paved over a dead deer that was lying on the road. When questioned regarding their actions, the workers claimed to have never seen it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Many policies are being implemented around the world to decrease the competition for explicit attention capture while operating a vehicle. For example, there are legislative efforts in many countries aimed at banning or restricting the use of [[cell phones]] while driving. Research has shown that the use of both hands-free and hand-held cellular devices while driving results in the failure of attention to explicitly capture other salient and distinctive objects, leading to significantly delayed reaction times, as well as inattentional blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horrey | first1 = W. J. | last2 = Wickens | first2 = C. D. | year = 2006 | title = Examining the Impact of Cell Phone Conversations on Driving Using Meta-Analytic Techniques | url = http://dept.wofford.edu/neuroscience/NeuroSeminar/pdfFall2011/HorreyWickens2006_wk1_driving.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Factors | volume = 48 | issue = 196| pages = 196â205 | doi=10.1518/001872006776412135}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1997, based on accident data in [[Toronto]], found the risk involved in driving while using a cell phone to be similar to that of driving drunk. In both cases, the risk of a collision was three to six times higher compared to a sober driver not using a cell phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1056/NEJM199702133360701|pmid= 9017937|title= Association between Cellular-Telephone Calls and Motor Vehicle Collisions|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 336|issue= 7|pages=453â458|year= 1997|last1= Redelmeier|first1= Donald A.|last2= Tibshirani|first2= Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Strayer et al. (2006) found that when controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, cell-phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers, using a high-fidelity [[driving simulator]].&lt;ref name=Strayer2006&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1518/001872006777724471 |url=http://www.distraction.gov/downloads/pdfs/a-comparison-of-the-cell-phone-driver-and-the-drunk-driver.pdf |title=A Comparison of the Cell Phone Driver and the Drunk Driver |journal=Human Factors: the Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=381â391 |year=2006 |last1=Strayer |first1=David L. |last2=Drews |first2=Frank A. |last3=Crouch |first3=Dennis J. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527164034/http://www.distraction.gov/downloads/pdfs/a-comparison-of-the-cell-phone-driver-and-the-drunk-driver.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inattentional blindness is also prevalent in aviation. The development of [[heads-up display]] (HUD) for pilots, which projects information onto the windshield or onto a helmet-mounted display, has enabled pilots to keep their eyes on the windshield, but simulator studies have found that HUD may cause runway incursion accidents, where one plane collides with another on the runway.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; This finding is particularly concerning because HUDs are being employed in automobiles, which could lead to potential roadway incursions.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt; When a particular object or event captures attention to the extent to which the beholders' attentional capacity is completely absorbed, the resulting inattentional blindness has been known to cause dramatic accidents. For example, an airliner crew, engrossed with a blinking console light, failed to notice the approaching ground and register hearing the danger alarm sounding before the airliner crashed.&lt;ref name="camc"/&gt;

===Illusion===
Collaborative efforts to establish links between science and illusion have examined the relationship of the processes underlying inattentional blindness and the concept of [[Misdirection (magic)|misdirection]]âa magician's ability to manipulate attention in order to prevent his/her audience from seeing how a trick was performed. In several misdirection studies, including Kuhn and Tatler (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuhn | first1 = G. | last2 = Tatler | first2 = B.W. | year = 2005 | title = Magic and fixation: Now you don't see it, now you do. | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1155â1161 | doi=10.1068/p3409bn1}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants watch a "vanishing item" magic trick. After the initial trial, participants are shown the trick until they detect the item dropping from the magician's hand. Most participants see the item drop on the second trial. The critical analyses involved differences in eye movements between the detected and undetected trials. These repetition trials are similar to the full-attention trial in the inattentional blindness paradigm, as both involve the detection of the unexpected event and, by detecting the unexpected event on the second trial, demonstrate that the event is readily perceivable.&lt;ref name=Kuhn2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.013|pmid=20943415|title=Misdirected by the gap: The relationship between inattentional blindness and attentional misdirection|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=20|issue=2|pages=432â436|year=2011|last1=Kuhn|first1=Gustav|last2=Tatler|first2=Benjamin W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between inattentional blindness and misdirection involves how attention is manipulated. While inattentional blindness tasks require an explicit distractor, the attentional distraction in misdirection occurs through the implicit yet systematic orchestration of attention.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt; Moreover, there are several varieties of misdirection and different types are likely to induce different cognitive and perceptual processes, which vary the misdirection paradigm's resemblance to inattentional blindness.&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"/&gt;

Although the aims of magic and illusion differ from those of neuroscience, magicians wish to exploit cognitive weaknesses, whereas neuroscientists seek to understand the brain and the neuronal significance of cognitive functions. Several researchers have argued that neuroscientists and psychologists can learn from incorporating the real world experience and knowledge of magicians into their fields of research. The techniques developed over centuries of stage magic by magicians may also be utilized by neuroscience as powerful probes of human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martinez-Conde | first1 = S. | last2 = Macknik | first2 = S. L. | year = 2008 | title = Magic and the Brain | url = http://macknik.neuralcorrelate.com/pdf/articles/sciam08.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 299| issue = 6| pages = 72â79 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1208-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police shootings===
When a police officer's version of events differs from video or forensic evidence, inattentional blindness has been used by defense lawyers as a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.forcescience.org/fsnews/225.html |title = The invisible gorilla strikes again |year=2015 |publisher=Force Science Institute Ltd. |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism of this defense is that this view could be used to defend nearly any police shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Apuzzo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/us/training-officers-to-shoot-first-and-he-will-answer-questions-later |title=Training Officers to Shoot First, and He Will Answer Questions Later |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2 August 2015 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">The '''James E. Rogers College of Law''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.arizona.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; at the '''University of Arizona''' has created an academic center for the study of American Indian and indigenous peoples law, policy, and human rights. The '''Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program''' furthers the research, training, and advocacy of Indian law and [[international law]] of [[indigenous peoples]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/indigenous-peoples-law-policy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002020918/http://www.law.arizona.edu/depts/iplp/index.cfm |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Courses and clinical opportunities are offered in areas of law and policy concerning indigenous peoples in the United States and around the world. What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities.  

The IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://uanews.org/node/16401 and https://law.arizona.edu/maya-communities-southern-belize &lt;/ref&gt;  

Faculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing [[Carrie Dann]] and recently deceased [[Mary Dann]], who have struggled against the federal government for decades over [[Western Shoshone]] territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and the United Nations [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]]. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. &lt;ref&gt;https://law.arizona.edu/western-shoshone&lt;/ref&gt;  

In addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of [[Awas Tingni]], a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua. After a lengthy legal battle, the community successfully gained legal recognition of its customary land tenure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://law.arizona.edu/awas-tingni |archivedate=2012-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Hugo Sporleder''' (born February 21, 1938) is a civil rights activist recognized for his work with the [http://shsmo.org/manuscripts/stlouis/s0509.pdf Freedom of Residence Movement]:  the driving force behind the landmark [[Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.|Jones v. Mayer]] Supreme Court case that invalidated racist practices of homebuilders in St. Louis, Missouri.

== Freedom of Residence ==
&lt;br /&gt;He was the lead staff person of Freedom of Residence, an early fair housing organization in the 1960s.  Freedom of Residence was the driving force behind the landmark Jones v. Mayer Supreme Court case that invalidated racist practices of homebuilders in St. Louis.  The Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse said this of [http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/a-look-back-couple-win-landmark-housing-rights-case-never/article_08928410-2a54-5da6-b749-243ac259a83f.html Jones v. Mayer], âThis case was one of the most important civil rights precedents of the 1960s. It began when the Plaintiffs, prospective African-American homebuyers, applied to purchase a property from Defendant-home developer, who rejected them solely on the basis of their race. Plaintiffs sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1982, 1983, and 2000e, alleging that a race-based denial of a home purchase violated federal civil rights laws, especially the requirement in 42 U.S.C. 1982 that: âAll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.ââ

Jim began working at Freedom of Residence in 1968 and the case was already en route to the Supreme Court.  He worked with the legal team, headed by Sam Lieberman, to bring to fruition this landmark case.  As important he then continued to push the implementation of the new law of the land through Freedom of Residence.  When he testified to the United States Senate in May of 1972 on these same unfair practices of lenders and real estate developers he said, âWhen Lockheed was in trouble, this government figured out a way to help.  When the oil industry was in trouble, we helped them.  When ITT got into trouble somebody figured a way to help out.  And now the people are in trouble.  The people are hurting and asking for help. . . . We cannot sweep these practices and exploitive operations of the combination of lenders, real estate dealers, insurance people, and politicians under the table.  It must stop.â  Always fighting for what was right.

== History ==
Jim also worked for the Urban League, the Nurse Home Visitation Program, the Judevine Center and Jeff Vander Lou, Inc. (JVL).  His work at JVL is the second highlight of his professional career.  He was the de facto Chief Operating Officer of JVL from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s working side by side with Macler Shepard the longtime leader and founder of the organization.  JVL was a community development organization working in the north city area bounded by Jefferson, Vandeventer and St. Louis Avenues.  JVL was a leader in the region in that it was run by local residents and produced affordable housing for both families and seniors, created an innovative partnership with Brown Shoe Company that led to a production plant in the neighborhood, opened a coffee shop and day care center.  Simply amazing and that type of work rarely gets accomplished today.

'''John Dewey''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|d|uË|i}}; October 20, 1859 â June 1, 1952) was an [[American philosopher]], [[psychologist]], and [[Education reform|educational reformer]] whose ideas have been influential in education and social reform. Dewey is one of the primary figures associated with the philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and is considered one of the fathers of [[functional psychology]]. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' survey, published in 2002, ranked Dewey as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139â52 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known [[public intellectual]], he was also a major voice of [[progressive education]] and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism'', (1995), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |location= |year= |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dewey is known best for his publications about education, he also wrote about many other topics, including [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]], [[art]], [[logic]], [[social theory]], and [[ethics]]. He was a major educational reformer for the 20th century.

The overriding theme of Dewey's works was his profound belief in democracy, be it in politics, education, or communication and journalism. As Dewey himself stated in 1888, while still at the University of Michigan, "Democracy and the one, ultimate, ethical ideal of humanity are to my mind synonymous."&lt;ref&gt;''Early Works'', 1:128 (Southern Illinois University Press) op cited in Douglas R. Anderson, AAR, ''The Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 61, No. 2 (1993), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for his advocacy of democracy, Dewey considered two fundamental elementsâschools and [[civil society]]âto be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality. Dewey asserted that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights but also by ensuring that there exists a fully formed [[public opinion]], accomplished by communication among citizens, experts, and politicians, with the latter being accountable for the policies they adopt.

==Life and works==
John Dewey was born in [[Burlington, Vermont]] to a family of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gutek |first=Gerald L. |title=Historical and Philosophical Foundations of Education: A Biographical Introduction. |publisher=Pearson Education Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0-13-113809-X |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of four boys born to Archibald Sprague Dewey and Lucina Artemisia Rich Dewey.  Their second son was also named John, but he died in an accident on January 17, 1859.  The second John Dewey was born October 20, 1859, forty weeks after the death of his older brother.  Like his older, surviving brother, [[Davis Rich Dewey]], he attended the [[University of Vermont]], where he was initiated into [[Delta Psi (University of Vermont)|Delta Psi]], and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&amp;id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa], Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed Oct 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; in 1879. A significant professor of Dewey's at the University of Vermont was [[Henry Augustus Pearson Torrey]] (H. A. P. Torrey), the son-in-law and nephew of former University of Vermont president [[Joseph Torrey]]. Dewey studied privately with Torrey between his graduation from Vermont and his enrollment at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html bio of Dewey from ''Bowling Green State University''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102195748/http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/acs/1890s/dewey/dewey.html |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Menand]], ''The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in the United States''. New York: Farrar, Staus and Giroux, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After two years as a high-school teacher in [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] and one teaching elementary school in the small town of [[Charlotte, Vermont]], Dewey decided that he was unsuited as a primary or secondary school teacher. After studying with [[George Sylvester Morris]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Herbert Baxter Adams]], and [[G. Stanley Hall]], Dewey received his Ph.D. from the School of Arts &amp; Sciences at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 1884, he accepted a faculty position at the [[University of Michigan]] (1884â88 and 1889â94) with the help of George Sylvester Morris. His unpublished and now lost dissertation was titled "The Psychology of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]."

In 1894 Dewey joined the newly founded [[University of Chicago]] (1894â1904) where he developed his belief in Rational [[Empiricism]], becoming associated with the newly emerging Pragmatic philosophy. His time at the University of Chicago resulted in four essays collectively entitled ''[[Thought and its Subject-Matter]]'', which was published with collected works from his colleagues at Chicago under the collective title ''[[Studies in Logical Theory]]'' (1903). During that time Dewey also initiated the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]], where he was able to actualize the pedagogical beliefs that provided material for his first major work on education, ''[[The School and Society]]'' (1899). Disagreements with the administration ultimately caused his resignation from the university, and soon thereafter he relocated near the East Coast. In 1899, Dewey was elected president of the [[American Psychological Association]]. From 1904 until his retirement in 1930 he was professor of philosophy at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times''edition of January 19, 1953, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 he became president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. He was a longtime member of the [[American Federation of Teachers]].

Along with the historians [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[James Harvey Robinson]], and the economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], Dewey is one of the founders of [[The New School]]. Dewey's most significant writings were "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (1896), a critique of a standard psychological concept and the basis of all his further work; ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), his celebrated work on progressive education; ''[[Human Nature and Conduct]]'' (1922), a study of the function of habit in human behavior;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dewey|title= Human Nature and Conduct: An Introduction to Social Psychology |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company |url= https://archive.org/details/humannatureandco011182mbp|year=1922 |accessdate= February 2, 2018 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' (1927), a defense of democracy written in response to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s ''[[The Phantom Public]]'' (1925); ''[[Experience and Nature]]'' (1925), Dewey's most "metaphysical" statement; ''Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World'' (1929), a glowing travelogue from the nascent [[USSR]];&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey (1929), [http://ariwatch.com/VS/JD/ImpressionsOfSovietRussia.htm ''Impressons of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World''], ''The New Republic''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dewey1929"&gt;{{citation|author=John Dewey|title=Impressions of Soviet Russia and the Revolutionary World: Mexico â China â Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruAGAAAAMAAJ|year=1929|publisher=''The New Republic''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Art as Experience]]'' (1934), Dewey's major work on aesthetics; ''[[A Common Faith]]'' (1934), a humanistic study of religion originally delivered as the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] at Yale; ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]'' (1938), a statement of Dewey's unusual conception of logic; ''[[Freedom and Culture]]'' (1939), a political work examining the roots of fascism; and ''[[Knowing and the Known]]'' (1949), a book written in conjunction with [[Arthur F. Bentley]] that systematically outlines the concept of trans-action, which is central to his other works (see [[Transactionalism]]). While each of these works focuses on one particular philosophical theme, Dewey included his major themes in most of what he published. He published more than 700 articles in 140 journals, and approximately 40 books.

Reflecting his immense influence on 20th-century thought, [[Hilda Neatby]] wrote "Dewey has been to our age what [[Aristotle]] was to the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]], not a philosopher, but ''the'' philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;Hilda M. Neatby, ''So Little for the Mind'' (Toronto: Clarke Irwin &amp; Co. Ltd., 1953), pp. 22â23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey married to Alice Chipman in 1886 shortly after Chipman graduated with her PhB from the University of Michigan. The two had six children: Frederick Archibald Dewey, Evelyn Riggs Dewey, Morris (who died young), Gordon Chipman Dewey, Lucy Alice Chipman Dewey, and Jane Mary Dewey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm Biography at Muskingum College] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331093737/http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/dewey.htm |date=2009-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/dewey-alice-chipman-1858-1927 from The Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Chipman died in 1927 at the age of 68; weakened by a case of malaria contracted during a trip to Turkey in 1924 and a heart attack during a trip to Mexico City in 1926, she died from cerebral thrombosis on July 13, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=eandc Douglas J.

The [[United States Postal Service]] honored Dewey with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 30Â¢ [[postage stamp]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Roger S.|title=30-cent Dewey|url=https://arago.si.edu/category_2028989.html|website=arago.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visits to China and Japan==
[[File:Hu Shih and John Dewey.jpg|thumb|John Dewey and Hu Shih, circa 1938â1942.]]
In 1919, while traveling in Japan on sabbatical leave, Dewey was invited by [[Peking University]] to visit China, probably at the behest of his former students, [[Hu Shih]] and [[Chiang Monlin]]. Dewey and his wife Alice arrived in Shanghai on April 30, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/31043/31043-h/31043-h.htm Letters from China and Japan by Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey and John Dewey]&lt;/ref&gt; just days before student demonstrators took to the streets of Peking to protest the decision of the Allies in Paris to cede the German held territories in [[Shandong]] province to Japan. Their [[May Fourth Movement|demonstrations on May Fourth]] excited and energized Dewey, and he ended up staying in China for two years, leaving in July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Ching-Sze Wang. ''John Dewey in China: To Teach and to Learn''. Albany: State University of New York Press, Suny Series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture, 2007. {{ISBN|9780791472033}} pp. 3â5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two years, Dewey gave nearly 200 lectures to Chinese audiences and wrote nearly monthly articles for Americans in ''[[The New Republic]]'' and other magazines. Well aware of both Japanese expansionism into China and the attraction of [[Bolshevism]] to some Chinese, Dewey advocated that Americans support China's transformation and that Chinese base this transformation in education and social reforms, not revolution. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of people attended the lectures, which were interpreted by Hu Shih. For these audiences, Dewey represented "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," the two personifications which they thought of representing modern values and hailed him as "Second Confucius". Perhaps Dewey's biggest impact, however, was on the forces for progressive education in China, such as Hu Shih and Chiang Monlin, who had studied with him, and [[Tao Xingzhi]], who had studied at Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, pp. 8â10, 13â14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their letters from China and Japan describing their experiences to their family were published in 1920, edited by their daughter Evelyn.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Harriet Alice Chipman Dewey ''Letters from China and Japan''. New York,: E.P. Dutton, 1920; rpr. [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31043 Project Guttenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; During and after his visit his commentaries on China would be published in such periodicals as the New Republic, Asia, the China Review, and sometimes in Newspapers like the Baltimore Sun. Though discussing Chinese philosophy but rarely, one article in 1922, "As the Chinese Think", discusses the teachings of [[Laozi]] and [[Confucius]] in an attempt to improve understanding of the Chinese in international business relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil390561.pdf Published by University of Hawai'i Press.

==Visit to Southern Africa==
Dewey and his daughter Jane went to [[South Africa]] in July 1934, at the invitation of the World Conference of New Education Fellowship in [[Cape Town]] and [[Johannesburg]], where he delivered several talks. The conference was opened by the South African Minister of Education [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hofmeyr]], and Deputy Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]]. Other speakers at the conference included [[Max Eiselen]] and [[Hendrik Verwoerd]], who would later become prime minister of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government that introduced [[Apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kraak|first1=Andre|last2=Young|first2=Michael|title=Education in Retrospect: Policy and Implementation since 1990|date=2001|publisher=Human Sciences Research Council, Pretoria|isbn=0-7969-1988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; John and Jane's expenses were paid by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]]. He also traveled to [[Durban]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Victoria Falls]] in what was then [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) and looked at schools, talked to pupils, and gave lectures to the administrators and teachers. In August 1934, Dewey accepted an honorary degree from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Jay|title=The Education of John Dewey|date=2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231116764|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional psychology==
{{See also|History of psychology}}
At the University of Michigan, Dewey published his first two books, ''Psychology'' (1887), and ''Leibniz's New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding'' (1888), both of which expressed Dewey's early commitment to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|British neo-Hegelianism]]. In ''Psychology'', Dewey attempted a synthesis between idealism and experimental science.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{Cite book|author=Field, Richard |title=John Dewey in ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' |publisher=Northwest Missouri State University|url= http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/dewey.htm|accessdate= 29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While still professor of philosophy at Michigan, Dewey and his junior colleagues, [[James Hayden Tufts]] and [[George Herbert Mead]], together with his student [[James Rowland Angell]], all influenced strongly by the recent publication of [[William James]]' ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890), began to reformulate psychology, emphasizing the social environment on the activity of mind and behavior rather than the physiological psychology of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his followers.

By 1894, Dewey had joined Tufts, with whom he would later write ''Ethics'' (1908) at the recently founded [[University of Chicago]] and invited Mead and Angell to follow him, the four men forming the basis of the so-called "Chicago group" of psychology.

Their new style of psychology, later dubbed [[functional psychology]], had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" which appeared in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' in 1896, he reasons against the traditional [[stimulus-response]] understanding of the [[reflex arc]] in favor of a "circular" account in which what serves as "stimulus" and what as "response" depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed the idea that there is a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.

Dewey&lt;!-- , not without polemic, --&gt; was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1899.

In 1984, the American Psychological Association announced that [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]] (1878â1972) had become the first psychologist to be commemorated on a United States postage stamp. However, psychologists Gary Brucato Jr. and [[John D. Hogan]] later made the case that this distinction actually belonged to John Dewey, who had been celebrated on an American stamp 17 years earlier. While some psychology historians consider Dewey more of a philosopher than a bona fide psychologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Benjamin, L.T. | year = 2003 | title = Why Can't Psychology Get a Stamp? | url = | journal = Journal of applied psychoanalytic studies | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 443â54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors noted that Dewey was a founding member of the A.P.A., served as the A.P.A.'s eighth president in 1899, and was the author of an 1896 article on the [[reflex arc]] which is now considered a basis of American functional psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Brucato, G. &amp; Hogan, J.D. (1999, Spring). "Psychologists on postage stamps" ''The General Psychologist'', 34(1):65&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey also expressed interest in work in the psychology of [[visual perception]] performed by Dartmouth research professor [[Adelbert Ames Jr.]] He had great trouble with listening, however, because it is known Dewey could not distinguish musical pitchesâin other words was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]].&lt;ref&gt;Zeltner, Philip N.; '''John Dewey's Aesthetic Philosophy'''; p. 93 {{ISBN|90-6032-029-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatism, instrumentalism, consequentialism==
Dewey sometimes referred to his philosophy as [[instrumentalism]] rather than [[pragmatism]], and would have recognized the similarity of these two schools to the newer school named [[consequentialism]]. He defined with precise brevity the criterion of validity common to these three schools, which lack agreed-upon definitions:

{{quote|But in the proper interpretation of "pragmatic," namely the function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problem evoking the operations, the text that follows is thoroughly pragmatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=john|title=Logic: The theory of Inquiry|year=1938|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=NY|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His concern for precise definition led him to detailed analysis of careless word usage, reported in ''Knowing and the Known'' in 1949.

===Epistemology===
{{Main| Knowing and the Known}}
The terminology problem in the fields of epistemology and logic is partially due, according to Dewey and Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]].&lt;/ref&gt; to inefficient and imprecise use of words and concepts that reflect three historic levels of organization and presentation.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, [[Boston]], pp. 107â09.&lt;/ref&gt; In the order of chronological appearance, these are:
* Self-Action: Prescientific concepts regarded humans, animals, and things as possessing powers of their own which initiated or caused their actions.
* Interaction: as described by Newton, where things, living and inorganic, are balanced against something in a system of interaction, for example, the third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
* Transaction: where modern systems of descriptions and naming are employed to deal with multiple aspects and phases of action without any attribution to ultimate, final, or independent entities, essences, or realities.

A series of characterizations of [[Transactionalism|Transactions]] indicate the wide range of considerations involved.&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, [[Arthur F. Bentley|Arthur Bentley]], (1949). ''Knowing and the Known''. Beacon Press, Boston, pp. 121â39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic and method==
Dewey sees paradox in contemporary logical theory. Proximate subject matter garners general agreement and advancement, while the ultimate subject matter of logic generates unremitting controversy. In other words, he challenges confident logicians to answer the question of the truth of logical operators. Do they function merely as abstractions (e.g., pure mathematics) or do they connect in some essential way with their objects, and therefore alter or bring them to light?&lt;ref name="logical"&gt;"The Problem of Logical Subject Matter", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Dewey Grave.JPG|thumb|Grave of Dewey and his wife in an alcove on the north side of the [[Ira Allen Chapel]] in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. The only grave on the [[University of Vermont]] campus]]

[[Logical positivism]] also figured in Dewey's thought. About the movement he wrote that it "eschews the use of 'propositions' and 'terms', substituting 'sentences' and 'words'." ("General Theory of Propositions", in ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'') He welcomes this changing of referents "in as far as it fixes attention upon the symbolic structure and content of propositions." However, he registers a small complaint against the use of "sentence" and "words" in that without careful interpretation the act or process of transposition "narrows unduly the scope of symbols and language, since it is not customary to treat gestures and diagrams (maps, blueprints, etc.) as words or sentences."
In other words, sentences and words, considered in isolation, do not disclose intent, which may be inferred or "adjudged only by means of context."&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;

Yet Dewey was not entirely opposed to modern logical trends. Concerning traditional logic, he states:

{{quote|Aristotelian logic, which still passes current nominally, is a logic based upon the idea that qualitative objects are existential in the fullest sense. To retain logical principles based on this conception along with the acceptance of theories of existence and knowledge based on an opposite conception is not, to say the least, conductive to clearnessâa consideration that has a good deal to do with existing dualism between traditional and the newer relational logics.}}

[[Louis Menand]] argues in ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' that [[Jane Addams]] had been critical of Dewey's emphasis on antagonism in the context of a discussion of the [[Pullman strike]] of 1894. In a later letter to his wife, Dewey confessed that Addams' argument was:

{{quote|... the most magnificent exhibition of intellectual &amp; moral faith I ever saw. She converted me internally, but not really, I fear. ... When you think that Miss Addams does not think this as a philosophy, but believes it in all her senses &amp; musclesâGreat God ... I guess I'll have to give it [all] up &amp; start over again.}}

He went on to add:

{{quote|I can see that I have always been interpreting dialectic wrong end up, the unity as the reconciliation of opposites, instead of the opposites as the unity in its growth, and thus translated the physical tension into a moral thing ... I don't know as I give the reality of this at all, ... it seems so natural &amp; commonplace now, but I never had anything take hold of me so.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Menand. ''The Metaphysical Club'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a letter to Addams, clearly influenced by his conversation with her, Dewey wrote:

{{quote|Not only is actual antagonizing bad, but the assumption that there is or may be antagonism is badâin fact, the real first antagonism always comes back to the assumption.}}

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Art as Experience}}
''Art as Experience'' (1934) is Dewey's major writing on aesthetics.

It is, in accordance with his place in the Pragmatist tradition that emphasizes community, a study of the individual art object as embedded in (and inextricable from) the experiences of a local culture. In the original illustrated edition, Dewey drew on the modern art and world cultures collection assembled by [[Albert C. Barnes]] at the [[Barnes Foundation]], whose own ideas on the application of art to one's way of life was influenced by Dewey's writing. Barnes was particularly influenced by "Democracy and Education" (1916) and then attended Dewey's seminar on political philosophy at Columbia University in the fall semester of 1918.

==On philanthropy, women and democracy==
Dewey founded the University of Chicago [[laboratory school]], supported educational organizations, and supported settlement houses especially [[Jane Addams]]' Hull House.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29â39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work at the [[Hull House]] serving on its first board of trustees, Dewey was not only an activist for the cause but also a partner working to serve the large immigrant community of Chicago and women's suffrage. Dewey experienced the lack of children's education while contributing in the classroom at the Hull House and the lack of education and skills of immigrant women.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Upin|first1=Jane S.|title="Charlotte Perkins Gilman": Instrumentalism beyond Dewey:Hypatia|journal=|volume=8|issue=2|pages=38â63|jstor=3810336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stengel argues:

{{quote|Addams is unquestionably a maker of democratic community and pragmatic education; Dewey is just as unquestionably a reflector. Through her work at Hull House, Addams discerned the shape of democracy as a mode of associated living and uncovered the outlines of an experimental approach to knowledge and understanding; Dewey analyzed and classified the social, psychological and educational processes Addams lived.&lt;ref name="muse.jhu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stengel|first1=Barbara|title=Dewey's Pragmatic Poet: Reconstructing Jane Addams's Philosophical Impact|journal=Project Muse|pages=29â39|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/.|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His leading views on democracy included: "First, Dewey believed that democracy is an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making ... Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Westbrook|first1=Robert B.|title=John Dewey and American Democracy|journal=|volume=97|issue=3|pages=919â20|jstor=2164912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.

Dewey believed that a woman's place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, "You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won't be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn't do".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; John Dewey's support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams' Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew as well as the support for the women's suffrage movement.

As commonly argued by Dewey's greatest critics, he was not able to come up with strategies in order to fulfill his ideas that would lead to a successful democracy, educational system, and a successful women's suffrage movement. While knowing that traditional beliefs, customs, and practices needed to be examined in order to find out what worked and what needed improved upon, it was never done in a systematic way.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; "Dewey became increasingly aware of the obstacles presented by entrenched power and alert to the intricacy of the problems facing modern cultures".&lt;ref name="John Dewey and American Democracy"/&gt; With the complex of society at the time, Dewey was criticized for his lack of effort in fixing the problems.

With respect to technological developments in a democracy:

{{quote|Persons do not become a society by living in physical proximity any more than a man ceases to be socially influenced by being so many feet or miles removed from others.}}

His work on democracy influenced [[B.R. Ambedkar]], one of his students, who later became one of the founding fathers of independent India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao|title=Annihilation of castes|publisher=Critical Quest|isbn=81-89524-21-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar's teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/05/john-dewey-pragmatism-communication-and-bhimrao-ambedkar/|title=The like-mindedness of Dewey and Ambedkar|date=2017-05-19|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2018/01/ambedkars-pragmatism-drew-heavily-on-the-1908-ethics/|title=Ambedkarâs pragmatism drew heavily on the 1908 âEthicsâ|date=2018-01-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On education and teacher education==
{{Main| Democracy and Education}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
Dewey's educational theories were presented in ''My Pedagogic Creed'' (1897), ''The School and Society'' (1900), ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916), [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001117418 ''Schools of To-morrow'' ] (c1915) with Evelyn Dewey, and ''[[Experience and Education (book)|Experience and Education]]'' (1938). Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.

The ideas of democracy and social reform are continually discussed in Dewey's writings on education. Dewey makes a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. In his eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a pre-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. He notes that "to prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself; it means so to train him that he will have the full and ready use of all his capacities" (''My Pedagogic Creed'', Dewey, 1897). In addition to helping students realize their full potential, Dewey goes on to acknowledge that education and schooling are instrumental in creating social change and reform. He notes that "education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction".

In addition to his ideas regarding what education is and what effect it should have on society, Dewey also had specific notions regarding how education should take place within the classroom. In ''The Child and the Curriculum'' (1902), Dewey discusses two major conflicting schools of thought regarding educational pedagogy. The first is centered on the curriculum and focuses almost solely on the subject matter to be taught. Dewey argues that the major flaw in this methodology is the inactivity of the student; within this particular framework, "the child is simply the immature being who is to be matured; he is the superficial being who is to be deepened" (1902, p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). ''The child and the curriculum''. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that in order for education to be most effective, content must be presented in a way that allows the student to relate the information to prior experiences, thus deepening the connection with this new knowledge.

At the same time, Dewey was alarmed by many of the "child-centered" excesses of educational-school pedagogues who claimed to be his followers, and he argued that too much reliance on the child could be equally detrimental to the learning process. In this second school of thought, "we must take our stand with the child and our departure from him. It is he and not the subject-matter which determines both quality and quantity of learning" (Dewey, 1902, pp.&amp;nbsp;13â14). According to Dewey, the potential flaw in this line of thinking is that it minimizes the importance of the content as well as the role of the teacher.

In order to rectify this dilemma, Dewey advocated for an educational structure that strikes a balance between delivering knowledge while also taking into account the interests and experiences of the student. He notes that "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process. Just as two points define a straight line, so the present standpoint of the child and the facts and truths of studies define instruction" (Dewey, 1902, p.&amp;nbsp;16). It is through this reasoning that Dewey became one of the most famous proponents of [[hands-on learning]] or [[experiential education]], which is related to, but not synonymous with [[experiential learning]]. He argued that "if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind" (Dewey, 1916/2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;217â18).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (2009). ''Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education''. New York: WLC Books. (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey's ideas went on to influence many other influential experiential models and advocates. [[Problem-Based Learning]] (PBL), for example, a method used widely in education today, incorporates Dewey's ideas pertaining to learning through active inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Savery, J. R. (2006). Overview of Problem-based Learning: Definitions and Distinctions. ''Journal of Problem-based
Learning'', 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. Throughout the history of American schooling, education's purpose has been to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. The works of John Dewey provide the most prolific examples of how this limited vocational view of education has been applied to both the Kâ12 public education system and to the teacher training schools who attempted to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline-specific skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce. In ''The School and Society'' (Dewey, 1899) and ''Democracy of Education'' (Dewey, 1916), Dewey claims that rather than preparing citizens for ethical participation in society, schools cultivate passive pupils via insistence upon mastery of facts and disciplining of bodies. Rather than preparing students to be reflective, autonomous and ethical beings capable of arriving at social truths through critical and intersubjective discourse, schools prepare students for docile compliance with authoritarian work and political structures, discourage the pursuit of individual and communal inquiry, and perceive higher learning as a monopoly of the institution of education (Dewey, 1899; 1916).

For Dewey and his philosophical followers, education stifles individual autonomy when learners are taught that knowledge is transmitted in one direction, from the expert to the learner. Dewey not only re-imagined the way that the learning process should take place, but also the role that the teacher should play within that process. For Dewey, "The thing needful is improvement of education, not simply by turning out teachers who can do better the things that are not necessary to do, but rather by changing the conception of what constitutes education" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;18). Dewey's qualifications for teachingâa natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with othersâare not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Turning to Dewey's essays and public addresses regarding the teaching profession, followed by his analysis of the teacher as a person and a professional, as well as his beliefs regarding the responsibilities of teacher education programs to cultivate the attributes addressed, teacher educators can begin to reimagine the successful classroom teacher Dewey envisioned.

===Professionalization of teaching as a social service===
For many, education's purpose is to train students for work by providing the student with a limited set of skills and information to do a particular job. As Dewey notes, this limited vocational view is also applied to teacher training schools who attempt to quickly produce proficient and practical teachers with a limited set of instructional and discipline skills needed to meet the needs of the employer and demands of the workforce (Dewey, 1904). For Dewey, the school and the classroom teacher, as a workforce and provider of a social service, have a unique responsibility to produce psychological and social goods that will lead to both present and future social progress. As Dewey notes, "The business of the teacher is to produce a higher standard of intelligence in the community, and the object of the public school system is to make as large as possible the number of those who possess this intelligence. Skill, ability to act wisely and effectively in a great variety of occupations and situations, is a sign and a criterion of the degree of civilization that a society has reached. It is the business of teachers to help in producing the many kinds of skill needed in contemporary life. If teachers are up to their work, they also aid in the production of character."(Dewey, TAP, 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;241â42).

According to Dewey, the emphasis is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is "impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now" (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;25). However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact imparting these qualities of intelligence, skill, and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a "lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill, and character" (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;242) of the nation's workforce. As Dewey notes, there is a lack of these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill, and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.

===A teacher's knowledge===
Dewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach. For Dewey, this propensity is an inherent curiosity and love for learning that differs from one's ability to acquire, recite and reproduce textbook knowledge. "No one," according to Dewey, "can be really successful in performing the duties and meeting these demands [of teaching] who does not retain [her] intellectual curiosity intact throughout [her] entire career" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34). According to Dewey, it is not that the "teacher ought to strive to be a high-class scholar in all the subjects he or she has to teach," rather, "a teacher ought to have an unusual love and aptitude in some one subject: history, mathematics, literature, science, a fine art, or whatever" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). The classroom teacher does not have to be a scholar in all subjects; rather, a genuine love in one will elicit a feel for genuine information and insight in all subjects taught.

In addition to this propensity for study into the subjects taught, the classroom teacher "is possessed by a recognition of the responsibility for the constant study of school room work, the constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;37). For Dewey, this desire for the lifelong pursuit of learning is inherent in other professions (e.g. the architectural, legal and medical fields; Dewey, 1904 &amp; Dewey, PST, 2010), and has particular importance for the field of teaching. As Dewey notes, "this further study is not a side line but something which fits directly into the demands and opportunities of the vocation" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;34).

According to Dewey, this propensity and passion for intellectual growth in the profession must be accompanied by a natural desire to communicate one's knowledge with others. "There are scholars who have [the knowledge] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. To the 'natural born' teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;35). For Dewey, it is not enough for the classroom teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.

===A teacher's skill===
The best indicator of teacher quality, according to Dewey, is the ability to watch and respond to the movement of the mind with keen awareness of the signs and quality of the responses he or her students exhibit with regard to the subject-matter presented (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, 1904). As Dewey notes, "I have often been asked how it was that some teachers who have never studied the art of teaching are still extraordinarily good teachers. The explanation is simple. They have a quick, sure and unflagging sympathy with the operations and process of the minds they are in contact with. Their own minds move in harmony with those of others, appreciating their difficulties, entering into their problems, sharing their intellectual victories" (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;36). Such a teacher is genuinely aware of the complexities of this mind to mind transfer, and she has the intellectual fortitude to identify the successes and failures of this process, as well as how to appropriately reproduce or correct it in the future.

===A teacher's disposition===
As a result of the direct influence teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings to the classroom. As Dewey notes, "no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency" (Dewey, TLS, p.&amp;nbsp;25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.

According to Dewey, the successful classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, they know that their career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; all of which have the potential to overcome their genuine love and sympathy for their students. For Dewey, "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not bear up under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.&amp;nbsp;35).

It is essential, according to Dewey, that the classroom teacher has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on them because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). Such negative demeanors, according to Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, teachers must be aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.

===The role of teacher education to cultivate the professional classroom teacher===
Dewey's passions for teachingâa natural love for working with young children, a natural propensity to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social issues related to the profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with othersâare not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which "work automatically, unconsciously" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. But later 'progress' may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers' journals, attending teachers' institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" (Dewey, 1904, p.&amp;nbsp;15). For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one's self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.

As Dewey notes, other professional fields, such as law and medicine cultivate a professional spirit in their fields to constantly study their work, their methods of their work, and a perpetual need for intellectual growth and concern for issues related to their profession. Teacher education, as a profession, has these same obligations (Dewey, 1904; Dewey, PST, 2010). As Dewey notes, "An intellectual responsibility has got to be distributed to every human being who is concerned in carrying out the work in question, and to attempt to concentrate intellectual responsibility for a work that has to be done, with their brains and their hearts, by hundreds or thousands of people in a dozen or so at the top, no matter how wise and skillful they are, is not to concentrate responsibilityâit is to diffuse irresponsibility" (Dewey, PST, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;39). For Dewey, the professional spirit of teacher education requires of its students a constant study of school room work, constant study of children, of methods, of subject matter in its various adaptations to pupils. Such study will lead to professional enlightenment with regard to the daily operations of classroom teaching.

As well as his very active and direct involvement in setting up educational institutions such as the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] (1896) and [[The New School for Social Research]] (1919), many of Dewey's ideas influenced the founding of [[Bennington College]] and Goddard College in Vermont, where he served on the Board of Trustees. Dewey's works and philosophy also held great influence in the creation of the short-lived [[Black Mountain College]] in North Carolina, an experimental college focused on interdisciplinary study, and whose faculty included [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]], [[Robert Creeley]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], among others. Black Mountain College was the locus of the "Black Mountain Poets" a group of avant-garde poets closely linked with the [[Beat Generation]] and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].

==On journalism==
{{Main| The Public and its Problems}}
[[File:John Dewey caricat.jpg|thumb|Caricature of Dewey by AndrÃ© Koehne, 2006]]
Since the mid-1980s, Deweyan ideas have experienced revival as a major source of inspiration for the public journalism movement. Dewey's definition of "public," as described in ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'', has profound implications for the significance of journalism in society. As suggested by the title of the book, his concern was of the transactional relationship between publics and problems. Also implicit in its name, public journalism seeks to orient communication away from elite, corporate hegemony toward a civic public sphere. "The 'public' of public journalists is Dewey's public."

Dewey gives a concrete definition to the formation of a public. Publics are spontaneous groups of citizens who share the indirect effects of a particular action. Anyone affected by the indirect consequences of a specific action will automatically share a common interest in controlling those consequences, i.e., solving a common problem.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. 1927. ''The Public and its Problems''. Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since every action generates [[unintended consequence]]s, publics continuously emerge, overlap, and disintegrate.

In ''The Public and its Problems'', Dewey presents a rebuttal to [[Walter Lippmann]]'s treatise on the role of journalism in democracy. Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to the public, whose role was to react emotionally to the news. In his model, Lippmann supposed that the public was incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.

Dewey refutes this model by assuming that politics is the work and duty of each individual in the course of his daily routine. The knowledge needed to be involved in politics, in this model, was to be generated by the interaction of citizens, elites, experts, through the mediation and facilitation of journalism. In this model, not just the government is accountable, but the citizens, experts, and other actors as well.

Dewey also said that journalism should conform to this ideal by changing its emphasis from actions or happenings (choosing a winner of a given situation) to alternatives, choices, consequences, and [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]] . Conditions and Consequences. American Philosophy: an Encyclopedia. 2007. Eds. John Lachs and Robert Talisse. New York: Routledge. pp. 124â27.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to foster conversation and improve the generation of knowledge. Journalism would not just produce a static product that told what had already happened, but the news would be in a constant state of evolution as the public added value by generating knowledge. The "audience" would end, to be replaced by citizens and collaborators who would essentially be users, doing more with the news than simply reading it. Concerning his effort to change journalism, he wrote in ''The Public and Its Problems'': "Till the Great Society is converted in to a Great Community, the Public will remain in eclipse. Communication can alone create a great community" (Dewey, p.&amp;nbsp;142).

Dewey believed that communication creates a great community, and citizens who participate actively with public life contribute to that community. "The clear consciousness of a communal life, in all its implications, constitutes the idea of democracy." (''The Public and its Problems'', p.&amp;nbsp;149). This Great Community can only occur with "free and full intercommunication." (p.&amp;nbsp;211) Communication can be understood as journalism.

==On humanism==
As an atheist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dewey at One Hundred Fifty|year=2009|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=9781557535504|page=22|authorlink=Larry A. Hickman|editor1=A. G. Rud |editor2=Jim Garrison |editor3=Lynda Stone |quote=With respect to his personal beliefs, Dewey wrote to Max Otto that "I feel the gods are pretty dead, tho I suppose I ought to know that however, to be somewhat more philosophical in the matter, if atheism means simply not being a theist, then of course I'm an atheist. But the popular if not the etymological significance of the word is much wider. ... Although he described himself as an atheist in one sense of the term, it is also clear that Dewey was opposed to militant atheism for the same reason that he was opposed to supernaturalism: he thought both positions dogmatic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] in his later life, Dewey participated with a variety of humanistic activities from the 1930s into the 1950s, which included sitting on the advisory board of [[Charles Francis Potter]]'s [[First Humanist Society of New York]] (1929); being one of the original 34 signatories of the first ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' (1933) and being elected an honorary member of the Humanist Press Association (1936).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030608113016/http://www.siu.edu/%7Edeweyctr/CHRONO.pdf "John Dewey Chronology" 1934.04.08, 1936.03.12, 1940.09, and 1950.09.11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His opinion of humanism is summarized in his own words from an article titled "What Humanism Means to Me", published in the June 1930 edition of ''Thinker 2'':

{{quote|What Humanism means to me is an expansion, not a contraction, of human life, ''an expansion in which nature and the science of nature are made the willing servants of human good''.&lt;ref&gt;"What Humanism Means to Me," first published in ''Thinker 2'' (June 1930): 9â12, as part of a series. Dewey: p. lw.5.266 [''The Collected Works of John Dewey, 1882â1953'', The Electronic Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Social and political activism==
{{American socialism}}
As a major advocate for academic freedom, in 1935 Dewey, together with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson|Alvin Johnson]], became a member of the United States section of the International League for Academic Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/public3_text.htm American Institute of Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1940, together with [[Horace M Kallen]], edited a series of articles related to the [[The Bertrand Russell Case|Bertrand Russell Case]].

As well as being active in defending the independence of teachers, and opposing a communist takeover of the New York Teachers' Union,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Dewey was involved in the organization that eventually became the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

He was an avid supporter of [[Henry George]]'s proposal for taxing land values. Of George, he wrote, "No man, no graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker."&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1927) [http://www.wealthandwant.com/HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html An Appreciation of Henry George]&lt;/ref&gt; As honorary president of the Henry George School of Social Science, he wrote a letter to [[Henry Ford]] urging him to support the school.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1939) [http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/dewey-john_a-letter-to-henry-ford-1939.html A Letter to Henry Ford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113025951/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/dewey-john_a-letter-to-henry-ford-1939.html |date=2015-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He directed the famous [[Dewey Commission]] held in Mexico in 1937, which cleared [[Leon Trotsky]] of the charges made against him by [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;ref name="Dewey Commission Report"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1937/dewey/index.htm "Dewey Commission Report"]&lt;/ref&gt; and marched for women's rights, among many other causes.

In 1939, John Dewey was elected President of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]], an organization with the goal of educating college students about the labor movement. The Student Branch of the L.I.D. would later become [[Students for a Democratic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Dewey'', edited by Molly Cochran. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Dewey, [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Benedetto Croce]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Jacques Maritain]] agreed to act as honorary chairmen of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm "Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949â1950" CIA official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613054254/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v38i5a10p.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Front organizations|false-front]] anti-communist advocacy group founded that year and funded by the [[CIA]].

==Other interests==
Dewey's interests and writings included many topics, and according to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], "a substantial part of his published output consisted of commentary on current domestic and international politics, and public statements on behalf of many causes. (He is probably the only philosopher in this encyclopedia to have published both on the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and on the value of displaying art in post offices.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/archives/sum2005/entries/dewey-political/ "Dewey's Political Philosophy" Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Dewey met [[F. Matthias Alexander|F. M. Alexander]] in New York City and later wrote introductions to Alexander's ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'' (1918), ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'' (1923) and ''The Use of the Self'' (1932). Alexander's influence is referenced in "Human Nature and Conduct" and "Experience and Nature."&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Alexander ''Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual'', E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., 1923 {{ISBN|0-913111-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as his contacts with people mentioned elsewhere in the article, he also maintained correspondence with [[Henri Bergson]], [[William M. Brown]], [[Martin Buber]], [[George Counts|George S. Counts]], [[William Rainey Harper]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[George Santayana]].

==Criticism==
Dewey is considered the epitome of liberalism by historians,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Paringer, ''John Dewey and the paradox of liberal reform'' (1990) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes was portrayed as "dangerously radical."&lt;ref&gt;William R. Caspary, ''Dewey on Democracy''. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dewey was critiqued strongly by American communists because he argued against [[Stalinism]] and had philosophical differences with Marx, identifying himself as a democratic socialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Westbrook | first = Robert B | title = John Dewey and American Democracy | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1993 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8014-8111-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have examined his religious beliefs. Biographer [[Steven C. Rockefeller]] traced Dewey's democratic convictions to his childhood attendance at the [[Congregational Church]], with its strong proclamation of social ideals and the [[Social Gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Rockefeller, ''John Dewey: Religious Faith and Democratic Humanism'', (1994), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Edward A. White suggested in ''[[Science and Religion in American Thought]]'' (1952) that Dewey's work led to the 20th century rift between religion and science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6695">'''Karl Duncker''' (2 February 1903, in [[Leipzig]] â 23 February 1940) was a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]]. He attended Friedrich-Wilhelms-University from 1923 to 1923, and spent 1925â1926 at [[Clark University]] in Worcester, MA as a visiting professor, where he received a masters in arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Schnall S. 2007. [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/239301/Schnall%20%281999%29.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Life as the Problem: Karl Duncker's Context]. In ''Thinking in Psychological Science: Ideas and Their Makers'', editor: Jaan Valsiner. Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1935 he was a student and assistant of the founders of [[Gestalt psychology]] in Berlin: [[Max Wertheimer]],  [[Wolfgang KÃ¶hler]] and   [[Kurt Koffka]].
In 1935, exiled by the Nazis, he got an assistantship in Cambridge with [[Frederic Charles Bartlett]] and later immigrated to the US, where he was again an assistant of  [[Wolfgang KÃ¶hler]]âs at [[Swarthmore College]].  He committed suicide in 1940 at 37 years of age. He had been suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] for some time and had received professional treatment.

His younger brother Wolfgang Duncker, a communist in exile in Moscow, was arrested in 1938 during the [[Great Purges]] and died in the [[Gulag]]. Their parents were the well-known socialist and later communist propagandists Hermann and [[KÃ¤te Duncker]].

== Achievements ==

Duncker coined the term [[functional fixedness]] for describing the difficulties in [[visual perception]] and in [[problem solving]] that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function which has to be changed for making the correct perception or for finding the solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens'', Springer, Berlin 1935&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Genimage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The candle problem (Karl Duncker, 1945).]]
In his "[[The Candle Problem|candle problem]]" the situation was defined by the objects: a candle, a box of thumb-tacks and a book of matches. The task was to fix the candles on the wall without any additional elements. The difficulty of this problem arises from the functional fixedness of the box, which originally contained thumb-tacks. It is a container in the problem situation but must be used as a shelf in the solution situation.

Other examples for this type of mental [[restructuring]] are:

* an electromagnet must be used as part of a pendulum
* a branch of a tree must be used as a tool
* a brick must be used a paper weight
* another meaning of a word must be found that is different from the meaning within the context of the sentence

# Coarsen the graph by generating a sequence of graphs G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, where G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the original graph and for each 0 â¤ i â¤ j â¤ N, the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than the number of vertices in G&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Compute a partition of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
# Project the partition back through the sequence in the order of G&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, refining it with respect to each graph.
The final partition computed during the third phase (the refined partition projected onto G&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is a partition of the original graph.

===Sound art and installations (2012-present)===
[[File:What Lies Beneath.jpg|thumb|left|What Lies Beneath, by Margaret Noble]]
Noble's installation ''44th and Landis'' opened in 2012 at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. The large-scale multimedia art piece combined [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]]-style paper dolls with 1980s urban influences based on her upbringing in San Diego's City Heights neighborhood, and included a performance by Noble.&lt;ref name="jchute032412"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=AnnaMaria|date=July 2012|title=The Exhibitionists|url=https://margaretnoble.net/wp-content/uploads/Riviera_Magazine_7_2012.pdf|journal=Riviera Magazine|publication-date=2 July 2012|pages=78â80|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's visual centerpiece was a hanging series of 100 paper dolls, along with paper-doll clothing, objects and architecture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-10/growing-city-heights|title=Growing up in City Heights|last=Carone|first=Angela|date=10 September 2012|work=PRI Arts, Culture &amp; Media|access-date=12 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015061647/https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-10/growing-city-heights|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her 2016 interactive piece "What Lies Beneath", she worked in sound sculpture, creating a tall wooden box with instructions next to it to raise the lid, which caused sounds of organ pipes, truck brakes and other dissonance to emit. The person interacting with it controlled the sound with the lid, with a "storm" inside the box.&lt;ref name="tlarson"/&gt;
[[File:I Long to be Free from Longing.jpg|thumb|I Long to Be Free from Longing, by Margaret Noble]]
Her "Head in the Sand" is a wooden box sitting on four legs with a head-sized hole in the top and instructions to visitors to place their heads in the hole and wait. Inside is a chambered light and sound show with soft pastoral sounds, the hole serving as a sanctuary from the art exhibit itself.&lt;ref name="tlarson" /&gt; "Head in the Sand" was included in her 2016 exhibition ''Resonating Object,'' an interactive mixture of sound, sculpture and videos, at [[South Puget Sound Community College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]]. The exhibition also included "I Long to Be Free From Longing" and "Material Shrine for the New Class", featuring dangling objects the visitor could squeeze to activate different sounds.&lt;ref name="mgilmore"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theolympian.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article103548607.html|title=Visitors, sound part of the art in âResonating Objectsâ|last=Gilmore|first=Molly|date=22 September 2016|work=[[The Olympian]]|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://archive.fo/2U1fY|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2014 interactive sound installation "I Long to Be Free From Longing" won first place in the 23rd annual Juried Exhibition at the [[Athenaeum Music &amp; Arts Library]] in San Diego.&lt;ref name="jchute081414"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-athenaeum-juried-exhibition-noble-2014aug14-story.html|title=Noble gets top prize in Athenaeum exhibition|last=Chute|first=James|date=14 August 2014|work=|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024023328/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-athenaeum-juried-exhibition-noble-2014aug14-story.htm|archive-date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Noble's 2016 sound art installation ''Time Strata'', a public art commission for the [[Port of San Diego]] at the [[CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez Park|Cesar Chavez Park]] pier, consisted of three sound sculptures made of materials including vintage buoys, hunks of bamboo, bells, stainless steel and harp strings, along with sounds of creatures like [[snapping shrimp]] in the water under the pier. Microphones placed around the pier fed the sound into a mixer and then into four digital consoles where participants could sample and alter the sounds.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-fall-arts-preview-visual-art-margaret-noble-2016sep13-htmlstory.html|title=Fall arts 2016: Up close with artist Margaret Noble|last=Myrland|first=Susan|date=13 September 2016|work=The San Diego Union-Times|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914225039/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/visual-arts/sdut-fall-arts-preview-visual-art-margaret-noble-2016sep13-htmlstory.html|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I Have Arrived.jpg|thumb|left|I Have Arrived, by Margaret Noble]]For ''The Collector'', Noble worked with puppeteers Animal Cracker Conspiracy and visual directors Bridget Rountree and Iain Gunn, creating a multi-layered soundscape that used animated video, live video projection and puppetry to tell a story of a debt collector.&lt;ref name="ljaniak"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/09/10/occupy-fringe-theatre-2012-the-good-the-bad-and-the-glowy|title=Occupy Fringe Theatre 2012: The Good, the Bad, and the Glowy|last=Janiak|first=Lily|date=10 September 2012|work=SF Weekly|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024023914/https://archives.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/09/10/occupy-fringe-theatre-2012-the-good-the-bad-and-the-glowy|archive-date=10 September 2012|dead-url=no|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Righteous Exploits'', a 2013 experimental performance created with Justin Hudnall, used a combination of live audio and video multimedia and performance art.&lt;ref name="ccasares"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/11/weekend-preview-righteous-exploits-stay-strange-an/|title=Weekend Preview: Righteous Exploits, Stay Strange and The Big Read|last=Cavanaugh|first=Maureen|date=11 April 2013|work=|access-date=15 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817090545/https://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/apr/11/weekend-preview-righteous-exploits-stay-strange-an/|archive-date=17 August 2013|dead-url=no|publisher=KPBS|last2=Casares|first2=Carissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her 2018 installations of ''Resonating Objects'' included "lawn sprinklers sitting on grass-covered pedestals, playing their percussive, shimmering, water-spraying sounds", entitled "I Have Arrived", which explores the use of expendable resources on lawns, or status symbols.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

[[File:A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds.jpg|thumb|A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure, by Margaret Noble]]Two other pieces are "Scaled Discords, 2015", with spinning tops representing "power structures, resource allocation and racial inequality in America", and "A Shit Pile of Lights and Sounds for Your Pleasure" consisting of "mash-up of Lite Brite, a Ouija board, and an early Akai sampler".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Noble describes the exhibit as "a quiet and personal experience for the participant. The sounds work together with the gestures of touching the work, the physical materials of each sculptureâs design and the personal responses of the audience".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Noble's art has been presented on [[PBS]] and reviewed favorably in Art Ltd. Magazine, [[The San Diego Union-Tribune]], and [[SF Weekly|San Francisco Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/artpress/docs/peripheral_arteries_art_review_-_ma_91e58f951d8abb|title=Peripheral ARTeries Art Review|date=March 2015|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic wrote that "enlarging the sensorium of art with sound begins with disorder," but while visual art may be viewed with "one or one hundred other hushed-up viewers," sound art is more like "a Fourth-of-July picnic, [[Charles Ives|Charles-Ives]] [[polyphony]], a resolute disequilibrium".&lt;ref name="tlarson" /&gt;

Noble's exhibits may not be what people expect art to be. Nathan Barnes of the Gallery at Kenneth J. Minnaert Center for the Arts at South Puget Sound Community College said, "''What can art be?'' is a good question to pose to students â and to the larger community. If people are walking through the door thinking art is a drawing or a painting that's rectilinear, this is probably going to blow their minds." Molly Gilmore of [[The Olympian|''The Olympian'']] wrote that the exhibition "doesn't fit into a neat category of art." Reviewer Michael James Rocha said in 2016, "Artist Margaret Noble isn't afraid to push the boundaries of what's art."&lt;ref name="mgilmore" /&gt;

Susan Myrland of ''The San Diego Tribune'' asked, "So why does sonic art still seem unusual 100 years after [[Luigi Russolo]] built his first [[intonarumori]], or experimental noise instruments?"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Noble and two of her collaborators on ''Time Strata'' offered these reasons: "It's hard to exhibit properly. Curators might not know how to assess it, and there aren't many collectors rushing to buy work that they can't see. It's difficult for sound art to break away from the paradigm of musical performance. It requires time and space to fully appreciate. Art galleries are often bare rooms with concrete floors, which means poor acoustics and one sound art piece overlapping another."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Observing ''Frakture'', Jennie Punter of ''[[Musicworks]]'' wrote of Noble's "underground club DJâs flair for performance and a conceptual artist's commitment to the rigorous investigation of ideas".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mark Jenkins of [[The Washington Post]] wrote, "Her primary goal is audience participation, whether that involves turning a crank or inserting one's head into a box to prompt whooshing sounds. Noble's work completes its circuit when the spectator is, literally or figuratively, inside it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/in-the-galleries-strangely-familiar-objects-for-the-eyes-and-ears/2017/01/26/2cacaf94-e191-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html|title=In the galleries: Strangely familiar objects for the eyes and ears|last=Jenkins|first=Mark|date=26 January 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015071805/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/in-the-galleries-strangely-familiar-objects-for-the-eyes-and-ears/2017/01/26/2cacaf94-e191-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.1c0b21848f65|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the exhibit ''44th and Landis,'' Angela Carone of [[Public Radio International]] commented, "Look close and you'll see the ghosts of ''Ms. Pac-Man'', the labels from Animal Cracker boxes and Laffy Taffy, and, on the seedier side, signage from neighborhood massage parlors. The paper dolls are pint-sized mash-ups of '80s pop culture and Victoriana. They seem to emerge from Noble's childhood dreams as she tried to make sense of both a threatening and exciting environment."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Drew Snyder noted, "...there is an excess to the sound collage, a soft but persistent drone of spinning bottles or coins, rolling glass marbles, the eternal creak of a cabinet hinge, the rapt knocking on a door, or the sound of something falling over. These reverberations are strikingly material, a confluence and collision of metal, plastic, wood and glass that mash up and reconfigure what we can imagine as a neighborhood's aural life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Drew|date=Jan 2013|title=San Diego: Margaret Noble: ''44th and Landis'' at Museum of Contemporary Art|url=http://artltdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AL-01-JAN-2013.pdf|journal=Art Ltd.|pages=22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015072511/http://artltdmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/AL-01-JAN-2013.pdf|archive-date=15 October 2018|via=art ltd. archives 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Now Is Not a GoodTime.jpg|left|thumb|Now Is Not a Good Time, by Margaret Noble]]
Reviewing her exhibit titled, "Now Is Not A Good Time", Rebecca Romani of ''The Buzz'' wrote in 2018 of its "intriguing mix" of sewing and tatting materials and rattlesnake tails powered by tiny batteries. Romani commented, "It's tempting to read a cautionary tale of watching too much ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House On The Prairie]]'' and the nostalgia that lead us to these current times."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vanguardculture.com/the-buzz-the-art-of-the-cut/|title=THE BUZZ: The Art of the Cut - Vanguard Culture|last=Romani|first=Rebecca|date=4 June 2018|work=Vanguard Culture|access-date=8 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015073017/https://vanguardculture.com/the-buzz-the-art-of-the-cut/|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Andrew Nunes described "Head in the Sand", which Noble exhibited in ''Resonating Objects'', as a  "claustrophobic challenge", a wooden box with a hole for a viewer's head. Nunes went on to say Noble fused sculptural sound art and interactivity, "seeking to go deeper on conceptual levels about human experience and our relationships with technology and each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/ez5eqm/resonating-objects-sound-art-meditate-human-experience|title=Interactive 'Resonating Objects' Meditate on the Human Experience|last=Nunes|first=Andrew|date=27 October 2016|work=Creators|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015211711/https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/ez5eqm/resonating-objects-sound-art-meditate-human-experience|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yvonne Wise, director of waterfront arts and activation at the Port of San Diego, wrote of Noble's art installation ''Time Strata'', "Temporal works like Noble's prompt new opportunities and formats for engaging in public art, producing interactions that are flexible, dynamic, and socially conscious. In place of monumental permanence emerges a sustained program of placemaking and experiential learning."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pantheonstorage.blob.core.windows.net/experiences/timestrata_online_singlepages.pdf|title=TIME STRATA, An Interactive Sound Art Experience by Margaret Noble|last=Wise|first=Yvonne|date=22 October 2016|website=Port of San Diego|isbn=9780999853108|access-date=October 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015073323/https://pantheonstorage.blob.core.windows.net/experiences/timestrata_online_singlepages.pdf|archive-date=15 October 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8274">In [[economics]], '''money illusion''', or '''price illusion''', is the tendency of people to think of currency in [[real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal, rather than real]], terms. In other words, the numerical/face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its [[purchasing power]] (real value) at a previous point in the general price level (in the past). This is false, as modern [[fiat currency|fiat currencies]] have no intrinsic value and their real value is derived from all the underlying value systems in an economy, e.g., sound government, sound economics, sound education, sound legal system, sound defence, etc. The change in this real value over time is indicated by the change in the [[Consumer Price Index]] over time.

The term was coined by [[Irving Fisher]] in ''Stabilizing the Dollar''. It was popularized by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the early twentieth century, and [[Irving Fisher]] wrote an important book on the subject, ''The Money Illusion'', in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Money Illusion | last = Fisher | first = Irving | publisher = Adelphi Company | year = 1928 |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of money illusion is disputed by [[monetary]] economists  who contend that people act rationally (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth.&lt;ref name=poverty&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marianne Bertran |author2=Sendhil Mullainathan |author3=Eldar Shafir  |last-author-amp=yes |title=A behavioral-economics view of poverty|journal=The American Economic Review|date=May 2004|volume=94|issue=2|pages=419â423|jstor=3592921|doi=10.1257/0002828041302019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eldar Shafir]], [[Peter A. Diamond]], and [[Amos Tversky]] (1997) have provided  [[empirical evidence]] for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.&lt;ref name="Shafir"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shafir |first=E. |last2=Diamond |first2=P. A. |last3=Tversky |first3=A. |year=1997 |title=On Money Illusion |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=341â374 |url= |doi=10.1162/003355397555208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shafir et al.&lt;ref name="Shafir" /&gt; also state that money illusion influences economic behaviour in three main ways:

*[[Sticky (economics)|Price stickiness]]. Money illusion has been proposed as one reason why [[nominal price]]s are slow to change even where [[Inflation (economics)|inflation]] has caused [[real price]]s or costs to rise.
*[[Contracts]] and [[laws]] are not indexed to inflation as frequently as one would rationally expect.
*Social discourse, in formal media and more generally, reflects some confusion about [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real and nominal value]].

Money illusion can also influence people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair, but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational equivalents. This result is consistent with the 'Myopic Loss Aversion theory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Benartzi | first1 = Shlomo | last2 = Thaler | first2 = Richard H. | year = 1995 | title = Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 73â92 | jstor = 2118511 | doi = 10.2307/2118511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the money illusion means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|jstor=1991376
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations and implications==

Explanations of money illusion generally describe the phenomenon in terms of [[heuristics]]. Nominal prices provide a convenient rule of thumb for determining value and real prices are only calculated if they seem highly [[Salience (communication)|salient]] (e.g. in periods of [[hyperinflation]] or in long term contracts).

Some have suggested that money illusion implies that the negative relationship between inflation and unemployment described by the [[Phillips curve]] might hold, contrary to more recent [[macroeconomic]] theories such as the "expectations-augmented Phillips curve".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Advanced macroeconomics
|first=David|last= Romer
|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year= 2006|page=252|isbn=9780072877304}}&lt;/ref&gt; If workers use their nominal wage as a reference point when evaluating wage offers, firms can keep real wages relatively lower in a period of high inflation as workers accept the seemingly high nominal wage increase. These lower real wages would allow firms to hire more workers in periods of high inflation.

Money illusion is believed to be instrumental in the Friedmanian version of the [[Phillips curve]]. Actually, money illusion is not enough to explain the mechanism underlying this Phillips curve. It requires two additional assumptions. First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: an increased aggregate demand exerts its influence on commodity prices sooner than it does on labour market prices. Therefore, the drop in unemployment is, after all, the result of decreasing real wages and an accurate judgement of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages). The other (arbitrary) assumption refers to a special informational asymmetry: whatever employees are unaware of in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=GalbÃ¡cs |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25156">{{numeral systems}}
A '''negative base''' (or negative [[radix]]) may be used to construct a [[non-standard positional numeral system]]. Like other place-value systems, each position holds multiples of the appropriate power of the system's base; but that base is negativeâthat is to say, the base {{mvar|b}} is equal to {{mvar|âr}} for some natural number {{mvar|r}} ({{mvar|r â¥ 2}}).

Negative-base systems can accommodate all the same numbers as standard place-value systems, but both positive and negative numbers are represented without the use of a [[minus sign]] (or, in computer representation, a [[sign bit]]); this advantage is countered by an increased complexity of arithmetic operations. The need to store the information normally contained by a negative sign often results in a negative-base number being one digit longer than its positive-base equivalent.

The common names for negative-base positional numeral systems are formed by [[prefix (linguistics)|prefixing]] ''nega-'' to the name of the corresponding positive-base system; for example, '''negadecimal''' (base â10) corresponds to [[decimal]] (base 10), '''negabinary''' (base â2) to [[binary numeral system|binary]] (base 2), and '''negaternary''' (base â3) to [[ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Donald|last=Knuth|title=[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 2|year=1998|edition=3rd|pages=204â205}}. Knuth mentions both negabinary and negadecimal.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The negaternary system is discussed briefly in {{Citation | last1=PetkovÅ¡ek | first1=Marko | author1-link=Marko PetkovÅ¡ek | title=Ambiguous numbers are dense | doi=10.2307/2324393 | mr=1048915 | year=1990 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=97 | issue=5 | pages=408â411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider what is meant by the representation {{val|fmt=none|12243}} in the negadecimal system, whose base {{mvar|b}} is â10:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|+ Multiples of
|-
| {{math|(â10)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 10,000}}
| {{math|(â10)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} â1,000}}
| {{math|(â10)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 100}}
| {{math|(â10)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} â10}}
| {{math|(â10)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}
|-
| 1
| 2
| 2
| 4
| 3
|}

Since 10,000 + (â2,000) + 200 + (â40) + 3 = {{val|fmt=commas|8163}}, the representation {{val|fmt=commas|12243|s={{sub|â10}}}} in negadecimal notation is equivalent to {{val|fmt=commas|8,163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal notation, while {{val|fmt=commas|â8163|s={{sub|10}}}} in decimal would be written {{val|fmt=commas|9,977|s={{sub|â10}}}} in negadecimal.

==History==
Negative numerical bases were first considered by [[Vittorio GrÃ¼nwald]] in his work ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'', published in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Vittorio GrÃ¼nwald. ''Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini'' (1885), 203-221, 367&lt;/ref&gt; GrÃ¼nwald gave algorithms for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root extraction, divisibility tests, and radix conversion. Negative bases were later independently rediscovered by [[Aubrey J. Kempner|A. J. Kempner]] in 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last = Kempner | first = A. J. | authorlink = Aubrey J. Kempner
 | doi = 10.2307/2300532
 | issue = 10
 | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]
 | mr = 1523792
 | pages = 610â617
 | title = Anormal Systems of Numeration
 | volume = 43
 | year = 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ZdzisÅaw Pawlak]] and A. Wakulicz in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Pawlak | first1 = Z.
 | last2 = Wakulicz | first2 = A.
 | journal = Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Scienses |series = Classe III
 | pages = 233â236
 | title = Use of expansions with a negative basis in the arithmometer of a digital computer
 | volume = 5
 | year = 1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negabinary was implemented in the early [[Poland|Polish]] computer [[BINEG]] (and [[UMC (computer)|UMC]]), built 1957â59, based on ideas by Z. Pawlak and A. Lazarkiewicz from the [[Mathematical Institute]] in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf Marczynski, R. W., "The First Seven Years of Polish Computing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719192337/http://chc60.fgcu.edu/images/articles/Marczynski.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Vol. 2, No 1, January 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementations since then have been rare.

==Notation and use==
Denoting the base as {{mvar|âr}}, every [[integer]] {{mvar|a}} can be written uniquely as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \sum_{i=0}^{n}d_{i}(-r)^{i}&lt;/math&gt;
where each digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer from 0 to {{math|''r'' - 1}} and the leading digit {{mvar|d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|&gt; 0}} (unless {{math|''n''&amp;#x003D;0}}). The base {{mvar|âr}} expansion of {{mvar|a}} is then given by the string {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;hellip;''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Negative-base systems may thus be compared to [[signed-digit representation]]s, such as [[balanced ternary]], where the radix is positive but the digits are taken from a partially negative range. (In the table below the digit of value â1 is written as the single character T.)

Some numbers have the same representation in base {{mvar|âr}} as in base {{mvar|r}}.  For example, the numbers from 100 to 109 have the same representations in decimal and negadecimal.  Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;17=2^4+2^0=(-2)^4+(-2)^0&lt;/math&gt;
and is represented by 10001 in binary and 10001 in negabinary.

Some numbers with their expansions in a number of positive and corresponding negative bases are:

Note that the base {{mvar|âr}} expansions of negative integers have an [[even number]] of digits, while the base {{mvar|âr}} expansions of the non-negative integers have an [[odd number]] of digits.

==Calculation==
The base {{mvar|âr}} expansion of a number can be found by repeated division by {{mvar|âr}}, recording the non-negative remainders of &lt;math&gt; 0, 1, \ldots, r-1&lt;/math&gt;, and concatenating those remainders, starting with the last.  Note that if {{math| ''a'' / ''b'' &amp;#x003D; ''c''}}, remainder {{mvar|d}}, then {{math| ''bc'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a''}} and therefore {{math| ''d'' &amp;#x003D; ''a'' - ''bc''}}. To arrive at the correct conversion, the value for {{mvar|c}} must be chosen such that {{mvar|d}} is non-negative and minimal. This is exemplified in the fourth line of the following example wherein â5 Ã· â3 must be chosen to equal 2 remainder 1 instead of 1 remainder â2.

For example, to convert 146 in decimal to negaternary:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rr}
 146 \div (-3) = &amp; -48 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2 \\
 -48 \div (-3) = &amp;  16 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 0 \\
  16 \div (-3) = &amp;  -5 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
  -5 \div (-3) = &amp;   2 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 1 \\
   2 \div (-3) = &amp;   0 ~\operatorname{remainder}~ 2
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
Reading the remainders backward we obtain the negaternary representation of 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;: 21102&lt;sub&gt;â3&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Proof: ((('''2'''Â·(â3)+'''1''')Â·(â3)+'''1''')Â·(â3)+'''0''')Â·(â3)+'''2''' = 146&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that in most [[programming languages]], the result (in integer arithmetic) of dividing a negative number by a negative number is rounded towards 0, usually leaving a negative remainder. In such a case we have {{math|''a'' &amp;#x003D; (â''r'')''c'' + ''d'' &amp;#x003D; (â''r'')''c'' + ''d'' â ''r'' + ''r'' &amp;#x003D; (â''r'')(''c'' + 1) + (''d'' + ''r'')}}. Because {{math|{{!}}d{{!}} &lt; r}}, {{math|(''d'' + ''r'')}} is the positive remainder. Therefore, to get the correct result in such case, computer implementations of the above algorithm should add 1 and {{mvar|r}} to the quotient and remainder respectively.

=== Shortcut calculation ===
====To negabinary====
The conversion to ''negabinary'' (base â2; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a remarkable shortcut 
(C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaBinary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA; // = 2/3*((2*2)^16-1) = ...1010
	return (value + Schroeppel2) ^ Schroeppel2; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements Îµ {0,1} (bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Due to D. Librik (Szudzik). The bitwise XOR portion is originally due to [[Richard Schroeppel|Schroeppel]] (1972).&lt;ref&gt;See the MathWorld Negabinary link&lt;/ref&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaBinary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel2 = 0xAAAAAAAA;
    // Convert to NegaBinary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel2 ) ^ Schroeppel2 ).toString(2);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====To negaquaternary====
The conversion to ''negaquaternary'' (base â4; digits &lt;math&gt;\in \; \{0, 1, 2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt;) allows a similar shortcut (C implementation):
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int toNegaQuaternary(unsigned int value) // input in standard binary
{
	unsigned int Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC; // = 4/5*((2*4)^8-1) = ...11001100 = ...3030
	return (value + Schroeppel4) ^ Schroeppel4; // eXclusive OR
	// resulting unsigned int to be interpreted as string of elements Îµ {0,1,2,3} (pairs of bits)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

JavaScript port for the same shortcut calculation: 
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
function toNegaQuaternary( number ) {
    var Schroeppel4 = 0xCCCCCCCC;
    // Convert to NegaQuaternary String
    return ( ( number + Schroeppel4 ) ^ Schroeppel4 ).toString(4);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Arithmetic operations==
The following describes the arithmetic operations for negabinary; calculations in larger bases are similar.

===Addition===
Adding negabinary numbers proceeds bitwise, starting from the [[least significant bit]]s; the bits from each addend are summed with the ([[balanced ternary]]) carry from the previous bit (0 at the LSB). This sum is then decomposed into an output bit and carry for the next iteration as show in the table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right;"
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Sum
! colspan=3 | Output
! rowspan=2 | Comment 
|-
! Bit
! colspan=2 | Carry
|-
| â2 || 010{{sub|â2}} || 0 ||  1 || 01{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | â2 occurs only during subtraction.
|-
| â1 || 011{{sub|â2}} || 1 ||  1 || 01{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  0 || 000{{sub|â2}} || 0 ||  0 || 00{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  1 || 001{{sub|â2}} || 1 ||  0 || 00{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  2 || 110{{sub|â2}} || 0 || â1 || 11{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" |
|-
|  3 || 111{{sub|â2}} || 1 || â1 || 11{{sub|â2}}
| style="text-align:left;" | 3 occurs only during addition.
|}

The second row of this table, for instance, expresses the fact that '''â1''' = '''1''' + '''1''' Ã â2; the fifth row says '''2''' = '''0''' + '''â1''' Ã â2; etc.

As an example, to add 1010101{{sub|â2}} (1 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 85) and 1110100{{sub|â2}} (4 + 16 â 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          1 â1  0 â1  1 â1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Number:         1 â1  2  0  3 â1  2  0  1
 Bit (result):   1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1
 Carry:          0  1 â1  0 â1  1 â1  0  0

so the result is 110011001{{sub|â2}} (1 â 8 + 16 â 128 + 256 = 137).

==== Another method ====
While adding two negabinary numbers, every time a carry is generated an extra carry should be propagated to next bit. Consider same example as above

 Extra carry:       1  1  0  1  0  0  0     
 Carry:          1  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0
 First addend:         1  0  1  0  1  0  1
 Second addend:        1  1  1  0  1  0  0 +
                --------------------------
 Answer:         1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1

==== Negabinary full adder ====
A [[Adder (electronics)|full adder]] circuit can be designed to add numbers in negabinary. The following logic is used to calculate the sum and carries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Francis, Suganda, Shizuhuo |first=Yu, Jutamulia, Yin |date=4 September 2001 |title=Introduction to Information Optics |publisher=Academic Press |page=498 |isbn=9780127748115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s_i = a_i \oplus b_i \oplus c_i^+ \oplus c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^+ = \overline{a_i}\overline{b_i}\overline{c_i^+}c_i^-&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}^- = a_i b_i \overline{c_i^-} + (a_i \oplus b_i)c_i^+ \overline{c_i^-}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Incrementing negabinary numbers ====
Incrementing a negabinary number can be done by using the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913101620/http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1878151/why-does-the-following-formula-increment-a-negabinary-number-number-in-base-2 |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2x \oplus ((2x \oplus x) + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction===
To subtract, multiply each bit of the second number by â1, and add the numbers, using the same table as above.

As an example, to compute 1101001{{sub|â2}} (1 â 8 â 32 + 64 = 25) minus 1110100{{sub|â2}} (4 + 16 â 32 + 64 = 52),

 Carry:          0  1 â1  1  0  0  0
 First number:   1  1  0  1  0  0  1
 Second number: â1 â1 â1  0 â1  0  0 +
                --------------------
 Number:         0  1 â2  2 â1  0  1
 Bit (result):   0  1  0  0  1  0  1
 Carry:          0  0  1 â1  1  0  0

so the result is 100101{{sub|â2}} (1 + 4 â32 = â27).

Unary negation, {{math|â''x''}}, can be computed as binary subtraction from zero, {{math|0 â ''x''}}.

===Multiplication and division===
Shifting to the left multiplies by â2, shifting to the right divides by â2.

To multiply, multiply like normal [[decimal]] or [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers, but using the negabinary rules for adding the carry, when adding the numbers.

 First number:                   1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 Second number:                  1  0  1  1  0  1  1 Ã
               -------------------------------------
                                 1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                              1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
                        1  1  1  0  1  1  0
                     1  1  1  0  1  1  0
 
               1  1  1  0  1  1  0                   +
               -------------------------------------
 Carry:        0 â1  0 â1 â1 â1 â1 â1  0 â1  0  0
 Number:       1  0  2  1  2  2  2  3  2  0  2  1  0
 Bit (result): 1  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0
 Carry:           0 â1  0 â1 â1 â1 â1 â1  0 â1  0  0

For each column, add ''carry'' to ''number'', and divide the sum by â2, to get the new ''carry'', and the resulting bit as the remainder.

===Comparing negabinary numbers===
It is possible to compare negabinary numbers by slightly adjusting a normal unsigned [[digital comparator|binary comparator]]. When comparing the numbers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, invert each odd positioned bit of both numbers.
After this, compare &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; using a standard unsigned comparator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murugesan |first=San|date=1977|title=Negabinary arithmetic circuits using binary arithmetic  |journal=Electronic Circuits and Systems, IEE Journal on |publisher=IET |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=77â78 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fractional numbers==
Base {{mvar|âr}} representation may of course be carried beyond the [[radix point]], allowing the representation of non-integral numbers.

As with positive-base systems, terminating representations correspond to fractions where the denominator is a power of the base; repeating representations correspond to other rationals, and for the same reason.

===Non-unique representations===
Unlike positive-base systems, where integers and terminating fractions have non-unique representations (for example, in decimal [[0.999â¦ = 1]]) in negative-base systems the integers have only a single representation.  However, there do exist rationals with non-unique representations. For the digits {0, 1, &amp;hellip;, '''t'''} with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}:=r\!-\!\!1=-b\!-\!\!1&lt;/math&gt; the biggest digit and
:&lt;math&gt;T:=0.\overline{01}_b = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} b^{-2i} = \frac1{b^2-1} = \frac1{r^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;0.\overline{0\mathbf{t}}_b=\mathbf{t}T=\frac{r\!-\!\!1}{r^2-1}=\frac1{r+1}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; as well as
:&lt;math&gt;1.\overline{\mathbf{t}0}_b = 1+\mathbf{t}bT = \frac{(r^2-1)+(r\!-\!\!1)b}{r^2-1}= \frac1{r+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
So every number &lt;math&gt;\frac1{r+1}+z&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Positional notation#Terminating fractions|terminating fraction]] &lt;math&gt;z\in \Z r^{\Z}&lt;/math&gt; added has two distinct representations.

For example, in negaternary, i.e. &lt;math&gt;b=-3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{t}=2&lt;/math&gt;, there is
: &lt;math&gt;1.\overline{02}_{(-3)} = \frac{5}{4} = 2.\overline{20}_{(-3)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Such non-unique representations can be found by considering the largest and smallest possible representations with integral parts 0 and 1 respectively, and then noting that they are equal. (Indeed, this works with any integral-base system.) The rationals thus non-uniquely expressible are those of form
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{z(r+1) + 1}{b^i(r + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;z,i\in \Z.&lt;/math&gt;

Just as using a negative base allows the representation of negative numbers without an explicit negative sign, using an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] base allows the representation of [[Gaussian integer]]s. [[Donald Knuth]] proposed the [[quater-imaginary base]] (base 2i) in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;D. Knuth. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 2, 3rd Edition. Addison-Wesley. pp. 205, "Positional Number Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative liberty''' is freedom from interference by other people. Negative liberty is primarily concerned with freedom from external restraint and contrasts with [[positive liberty]] (the possession of the power and resources to fulfil one's own potential). The distinction was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

== Overview ==
''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes negative liberty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The negative concept of freedom ... is most commonly assumed in liberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences of the right to private property, although some have contested the claim that private property necessarily enhances negative liberty."&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Gerald Cohen|Cohen, G. A.]], 1991, ''Capitalism, Freedom and the Proletariat''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
According to [[Thomas Hobbes]], "a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and will he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Part 2, Ch. XXI; thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).

[[Claude Adrien HelvÃ©tius]] expressed the following point clearly: "The free man is the man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a slave by the fear of punishment ... it is not lack of freedom, not to fly like an eagle or swim like a whale." Moreover, [[John Jay]], in [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' paper]] [[Federalist No. 2|No. 2]], stated that: "Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers." Jay's meaning would be better expressed by substituting "negative liberty" in place of "natural rights", for the argument here is that the power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.

An idea that anticipates the distinction between negative and positive liberty was [[G. F. W. Hegel]]'s "[[sphere of abstract right]]" (furthered in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''), which constitutes what now is called negative freedom and his subsequent distinction between "abstract" and "positive liberty."&lt;ref&gt;George Klosko, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O5XvGdmuTkkC&amp;dq= ''History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume II: Modern''] (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 465: "we should note that Hegel's realization of the distance between his own and the traditional liberal conception of freedom, which he calls "abstract freedom," is clear in his embrace of [[positive freedom]] [in [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR149 ''PR'' Â§149A]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lee Goodfield, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n9vpAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq= ''Hegel and the Metaphysical Frontiers of Political Theory''], Routledge, 2014: "Hegel's collective vision of positive liberty in and through ''[[Sittlichkeit]]'' is reduced to no more than the "mischief" and "mystification" of an amoral, regressive and anti-liberal political vision."&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the Anglophone [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition the distinction between negative and positive liberty was introduced by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in his 1958 lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]". According to Berlin, the distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition. In Berlin's words, "liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subjectâa person or group of personsâis or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"&gt;Berlin, I. (1958). "Two Concepts of Liberty." In Isaiah Berlin (1969): ''Four Essays on Liberty''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on negative liberty are imposed by a person, not by natural causes or incapacity.

[[Frankfurt School]] [[psychoanalyst]] and [[humanistic]] [[philosopher]] [[Erich Fromm]] drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work, ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'', that predates Berlin's essay by more than a decade.  Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms.  This aspect of freedom, he argues, "is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm, ''The Fear of Freedom'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., 1966):26.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Fromm, then, negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct.

The distinction between positive and negative liberty is considered specious by some [[Socialism|socialist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] political philosophers, who argue that positive and negative liberty are indistinguishable in practice, or that one cannot exist without the other.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Negative/Positive Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he is not a socialist nor a Marxist, Berlin argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It follows that a frontier must be drawn between the area of private life and that of public authority. Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others."&lt;ref name="Berlin, I. 1958"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Libertarian]] thinker [[Tibor Machan]] defends negative liberty as "required for moral choice and, thus, for human flourishing," claiming that it "is secured when the rights of individual members of a human community to life, to voluntary action (or to liberty of conduct), and to property are universally respected, observed, and defended."

== Negative liberty and authority: Hobbes and Locke ==

One might ask, "How is men's desire for liberty to be reconciled with the assumed need for authority?" Its answer by various thinkers provides a fault line for understanding their view on liberty but also a cluster of intersecting concepts such as authority, equality, and justice.

[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] give two influential and representative solutions to this question. As a starting point, both agree that a line must be drawn and a space sharply delineated where each individual can act unhindered according to their tastes, desires, and inclinations. This zone defines the sacrosanct space of personal liberty. But, they believe no society is possible without some authority, where the intended purpose of authority is to prevent collisions among the different ends and, thereby, to demarcate the boundaries where each person's zone of liberty begins and ends. Where Hobbes and Locke differ is the extent of the zone. Hobbes, who took a rather negative view of human nature, argued that a strong authority was needed to curb men's intrinsically wild, savage, and corrupt impulses. Only a powerful authority can keep at bay the permanent and always looming threat of anarchy. Locke believed, on the other hand, that men on the whole are more good than wicked and, accordingly, the area for individual liberty can be left rather at large.

Locke is a slightly more ambiguous case than Hobbes because although his conception of liberty was largely negative (in terms of non-interference), he differed in that he courted the republican tradition of liberty by rejecting the notion that an individual could be free if he was under the arbitrary power of another:

"This ''freedom'' from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together: for a man, not having the power of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his own consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he pleases. No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it. Indeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by some act that deserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in his power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and he does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life, it is in his power, by resisting the will of his master, to draw on himself the death he desires."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr04.htm John Locke: ''Second Treatise of Civil Government'', Chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concrete example ==

This section outlines specific examples of governmental types which follow the concept of negative liberty.

===Monarchy===
Thomas Hobbes' [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|''Leviathan'']] outlines a commonwealth based upon a monarchy to whom citizens have ceded their rights. The basic reasoning for Hobbes' assertion that this system was most ideal relates more to Hobbes' value of order and simplicity in government. The monarchy provides for its subjects, and its subjects go about their day-to-day lives without interaction with the government:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: ''I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.''

The sovereign has twelve principal rights:

# because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.
# because the covenant forming the commonwealth is the subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
# the selection of sovereign is (in theory) by majority vote; the minority have agreed to abide by this.
# every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects, and cannot be accused of injustice.
# following this, the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.
# because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord, therefore the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse; who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes; and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
# to prescribe the rules of civil law and property.
# to be judge in all cases.
# to make war and peace as he sees fit; and to command the army.
# to choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
# to reward with riches and honour; or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.
# to establish laws of honour and a scale of worth.

Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of ''Separation of Powers'', in particular the form that would later become the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution]]. Part 6 is a perhaps under-emphasised feature of Hobbes's argument: his is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech, should they be considered desirable by the sovereign in order to promote order.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon closer inspection of Hobbes' ''Leviathan'', it becomes clear that Hobbes believed individual people in society must give up liberty to a sovereign. Whether that sovereign is an absolute monarch or other form was left open to debate, however Hobbes himself viewed the absolute monarch as the best of all options. Hobbes himself said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For as amongst masterless men, there is perpetual war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of goods, or lands; no security; but a full and absolute liberty in every particular man: so in states, and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth, not every man, has an absolute liberty, to do what it shall judge, that is to say, what that man, or assembly that representeth it, shall judge most conducing to their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works'', vol. III (''Leviathan''). 1651: [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/585/89860 Part 1, Ch. XIX]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From this quote it is clear that Hobbes contended that people in a [[state of nature]] ceded their [[natural rights|individual rights]] to create [[sovereignty]], retained by the state, in return for their protection and a more functional society. In essence, a social contract between the sovereign and citizens evolves out of pragmatic self-interest. Hobbes named the state ''Leviathan'', thus pointing to the artifice involved in the social contract. In this vein, Hobbes' concept of negative liberty was built upon the notion that the state would not act upon its subjects because its subjects had willingly relinquished their liberties.

'''The Nurbank bank''', founded in Atyrau regional governor's office was taken over by [[Rakhat Aliyev]] in January 2007. Shortly after, two Nurbank managers, Zholdas Timraliyev and Aybar Khasenov, were kidnapped, tortured and eventually killed by Aliyev. In May 2007, the criminal proceedings against Aliyev in Almaty began and [[Kazakhstan]] sentenced him for forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&amp;int_id=expert_opinions&amp;news_id=464 |title=Rakhat Aliyev may be sentenced to life imprisonment in Austria - newspaper |website=Interfax.kz |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the Nurbank bank opened for business and became the seventh largest bank in [[Kazakhstan]]. "According to its Website, it is owned by the largest oil, food, publishing and foreign trade firms operating in Kazakhstan, and also currently lends to oil, food, foreign trade, and publishing &amp; information firms."&lt;ref name=widens&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2007/05/24/kazakhstan-nurbank-scandal-widens/ |title=Kazakhstan: Nurbank scandal widens |publisher=Foreign Policy Blogs |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Rakhat Aliyev became the main owner and acquired about 75% of all Nurbankâs assets. His father owned 6.71% and his 22-year-old son Nurali Aliyev was a sitting board member.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

==First kidnapping==
Around January 18, 2007, Zholdas Timraliyev (vice president) and Abilmazhen Gilimov (chairmen of Nurbank) entered into a car and were threatened by Rakhat Aliyev, according to Abilmazhen Gilimov.  Rakhat was looking to acquire possession of a prized financial building in Kazakhstan's commercial capital, Almaty by ensuring ownership passed to him. They escaped after 24 hours. During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife and tell of his abduction. Timraliyev's wife (Armangul Kapasheva/Armangul Qapasheva) reported him missing. They escaped after being held for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt; They both left their positions at Nurbank on January 19.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

According to newspapers, the building Aliyev wanted them to sell, sold on January 22 for a very low price,  four days after the alleged first kidnapping.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pannier |first=Bruce |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1074875.html |title=Kazakhstan: Nazarbaev's Son-In-Law Sent To Austria Amid More Accusations |website=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second kidnapping==
On January 31, Timraliyev disappeared again after receiving summons to speak with the tax police. Him and  chairman of the board, Aibar Khasenov were reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_06_06/Kazakh-presidents-former-son-in-law-arrested-in-Vienna-7204/ |title=Kazakh president's former son-in-law arrested in Vienna|publisher=The Voice of Russia |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a days of violent acts, both of the bodies were tucked into a metal drum, assailed with chalk and buried on a waste dump.&lt;ref name=tagdyr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519112016/http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case/ |archivedate=May 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife (Armangul Kapasheva) and tell of his abduction. She reported them missing and her strong public appearance about the disappearance of her husband and mounting pressure against Alivey, the Kazakh authorities finally initiated criminal proceedings on May 10, 2007.&lt;ref name=tagdyr/&gt; The wives of the two missing Nurbank managers establish the TAGDYR association in order to find their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/asianet/130411/rakhat-aliyev-malta-lives-fear-he-will-be-kidnapped |title=Rakhat Aliyev in Malta lives in fear that he will be kidnapped |publisher=Global Post |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
:''See Also [[Tagdyr]]''
As a result, Aliyev brought forth a lawsuit against the two wives, for âinsulting his honor and dignity.â&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

Timraliyevâs wife was interviewed and several news outlets including,Svoboda Slova," "Tasjargan," "Vremya," and zonakz.net published her comments and now faced legal suit from Aliyev.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

==Criminal prosecution==
Aliyev was quickly appointed the new Kazak ambassador to Austria on February 9, 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country. While in Austria, Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazak President, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. A full domestic Kazak investigation began in May 2007 into Aliyevâs activities. His diplomatic passport was cancelled, as was his diplomatic immunity. Kazakhstan filed its first extradition request at this time. The domestic Kazak investigation concluded January 2008 and Kazak courts sentenced Aliyev to 20 years of imprisonment ''in absentia''.  His crimes were kidnapping, treason and plotting a coup d'Ã©tat against his father-in-law  Nursultan Nazarbayev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roberts-report.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html |title=The Roberts Report on Central Asia and Kazakhstan: February 2007 |website=Roberts-report.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their second request for extradition in 2011 was also rejected, as Austria feared Kazak political persecution of Aliyev. They did however open their own investigation into Aliyev's dealings.

January 2013, Ailyev claimed Kazakhstan was politically persecuting him because he rejected the political system. Viennese supreme court excluded political underpinnings as a reason for persecution, which helped to greatly legitimize legal action brought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ÐÐ¸ÑÐµÑ: Steven ÐÑÐºÑÐ´Ð°: Simon |url=http://www.caucasustimes.com/article.asp?id=21159 |title=Caucasus Times |publisher=Caucasus Times |date=2013-07-21 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes==
[[Rakhat Aliyev]] (Shoraz) is also suspected of the murder of opposition leader and former Kazak ambassador to Russia Mr Sarsenbayev in early 2006, a complex embezzlement scheme stretching from Germany to Malta and Navis, torturing two Kazak bodyguards in 2001, and the death of his girlfriend [[Anastasiya Novikova]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610020907/http://austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |archivedate=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of TÃ¼rkiye Bozkurt " In 1999 we came together as mothers, whose children were either in the mountains, in prisons or had lost their lives in the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= International Women's Day for Peace and Disarmament|publisher= International Peace Bureau|year=2007|url= http://www.ipb.org/i/pdf-files/May_24-2007_Int_Womens_Day_for_Peace_and_Disarmament.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are based in [[Istanbul]] and [[Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Delegationsbericht der Newroz-Delegation 2008 aus MÃ¼nchen, Berlin und NRW|publisher= Deutsch-Kurdischen Gesellschaft|year=2008|url= http://www.dkg-muenchen.de/DKG%20Aktuell-Dateien/DelegationsberichtNewroz.html|accessdate=2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have been frequently in the news for their protests and court cases. In 2000, [[Amnesty International]] reported a delegation of Peace Mothers had allegedly been tortured and ill-treated, after they travelled to neighbouring Iraq to try to mediate between the two sides in the civil conflict in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] in North [[Iraq]]. The lawyer who defended them, [[Eren Keskin]], was later put on trial for having insulted the army after her description of the alleged torture of the Peace Mothers was published in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Memorandum from Amnesty International UK|publisher= Amnesty International|date=January 2002

In June 2006, Peace Mother activists Muyesser Gunes and Sakine Arat were sentenced to 1-year jail each and 600 YTL in Ankara 4th Criminal Court on a charge of praising a separatist organisation and its leader, after they had visited the [[Turkish General Staff|General Staff]] headquarters on 22 August 2005 to present their case.

'''Phagomimicry''' is a [[defensive behaviour]] of [[sea hare]]s, in which the animal ejects a mixture of chemicals, which [[Mimicry|mimic]] food, and overwhelm the senses of their predator, giving the sea hare a chance to escape.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kicklighter|first=Cynthia E.|last2=Shabani|first2=Shkelzen|last3=Johnson|first3=Paul M.|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|title=Sea Hares Use Novel Antipredatory Chemical Defenses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982205002228|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=6|pages=549â554|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shabani|first1=Shkelzen|last2=Yaldiz|first2=Seymanur|last3=Vu|first3=Luan|last4=Derby|first4=Charles D.|date=2 October 2007|title=Acidity enhances the effectiveness of active chemical defensive secretions of sea hares, Aplysia californica, against spiny lobsters, Panulirus interruptus|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|volume=193|issue=12|pages=1195â1204|doi=10.1007/s00359-007-0271-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nusnbaum|first1=Matthew|last2=Derby|first2=Charles D.|date=May 2010|title=Ink secretion protects sea hares by acting on the olfactory and nonolfactory chemical senses of a predatory fish|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1067â1076|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.01.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical defence response of the sea hare to a predator is to release two chemicals - [[Cephalopod ink|ink]] from the ink gland and [[opal]]ine from the opaline gland. While ink creates a dark, diffuse cloud in the water which disrupts the sensory perception of the predator by acting as a smokescreen and as a decoy, the opaline, which affects the senses dealing with feeding, causes the predator to instinctively attack the cloud of chemicals as if it were indeed food.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; This ink is able to mimic food by having a high concentration of amino acids and other compounds that are normally found in food, and the attack behaviour of the predator allows the sea-hares the opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NUSNBAUM|first=MATTHEW|last2=DERBY|first2=CHARLES D.|date=2010|title=Effects of Sea Hare Ink Secretion and Its Escapin-Generated Components on a Variety of Predatory Fishes|jstor=27822920|journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=218|issue=3|pages=282â292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inking behaviour ==
The inking behaviour exhibited in phagomimicry is in response to predator threat. [[Anaspidea|Sea hares]] have many natural predators such as [[starfish]], [[lobster]]s, and other [[crustacean]]s. When threatened by a predator, phagomimicry behaviour begins. An ink solution is released from both the [[Opaline gland|opaline]] and ink glands individually, then the compounds mix in the mantle of the sea hare to form the ink mixture. When ink is released it creates a smoke-screen like [[Anti-predator adaptation|defense mechanism]] allowing the sea hares time to escape while also affecting the [[Olfaction|olfactory]] and [[Taste|gustation]] senses of their predator.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Predators are tricked into thinking that they have captured their prey due to the specific chemical composition of the ink released. This induces feeding behaviours in the predator, and again gives the sea hares a better chance of escaping predation.

=== Opaline gland ===
The opaline gland is a structure resembling a bundle of grapes attached to a central canal which is composed of [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells. Synthesis of the opaline substance happens in the opaline vesicles themselves, as there are only opaline vesicles and muscle cells in the opaline gland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prince|first=Jeffrey S.|date=2007-05-01|title=Opaline gland ultrastructure in Aplysia californica (Gastropoda: Anaspidea)|url=http://academic.oup.com/mollus/article/73/2/199/978441/Opaline-gland-ultrastructure-in-Aplysia|journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies|language=en|volume=73|issue=2|pages=199â204|doi=10.1093/mollus/eym016|issn=0260-1230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gland is innervated by three separate [[motor neuron]]s, and is composed of single large cells and vesicle cells, all of which have enlarged nucleus. These cells are inclosed in an external layer of muscle. When a [[sensory neuron]] detects a predator threat, dopamine is released onto one of the three motor neurons. The dopamine release causes a gland contraction, which then causes the expulsion of the opaline substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brunelli|first=M.|last2=Castellucci|first2=V.|last3=Kandel|first3=E. R.|date=1976|title=Synaptic Facilitation and Behavioral Sensitization in Aplysia: Possible Role of Serotonin and Cyclic AMP|jstor=1743647|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1178â1181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ink gland ===
The ink gland is smaller in size than the opaline gland, and is composed of two cell types: Rough endoplasmic recticlum (RER) and granulate cells. The cells are surrounded by a layer of muscle, to contraction and expelling their contents. The RER is the formation site of the anti-predator protein, the granulate cells are for extra pigment storage. Pigment is dependent on the amount of red algae available to the sea hares, the higher the red algal consumption, the darker the colour of their ink.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamio|first=Michiya|last2=Grimes|first2=Tiphani V.|last3=Hutchins|first3=Melissa H.|last4=Dam|first4=Robyn van|last5=Derby|first5=Charles D.|title=The purple pigment aplysioviolin in sea hare ink deters predatory blue crabs through their chemical senses|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347210001338|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=1|pages=89â100|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mixing can cause another chain of reactions between the compounds that have further implications on the effect that the ink secretion has on predators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ink chemical composition ==
Both the opaline and ink gland secrete different substances that when mixed together form the ink released during phagomimicry. The secretion is very acidic (ink having a pH of 4.9 and opaline having a pH of 5.8) and contains high levels of bioactive molecules that can serve as feeding stimulants, feeding deterrents, and aversive compounds. Feeding stimulants can be found in both the ink and opaline secretions in the form of [[amino acid]]s (such as [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]), and serve to trick predators into thinking that the ink secretion is a food source.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derby|first=Charles D.|last2=Kicklighter|first2=Cynthia E.|last3=Johnson|first3=P.

[[File:Juan de la AbadÃ­a, 'The Elder' - Saint Michael Weighing Souls - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Juan de la AbadÃ­a el Viejo]]: ''Saint Michael Weighing Souls'']]
'''Predestination''', in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by [[God]], usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/predestination "Predestination", '' The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005. 13 Jun 2011 at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of predestination often seek to address the "[[Argument from free will|paradox of free will]]", whereby God's [[omniscience]] seems incompatible with human [[Free will in theology|free will]]. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious [[determinism]]; and usually [[predeterminism]].

==Christianity==

===History===

====New Testament period====
There is some disagreement among scholars regarding the views on predestination of [[Second Temple period|first-century AD Judaism]], out of which Christianity came. [[Josephus]] wrote during the first century that the three main Jewish sects differed on this question. He argued that the [[Essenes]] and [[Pharisees]] argued that God's providence orders all human events, but the Pharisees still maintained that people are able to choose between right and wrong. He wrote that the [[Sadducees]] did not have a doctrine of providence.
 
The biblical scholar [[N. T. Wright]] argues that Josephus's portrayal of these groups is incorrect, and that the Jewish debates referenced by Josephus should be seen as having to do with God's work to liberate Israel rather than philosophical questions about predestination. Wright asserts that Essenes were content to wait for God to liberate Israel while Pharisees believed Jews needed to act in cooperation with God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=15}} [[John Barclay (theologian)|John Barclay]] responded that Josephus's description was an over-simplification and there were likely to be complex differences between these groups which may have been similar to those described by Josephus.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=16}} [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]] has also argued on the basis of [[4 Ezra]], a document dated to the first century AD, that Jewish beliefs in predestination are primarily concerned with God's choice to save some individual Jews.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=17}}

In the [[New Testament]], [[Letter to the Romans|Romans]] 8â11 presents a statement on predestination. In [[Romans 8]]:28â30, Paul writes, {{quote|We know that in everything God works for good with those who love him, who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=25}}}}
Biblical scholars have interpreted this passage in several ways. Many say this only has to do with service, and is not about salvation. The Catholic biblical commentator Brendan Byrne wrote that the predestination mentioned in this passage should be interpreted as applied to the Christian community corporately rather than individuals.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=29}} Another Catholic commentator, [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], wrote that this passage teaches that God has predestined the [[universal salvation|salvation of all humans]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=31}} [[Douglas Moo]], a Protestant biblical interpreter, reads the passage as teaching that God has predestined a certain set of people to salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=32}} Similarly, Wright's interpretation is that in this passage Paul teaches that God will save those whom he has chosen, but Wright also emphasizes that Paul does not intend to suggest that God has eliminated human free will or responsibility. Instead, Wright asserts, Paul is saying that God's will works through that of humans to accomplish salvation.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=33}}

====Patristic period====
[[Origen]], writing in the third century, taught that God's providence extends to every individual.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=38}} He believed God's predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of every individual's merits, whether in their current life or a [[pre-existence|previous life]].{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=39â40}}

Later in the fourth and fifth centuries, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354â430) also taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=44}} Prior to 396, Augustine believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe, that God's grace was "a reward for human assent".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=48-49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that it is God's grace that causes the individual act of faith.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=47â48}} Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars affirm that Augustine did believe in double predestination.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}}

Augustine's position raised objections. [[Julian of Eclanum]] expressed the view that Augustine was bringing [[Manichean]] thoughts into the church.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=232}} For [[Vincent of LÃ©rins]], this was a disturbing innovation.{{sfn|Chadwick|1993|p=233}} This new tension eventually became obvious with the confrontation between Augustine and [[Pelagius]] culminating in condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] (as interpreted by Augustine) at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. Pelagius denied Augustine's view of predestination in order to affirm that salvation is achieved by an act of free will.

The [[Council of Arles (475)|Council of Arles]] in the late fifth century condemned the position "that some have been condemned to death, others have been predestined to life", though this may seem to follow from Augustine's teaching. The [[Second Council of Orange]] in 529 also condemned the position that "some have been truly predestined to evil by divine power".{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=37}}

In the eighth century, [[John of Damascus]] emphasized the freedom of the human will in his doctrine of predestination, and argued that acts arising from peoples' wills are not part of God's providence at all. Damascene teaches that people's good actions are done in cooperation with God, but are not caused by him.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=60}}

====Middle Ages====
[[Gottschalk of Orbais]], a ninth-century [[Saxon]] monk, argued that God predestines some people to hell as well as predestining some to heaven, a view known as double predestination. He was condemned by several synods, but his views remained popular. Irish theologian [[John Scottus Eriugena]] wrote a refutation of Gottschalk.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} Eriugena abandoned Augustine's teaching on predestination.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=69}} He wrote that God's predestination should be equated with his foreknowledge of people's choices.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=74}}

In the twelfth century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that God predestines certain people to the [[beatific vision]] based solely on his own goodness rather than that of creatures.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=80}} Aquinas also believed that people are free in their choices, fully cause their own sin, and are solely responsible for it.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78}} According to Aquinas, there are several ways in which God wills actions. He directly wills the good, indirectly wills evil consequences of good things, and only permits evil. Aquinas held that in permitting evil, God does not will it to be done or not to be done.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=78â79}}

In the thirteenth century, [[William of Ockham]] taught that God does not cause human choices and equated predestination with divine foreknowledge.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=88}} Though Ockham taught that God predestines based on people's foreseen works, he maintained that God's will was not constrained to do this.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=89}}

====Reformation====
[[John Calvin]] rejected the idea that God permits rather than actively decrees the damnation of sinners, as well as other evil.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=102}} Calvin did not believe God to be guilty of sin, but he considered it an unfathomable mystery that God seems to simultaneously will sin and to also not will sin.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=104}} Though he maintained God's predestination applies to damnation as well as salvation, he taught that the damnation of the damned is caused by their sin, but that the salvation of the saved is solely caused by God.{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=105â106}} Other [[Protestant Reformers]], including [[Huldrych Zwingli]], also held double predestinarian views.{{sfnm|James|1998|1p=30|Trueman|1994|2p=69}}

===Views of Christian branches===

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
The [[Eastern Orthodox]] view was summarized by Bishop [[Theophan the Recluse]] in response to the question, "What is the relationship between the Divine provision and our free will?"
{{quote|Answer: The fact that the Kingdom of God is "taken by force" presupposes personal effort. When the Apostle Paul says, "it is not of him that willeth," this means that one's efforts do not produce what is sought. It is necessary to combine them: to strive ''and'' to expect all things from grace. It is not one's own efforts that will lead to the goal, because without grace, efforts produce little; nor does grace without effort bring what is sought, because grace acts in us and for us ''through'' our efforts. Both combine in a person to bring progress and carry him to the goal. (God's) foreknowledge is unfathomable. It is enough for us with our whole heart to believe that it never opposes God's grace and truth, and that it does not infringe man's freedom. Usually this resolves as follows: God foresees how a man will freely act and makes dispositions accordingly. Divine determination depends on the life of a man, and not his life upon the determination.&lt;ref&gt;St. Theophan the Recluse, ''An Explanation of Certain Texts of Holy Scripture'', as quoted in Johanna Manley's ''The Bible and the Holy Fathers for Orthodox: Daily Scripture Readings and Commentary for Orthodox Christians'', pg. 609.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Catholicism teaches the doctrine of predestination, while rejecting the classical Calvinist view known as "double predestination". This means that while it is held that those whom God has elected to eternal life will infallibly attain it, and are therefore said to be predestined to salvation by God, those who perish are not predestined to damnation. According to the Catholic Church, God predestines no one to go to hell, for this, a willful turning away from God (a mortal sin) is necessary, and persistence in it until the end."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1037&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism has been generally discouraging to human attempts to guess or predict the Divine Will. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' entry on predestination says:&lt;ref&gt;[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] entry on [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12378a.htm entry on Predestination]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|God, owing to His infallible prescience of the future, has appointed and ordained from eternity all events occurring in time, especially those that directly proceed from, or at least are influenced by, man's free will.}} The heretical seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sect within Roman Catholicism known as [[Jansenism]] preached the doctrine of double predestination, although Jansenism claimed that even members of the saved elect could lose their salvation by doing sinful, un-repented deeds, as implied in Ezekiel 18:21â28 in the Old Testament of the Bible.

[[Pope John Paul II]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;the [[encyclical]] ''[[Redemptoris Missio]]'', chapter 1, section 10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The universality of salvation means that it is granted not only to those who explicitly believe in Christ and have entered the Church. Since salvation is offered to all, it must be made concretely available to all.

Grace comes from Christ; it is the result of his Sacrifice and is communicated by the Holy Spirit. It enables each person to attain salvation through his or her free cooperation.}}

The [[Catholic Catechism]] says, "To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace."&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 600&lt;/ref&gt; 

Catholics do not believe that any hints or evidence of the predestined status of individuals is available to humans, and predestination generally plays little or no part in Catholic teaching to the faithful, being a topic addressed in a professional theological context only.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] laid the foundation for much of the later Catholic teaching on predestination. His teachings on grace and free will were largely adopted by the Second Council of Orange (529), whose decrees were directed against the Semipelagians. Augustine wrote, 
{{quote|[God] promised not from the power of our will but from His own predestination. For He promised what He Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those good things which pertain to Godâs worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not they that cause Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of Godâs promises would not be in the power of God, but in that of men"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Augustine of Hippo|title=In What Respects Predestination and Grace Differ.|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf105.xxi.ii.xix.html|work=Anti Pelagian Writings|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Augustine also teaches that people have free will. For example, in "On Grace and Free Will", (see especially chapters IIâIV) Augustine states that "He [God] has revealed to us, through His Holy Scriptures, that there is in man a free choice of will," and that "God's precepts themselves would be of no use to a man unless he had free choice of will, so that by performing them he might obtain the promised rewards." (chap. II)

[[Thomas Aquinas]]' views concerning predestination are largely in agreement with Augustine and can be summarized by many of his writings in his ''[[Summa TheologiÃ¦]]'':
{{quote|God does reprobate some. For it was said above (A[1]) that predestination is a part of providence. To providence, however, it belongs to permit certain defects in those things which are subject to providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[2]). Thus, as men are ordained to eternal life through the providence of God, it likewise is part of that providence to permit some to fall away from that end; this is called reprobation. Thus, as predestination is a part of providence, in regard to those ordained to eternal salvation, so reprobation is a part of providence in regard to those who turn aside from that end. Hence reprobation implies not only foreknowledge, but also something more, as does providence, as was said above (Q[22], A[1]). Therefore, as predestination includes the will to confer grace and glory; so also reprobation includes the will to permit a person to fall into sin, and to impose the punishment of damnation on account of that sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Whether God Reprobates any Man|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.FP_Q23_A3.html|work=Summa Theologica|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=====Lutheranism=====
[[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] historically hold to unconditional election unto salvation. However, some do not believe that there are certain people that are predestined to salvation, but salvation is predestined for those who seek God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:48;&amp;version=9; Acts 13:48], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.%201:4-11;&amp;version=47; Eph. 1:4â11], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

"The Election of Grace", paragraph 180.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, they disagree with those who make predestination the source of salvation rather than Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection. Unlike some [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], Lutherans do not believe in a predestination to damnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim.%202:4;&amp;version=31; 1 Tim. 2:4], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Pet.%203:9;&amp;version=31; 2 Pet. 3:9], [http://www.bookofconcord.com/fc-ep.html#XI.%20Election.

The Election of Grace, pp. 124â8.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Lutherans teach eternal damnation is a result of the unbeliever's sins, rejection of the forgiveness of sins, and unbelief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%2013:9;&amp;version=9; Hos. 13:9], Mueller, J.T., &lt;cite&gt;Christian Dogmatics&lt;/cite&gt;.

"Eternal Death", paragraph 196.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Luther]]'s attitude towards predestination is set out in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]]'', published in 1525. This publication by Luther was in response to the published treatise by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in 1524 known as ''[[De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio|On Free Will]]''. Luther based his views on [[Ephesians 2]]:8â10, which says:
{{quote|For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.}}

=====Calvinism=====
{{main|Predestination in Calvinism}}
The [[Belgic Confession]] of 1561 affirmed that God "delivers and preserves" from perdition "all whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable council, of mere goodness hath elected in Christ Jesus our Lord, without respect to their works" (Article XVI).
Calvinists believe that [[Christianity|God]] picked those who he will save and bring with him to [[Heaven]] before the world was created. They also believe that those people God does not save will go to [[Hell]]. John Calvin thought people who were saved could never lose their salvation and the "[[Election (Christianity)|elect]]" (those God saved) would know they were saved because of their actions.

In this common, loose sense of the term, to affirm or to deny predestination has particular reference to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine of [[unconditional election]]. In the Calvinist interpretation of the Bible, this doctrine normally has only pastoral value related to the assurance of salvation and the absolution of salvation by grace alone. However, the philosophical implications of the doctrine of election and predestination are sometimes discussed beyond these systematic bounds. Under the topic of the doctrine of God (theology proper), the predestinating decision of God cannot be contingent upon anything outside of himself, because all other things are dependent upon him for existence and meaning. Under the topic of the doctrines of salvation (soteriology), the predestinating decision of God is made from God's knowledge of his own will (Romans 9:15), and is therefore not contingent upon human decisions (rather, free human decisions are outworkings of the decision of God, which sets the total reality within which those decisions are made in exhaustive detail: that is, nothing left to chance). Calvinists do not pretend to understand how this works; but they are insistent that the Scriptures teach both the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereign control]] of God and the responsibility and freedom of human decisions.

Calvinist groups use the term [[Hyper-Calvinism]] to describe Calvinistic systems that assert without qualification that God's intention to destroy some is equal to his intention to save others. Some forms of Hyper-Calvinism have racial implications, as when Dutch Calvinist theologian [[Franciscus Gomarus]] however argued that Jews, because of their refusal to worship Jesus Christ, were members of the non-elect, as also argued by [[John Calvin]] himself, based on I John 2:22â23 in The New Testament of the Bible. Some Dutch settlers in South Africa argued that black people were sons of Ham, whom Noah had [[Curse of Ham|cursed to be slaves]], according to Genesis 9:18â19, or drew analogies between them and the Canaanites, suggesting a "chosen people" ideology similar to that espoused by proponents of the [[Jews as the chosen people|Jewish nation]]. This justified racial hierarchy on earth, as well as racial segregation of congregations, but did not exclude blacks from being part of the elect. Other Calvinists vigorously objected to these arguments (see [[Afrikaner Calvinism]]). 

Expressed sympathetically, the [[Calvinist]] doctrine is that God has mercy or withholds it, with particular consciousness of who are to be the recipients of mercy in Christ. Therefore, the particular persons are chosen, out of the total number of human beings, who will be rescued from enslavement to sin and the fear of death, and from punishment due to sin, to dwell forever in his presence. Those who are being saved are assured through the gifts of faith, the sacraments, and communion with God through prayer and increase of good works, that their reconciliation with him through Christ is settled by the sovereign determination of God's will. God also has particular consciousness of those who are passed over by his selection, who are without excuse for their rebellion against him, and will be judged for their sins.

Calvinists typically divide on the issue of predestination into [[infralapsarianism|infralapsarians]] (sometimes called 'sublapsarians') and [[supralapsarianism|supralapsarians]]. Infralapsarians interpret the biblical election of God to highlight his love (1 John 4:8; Ephesians 1:4bâ5a) and chose his elect considering the situation after the Fall, while supralapsarians interpret biblical election to highlight God's sovereignty (Romans 9:16) and that the Fall was ordained by God's decree of election. In infralapsarianism, election is God's response to the Fall, while in supralapsarianism the Fall is part of God's plan for election. In spite of the division, many Calvinist theologians would consider the debate surrounding the infra- and supralapsarian positions one in which scant Scriptural evidence can be mustered in either direction, and that, at any rate, has little effect on the overall doctrine.

Some Calvinists decline to describe the eternal decree of God in terms of a sequence of events or thoughts, and many caution against the simplifications involved in describing any action of God in speculative terms. Most make distinctions between the positive manner in which God chooses some to be recipients of grace, and the manner in which grace is consciously withheld so that some are destined for everlasting punishments.

Debate concerning predestination according to the common usage concerns the destiny of the damned: whether God is just if that destiny is settled prior to the existence of any actual volition of the individual, and whether the individual is in any meaningful sense responsible for his destiny if it is settled by the eternal action of God.

=====Arminianism=====
{{Main|Corporate election}}
[[Arminianism|Arminians]] hold that God does not predetermine, but instead infallibly knows who will believe and perseveringly be saved. This view is known as [[conditional election]], because it states that election is conditional on the one who wills to have faith in God for salvation. Although God knows from the beginning of the world who will go where, the choice is still with the individual. The Dutch Calvinist theologian Franciscus Gomarus strongly opposed the views of Jacobus Arminius with his doctrine of supralapsarian predestination.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) rejects the doctrine of predestination, but does believe in [[foreordination]]. Foreordination, an important [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]] of the LDS Church,&lt;ref name="GT: Foreordination"&gt;{{citation |url= https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |title= Gospel Topics: Foreordination |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141207153038/https://www.lds.org/topics/foreordination?lang=eng |archive-date= 2014-12-07 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConkie May 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://www.lds.org/ensign/1974/05/god-foreordains-his-prophets-and-his-people?lang=eng |title= God Foreordains His Prophets and His People |first= Bruce R. |last= McConkie |authorlink= Bruce R.

For example, [[prophets]] were foreordained to be the Lord's servants (see Jeremiah 1:5), all who receive the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] were foreordained to that calling, and Jesus was foreordained to enact the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

The LDS Church teaches the doctrine of moral [[Agency (LDS Church)|agency]], the ability to choose and act for ourselves, and decide whether to accept Christ's atonement.&lt;ref name="lds2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/agency?lang=eng|title=Agency|publisher=lds.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of predestination===

====Conditional election====
[[Conditional election]] is the belief that [[God in Christianity|God]] chooses for eternal [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] those whom he foresees will have [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] in [[Christ]]. This belief emphasizes the importance of a person's [[free will]]. The counter-view is known as [[unconditional election]], and is the belief that God chooses whomever he will, based solely on his purposes and apart from an individual's free will. It has long been an issue in [[History of the CalvinistâArminian debate|CalvinistâArminian debate]]. An alternative viewpoint is [[Corporate election]], which distinguishes God's election and predestination for corporate entities such as the community "in Christ," and individuals who can benefit from that community's election and predestination so long as they continue belonging to that community.

====Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism====
[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Infralapsarianism]] (also called sublapsarianism) holds that predestination logically coincides with the preordination of Man's fall into sin. That is, God predestined sinful men for salvation. Therefore, according to this view, God is the [[proximate and ultimate causation|ultimate cause]], but not the proximate source or "author" of sin. Infralapsarians often emphasize a difference between God's decree (which is inviolable and inscrutable), and his revealed will (against which man is disobedient). Proponents also typically emphasize the grace and mercy of God toward all men, although teaching also that only some are predestined for salvation.

In common English parlance, the doctrine of predestination often has particular reference to the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. The version of predestination espoused by [[John Calvin]], after whom Calvinism is named, is sometimes referred to as "double predestination" because in it God predestines some people for salvation (i.e. [[unconditional election]]) and some for condemnation (i.e. [[Reprobation]]) which results by allowing the individual's own sins to condemn them. Calvin himself defines predestination as "the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. Not all are created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that he has been predestined to life or to death."&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |title=Calvin, John. ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'', (Henry Beveridge, trans.), III.21.5 |access-date=21 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829234225/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html |archive-date=29 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the spectrum of beliefs concerning predestination, Calvinism is the strongest form among Christians. It teaches that God's predestining decision is based on the knowledge of his own will rather than foreknowledge, concerning every particular person and event; and, God continually acts with entire freedom, in order to bring about his will in completeness, but in such a way that the freedom of the creature is not violated, "but rather, established".&lt;ref name="WCF3"&gt;[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER III. Of God's Eternal Decree.|Westminster Confession of faith, Ch 3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvinists who hold the infralapsarian view of predestination usually prefer that term to "sublapsarianism," perhaps with the intent of blocking the inference that they believe predestination is on the basis of foreknowledge (''sublapsarian'' meaning, assuming the fall into sin).&lt;ref&gt;Here, sub- is opposed to super- or supra- in a sense related to volition and/or necessity. Cf., for relapse of same origin, http://freedictionary.org/index.php?Query=relapse&amp;database=%2A&amp;strategy=exact : L. relapsus, p. p. of relabi to slip back, to relapse.&lt;/ref&gt; The different terminology has the benefit of distinguishing the Calvinist double predestination version of infralapsarianism from Lutheranism's view that predestination is a mystery, which forbids the unprofitable intrusion of prying minds since God only reveals partial knowledge to the human race.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism|Supralapsarianism]] is the doctrine that God's decree of predestination for salvation and reprobation logically precedes his preordination of the human race's fall into sin. That is, God decided to save, and to damn; he then determined the means by which that would be made possible. It is a matter of controversy whether or not Calvin himself held this view, but most scholars link him with the infralapsarian position. It is known, however, that Calvin's successor in Geneva, [[Theodore Beza]], held to the supralapsarian view.

====Double predestination====
Double predestination, or the double decree, is the doctrine that God actively [[reprobates]], or decrees damnation of some, as well as salvation for those whom he has elected. Augustine made statements that on their own seem to teach such a doctrine, but in the context of his other writings it is not clear whether he held it. Augustine's doctrine of predestination does seem to imply a double predestinarian view.{{sfn|James|1998|p=102}} Gottschalk of Orbais taught it more explicitly in the ninth century,{{sfn|Levering|2011|p=70}} and [[Gregory of Rimini]] in the fourteenth.{{sfn|James|1998|p=147}} During the Protestant Reformation John Calvin also held double predestinarian views.{{sfn|James|1998|p=30}}{{sfn|Trueman|1994|p=69}} John Calvin states: "By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man. All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that '''he has been predestinated to life or to death'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of Christian Religion|location=Book Three, Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open theism====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
[[Open theism]] advocates the non-traditional Arminian view of election that predestination is corporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brian Abasciano |title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace |date=25 October 2013 |url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/ |publisher=Society of Evengelical Arminians|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[corporate election]], God does not choose which individuals he will save prior to creation, but rather God chooses the church as a whole. Or put differently, God chooses what type of individuals he will save. Another way the New Testament puts this is to say that God chose the church in Christ (Eph. 1:4). In other words, God chose from all eternity to save all those who would be found in Christ, by faith in God. This choosing is not primarily about salvation from eternal destruction either but is about God's chosen agency in the world. Thus individuals have full freedom in terms of whether they become members of the church or not. Corporate election is thus consistent with the open view's position on God's omniscience, which states that God's foreknowledge does not determine the outcomes of individual free will.

====Middle Knowledge====
[[Middle knowledge|Middle Knowledge]] is a concept that was developed by [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Luis de Molina]], and exists under a doctrine called [[Molinism]]. It attempts to deal with the topic of predestination by reconciling Gods sovereign providence with the notion of [[libertarian free will]]. The concept of Middle Knowledge holds that God has a knowledge of true pre-volitional [[counterfactuals]] for all free creatures. That is, what any individual creature with a free will (e.g. a human) would do under any given circumstance. Gods knowledge of counterfactuals is reasoned to occur logically prior to his divine creative decree (that is, prior to creation), and after his knowledge of [[Logical truth|necessary truths]]. Thus, Middle Knowledge holds that before the world was created, God knew what every existing creature capable of libertarian freedom (e.g. every individual human) would freely choose to do in all possible circumstances. It then holds that based on this information, God elected from a number of these [[Possible world|possible worlds]], the world most consistent with his ultimate will, which is the actual world that we live in.

For example:

* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance B, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Y over option Z.
* if Free Creature A was to be placed in Circumstance C, God via his Middle Knowledge would know that Free Creature A will freely choose option Z over option Y. 

Based on this Middle Knowledge, God has the ability to actualise the world in which A is placed in a circumstance that he freely chooses to do what is consistent with Gods ultimate will. If God determined that the world most suited to his purposes is a world in which A would freely choose Y instead of Z, God can actualise a world in which Free Creature A finds himself in Circumstance B.

In this way, Middle Knowledge is thought of by its proponents to be consistent with any theological doctrines that assert God as having divine providence and man having a libertarian freedom (e.g. Calvinism, Catholicism, Lutheranism), and to offer a potential solution to the concerns that Gods providence somehow nullifies man from having true liberty in his choices.

==Islam==
{{Main|Predestination in Islam}}
''Qadar'' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ¯Ø±}}, [[Hans Wehr transliteration|transliterated]] ''qadar'', meaning "fate", "divine fore-ordainment", "predestination")&lt;ref name="Wehr"&gt;J. M. Cowan (ed.) (1976). ''The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic''. Wiesbaden, Germany: Spoken Language Services. {{ISBN|0-87950-001-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the concept of [[Divinity|divine]] [[destiny]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/Qadar.htm|title=Qadar|work=missionislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of Sunni Islam's [[Iman (concept)|six pillars of faith]], along with belief in the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], the [[Islamic holy books|Revealed Books]], the [[Prophets of Islam]], the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] and [[Angels in Islam|Angels]].

In Islam, "predestination" is the usual English language rendering of a belief that Muslims call ''al-qada wa al-qadar'' in Arabic. The phrase means "the divine decree and the predestination". In Islam, God has predetermined, known, ordained, and is constantly creating every event that takes place in the world. This is entailed by his being omnipotent and omniscient. Sunni scholars hold that there is no contradiction in people's deeds (and naturally their choices) being created and predetermined by the creator, since they define free will to be the antonym of compulsion and coercion. People â in the Sunni perspective â do acknowledge that they are free, since they do not see anybody or anything forcing them to do whatever they chose to do. This, however, does not contradict that everything they do, including the choices they make, are predestined and predetermined by God. Consequently, people are already predestined to either heaven or hell at birth, as Sunnis believe; however, they will have no argument on the day of judgment since they never knew in advance what their fate would be, and they do acknowledge that they have choice; which is what moral responsibility comes with.&lt;ref name="eltwhed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltwhed.com/vb/showthread.php?28233-%C7%E1%CC%E6%C7%C8-%DD%ED-%E3%D3%C3%E1%C9-%C7%E1%DE%CF%D1-%E6%D4%C8%E5%C9-%C7%E1%CC%C8%D1-%E6%C7%E1%C7%CE%CA%ED%C7%D1|title=Ø§ÙØ¬ÙØ§Ø¨ ÙÙ ÙØ³Ø£ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙØ¯Ø± ÙØ´Ø¨ÙØ© Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¨Ø± ÙØ§ÙØ§Ø®ØªÙØ§Ø±.|publisher=eltwhed.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human will being predetermined by God's will is stated clearly in the Quran:
"Verily this (The Holy Quran) is no less than a Message to (all) the Worlds; (With profit) to whoever among you wills to go straight, ''but ye shall not will except as God wills;'' the Cherisher of the Worlds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&amp;BookID=15&amp;SuraNum=81&amp;AyaNum=29 The Koran; Section 81, Verses 27-29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islam-qa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/index.php?ref=96978&amp;ln=eng|title=ÙÙÙØ¹ Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø³Ø¤Ø§Ù ÙØ¬ÙØ§Ø¨ - Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ù - islamqa.info|publisher=islam-qa.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predestination is rejected in Shiaism.&lt;ref&gt;Need of Religion, by Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{See also|Free will in theology#In Jewish thought}}
In [[Rabbinic literature]], there is much discussion as to the apparent [[contradiction]] between God's omniscience and free will. The representative view is that "Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given" ([[Rabbi Akiva]], ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830203834/http://sichosinenglish.org/books/ethics/03-15.htm 3:15]). Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a [[paradox]], perhaps beyond our understanding.

[[Hasdai Crescas]] resolved this dialectical tension by taking the position that free will doesn't exist. All of a person's actions are predetermined by the moment of their birth, and thus their judgment in the eyes of God (so to speak) is effectively preordained. In this scheme this is not a result of God's predetermining one's fate, but rather that the universe is deterministic. Crescas's views on this topic were rejected by Judaism at large. In later centuries this idea independently developed among some in the [[Chabad]] (Lubavitch) movement of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. Many individuals within Chabad take this view seriously, and hence effectively deny the existence of free will.&lt;ref name="Apologetics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abasciano|first1=Brian|title=The FACTS of Salvation: A Summary of Arminian Theology/the Biblical Doctrines of Grace|journal=Society of Evangelical Arminians|issue=The Facts of Salvation|url=http://evangelicalarminians.org/the-facts-of-salvation-a-summary-of-arminian-theologythe-biblical-doctrines-of-grace/|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Chabad (Lubavitch) Jews attempt to hold both views. They affirm as infallible their [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|rebbe]]'s teachings that God knows and controls the fate of all, yet at the same time affirm the classical Jewish belief in free will. The inherent contradiction between the two results in their belief that such contradictions are only "apparent", due to man's inherent lack of ability to understand greater truths and due to the fact that Creator and Created exist in different realities. The same idea is strongly repeated by [[Rambam]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Laws of Repentance, Chapter 5).

Many other Jews (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and secular) affirm that since free will exists, then by definition one's fate is not preordained. It is held as a tenet of faith that whether God is omniscient or not, nothing interferes with mankind's free will. Some Jewish theologians, both during the medieval era and today, have attempted to formulate a philosophy in which free will is preserved, while also affirming that God has knowledge of what decisions people will make in the future. Whether or not these two ideas are mutually compatible, or whether there is a contradiction between the two, is still a matter of great study and interest in [[philosophy]] today.

==Zoroastrianism==
Predestination is rejected in [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=201 Billion Galaxies: And Other Religious Discoveries|date=2012|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781466962187|page=301|author=Nicholas Campbell Corff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olsen|first=Brad|title=Modern Esoteric: Beyond Our Senses|date=1 Mar 2014|publisher=CCC Publishing|isbn=9781888729504|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another.

{{unsolved|computer science|Prove or disprove the BarendregtâGeuversâKlop conjecture.}}
In the branches of [[mathematical logic]] known as [[proof theory]] and [[type theory]], a '''pure type system''' ('''PTS'''), previously known as a '''generalized type system''' ('''GTS'''), is a form of [[typed lambda calculus]] that allows an arbitrary number of [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Many-sorted structures|sorts]] and dependencies between any of these. The framework can be seen as a generalisation of [[Henk Barendregt|Barendregt]]'s [[lambda cube]], in the sense that all corners of the cube can be represented as instances of a PTS with just two sorts.&lt;ref name="pierce2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|page= 466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k116&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Fairouz D. | last1 = Kamareddine | first2 = Twan | last2 = Laan | first3 =  Rob P. | last3 = Nederpelt | title = A modern perspective on type theory: from its origins until today | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-4020-2334-0 | chapter = Section 4c: Pure type systems | page = 116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Barendregt (1991) framed his cube in this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=H.P. Barendregt |first=H. P. |last=Barendregt |url= http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/henglein/papers/barendregt1991.pdf |title=Introduction to generalized type systems |journal=Journal of Functional Programming |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=125â154 |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure type systems may obscure the distinction between ''types'' and ''terms'' and collapse the [[type hierarchy]], as is the case with the [[calculus of constructions]], but this is not generally the case, e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] allows only terms to depend on terms.

Pure type systems were independently introduced by Stefano Berardi (1988) and Jan Terlouw (1989).&lt;ref name="pierce2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=k116/&gt; Barendregt discussed them at length in his subsequent papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=S. Abramsky, D. Gabbay and T. Maibaum|author=H. Barendregt|chapter=Lambda calculi with types|chapterurl=ftp://ftp.cs.ru.nl/pub/CompMath.Found/HBK.ps|title=Handbook of Logic in Computer Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford Science Publications]]|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | first = S. | last = Berardi | title = Type dependence and Constructive Mathematics | degree = PhD | publisher = University of Torino | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berardi defined a cube of [[constructive logic]]s akin to the lambda cube (these specifications are non-dependent). A modification of this cube was later called the L-cube by Geuvers, who in his PhD thesis extended the [[CurryâHoward correspondence]] to this setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | first = H. | last = Geuvers | title = Logics and Type Systems | citeseerx = 10.1.1.56.7045 | degree = PhD | publisher = University of Nijmegen | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these ideas, Barthe and others defined '''classical pure type systems''' ('''CPTS''') by adding a [[double negation]] operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. Barthe|author2=J. Hatcliff |author3=M. H. SÃ¸rensen |title=A Notion of Classical Pure Type System|citeseerx = 10.1.1.32.1371|journal=Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|volume=6|year=1997|pages=4â59|doi=10.1016/S1571-0661(05)80170-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    	
Similarly, in 1998, Tijn Borghuis introduced '''modal pure type systems''' ('''MPTS''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tijn |last=Borghuis |title=Modal Pure Type Systems |journal=Journal of Logic, Language and Information |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=265â296 |doi=10.1023/A:1008254612284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roorda has discussed the application of pure type systems to functional programming; and Roorda and Jeuring have proposed a programming language based on pure type systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.cs.uu.nl/johanj/MSc/jwroorda/|author=Jan-Willem Roorda|author2=Johan Jeuring |title=Pure Type Systems for Functional Programming}}  Roorda's masters' thesis (linked from the cited page) also contains a general introduction to pure type systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

The systems from the lambda cube are all known to be [[strongly normalizing]]. Pure type systems in general need not be, for example [[System U]] from '''Girard's paradox'''&lt;!-- "Girard's paradox" redirects to this page --&gt; is not. (Roughly speaking, [[Jean-Yves Girard|Girard]] found pure systems in which one can express the sentence "the types form a type".) Furthermore, all known examples of pure type systems that are not strongly normalizing are not even (weakly) [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|normalizing]]: they contain expressions that do not have [[normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]]s, just like the untyped lambda calculus{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. It is a major open problem in the field whether this is always the case, i.e. whether a (weakly) normalizing PTS always has the strong normalization property. This is known as the '''BarendregtâGeuversâKlop conjecture'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Morten Heine |last=SÃ¸rensen |first2=PaweÅ |last2=Urzyczyn |title=Lectures on the CurryâHoward isomorphism |location= |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=0-444-52077-5 |chapter=Pure type systems and the lambda cube }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|358}} (named after [[Henk Barendregt]], [[Herman Geuvers]], and [[Jan Willem Klop]]).

The term '''rational animal''' ([[Latin]]: ''animal rationale'' or ''animal rationabile'') refers to a classical definition of humanity or [[human nature]], associated with [[Aristotelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognition-animal/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

While the Latin term itself originates in [[scholasticism]], it reflects the Aristotelian view of man as a creature distinguished by a rational principle.  In the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' I.13, Aristotle states that the human being has a rational principle ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎ¿Î½), on top of the nutritive life shared with plants, and the instinctual life shared with other animals, i. e., the ability to carry out rationally formulated [[Praxis (process)|projects]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 75 and p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;.  That capacity for deliberative imagination was equally singled out as man's defining feature in ''[[De anima]]'' III.11.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Stigum, ''Econometrics and the Philosophy of Economics'' (2003) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; While seen by Aristotle as a universal human feature, the definition applied to wise and foolish alike, and did not in any way imply necessarily the ''making'' of rational choices, as opposed to the ''ability'' to make them.&lt;ref&gt;Stigum, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] defined man as a "mortal rational animal", and also considered animals to have a (lesser) rationality of their own.&lt;ref&gt;L. Johnson, ''Power Knowledge Animals'' (2012) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of man as a rational animal was common in [[scholastical philosophy]].&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|inline=1|wstitle=Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] states that this definition means that "in the system of classification and definition shown in the [[Arbor Porphyriana]], man is a [[Substance (philosophy)|substance]], [[Matter|corporeal]], [[life|living]], [[sentient]], and [[Rationality|rational]]".&lt;ref name="CathEnc"/&gt;


In Meditation II of ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[Descartes]] arrives at his famous [[cogito ergo sum|"I think, I exist"]] claim. He then goes on to wonder "What am I?" He considers and rejects the scholastic concept of the "rational animal":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shall I say 'a rational animal'? No; for then I should have to inquire what an animal is, what rationality is, and in this one question would lead me down the slope to other harder ones.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes Volume II''. Translated by John Cottingham, Robert Stoothoff, Dugald Murdoch. Cambridge University Press. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern use==

[[Freud]] was as aware as any of the irrational forces at work in humankind, but he nevertheless resisted what he called too much âstress on the weakness of the ego in relation to the id and of our rational elements in the face of the daemonic forces within usâ.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Kantian philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]], in his work ''An Essay on Man'' (1944), altered Aristotle definition to label man as a ''[[symbolic animal]]''. This definition has been influential in the field of [[philosophical anthropology]], where it has been reprised by [[Gilbert Durand]], and has been echoed in the [[naturalist]] description of man as the compulsive communicator.&lt;ref&gt;D. Attenborough, ''Life on Earth'' (1992) Ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists in the tradition of [[Max Weber]] distinguish rational behavior (means-end oriented) from irrational, emotional or confused behavior, as well as from traditional-oriented behavior, but recognise the wide role of all the latter types in human life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Schutz]], ''The Phenomenology of the Social World'' (1997) p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnomethodology]] sees rational human behavior as representing perhaps 1/10 of the human condition, dependent on the 9/10ths of background assumptions which provide the frame for means-end decision making.&lt;ref&gt;A. Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'' (1974) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] satirized the concept that man is rational, saying "Man is a rational animal â so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life I have been looked diligently for evidence in favour of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell'' (2009), p. 45&lt;!--please give the original reference to Russell himself--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The humor of his observation derives from an equivocation between describing mankind as rational (i.e., that all members of the species has the potential to think, whether that potential is realized or not) and describing an individual person as rational (i.e., the person actually can think well, avoid biases, make valid inferences, etc.).

The '''Records Continuum Model''' (RCM) was created in the 1990s by [[Monash University]] academic [[Frank Upward]] with input from colleagues [[Sue McKemmish]] and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of [[Archival science|Archival Science]].&lt;ref name="elis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Upward |first2=F. H. |last3=Reed |first3=B. |year=2010 |chapter=Records Continuum Model |title=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences |edition=3rd |pages=4447â8 |url=http://doi.org/10.1081/E-ELIS3-120043719 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The RCM was first published in Upwardâs 1996 paper "Structuring the Records Continuum â Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties".&lt;ref name="upward1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Structuring the records continuum â part one: postcustodial principles and properties |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=268â285 |url=http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/research/groups/rcrg/publications/recordscontinuum-fupp1.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Structuration theory|structuration]] conceptual framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1997 |title=Structuring the records continuum â part two: structuration theory and recordkeeping |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=10â35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.

==Description==
The RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time ([[spacetime]]).&lt;ref name="McK2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=2001 |title=Placing records continuum theory and practice |journal=Archival Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=333â359 |url=http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02438901 }}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding [[metadata]], fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.&lt;ref name="curtin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013123845/http://john.curtin.edu.au/society/australia/ |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'') and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. ''Create'', ''Capture'', ''Organize'' and ''Pluralize'' represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The information in the table is drawn from {{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197â222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms "records" and "archives".&lt;ref name="upward1"/&gt; This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM â starting at ''Create'' as the initiating phase and working outwards towards ''Pluralization'' of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first â the role that systems of ''Pluralization'' and ''Organization'' play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for ''Create'' and ''Capture''. However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.&lt;ref name="curtin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=B. |year=2005 |title=Reading the records continuum: interpretations and explorations |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18â43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.

The RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the [[Records life-cycle|lifecycle]] records model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/records-continuum |title=Records Continuum |work=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |publisher=Society of American Archivists |accessdate=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McK1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKemmish |first=S. |year=1997 |chapter=Yesterday, today and tomorrow: a continuum of responsibility |title=Proceedings of the Records Management Association of Australia 14th National Convention, 15â17 Sept 1997 |pages=18â36 |place=Perth, Australia |publisher=RMAA }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts.&lt;ref name="McK1997"/&gt; Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always "in a state of always becoming...",&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime.  In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as "relics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acland |first=G. |year=1992 |title=Managing the record rather than the relic |journal=Archives &amp; Manuscripts |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=57â63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and influences ==
The RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches.&lt;ref name="McK2001"/&gt; These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKemmish |first1=S. |last2=Piggott |first2=M. |year=1994 |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; referred in a 1959 ''American Archivist'' article to a "continuum of (public) records administration" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a "cultural end-product".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maclean |first=I. |title=Australian experience in records and archives management |journal=American Archivist |year=1959 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=383â418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macleanâs vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple "social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;

Further influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics|David Bearman]] and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]]'s ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal.&lt;ref name="Upw2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2000 |title=Modelling the continuum as paradigm shift in recordkeeping and archiving processes, and beyond â a personal reflection |journal=Records Management Journal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=115â39 |url=http://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard]], as well as sociologist [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]], with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term "records continuum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atherton |first=J. |title=From life cycle to continuum: some thoughts on the records management-archives relationship |journal=Archivaria |date=1985â1986 |volume=21 |pages=43â51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bwalya |first1=K. J. |last2=Mnjama |first2=N. M. |last3=Sebina |first3=P. M. I. M. |year=2014 |title=Concepts and Advances in Information Knowledge Management: Studies from Developing and Emerging Economies |publisher=Chandos Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=1994 |chapter=In Search of the Continuum: Ian Maclean's "Australian Experience" Essays on Recordkeeping |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |title=The Records Continuum: Ian Maclean and Australian Archives: first fifty years |publisher=Ancora Press |place=Clayton |isbn=086862019X |pages=110â130 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/5PX3PN3N/q/in%20search%20of%20the%20continuum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space.&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Upward |first1=F. |last2=McKemmish |first2=S |year=1994 |title=Somewhere beyond custody: literature review |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=136â149 |url=https://www.zotero.org/groups/records_continuum_research_group_publications/items/itemKey/RHKH3WD5/q/somewhere%20beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]] as part of a "post-custodial paradigm shift".&lt;ref name="U&amp;M1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=F. G. |year=1981 |title=Archival strategies for the post-custodial era |journal=American Archivist |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=207â16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=T. |authorlink=Terry Cook (archivist) |year=1994 |title=Electronic records, paper minds: the revolution in information management and archives in the post-custodial and post-modernist era |journal=Archives and Manuscripts |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=300â28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, [[Archival appraisal|appraisal]], describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.

Drawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as "a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes".&lt;ref name="elis"/&gt; Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upward |first=F. |year=2005 |chapter=The Records Continuum |editor1-first=S. |editor1-last=McKemmish |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Piggott |editor3-first=B. |editor3-last=Reed |editor4-first=F. |editor4-last=Upward |title=Archives: Recordkeeping in Society |pages=197â222 |place=Wagga Wagga, NSW |publisher=Centre for Information Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other information continuum models ==

The RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.

The series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:&lt;ref name="Upw2000"/&gt;
* Information Systems (Data) Continuum Model (data modeling and data flow)
* Cultural Heritage Continuum Model (the stories the documents tell and the significance of those stories to others)
* Publication (Access) Continuum Model (the reach of accessibility and the way the document is issued)

Models created in collaboration:
* Information Continuum Model (Barbara Reed, Don Schauder, Frank Upward) (the technologies driving the system and classification methods)

Other models:
* Juridical contexts of the Records Continuum Model (Livia Iacovino)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iacovino |first=Livia |year=2006 |chapter=Legal and social relationships: an alternative Internet regulatory model |title=Recordkeeping, Ethics and Law |pages=253â300 |place=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer Netherlands |ISBN=978-1-4020-4691-9 |url=https://www.springer.com/law/book/978-1-4020-4691-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mediated Recordkeeping: culture-as-evidence (Leisa Gibbons)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbons |first=L.

[[Image:Maxschelerphoto.jpg|thumb|Max Scheler (1874-1928)]]
[[Max Scheler]] (1874â1928) was both the most respected and neglected of the major early [[20th-century philosophy|20th century]] [[Germany|German]] [[Continental philosophy|Continental philosopher]]s in the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973c|loc=Editor's introduction, pp. xiâxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His observations and insights concerning "a special form of human hate" &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related social and psychological phenomenon furnished a descriptive basis for his philosophical concept of "'''Ressentiment'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a widely recognized convention, the French spelling of this term has been retained in philosophical circles so as to preserve a broad sense of discursive meaning and application.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|1996|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1928 leaving a vast body of unfinished works. Extrapolations from his thoughts have always since piqued interest and discussion on a variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works were on the [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burn]] list.

As a concept belonging to the study of ethics, Ressentiment represents the antithetical process of Scheler's emotively informed non-formal ethics of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973a}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Ressentiment can also be said to be, at once, Scheler's darkest as well as his most psychological and sociological of topics, foreshadowing many later findings in those particular social sciences.

Folk wisdom comes closest to Scheler's meaning by recognizing Ressentiment as a self-defeating turn of mind which is non-productive and ultimately a waste of time and energy. Maturity informs most of us that sustained hatred hurts the hater far more than the object of our hate. Sustained hatred enslaves by preventing emotional growth from progressing beyond the sense of pain having been precipitated, in some way, by whom or what is hated (i.e., another person, group or class of persons).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|1996|pp=53â54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

It is difficult to imagine the intellectual concern of late 19th and early 20th Century over the collective drift in Western Civilization away from old-guard monarchial and hierarchical societal structures (i.e., one's station in life being determined primarily by birth), toward the relative uncertainty and instability embodied in such Enlightenment Era ideals such as democracy, nationhood, class struggle (Karl Marx), human equality, humanism, egalitarianism, utilitarianism and the like. As such, Ressentiment, as a phenomenon, was first viewed as a pseudo-ethically based political force enabling the lower classes of society to rise in their situation in life at the (perceived) expense of the higher, or more inherently "noble" classes. Hence, Ressentiment first emerged as, what some might view, a reactionary and elitist concept by today's democratic standards; while others of a more conservative mind-set might view Ressentiment as liberalism disguised as a socialist attempt at usurping the role of individual responsibility and self-determination. In any event Scheler's contributions regarding this topic can not be fully appreciated without some cursory reference to the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844â1900).

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] used the [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaardian]] term ''[[Ressentiment]]'' as the source of this emerging degenerative morality issuing from an underlying existential distinction between what he saw as the two basic character options available to the individual: the Strong ("Over Man," "Superman" or "Master") or the Weak (the "Slave"). The Master-type fully accepts the burdens of freedom and decides a path of self-determination. The Slave, rather than deciding to be the authentic author of his own destiny, chooses a repressed unsatisfying mode of life, blaming (by projection) his submissiveness, loss of self-esteem and pitiful lot in life upon the dominant Master figure (and his entire social class) who by contrast seems to flourish at every moment. A true enough assessment, given that economic exploitation always seems to lie at the heart of any intrinsic Master / Slave social arrangement, along with the Master class "washing their hands" (so to speak) of the burdens of social responsibility. This underlying Ressentiment forms the underlying rationale for a code of conduct (e.g., passive acceptance of abuse, fear of reprisal for asserting personal rights due to implied intimidation, or inability to enjoy life) belonging to the Slave-type or class ("Slave Morality").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nietzsche|1995|loc=Editor's introduction, pp. xiiiâxv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche was an atheist and harbored a particular disdain for Christianity, which he viewed as playing a key role in supporting Slave Morality. In supporting the Weak and disadvantaged of humanity, Christianity undermined the authority, social position and cultural progress of the Strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nietzsche|1995|loc=Editor's introduction, pp. xâxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche viewed the progress of such Slave Morality as a sort of violation of the natural order and a thwarting of the authentic advancements of civilization available only through the Strong. This view of a "natural order", so typical of 19th Century Europe (e.g., Darwin's Theory of Evolution) is expressed in Nietzsche's metaphysical principal â ''Will to Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nietzsche|1995|pp=134â135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler, by comparison, ultimately viewed the universal salvic nature of Christian love as contradicting Nietzsche's assessments,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in later life developed an alternate metaphysical dualism of ''Vital Urge''{{#tag:ref|"...the lowest stratum of psychic being is the presence of an unspecified, undifferentiated, blind 'urge forward' (''Drang''). It is completely conscious-less and, therefore without inner or outer sensation. This urge reveals itself as a slow 'towards' and 'away from' (e.g. towards light) and it must first be attributed to plant life. It is at the same time the 'vapor' (''Dampf''), which is at the bottom of all life, driving forward all life up to its highest manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|1996|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} and ''Spirit'':{{#tag:ref|"...the essential difference between animal and man is the presence of Spirit (''Geist''), which makes human life highly independent of drives, and independent of attachment to environment (in contrast to the basically environment-stricken animal).... This is clear when we consider that man forms his own environment in social life and history as well as in using artificial means to change it for better adjustment and comfort.... ''Spirit'' elevates man above world and above himself (as organic being).... ''Spirit'', then, cannot have its foundation or source in this objective world, but only in the primordial principal of the cosmos (''Urgrund'') itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|1996|pp=15â17}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} ''Vital Urge'' as closely allied to ''Will to Power'', and ''Spirit'' as dependent yet truly distinct in character.

Contrary to Nietzsche's ultimate intent, much of his legacy ultimately led to an implosion of objectivity in which (i) truth became relative to individual perspective, (ii) "might ultimately made right" ("Social Darwinism"), and (iii) ethics would become subjective and solipsistic.

By contrast, Scheler, who also was skeptical over the historically emerging unchecked power of mass culture and the prevalence and leveling power of mediocrity upon ethical standards and upon the individual human person (as a unique sacred value), was nonetheless a theistic ethical objectivist.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=13â15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=164â165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For Scheler, the phenomenon of Ressentiment principally involved Spirit (as opposed to Will to Power, Drives or Vital Urge), which entailed deeper personal issues involving distortion of the objective realm of values, the self-poisoning of moral character, and personality disorder.&lt;ref name="Ressentiment, p 48"&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic features of Ressentiment==

Scheler's described Ressentiment in his 1913 book by the same title as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"â¦Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such are normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=45â46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although scholars do not agree on a fixed number or attributes materially defining Ressentiment, they have nonetheless collectively articulated about ten authoritative and insightful points (many times combining them) which stake-out the boundaries of this concept:

1) Ressentiment must first and foremost be understood in relation to, what Scheler termed the ''apriori hierarchy of value modalities''. While the direction of personal transcendence and ethical action is one toward positive and higher values, the direction of Ressentiment and unethical action is one toward negative and lower values. Scheler viewed values as emotively experienced with reference to a universal, objective, constant and unchanging ''apriori hierarchy of value modalities''. From lowest to highest these modalities (with their respective positive and corresponding negative dis-value forms) are as follows: sensual values of the agreeable and the disagreeable; vital values of the noble and vulgar; mental (psychic) values of the beautiful and ugly, right and wrong and truth and falsehood; and finally values of the Holy and Unholy of the Divine and Idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973a|loc=Part I, Chapter 2-B (5) "A priori relations of rank among value-modalities"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ressentiment represents the dark underside, or inversion, of Scheler's vision of a personal and transformational non-formal ethics of values.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

2) Ressentiment, as a personal disposition, has its genesis in negative psychic feelings and feeling states which most people experience as normal reactive responses to the demands of social life:&lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=148"&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., envy, jealousy, anger, hatred, spite, malice, joy over another's misfortune, mean spirited competition, etc. The objective sources of such feeling states responses might be occasioned by almost anything: e.g., personal criticism, ridicule, mockery, rejection, abandonment, etc.

For the individual person, the ethical and psychological issue becomes how the energy from these feeling states will be channeled so as to better benefit the individual person and society.

3) Ressentiment is highly situational in character in that it always involves "mental comparisons" (value-judgments) with other people who allegedly have no such Ressentiment feelings,&lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=146"&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who likewise exhibit genuinely positive values. Hence, although Ressentiment might begin with something like admiration and respect, but surely ends in a sort of coveting of those personal qualities and goods of another: i.e., advantages afforded by their beauty, intelligence, charm, wit, personality, education, talent, skills, possessions, wealth, work achievement, family affiliation and the like. This early stage of Ressentiment resembles what we might refer to today as an [[inferiority complex]].

However, one can easily extend this notion of "comparing" to externally acquired qualifiers having the potential for negative valuations which also tend to a support consumer based economics: i.e., status symbol possessions (a lavish house, or car), expensive fashion accessories, special privileges, club memberships, plastic surgery and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principal is expressed in our common colloquialism of "Keeping-up with the Jones'". The subliminal result of all of these "comparisons" tend to lend credence the idea that one's [[self-concept]], [[self-image]], [[self-esteem]], worth or social desirability is linked to our social inclusion or exclusion in a favored superior class having the means to insulate themselves from the rest of society.

4) Ressentiment, as situational, also typically extends to inherent social roles. Many social roles involve relationships frequently occasioning some level of inter-personal value-judgment with accompanying negative psychic feelings and feeling states which suggest dominant and submissive roles, not unlike Nietzsche's Master-Slave dichotomy. For example:

*The subordinate and/or submissive gender roles assigned to woman in terms of sexuality, child rearing and nurturing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=61â62}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Generational Divides ("Generation Gaps"): The rejection of a younger generation by members of an older generation, due to the latter's inability to accept their own changes and to move beyond the value pursuits proper to those preceding stages of life. Also, the reverse is true. The rejection of an older generation by members of a younger generation due to latter's inability to accept the fact that the older generation understands and sympathizes with the challenges they face.&lt;ref name="Ressentiment_62_64"&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=62â64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Progressive forms of inter-family and blended-family relations: i.e., younger siblings toward the elder sense of entitlement; the hyper-critical mother-in-law toward the daughter-in-law;,&lt;ref name="Ressentiment_62_64"/&gt; or even the more contemporarily abandonment of an ex-spouse in favor of "trophy wife" or "trophy husband" as a status symbol signaling a raise in social status; the relational neglect toward children from a previous marriage over ones of the current; the reactions of peer friends and family to a romantic relationship involving partners of vastly different ages; the pathetic efforts of a mediocre neâer-do-well child to live up to the standards of a successful high achieving parent, etc.
*The classic employee / employer adversarial relationships.

5) Ressentiment triggers a tendency in people which Scheler termed "Man's Inherent Fundamental Moral Weakness":&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=23â26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973a|loc=Part II, and Chapter 9 (a) "The law of the tendency toward surrogates when a 'deeper' emotional determination of the ego is negative"}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sense of hopelessness which pre-disposes a person to regress and seek surrogates of lower value as a source of solace.

When personal progress becomes stagnant or frustrated in moving from a negative to a more positive plateau given a relatively high vital or psychic level of value attainment, there is an inherent tendency toward [[Regression (psychology)|regression]] in terms of indulgence in traditional vices and a host of other physical and psychological addictions and self-destructive modes of behavior (e.g., the use of narcotics).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973a|pp=345â346}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency to seek surrogates to compensate for a frustration with higher value attainment inserts itself into the scenario of consumerist materialism as an insatiable self-defeating need "to have more" in order to fill the void of our own philosophical bankruptcy and spiritual poverty.

== Essential structures of Ressentiment proper: "Pathological Ressentiment" ==

Further refining Ressentiment, Scheler wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Through its very origin, ressentiment is therefore chiefly confined to those who serve and are dominated at the moment, who fruitlessly resent the sting of authority. When it occurs elsewhere, it is either due to psychological contagionâand the spiritual venom of ressentiment is extremely contagious â or to the violent suppression of an impulse which subsequently revolts by "embittering" and "poisoning" the personality." &lt;ref name="Ressentiment, p 48"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence, certain advanced characteristics of Ressentiment link this phenomenon to what we might refer to today as [[personality disorders]]. As such, Ressentiment Proper &lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=146"/&gt; ("Pathological Ressentimentâ) is not materially linked exclusively to issues of socio-economic status, but rather cuts across all socio-economic strata of society to include even the most powerful.

6) In Pathological Ressentiment a Sense of Impotency develops on the part of those experiencing ressentiment-feelings, especially if situational and social factors weigh so heavily so as render a person unable to release or resolve negative psychic feelings and feeling states in a positive and constructive manner:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=70â71}}&lt;/ref&gt; what we refer to today in psychological terms as [[psychological repression|repression]].

Originally understood, Ressentiment is defused whenever one has the power and ability to physically retaliate, or act out, against an oppressor. For example, an ancient Roman citizen, as Master, could be expected to take revenge straight away upon his Slave while the reverse would be unthinkable. "When [negative psychic feelings and feeling states] can be acted out, no ressentiment results. But when a person is unable to release these feelings against the persons or groups evoking them, thus developing a sense of impotence, and when these feelings are continuously re-experienced over time, then ressentiment arises." &lt;ref name="Ressentiment_23_24"&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=23â24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But for Scheler, the essence of Impotency as characteristic of Pathological Ressentiment has less to do with the actual presence of an external oppressor, and more to do with a self-inflicted personal sense of inadequacy over limitations in the face of positive value attainment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Resesentiment-feelings tend to be continuously re-experienced over time in a self-perpetuating manner primarily fueled by a sense of inadequacy felt within the self which the "other" really only occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=69â72}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can have every advantage in life given them, yet prove to lack the talent for achieving the goals set for him or her self.

These re-experienced feelings of impotency become rationalized on a subconscious level as knee-jerk attitudinal projections: i.e., prejudices, bias, racism, bigotry, cynicism, and closed mindedness.

Noteworthy is the "abstract" focus of Ressentiment: the fact that specific individuals (i.e., the "Master figure" or their counterpart "Slave figure") are no longer even required for Ressentiment feelings and their rationalized forms of expression to continue and drive forward. One only needs a representative member of the class of one's focus of resentment to be represented in some way. "Members of a group can become random targets of hate, borne out of impotence that seeks to level the group." &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=148â149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a random formal treatment of "otherness" offers a plausible explanation for hate crimes, serial killings (in part), genocide, the general framing of an enemy in faceless non-human terms, as well as any top-down or bottom-up form of class warfare agenda, etc. Hence, there must be a psychic distancing of de-personalization between Master and Slave perceptions of "the other" in order for Ressentiment to operate effectively.

7) Pathological Ressentiment entails "Value-Delusion". Value Delusion is "a tendency to belittle, degrade, dismiss or to âreduceâ genuine values as well as their bearers."&lt;ref name="Ressentiment_23_24"/&gt; However, this is done in a distinctively non-productive manner because "ressentiment does not lead to affirmation of counter-values since ressentiment-imbued persons secretly crave the values they publicly denounce."&lt;ref name="Ressentiment_23_24"/&gt; This aspect of Value Delusions represents a ''horizontal'' shift of value judgment concerning things and the world from a positive to a more negative orientation. What was once loved or thought of as good becomes devalued as "sour grapes" &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "damaged goods" in the mind of the Ressentiment-imbued person, and what was previously lacking in value is now elevated to the status of acceptable.

In spite of this decidedly negative direction, "the ressentiment-subject is continuously 'plagued' by those distractions of unattainable values in that he emotionally replaces them with disvalues issuing forth from his impotence. In the background of such an illusory and self-deceiving over-turning of positive values with illusory negative valuations there still remains transparency of the true objective order of values and their ranks." &lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=146"/&gt; Hence, the demands of Value-Delusion manifest in what we commonly refer to as a [[superiority complex]], i.e., arrogance, hubris, hypocrisy, employment of double standards, denial, revenge, and self-projection of one's own negative qualities onto the opposition.

Correspondingly, negative feeling states suggest the absence, repudiation or flight from positive values. But nonetheless, negative values do not stand on their own intrinsic merit: they always refer back in some way to correspondingly positive values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotionally, Value Delusion turns happiness to sadness, compassion to hate, hope to despair, self-respect to shame, love and acceptance to rejection (or worse, competition), resolve to dread, and so on down throughout the human emotional strata.

Delusion is essential for the Ressentiment-imbued person in order to maintain any semblance of mental homeostasis.

8) Pathological Ressentiment ultimately manifests as "Metaphysical Confusion". Metaphysical Confusion is a form of Value Delusion in which the value shift is more ''vertical'' in character,&lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=70"&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the apriori hierarchy of value modalities. In this dimension, Value Delusion occurs a sort of twisting, or false inversion, of the value hierarchy wherein higher value-contents and bearers are viewed as lower, and lower as higher. Today we commonly refer to this phenomenon as "Having One's Priorities Out of Order." Scheler illustrated such an inversion in his analysis of Western civilizations humanistic, materialistic and capitalistic propensities to elevate utility values above those of vital values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|pp=149â174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=154â159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carried to the logical extreme, "Ressentiment brings its most important achievement when it determines a whole "morality," preventing the rules of preference until what was "evil" appears "good".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

9) Pathological Ressentiment ultimately results in a deadening ([[psychological numbing]]) of normal sympathetic feeling states, as well as all higher forms of psychic and spiritual feelings and feeling states. As opposed to a pure well ordered emotive life (''Ordo Amoris'') appropriate to the ethical person as created in God's image through love (''ens amans''), Pathological Ressentiment emotively results in a disordered heart (''deâordre du coeurs''),&lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=70"/&gt; or what we might commonly refer to as a "hardened heart."

For Scheler, morality finds expression in response to "the call of the hour",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=66â68}}&lt;/ref&gt; or exercise of personal conscience, which is based the heart's proper order of love (''Ordo Amoris'') in relation to positive and higher values. By contrast, Ressentiment with its corresponding Value-Delusions willfully favors varying degrees of a disordered heart (''deâordre du coeurs'') and twisted emotions consistent with personality disorders. For example, it is precisely the failure to feel for and identify with their victims (even to the extent of deriving sadistic pleasure) which characterizes the [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopath]], the [[psychopath]], the serial killer, the dictator, the rapist, the [[bullying|bully]], the corrupt CEO and the ruthless drug dealerâall share this same common denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972a|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Law would refer to this quality as "cold blooded".

Author Erick Larson in his book ''Devil in the White City'' renders with great precision a literary description of this deadening of higher feeling states in reference to America's first serial killer, Herman Webster Mudgett, alias Dr. H.H. Holmes

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"â¦Holmes was [[Superficial charm|charming]] and gracious, but something about him made Belkamp [the antagonist] uneasy. He could not have defined it. Indeed for the next several decades alienists [early psychologists] and their successors would find themselves hard-pressed with any precision what it was about men like Holmes that caused them to seem warm and integrating but also telegraph the vague sense that some important element of humanness was missing. At first alienists described this condition as "[[moral insanity]]" and those who exhibited the disorder as "moral imbeciles." They later adopted the term "psychopath"â¦as a "new malady" and stated, "Besides his own person and his own interests, nothing is sacred to the psychopath."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Larson|2003|pp=87â88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Ressentiment-Imbued person exercises such a pronounced psychic distance from his victims so as to never fully achieve the desired lasting satisfaction produced though his own unethical actions. "Retaliation" of this sort no longer yields any good, and "expression" of this sort lacks all possibility of positive results. "In true ressentiment there is no emotive satisfaction but only a life-long anger and anguish in feelings that are compared with others." &lt;ref name="harvp|Frings|2001|p=148"/&gt;

Unfortunately in general, our particular era suffers from a pronounced inability to feel higher levels of vital psychic (intellectual and sympathetic) and spiritual feeling states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=165â166}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the process of our legal system tends to convert the absolute character of moral sentiments to a "blameless" game of negotiation of cost vs. benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Can we even imagine the moral education furnished by such archaic practices as the stockade or tar and feathering so as to invoke real public humiliation for crimes? In addition, we as a culture have become so desensitized to feelings of outrage over public persons of power and stature lacking in all feelings of shame over their wrongdoings that our greatest moral problem becomes one of complacency.

==Ressentiment and wider societal impact==

10) Finally, Pathological Ressentiment bears a particular relation to the Socio-Political Realm by virtue of, what Scheler describes as, man's lowest form of social togetherness, "Psychic Contagion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1973b|pp=14â18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|pp=92â93, 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychic Contagion is the phenomenon of uncritically "following the crowd", or [[mob mentality]], liken to lemmings charging over a cliff. Positive examples, are good natured crowds in a pub or at sporting events; a negative example, violent rioting. As a concept, Psychic Contagion bears an affinity to Nietzsche's assessment of Slave-type mentality.

To the extent that the politically powerful (i.e., the "Master" faction or "Slave" faction of society, as the case might be) are able to rally collective cultural animosities through the use of Psychic Contagion, they increase their ability to achieve their underlying socio-political objectives. Such methods usually take the forms of incendiary rhetoric, scapegoat tactics (e.g., anti-Semitism, homophobia, hatred toward welfare recipients and the disadvantaged, etc.), class warfare, partisan politics, propaganda, excessive secrecy / non-transparency, closed minded political ideology, jingoism, misguided nationalism, violence, and waging unjust war.

The use of such methods of negative Psychic Contagion can be viewed as having propelled such historical figures or movements as Nero (burning of Rome), the French Revolution (Ressentiment in the original concept), Hitler (genocide of the Jews, the Aryan Master Race agenda and the ''Lebensborn'' project), the 1975-1979 Cambodian Khmer Rouge (genocidal social engineering), the 1994 Rwanda (tribal based genocide), International Fundamental Islamic Terrorism.

== Conclusions ==

It is a mistake to assess Scheler's concept of Ressentiment as chiefly a theory of psychological pathology, though surely it is that in part. In addition, Ressentiment is a philosophical and ethical concept from which to assess the spiritual and cultural health both of individual persons and society as a whole: a task which seems all the more urgent given [[economic globalization]] (i.e., a tendency toward ''carte blanche'' predatory capitalism).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|loc=Chapter VI, pp. 167â180}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is entirely acceptable to view human ethical transcendence as complementary and commensurate with a bottom-up psychology of needs and drives so long as the arch of that qualitative direction is positive in nature. However the reverse is false. Negative parallel aspects are irreducible to Scheler's top-down metaphysical principal of good as emanating from our personal development as spiritual beings. This distinction is illustrated by the many cases in which negative role models can, and do, emerge as highly self-actualized economically powerful individuals from a psychological standpoint (clearly "Superman" type persons), but who are entirely lacking from an ethical, social and spiritual standpoint: e.g., the drug king-pin or pimp as a person young boys admire and look up to, or the corrupt CEO who absconds with obscene bonuses while his company goes bankrupt and the employee pension fund disintegrates. These negative manifestations of values and value inversions demonstrate how the philosophical conception of Ressentiment rests upon qualitatively different grounds transcending science and pure economics.

For Scheler, Ressentiment is essentially a matter of self in relation to values, and only proximately an issue of social conflict over resources, power and the like (Master / Slave, or dominant / submissive relationships). For Scheler, what we call "having class", for instance, is not something as one-dimensional as power, money, or goods and services readily sold or purchased. Rather, liken to the array of apriori hierarchy of value modalities, "class" has to do with ''who'' you make of yourself as a person,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves a whole range of factors including moral character, integrity, talents, aptitudes, achievements, education, virtues (i.e., generosity), reciprocal respect among diverse individuals (active citizenship) and the like.

Scheler's formulation of Ressentiment backhandedly acknowledges the underlying principal of love, as replacing raw will to power, with its accompanying decision to pursue uncompassionate domination of our fellow man. As such, the best case scenario for Nietzsche's Master / Slave distinction lies in the free self-mastery by the individual person to channel negative psychic feelings and feeling states, and to become disillusioned &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Scheler|1972b|pp=167â168}}&lt;/ref&gt; with unpragmatic beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to intelligently benefit themselves and society. As such, we should promote a society which is inclusive, rather than exclusive, in character; but which also promotes individual and social responsibility. Repression should be constructively defused wherever reasonable and possible. We might also foster a society which seeks to resolve (instead of deny) attitudinal conflicts and differences through constructive means: i.e., dialogue, education, constructive negotiation, enhanced personal communication, and professional intervention. Force and violence should always be used only as a last resort.

Since society must be guided by the rule of law above power, we must promote government which relies upon fairness (See [[John Rawls]]) and egalitarian principal &lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Frings|2001|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of channeling our national economic forces. Self-interest (as in [[Adam Smith]]'s "invisible hand") is man's (and nature's) most highly efficient means of positively converting Vital Urge into human economic benefits-âthe point at which "the rubber hits the road"âbut it is also a force highly susceptible to greed. Therefore, government must insure that such raw pursuit of utility value is not purely an end in itself, but must serve primarily to form an economic base upon which genuine value strata and culture can take root and flourish for the common good as well as everyone's respective individual needs. We should realize that living with less materially does not diminish in any way our access to greater emotional, intellectual, artistic and spiritual fulfillment. Only in such ways can virtue truly become its own reward.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5396">'''Righteous indignation''' is typically a reactive [[emotion]] of [[anger]] over mistreatment, insult, or malice of another. It is akin to what is called the [[injustice|sense of injustice]]. In some [[Christianity|Christian]] doctrines, righteous anger is considered the only form of anger which is not sinful, e.g., when [[Jesus]] drove the [[Cleansing of the Temple|money lenders out of the temple]] ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 21).

==Elements==
{{disputed-section|date=August 2014}}
"Righteous" means acting in accord with divine or [[Moral absolutism|moral law]] or free from guilt or sin. It may also refer to a morally right or justifiable decision or action or to an action which arises from an outraged sense of justice or morality. (See third paragraph below) "Indignation" is anger aroused by something unjust, mean, or unworthy. The ''Standard Dictionary'' describes indignation as a "feeling involving anger mingled with contempt or disgust".&lt;ref name="humanele"&gt;{{cite web |author=Craig L. Adams |url=http://homepage.mac.com/craigadams1/HUMANELE/CHPTR07.html |title=Righteous Indignation |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419075734/http://homepage.mac.com/craigadams1/HUMANELE/CHPTR07.html |archivedate=2010-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament Bible commentary== 
[[Daniel Whitby]] argues that "Anger is not always sinful",&lt;ref name="criticalcommenta"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Whitby, D.D |url=https://archive.org/stream/criticalcommenta04patr#page/212/mode/1up |title=A critical commentary and paraphrase on the Old and New Testament and the Apocrypha |publisher= www.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it is found among non-sinners. For example, Jesus was "angry with the [[Pharisees]] for the hardness of their hearts; yet He had no desire to revenge this sin upon them, but had a great compassion for them".

In [[Thomas Scott (commentator)|Scott]]'s comment on [[Ephesians]] 4:26, "Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger", he notes that "...on many occasions, in the management of families, in reproving sin, and even in ordering their temporal concerns", anger is permitted of Christians. Nevertheless, Scott cautions that Christians should aim to "....be very circumspect and vigilant to restrain that dangerous passion within the bounds of reason, meekness, piety, and charity; not being angry without cause, or above cause, or in a proud, selfish, and peevish manner." Scott argues that Christians should not express anger in the "language of vehement indignation".&lt;ref name="humanele" /&gt;

The ''[[Forerunner Commentary]]'' on [[Psalms]] 137:2 argues that these psalms are about the "bitterness of exile into which God forced Judah", purportedly with the goal of turning grief into zeal, so that the "anger can be used to scour away sin" by becoming "righteously indignant".&lt;ref name="forerunner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/729/Righteous-Indignation.htm |title=Righteous Indignation (Forerunner Commentary) :: Bible Tools |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228174646/http://bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/729/Righteous-Indignation.htm |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Richard T. Ritenbaugh's comments on [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:18 in How to Survive Exile, he argues that it "is alright for us to be righteously indignant as long as we do not sin."&lt;ref name="forerunner" /&gt;  

In [[James McCosh| James McCosh's]] book ''[[Motive Powers]]'', he notes that "We may be angry and sin not; but this disposition may become sinful, and this in the highest degree. It is so when it is excessive, when it is rage, and makes us lose control of ourselves. It is so, and may become a vice, when it leads us to wish evil to those who have offended us. It is resentment when it prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. It is vengeance when it impels us to crush those who have injured us. It is vindictiveness when it is seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us. Already sin has entered."&lt;ref name="humanele" /&gt;

==Theological commentary==
[[St. Thomas Aquinas]], in the question on [[anger]] of his [[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], quotes the [[Opus Imperfectum|Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum]], "he that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked," and concludes saying that "to be angry is therefore not always an evil."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3158.htm#article1 ST]'', II-II, Q. 158, a. 1, ''sed contra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ripple-down rules''' ('''RDR''') are a way of approaching [[knowledge acquisition]]. Knowledge acquisition refers to the transfer of knowledge from human experts to knowledge based systems.

== Introductory material ==
Ripple-down rules are an incremental approach to [[knowledge acquisition]] and covers a family of techniques. RDR were proposed by [[Paul Justin Compton|Compton]] and Jansen based on experience maintaining the expert system GARVAN-ES1 (Compton and Jansen 1988). The original GARVAN-ES1 (Horn et al. 1985) employed a knowledge acquisition process where new cases that were poorly classified by the system were added to a data base and then used to incrementally refine the knowledge base. The added cases, whose conclusions conflicted with the advice of the system were termed "cornerstone cases". Consequently, the data base grew iteratively with each refinement to the knowledge. The data base could then be used to test changes to the knowledge. Knowledge acquisition tools, similar to those provided by Teiresias were developed to find and help modify the conflicting rules. The tools would display the rules fired by each case and suggestions to "edit" the knowledge to remove the conflicts.

In the RDR framework, the human expertâs knowledge is acquired based on the current context and is added incrementally. Compton and Jansen argued that the expert's knowledge is to some extent 'made up' to justify why she was right, not to explain how she reached this right interpretation (or conclusion). The justification is based on features that are identified from the current case. The expert creates a rule for classifying cases corresponding to a particular context. This rule is unlikely to classify all cases belonging to the class. Compton and Jansen asserted that it is not possible to create a single elegant context free rule as the knowledge we communicate is a justification in a context. This implies that there is no absolute knowledge that acts as foundation of other knowledge, since knowledge is only true in a context (Compton and Jansen 1990).

== Methodology ==
Ripple-down rules consist of a data structure and knowledge acquisition scenarios. Human experts' knowledge is stored in the data structure. The knowledge is coded as a set of rules.
The process of transferring human experts's knowledge to Knowledge-based systems in RDR is explained in knowledge acquisition scenario.

=== Data structure ===
There are various structures of ripple-down rules, for example single-classification ripple-down rules (SCRDR), multiple-classification ripple-down rules (MCRDR), nested ripple-down rules (NRDR) and repeat-inference multiple-classification ripple-down rules (RIMCRDR). The data structure of RDR described here is SCRDR, which is the simplest structure.

The data structure is similar to a [[decision tree]]. Each node has a rule, the format of this rule is IF cond1 AND cond2 AND ... AND condN THEN conclusion. Cond1 is a condition (boolean evaluation), for example A=1, isGreater(A,5) and average(A,"&gt;",average(B)). Each node has exactly two successor nodes, these successor nodes are connected to predecessor node by "ELSE" or "EXCEPT".

An example of SCRDR tree (defined recursively) is shown below:

IF (OutLook = "SUNNY" AND Temperature = "COOL") THEN PLAY="TENNIS"
EXCEPT Child-1
ELSE Child-2

where Child-1 and Child-2 are also SCRDR trees. For example, Child-1 is:

IF (Wind = "WINDY" AND Humidity = "HIGH") THEN Play="SQUASH"
EXCEPT NoChild
ELSE NoChild

===Knowledge-acquisition scenario===
Human experts provide a case to the system and they add a new rule to correct the classification of a misclassified case. For example, rule Child-1 is added to correct classification of case
[OutLook="SUNNY", Temperature="COOL", Wind="WINDY", Humidity="HIGH", ForeCast="STORM", Play="SQUASH"]. This case is misclassified as Play="TENNIS".

When a rule is constructed by the human experts, the conditions of this rule should be satisfied by the misclassified case and also they should NOT be satisfied by any previous cases classified correctly by the parent rule (which in this context is the first rule).

==Implementations==

{{Politics}}

The '''rule of law''' is "The authority and influence of [[law]] in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' online (accessed September 13, 2018;  spelling Americanized).  The phrase "the rule of law" is also sometimes used in other senses.  ''See'' Garner, Bryan A. (Editor in Chief). ''Black's Law Dictionary'', 9th Edition, p. 1448. (Thomson Reuters, 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-314-26578-4}}.  Black's provides a five definitions of "rule of law":  the lead definition is "A substantive legal principle";  the second is the "supremacy of regular as opposed to arbitrary power".&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "the rule of law" refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.  

Use of the phrase can be traced back to 16th-century [[Great Britain|Britain]], and in the following century the Scottish theologian [[Samuel Rutherford]] employed it in arguing against the [[divine right of kings]].&lt;ref name="Rex" /&gt;  [[John Locke]] wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  "The rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist [[A. V. Dicey]]. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers;  for example, [[Aristotle]] wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens".&lt;ref name="ari" /&gt;

The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including people who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials, and judges.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, Charles.  ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'', p. 57 (University Press of Kansas, 1996): according to [[John Marshall]], "the framers of the Constitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature."&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it stands in contrast to a [[monarchy]] or [[oligarchy]] where the rulers are held above the law. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Lack of the rule of law can be found in both democracies and monarchies, for example, because of neglect or ignorance of the law, and the rule of law is more apt to decay if a government has insufficient corrective mechanisms for restoring it.

==History==
Although credit for popularizing the expression "the rule of law" in modern times is usually given to [[A. V. Dicey]],&lt;ref name=Wormuth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Bingham|Bingham, Thomas]]. ''The Rule of Law'', p. 3 (Penguin 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Black, Anthony. ''A World History of Ancient Political Thought'' (Oxford University Press 2009). {{ISBN|0-19-928169-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
In the [[Western civilization|West]], the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;  [[Plato]] advocated a [[benevolent dictatorship|benevolent monarchy]] ruled by an idealized [[philosopher king]], who was above the law.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;David Clarke, "[http://www.lfip.org/lawe506/documents/lawe506davidclarke.pdf The many meanings of the rule of law]" in Kanishka Jayasuriya, ed., ''Law, Capitalism and Power in Asia'' (New York: Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eSKTvJDrr5kC&amp;pg=PA1402&amp;lpg=PA1402&amp;dq=%22if+law+is+the+master+of+the+government+and+the+government+is+its+slave%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XNhu-PDe7H&amp;sig=4in2cTSQVL-2gcq9i881VqWYUxo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UmTZSZDIKqntlQe4vLzgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA1402,M1 Complete Works By Plato]'', p. 1402 (Hackett Publishing, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; More than Plato attempted to do, [[Aristotle]] flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt; In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws.&lt;ref name=ari&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' [[s:Politics (Ellis)/Book 3#3:16|3.16]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Roman statesman [[Cicero]] is often cited as saying, roughly:   "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free."&lt;ref&gt;In full: "The magistrates who administer the law, the judges who act as its spokesmen, all the rest of us who live as its servants, grant it our allegiance as a guarantee of our freedom."{{mdash}}{{cite book|author=Cicero|title=Murder Trials|translator=Michael Grant|location=Harmondsworth|publisher=Penguin|year=1975|series=Penguin Classics|page=217}}

Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (''legibus solutus''), but those with grievances could sue the treasury.&lt;ref name=Wormuth&gt;Wormuth, Francis. ''The Origins of Modern Constitutionalism'', p. 28 (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, members of the school of [[w:Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted "rule ''by'' law" as opposed to "rule ''of'' law", meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law.&lt;ref&gt;Xiangming, Zhang. [http://www.international-relations.com/wbcm5-1/wbrule.htm On Two Ancient Chinese Administrative Ideas: Rule of Virtue and Rule by Law], ''The Culture Mandala: Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies'' (2002): âAlthough Han Fei recommended that the government should rule by law, which seems impartial, he advocated that the law be enacted by the lords solely. The lords place themselves above the law. The law is thereby a monarchical means to control the people, not the people's means to restrain the lords. The lords are by no means on an equal footing with the people. Hence we cannot mention the rule by law proposed by Han Fei in the same breath as democracy and the rule of law advocated today.â&lt;br /&gt;Bevir, Mark.

There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the [[Old Testament]], the book of [[Deuteronomy]] imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use).  According to Professor [[Bernard M. Levinson]], "This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented...."&lt;ref name=Levinson&gt;Levinson, Bernard.

(Continuum 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
In [[Sharia|Islamic jurisprudence]] rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the [[caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Weeramantry|Weeramantry, Christopher]] (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-1sH1wc58UC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Justice+Without+Frontiers:+Furthering+Human+Rights%22&amp;ei=f1f-SbCnH5nCyASU38TvBw#PPA132,M1 Justice without Frontiers]'', p. 132 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not a reference to [[secular]] law, but to Islamic [[religious law]] in the form of [[Sharia law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impossible State: Islam, Politics and Modernity's Moral Predicament|last=Hallaq|first=Wael|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred the Great]], Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the [[Doom Book]]) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by [[Leviticus]] 19:15: "You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alter|first1=Robert|title=The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary|date=2004|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-01955-1|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1215, Archbishop [[Stephen Langton]] gathered the Barons in England and forced [[John of England|King John]] and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by [[Magna Carta]] in return for exacting taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/magnacarta/translation/mc_trans.html Magna Carta (1215) translation, British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/ Magna Carta (1297) U.S. National Archives].&lt;/ref&gt; This foundation for a constitution was carried into the [[United States Constitution]].

In 1481, during the reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], the ''[[ConstituciÃ³ de l'ObservanÃ§a]]'' was approved by the [[Catalan Courts|General Court of Catalonia]], establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferro, VÃ­ctor: El Dret PÃºblic CatalÃ .

The first known use of this English phrase occurred around AD 1500.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (OED), "[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry:showfullentry/true?redirectedFrom=%22Rule+of+Law%22&amp;t:ac=Entry/277614 Rule of Law, n.]", accessed April 27, 2013.  According to the OED, this sentence from about 1500  was written by [[John Blount (died 1531)|John Blount]]: "Lawes And constitutcions be ordeyned be cause the noysome Appetit of man maye be kepte vnder the Rewle of lawe by the wiche mankinde ys dewly enformed to lyue honestly."  And this sentence from 1559  is attributed to [[William Bavand]]: "A Magistrate should..kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, least thei despisyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilfulnes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Another early example of the phrase "rule of law" is found in a petition to [[James I of England]] in 1610, from the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain ''rule of the law'' which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government....&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Hallam|Hallam, Henry]]. ''The Constitutional History of England'', vol. 1, p. 441 (1827).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1607, English Chief Justice [[Sir Edward Coke]] said in the ''[[Case of Prohibitions]]'' (according to his own report) "that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, ''quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege'' (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.)."

Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was [[Samuel Rutherford]] in ''[[Lex, Rex]]'' (1644).&lt;ref name=Rex&gt;Rutherford, Samuel.  ''Lex, rex: the law and the prince, a dispute for the just prerogative of king and people, containing the reasons and causes of the defensive wars of the kingdom of Scotland, and of their expedition for the ayd and help of their brethren of England'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpIBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Rutherford%22+and+%22but+under+rule+of+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3jZvY_yR6F&amp;sig=0t4WLPmw2ucho0R_mDqg9EJrKA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI_oLUzO6KxwIVRpUeCh3fnQj1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Rutherford%22%20and%20%22but%20under%20rule%20of%20law%22&amp;f=false p. 237] (1644): "The prince remaineth, even being a prince, a social creature, a man, as well as a king; one who must buy, sell, promise, contract, dispose: ergo, he is not regula regulans, but under rule of law...."&lt;/ref&gt; The title, Latin for "the law is king", subverts the traditional formulation ''rex lex'' ("the king is law").&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rule of Law|url=http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|publisher=The Constitution Society|accessdate=3 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092303/http://www.consoc.org.uk/other-content/about-us/discover-the-facts/the-rule-of-law/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] wrote in ''Oceana'' (1656), drawing principally on Aristotleâs ''Politics'', that among forms of government an âEmpire of Laws, and not of Menâ was preferable to an âEmpire of Men, and not of Lawsâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oceanaotherworks00harr|last=Harrington|first=James|title=The Oceana and other works|editor-last=Toland|editor-first=John|location=London|publisher=Millar|edition=3|year=1747|page=37 (Internet Archive: copy possessed by [[John Adams]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] also discussed this issue in his ''[[Second Treatise of Government]]'' (1690):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John.  [[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Civil Government]], Ch. IV, sec. 22 (1690).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle was also discussed by [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748).&lt;ref name="Tamanaha3"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p4CReF67hzQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Rule of Law]'', p. 47 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "rule of law" appears in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''Dictionary'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;Peacock, Anthony Arthur, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eENm8IKECDYC&amp;dq= Freedom and the rule of law]'', p. 24. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, [[Thomas Paine]] wrote in his pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that "in America, ''the law is king''. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ''ought'' to be king; and there ought to be no other."&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, Jethro. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OmA8a1Q9UekC&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=%22so+in+free+countries+the+law+ought+to+be+king%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;ei=9lH-Sa-cEIXGzAS0hLm2Cw A Practical Companion to the Constitution]'', p. 436 (University of California Press 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1780, [[John Adams]] enshrined this principle in the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] by seeking to establish "a government of laws and not of men."&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)|Massachusetts Constitution]]'', Part The First, art. XXX (1780).&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winks|first1=Robin W.|title=World civilization: a brief history|date=1993|publisher=Collegiate Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=9780939693283|page=406|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mY7McxJl7jYC&amp;pg=PA406&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv-sKmzafMAhXBK8AKHbYhDrEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Billias|first1=George Athan|title=American constitutionalism heard round the world, 1776â1989: a global perspective|date=2011|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814725177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ku0TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpnefZzqfMAhXC1hoKHcjFAG0Q6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=53â56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning and categorization of interpretations ==
The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' has defined ''rule of law'' this way:&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by [[divine right of kings|divine right]].

Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as "an exceedingly elusive notion".&lt;ref name=elusive&gt;{{cite book|last=Tamanaha|first=Brian Z.|title=On the Rule of Law|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2004|page=3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among modern [[Legal theory#Legal theory|legal theorists]], one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a [[legal formalism|formalist]] or "thin" definition, and a substantive or "[[Thick concept|thick]]" definition; one occasionally encounters a third "functional" conception.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=312622# âThe Rule of Law for Everyone?â], ''Current Legal Problems'', vol. 55, via [[SSRN]] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the "justness" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=Paul P.|title=Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: An Analytical Framework|journal=Public Law|page=467|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics, meaning that the law must be publicly declared (prohibitions or exigencies), with prospective application (punishments or consequences tied to a given prohibition or exigency), and possess the characteristics of generality (usually meaning consistency and comprehensibility), equality (that is, applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (that is, certainty of application for a given situation), but there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The "formal" interpretation is more widespread than the "substantive" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law.&lt;ref name="Tamanaha" /&gt; This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights.

The substantive interpretation holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.

The functional interpretation of the term "rule of law", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the "rule of law" with the "[[rule of man]]".&lt;ref name="Stephenson"&gt;Stephenson, Matthew. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTLAWJUSTINST/0,,contentMDK:20763583~menuPK:1989584~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:1974062,00.html "Rule of Law as a Goal of Development Policy"], World Bank Research (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of "rule of law", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of "rule of law".&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt; Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are [[justification (law)|justifiable]] under [[natural law]] but not statutory law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Justifiably Punishing the Justified|author=Heidi M. Hurd|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=90|date=Aug 1992|pages=2203â2324|publisher=The Michigan Law Review Association|jstor=1289573|issue=8|doi=10.2307/1289573}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable.&lt;ref name="Stephenson" /&gt;

The ancient concept of rule ''of'' law can be distinguished from rule ''by'' law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: "The difference&amp;nbsp;... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian 2004).

===Europe===
The preamble of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] says "the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law".

In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (''Etat de droit'' and ''Rechtsstaat'' respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see [[public law]]), particularly the [[legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pech|first1=Laurent|title=Rule of Law in France|journal=Middlesex University â School of Law|ssrn=929099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Letourneur|first1=M.|last2=Drago|first2=R.|title=The Rule of Law as Understood in France|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|date=1958|volume=7|issue=2|pages=147â177|doi=10.2307/837562|jstor=837562}}&lt;/ref&gt; France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peerenboom|first1=Randall|title=Asian discourses of rule of law : theories and implementation of rule of law in twelve Asian countries, France and the U.S.|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=9780415326124|page=81|edition=Digital printing.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXJFFudGd0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Rule of Law in France}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German interpretation is more "rigid" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rule of Law in China: A Comparative Approach|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662446225|pages=77â78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7gjBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Zurn|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Nollkaemper|editor2-first=Andre|editor3-last=Peerenboom|editor3-first=Randy|title=Rule of Law Dynamics: In an Era of International and Transnational Governance|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139510974|pages=116â117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAAgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzrmW7MfMAhViD8AKHestC7sQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland's [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]] explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that "the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed."

====United Kingdom====
{{Main article|Rule of law in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from [[Magna Carta]] in 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref name=TSC-RoL-brief /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule of Law|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritemsruleoflaw.html|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|title=The rule of law and the prosecutor|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-rule-of-law-and-the-prosecutor|publisher=Attorney General's Office|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Albert Venn Dicey|A. V. Dicey]], a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the [[British constitution]] in his classic work ''Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'' (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and [[parliamentary sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=John|last1=Hostettler|title=Champions of the rule of law|date=2011|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=9781904380689|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh7bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibuqX19cfMAhVJ0xoKHY_QBYEQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dicey&amp;f=false|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====United States====
All government officers of the United States, including the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justices of the Supreme Court]], state judges and legislators, and all [[United States Congress|members of Congress]], pledge first and foremost to uphold the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader.&lt;ref&gt;Vile, Josh (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-QXyUM5BhKUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22rule+of+law%22+and+%22shall+be+a+law%22+and+constitution&amp;ots=7hOE4WdL4m&amp;sig=PRZ1TgZMRfRKQ-p0k-8skOzRF7I#PPA80,M1 A Companion to the United States Constitution and its Amendments]''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its [[enumerated powers]] and respects the constitutionally protected [[United States Bill of Rights|rights of individuals]]. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of [[judicial discretion]],&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn v. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824): "When [courts] are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it."&lt;/ref&gt; and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including [[prosecutorial discretion]].

Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the "rule of law", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word "law" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being "defined by formal or substantive criteria", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, John. "Substantive Due Process and the Constitutional Text," ''[[Virginia Law Review]]'', vol. 83, p. 493 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Law Professor [[Frederick Mark Gedicks]] disagrees, writing that [[Cicero]], [[Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Gedicks|Gedicks, Frederick]]. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1072284 "An Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: Magna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the Fifth Amendment"], ''Emory Law Journal'', vol. 58, pp. 585â673 (2009). See also Edlin, Douglas, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1124590 Judicial Review without a Constitution]", ''Polity'', vol. 38, pp. 345â368 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by [[legal realism|legal realists]] such as [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].  For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: "The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''How an Instrumental View of Law Corrodes the Rule of Law'', twelfth annual Clifford Symposium on Tort Law and Social Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: "no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land." That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed "you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers." By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked "the ordinary legal manner" of the courts, further review of the facts by "the ordinary Courts of the land" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your "day in commission", the rule of law did not require a further "day in court". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Daniel R. (2014). ''Tocqueville's Nightmare: The Administrative State Emerges in America, 1900â1940''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0199920860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wilson]] said during the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 that, "Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect." [[George Mason]] agreed that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course."&lt;ref&gt;Snowiss, Sylvia. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JUj81cN6nyAC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22could+declare+an+unconstitutional+%22+%22Laws+may+be+unjust,+may+be+unwise,+may+be+dangerous%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=P0P-Sa6jGI_CzASqtpzhDQ Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution]'', pp. 41â42 (Yale University Press 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] (joined by Justice [[Joseph Story]]) took a similar position in 1827: "When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law."&lt;ref&gt;''Ogden v. Saunders'', {{ussc|25|213|1827|pin=347}}. This was Marshall's only dissent in a constitutional case. The [[individualist anarchist]] [[Lysander Spooner]] later denounced Marshall for this part of his ''Ogden'' dissent. See {{cite book|first=Lysander|last=Spooner|title=Let's Abolish Government|publisher=Ludwig Von Mises Institute|year=2008|page=87}} These same issues were also discussed in an earlier U.S. Supreme Court case, ''Calder v. Bull'', {{ussc|3|386|1798}}, with Justices [[James Iredell]] and [[Samuel Chase]] taking opposite positions. See Presser, Stephen. "Symposium: Samuel Chase: In Defense of the Rule of Law and Against the Jeffersonians", ''[[Vanderbilt Law Review]]'', vol. 62, p. 349 (March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, [[Confucianism]], which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state.&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Yun-Han et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oNk6KpfXyYQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+Law%22+and+Korea+and+Japan&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0NMASsrtG5XQzATy8KC8BA#PPA31,M1 How East Asians View Democracy]'', pp. 31â32.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Awzar Thi, a member of the [[Asian Human Rights Commission]], the rule of law in Thailand, Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is an organized crime gang. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade?&lt;ref&gt;Thi, Awzar.

In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Peerenboom, Randall ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], p. 39 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese law#Rule of law|rule of law in China]] has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.

In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. Although the [[Constitution of India]] may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion, the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise [[Constitution of India#Judicial Review|judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Baxi, Upendra ''in'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YlKYLRjcoi0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Rule+of+law+in+Asia%22&amp;ei=hcIASqy4KKGeygSpzf2vDQ#PPA336,M1 Asian Discourses of Rule of Law], pp. 336â337 (Routledge 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Indian journalist [[Harish Khare]], "The rule of law or rather the Constitution [is] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges."&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Simon. [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1556853,00.html "For Activist Judges, Try India"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (2006-11-08).&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had centuries of tradition prior to [[World War II]], during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Carl. [http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html "Japan: 'The Rule of Law Without Lawyers' Reconsidered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623094753/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/green.html |date=2008-06-23 }}, Speech to the [[Asia Society]] (2001-03-14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F.|title=The rule of law in Japan : a comparative analysis|date=2008|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9789041127501|edition=2nd rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIsmHbijQesC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.

=== The Council of Europe ===
[[Statute of the Council of Europe|The Statute]] of [[Council of Europe|the Council of Europe]] characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: "Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy." The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/1680306052|title=Statute of the Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Commission of Jurists===
In 1959, an event took place in [[New Delhi]] and speaking as the [[International Commission of Jurists]], made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the [[Declaration of Delhi]]. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldsworthy, Jeffrey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=84tBKuObyNEC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22Declaration+of+Delhi%22+and+%22rule+of+law%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=5PLOSdWiJ4WoNsPhoMcH âLegislative Sovereignty and the Rule of Law"] in Tom Campbell, Keith D. Ewing and Adam Tomkins (eds), ''Sceptical Essays on Human Rights'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] defines the rule of law as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrol.org/article.aspx?article_id=3 What is the Rule of Law?], United Nations Rule of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The General Assembly has considered rule of law as an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions.&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations General Assembly Resolutions A/RES/61/39, A/RES/62/70, A/RES/63/128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council debates S/PRST/2003/15, S/PRST/2004/2, S/PRST/2004/32, S/PRST/2005/30, S/PRST/2006/28.&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security,&lt;ref&gt;See United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; children in armed conflict,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1612.&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peacebuilding Commission]] has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml United Nations and the Rule of Law].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] also requires the rule of law be included in [[human rights education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] Part II, paragraph 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Bar Association===
The Council of the [[International Bar Association]] passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or "thick" definition of the rule of law:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibanet.org/Document/Default.aspx?DocumentUid=9925C6FD-5804-407F-9D39-ECB9D6A8B9D4 Resolution of the Council of the International Bar Association of October 8, 2009, on the Commentary on Rule of Law Resolution (2005)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World Justice Project===
As used by the [[World Justice Project]], a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjusticeproject.org About the WJP].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law;
# The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property;
# The process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient;
# Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The [[World Justice Project#WJP Rule of Law Index|WJP Rule of Law Index]] is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of lawâsuch as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;Agrast, M., Botero, J., Ponce, A., WJP [http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/wjproli2011_0.pdf Rule of Law Index 2011.] Washington, D.C.: The World Justice Project. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The International Development Law Organization (IDLO)===
The [[International Development Law Organization]] (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them.&lt;ref name="IDLO - What we Do"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDLO â What We Do|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do|website=idlo.int|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan IDLO Strategic Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208164000/http://idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 170 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history IDLO Mission and History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/rule-law IDLO â Rule of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in [[The Hague]] and has Permanent Observer Status at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City.

=== The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) ===
The [http://inprol.org International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL)] is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective.  INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://inprol.org/about-inprol |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202002311/http://inprol.org/about-inprol |archive-date=2017-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.

INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices.  Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.

==In relation to economics==
One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of lawâs impact on [[economic development]]. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter for economic development or not?&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. "Corruption and development. Does the 'rule of law' factor weigh more than we think?" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 15 Nov 2008. [http://54pesos.org/2008/11/15/corruption-and-development-does-the-%E2%80%9Crule-of-law%E2%80%9D-factor-weigh-more-than-we-think/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]], which, in many transitional and [[developing countries]], is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.

The standards of [[constitutional economics]] can be used during annual [[budget process]], and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, "Defining the rules", ''The European Lawyer'', Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term "rule of law" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova. [http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/worldruleoflaw.pdf "The 25th Anniversary of Constitutional Economics: The Russian Model and Legal Reform in Russia, in The World Rule of Law Movement and Russian Legal Reform"], edited by Francis Neate and Holly Nielsen, Justitsinform, Moscow (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The "rule of law" primarily connotes "protection of property rights".&lt;ref name=licht/&gt; The economist [[F. A. Hayek]] analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: "under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ''ad hoc'' action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts."&lt;ref name=Serfdom&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=F.A.|title=The Road to Serfdom|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-32061-8|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Brad|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|year=2016|title=Does Anti-bribery enforcement deter foreign investment?|url=http://fcpa.stanford.edu/academic-articles/20150511-does-anti-bribery-enforcement-deter-foreign-investment.pdf|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=|pages=63â67|via=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to culture==
The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or [[Roerich Pact]] is an inter-American [[treaty]]. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the [[legal recognition]] that the defense of [[cultural objects]] is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military [[defense (military)|purposes]], and the protection of culture always has precedence over any [[military necessity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophicalclub.ru/content/docs/75th_Anniversary_of_Roerich_Pact_Eng.html Peter Barenboim, Naeem Sidiqi, ''Bruges, the Bridge between Civilizations: The 75 Anniversary of the Roerich Pact, Grid Belgium, 2010]. {{ISBN|978-5-98856-114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935 by the representatives of 21 American states in the [[Oval Office]] of the [[White House]] (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Stoumatoff, ''FDR's Unfinished Portrait: A Memoir'', University of Pittsburgh Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8229-3659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is [[intellectual property]]. Under the auspices of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant [[copyright infringement|piracy]], including an increase in [[peer-to-peer file sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=White Paper: Building a Culture of Respect for the Rule of Law|publisher=American Bar Association|author=Bica-Huiu, Alina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Russia, [[tax evasion]] is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~ieresgwu/assets/docs/demokratizatsiya%20archive/07-02_pope.pdf|title=The Rule of Law and Russian Culture â Are They Compatible?|author=Pope, Ronald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bribery]] likewise has different normative implications across cultures.&lt;ref name=licht&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Comparative Economics|volume=35|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=659â688|title=Culture rules: The foundations of the rule of law and other norms of governance|author=Licht, Amir N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Rule of Law has been criticised by several scholars, authors, philosophers and activists as unrealistic, hypocritical or dangerous.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Author [[Peter Gelderloos]] argues that attempting to create a specialised class of judicial authority that is separate from the community will inevitably lead to corruption. He points out that nonviolent drug-related offences receive far more police and media attention than workplace injuries or pollution, which kill far more people each year. He argues that [[restorative justice]] is a far more effective and humane alternative to prisons, courts and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schedule delay''' is a term in [[transportation planning|transport modelling]] which refers to a difference between a desired time of arrival or departure and the actual time. Despite the use of "delay", it can refer to a difference in either the early or late direction.

The most common example is that of having a fixed work start time: if someone starts work at 0900 but actually arrives at 0850, they are incurring a schedule delay of 10 minutes. Alternative examples might include [[public transport]] - if a bus is scheduled to depart from a stop at 20-minute intervals (e.g. 0800, 0820, 0840) and a person wishes to begin their journey between those intervals (e.g. at 0815), they incur a schedule delay through having to retime their departure from the desired 0815 point to the bus departure time of 0820.

Schedule delay can be measured as a [[utility]] (or, rather, a disutility). The Small model of scheduling has the disutility of schedule delay decrease linearly towards zero as the actual arrival (or departure) time approaches the desired time. The disutility of schedule delay for a late arrival or departure also increase linearly, but Small hypothesises that there can also be a fixed penalty component of schedule delay on the "late" side - e.g. arriving late for work is always bad, even if it is only slightly late.

'''Self-propaganda''' is a form of [[propaganda]] and [[indoctrination]] performed by an [[individual]] or a [[Group (sociology)|group]] on oneself.

==Background==
Essentially, it is the act of telling one's self (or a group telling themselves) something that they consider to be true, or to convince themselves, with the unfortunate repercussion of their having no doubts. Because of what they do to themselves, they will go over every aspect of their side of the "argument" to prove to themselves that they are right, and will refuse to look at any alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQE9rD5X0m4C&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false Carey McWilliams (1999) ''A mask for privilege: anti-semitism in America''] 2 Ed. pp 242.

It hides behind partial truths and ignores questions of [[critical thought]].

The psychological process of utilizing self-propaganda can negatively influence values and beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=04t1W8w1ApQC&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false Paul M.

The '''separation of mechanism and policy'''&lt;ref&gt;Butler W. Lampson and Howard E. Sturgis. ''[http://research.microsoft.com/Lampson/15-ReflectionsOnOS/Acrobat.pdf Reflections on an Operating System Design]'' [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=360051.360074] Communications of the ACM  19(5):251-265 (May 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[software design|design]] principle in [[computer science]].  It states that mechanisms (those parts of a system implementation that control the [[authorization]] of operations and the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]]) should not dictate (or overly restrict) the policies according to which decisions are made about which operations to authorize, and which resources to allocate.

This is most commonly discussed in the context of security mechanisms (authentication and authorization), but is actually applicable to a much wider range of resource allocation
problems (e.g. [[Scheduling (computing)|CPU scheduling]], [[memory allocation]], [[quality of service]]), and the general 
question of good object abstraction.

[[Per Brinch Hansen]] introduced the concept of separation of policy and mechanism in operating systems in the [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Per Brinch Hansen â¢ IEEE Computer Society|url = http://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-per-hansen|website = www.computer.org|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artsy and Livny, in a 1987 paper, discussed an approach for an operating system design having an "extreme separation of mechanism and policy".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. S., &amp; Drexler, K. E. (1988). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033556/http://www.agorics.com/Library/agoricpapers/aos/aos.4.html "Markets and computation: Agoric open systems"]. In Huberman, B. A. (Ed.). (1988), pp. 133â176. ''The Ecology of Computation''. North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artsy, Yeshayahu ''et al.'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 article, Chervenak et al. described the principles of ''mechanism neutrality'' and ''policy neutrality''.&lt;ref&gt;Chervenak 2000 p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale and implications==

The separation of mechanism and policy is the fundamental approach of a [[microkernel]] that distinguishes it from a [[Monolithic kernel|monolithic]] one. In a microkernel the majority of operating system services are provided by user-level server processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphael Finkel]], [[Michael L. Scott]], Artsy Y. and Chang, H. ''[www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/1989_IEEETSE_Charlotte.pdf Experience with Charlotte: simplicity and function in a distributed operating system]. IEEE Trans. Software Engng 15:676-685; 1989. Extended abstract presented at the IEEE Workshop on Design Principles for Experimental Distributed Systems, Purdue University; 1986. &lt;/ref&gt; It is important for an [[operating system]] to have the flexibility of providing adequate mechanisms to support the broadest possible spectrum of real-world security policies.&lt;ref&gt;R. Spencer, S. Smalley, P. Loscocco, M. Hibler, D. Andersen, and J. Lepreau ''[http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/papers/flask-usenixsec99-abs.html The Flask Security Architecture: System Support for Diverse Security Policies]'' In Proceedings of the Eighth USENIX Security Symposium, pages 123â139, Aug. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is almost impossible to envision all of the different ways in which a system might be used by different types of users over the life of the product.  This means that any hard-coded policies are likely to be inadequate or inappropriate for some (or perhaps even most) potential users.
Decoupling the mechanism implementations from the policy specifications makes it possible for different applications to use the same mechanism implementations with different policies.  This means that those mechanisms are likely to better meet the needs of a wider range of users, for a longer period of time.

If it is possible to enable new policies without changing the implementing mechanisms, the costs and risks of such policy changes can be greatly reduced. In the first instance, this could be accomplished merely by segregating mechanisms and their policies into distinct modules: by replacing the module which dictates a policy (e.g. CPU scheduling policy) without changing the module which executes this policy (e.g. the scheduling mechanism), we can change the behaviour of the system.  Further, in cases where a wide or variable range of policies are anticipated depending on applications' needs, it makes sense to create some non-code means for specifying policies, i.e. policies are not hardcoded into executable code but can be specified as an independent description.  For instance, file protection policies (e.g.  [[Filesystem permissions|Unix's ''user/group/other read/write/execute'']]) might be parametrized. Alternatively an implementing mechanism could be designed to include an interpreter for a new policy specification language. In both cases, the systems are usually accompanied by a {{clarify-span|deferred binding|date=August 2013}} mechanism (e.g. [[configuration file]]s, or [[Application programming interface|API]]s) that permits policy specifications to be incorporated to the system or replaced by another after it has been delivered to the customer.

An everyday example of mechanism/policy separation is the use of [[Keycard lock|card keys]] to gain access to locked doors. The mechanisms (magnetic card readers, remote controlled locks, connections to a security server) do not impose any limitations on entrance policy (which people should be allowed to enter which doors, at which times). These decisions are made by a centralized security server, which (in turn) probably makes its decisions by consulting a database of room access rules. Specific authorization decisions can be changed by updating a room access database. If the rule schema of that database proved too limiting, the entire security server could be replaced while leaving the fundamental mechanisms (readers, locks, and connections) unchanged.

Contrast this with issuing physical keys:  if you want to change who can open a door, you have to issue new keys and change the lock.  This intertwines the unlocking mechanisms with the access policies.  For a hotel, this is significantly less effective than using key cards.

'''Sovereignty''' is the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a [[substantive]] term designating supreme [[authority]] over some [[polity]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]|title=sovereignty (politics)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557065/sovereignty |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic principle underlying the dominant [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian model]] of [[Sovereign state|state foundation]].

==Different approaches==

The concepts of sovereignty have been discussed throughout history, and are still actively debated.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=NÃºÃ±ez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-013-9333-x|doi=10.1007/s11196-013-9333-x|volume=27|pages=645â664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=NÃºÃ±ez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty: The Middle Ages|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-014-9379-4|doi=10.1007/s11196-014-9379-4|volume=28|pages=235â250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition, concept, and application has changed throughout, especially during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The current notion of [[sovereign state|state sovereignty]] contains four aspects consisting of territory, population, authority and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biersteker|first1=Thomas|last2=Weber|first2=Cynthia |title=State Sovereignty as Social Construct|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy97O2Eon0gC|series=Cambridge Studies in International Relations|volume=46|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=9780521565998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stephen D. Krasner]], the term could also be understood in four different ways: 
* domestic sovereignty â actual control over a state exercised by an authority organized within this state,&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite book|pages=6â12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISqwQIBQff4C&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7|title=Problematic Sovereignty: Contested Rules and Political Possibilities|isbn=9780231121798|author1=Krasner|first1=Professor Stephen D.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* interdependence sovereignty â actual control of movement across state's borders, assuming the borders exist,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* international legal sovereignty â formal recognition by other sovereign states,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* [[Westphalian sovereignty]] â lack of other authority over state other than the domestic authority (examples of such other authorities could be a non-domestic church, a non-domestic political organization, or any other external agent).&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;

Often, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case â they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects.&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognised by others if it is to have any meaning: {{cquote|Sovereignty is more than anything else a matter of legitimacy [...that] requires reciprocal recognition. Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially conflicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such recognitions as their least costly strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|title=World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vGr7kRsXBkC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334422|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

===Classical===
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] jurist [[Ulpian]] observed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or46AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=ulpian+sovereignty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLziOgc30p&amp;sig=M8UwaBN0HZMBwqfdmI3Cz9HBk3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pE6kVJ6GEMe3oQSAq4L4Dg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ulpian%20sovereignty&amp;f=false|title=Sovereignty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The people transferred all their ''[[imperium]]'' and power to the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]]. Cum lege regia, quae de imperio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat (Digest I.4.1)
* The emperor is not bound by the laws. Princeps legibus solutus est (Digest I.3.31)
* A decision by the emperor has the force of a statute. Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem. (Digest I.4.1)

Ulpian was expressing the idea that the Emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty, that originated in the people, although he did not use the term expressly.

===Medieval===
Ulpian's statements were known in [[medieval Europe]], but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Medieval monarchs were ''not'' sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Sovereignty existed during the Medieval period as the ''[[de jure]]'' rights of nobility and royalty, and in the ''de facto'' capability of individuals to make their own choices in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/sovereignty_07.htm|title=Sovereignty|website=www.tititudorancea.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around c. 1380â1400, the issue of feminine sovereignty was addressed in Geoffrey Chaucer's [[Middle English]] collection of ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', specifically in ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaucer's tale of the Wife of Bath.|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221200100/http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|archivedate=21 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later English [[Arthurian]] romance, ''The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell'' (c. 1450),&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell|url=http://www.lone-star.net/mall/literature/gawain.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses many of the same elements of the Wife of Bath's tale, yet changes the setting to the court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The story revolves around the knight [[Sir Gawain]] granting to Dame Ragnell, his new bride, what is purported to be wanted most by women: sovereignty.

{{quote|We desire most from men,&lt;br /&gt;
From men both lund and poor,&lt;br /&gt;
To have sovereignty without lies.&lt;br /&gt;
For where we have sovereignty, all is ours,&lt;br /&gt;
Though a knight be ever so fierce,&lt;br /&gt;
And ever win mastery.&lt;br /&gt;
It is our desire to have master&lt;br /&gt;
Over such a sir.&lt;br /&gt;
Such is our purpose.|sign=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell (c. 1450)|source=&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"/&gt;}}

===Reformation===

Sovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for stronger central authority, when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern [[nation state]] was emerging. [[Jean Bodin]], partly in reaction to the chaos of the [[French wars of religion]], presented theories of sovereignty calling for strong central authority in the form of [[absolute monarchy]]. In his 1576 treatise ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six Livres de la RÃ©publique]]'' ("Six Books of the Republic") Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the [[State (politics)|state]] that sovereignty must be:&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

* Absolute: On this point he said that the sovereign must be hedged in with obligations and conditions, must be able to legislate without his (or its) subjects' consent, must not be bound by the laws of his predecessors, and could not, because it is illogical, be bound by his own laws.
* Perpetual: Not temporarily delegated as to a strong leader in an emergency or to a state employee such as a [[magistrate]]. He held that sovereignty must be perpetual because anyone with the power to enforce a time limit on the governing power must be above the governing power, which would be impossible if the governing power is absolute.

Bodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as ''the sovereign''); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (''ie.'' not bound by) only [[positive law]], that is, laws made by humans. He emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodinâs sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the ''lois royales'', the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign.

Despite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a [[senate]] from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] as a means of communicating with the people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bodin believed that âthe most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democraticallyâ.&lt;ref&gt;Bodin, Six livres, 6:254 (VI:vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the [[divine right of kings]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
&lt;!--Bodin: "''Sovereignty is a Republic's absolute and perpetual power ''" Sovereignty is [[absolute]], thus indivisible, but not without any limits: it exercises itself only in the [[public]] sphere, not in the [[Private sector|private]] sphere. It is perpetual, because it does not expire with its holder (as ''auctoritas'' does). In other words, sovereignty is no one's property: by essence, it is inalienable. --&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the "[[Social contract]]" as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new [[United States]] and [[France]], though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent.

[[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) arrived a conception of sovereignty similar to Bodin's, which had just achieved legal status in the "[[Peace of Westphalia]]", but for different reasons. He created the first modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the "nasty, brutish and short" quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a "commonwealth" and submit to a "Soveraigne{{sic}} Power" that is able to compel them to act in the common good. This expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the definition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin's, by saying that it must be:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

* Absolute: because conditions could only be imposed on a sovereign if there were some outside arbitrator to determine when he had violated them, in which case the sovereign would not be the final authority.
* Indivisible: The sovereign is the only final authority in his territory; he does not share final authority with any other entity. Hobbes held this to be true because otherwise there would be no way of resolving a disagreement between the multiple authorities.

Hobbes' hypothesisâthat the ruler's sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safetyâled him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract.

Hobbes's &lt;!--characteristics--&gt;theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of [[social contract]] theories. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s (1712â1778) definition of [[popular sovereignty]] (with early antecedents in [[Francisco SuÃ¡rez]]'s theory of the origin of power), provides that the people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which [[constitutional monarchy]] or [[representative democracy]] is founded. [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]] are also key figures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability.

The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''[[Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique]]'' (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible, since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will in regard to some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Contract|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/rousseau1762.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau, in the Social Contract''&lt;ref&gt;''Social Contract'', Book II, Chapter III.
&lt;/ref&gt;
argued, "the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn in order to contain the Government," with the understanding that the Sovereign is "a collective being of wonder" (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from "the general will" of the people, and that "what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law" (Book II, Chapter VI) â and furthermore predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will.  Thus the legal maxim, "there is no law without a sovereign."&lt;ref name="max-seydel"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gl9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22there+is+no+law+without+a+sovereign%22+Seydel | title = A society of states: Or, Sovereignty, independence, and equality in a league of nations | author1 = Stallybrass | first1 = William Teulon Swan | year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and types==
{{quote box|width=30%|There exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty. It is an indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was universally agreed upon.|[[Lassa Oppenheim]] (30-03-1858 â 07-10-1919)|an authority on international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], International Law 66 (Sir Arnold D. McNair ed., 4th ed. 1928)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Absoluteness===
An important factor of sovereignty is its degree of [[Absolute monarchy|absoluteness]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A sovereign power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by the laws of its predecessors, or by [[Custom (law)|custom]], and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. [[International law]]; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness.

===Exclusivity===
A key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of [[jurisdiction]]. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority.  Along these lines, the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] proposed that sovereignty is a community's monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the same right must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate, or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Kenneth. Foundations of comparative politics: democracies of the modern world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as [[federated state]]s or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent ''de facto'' infringements on exclusivity.

===''De jure'' and ''de facto''===
''[[De jure]]'', or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. ''[[De facto]]'', or actual, sovereignty is concerned with whether control in fact exists. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent measures of ''de facto'' sovereignty. When control is practiced predominantly by military or police force it is considered ''coercive sovereignty''.

====Sovereignty and independence====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
State sovereignty is sometimes viewed synonymously with [[independence]], however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right whereas independence cannot.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; A state can achieve ''de facto'' independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation such as when [[Iraq]] had been overrun by the forces to take part in the [[Iraq War of 2003]], Iraq had not been annexed by any country, so its sovereignty during this period was not contested by any state including those present on the territory. Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst their territories were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the pre-Soviet republics.&lt;ref name="talmon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scc8EboiJX8C&amp;pg=PA50|series=Oxford Monographs in International Law Series|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198265733|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MÃ¤lksoo|first=Lauri|title=Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR|year=2003|publisher=M. Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041121773|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5w6AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of [[Poland]], the [[History of Poland (1945â89)|People's Republic of Poland]] which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the [[Second Polish Republic]] which ended in 1939. For other reasons however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its pre-World War II shape which included areas now in [[Belarus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]] but did not include some of its western regions that were then in [[Germany]].

At the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the self-governance of certain self-proclaimed states such as [[Republic of Abkhazia]], [[Republic of South Ossetia]] or the [[Republic of Kosovo]] (see [[List of states with limited recognition]]) since their governments neither answer to a bigger state, nor is their governance subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in all three cases as the first two entities are claimed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the third by [[Serbia]].

===Internal===
Internal sovereignty is the relationship between a sovereign power and the political community. A central concern is [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]]: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the [[divine right of kings]] or to a [[social contract]] (i.e. [[popular sovereignty]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

With Sovereignty meaning holding supreme, independent authority over a region or state, Internal Sovereignty refers to the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 92|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=25 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy.  Internal sovereignty examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates.  It is important to have strong internal sovereignty in relation to keeping order and peace.  When you have weak internal sovereignty, organisations such as rebel groups will undermine the authority and disrupt the peace.  The presence of a strong authority allows you to keep agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation of laws.  The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key variable in determining internal sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford,  Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.1|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of internal sovereignty can cause war in one of two ways: first, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford, Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.3|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements.  The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining.  It has been said that a more decentralized authority would be more efficient in keeping peace because the deal must please not only the leadership but also the opposition group.  While the operations and affairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument between who should hold the authority in a sovereign state.

This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty.  This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty.  An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch.  They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority.  An example of an internal sovereign or monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century;  Louis XIV claimed that he was the state.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty.  Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will.  This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind.  The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 93|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern internal sovereignty====

Within the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign.  A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system.  From 1790 to 1859 it was argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the "Monarch in Parliament".  This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution.  With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called "elective dictatorship" or "modern autocracy".  Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the USA, Canada, Australia and India where government is divided into different levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|work=pgs. 94â95|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External===
{{See also|Sovereign state#Recognition}}
External sovereignty concerns the relationship between a sovereign power and other states. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] uses the following criterion when deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as having sovereignty over some territory;
{{quote box|width=30%|"Sovereignty." A government which exercises de facto administrative control over a country and is not subordinate to any other government in that country or a foreign sovereign state.|(''The Arantzazu Mendi'', [1939] A.C. 256)|Stroud's Judicial Dictionary}}

External sovereignty is connected with questions of international law â such as: when, if ever, is [[Foreign intervention|intervention]] by one country into another's territory permissible?

Following the [[Thirty Years' War]], a European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a norm of [[non-intervention|noninterference in the affairs of other nations]], so-called [[Westphalian sovereignty]], even though the actual treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple levels of sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural extension of the older principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (Whose realm, his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to interfere with the internal affairs of many European states.  It is a myth, however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Osiander, "Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Westphalian Myth", ''[[International Organization]]'' Vol. 55 No. 2 (Spring 2001), pp. 251â287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international law]], sovereignty means that a government possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an expectation that both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' sovereignty rest in the same organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise the sovereignty of a state over a territory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Membership in the [[United Nations]] requires that "[t]he admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Chart, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208031716/https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovereignty may be recognized even when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under partial or total occupation by another power. The [[Holy See]] was in this position between the annexation in 1870 of the [[Papal States]] by Italy and the signing of the [[Lateran Treaties]] in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no territory â a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy See sovereignty over the [[Vatican City]]. Another case, ''[[sui generis]]'', {{Citation needed span|text=though often contested,|date=October 2012}} is the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the third sovereign entity inside Italian territory (after [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City State]]) and the second inside the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta receive [[extraterritorial]] rights, in this way becoming the only "sovereign" territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir to one of several once militarily significant, [[crusader state]]s of sovereign [[Military order (society)|military order]]s. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made [[ReichsfÃ¼rst]] (princes of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]], at the time the closest permanent equivalent to a UN-type general assembly; confirmed 1620). These sovereign rights were never deposed, only the territories were lost. 100 modern states still maintain full diplomatic relations with the order&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en Bilateral diplomatic relations of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203180316/http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en |date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now ''de facto'' "the most prestigious service club"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}), and the UN awarded it observer status.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES48265"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-265 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=265 |accessdate=10 September 2007|title=Observer status for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government-in-exile|governments-in-exile]] of many European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or [[Czechoslovakia]]) during the [[Second World War]] were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation had ended. The government of [[Kuwait]] was in a similar situation ''vis-Ã -vis'' the [[Iraq]]i occupation of its country during 1990â1991.&lt;ref name='nolan'&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&amp;pg=PA1559|volume=Volume 4|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government of [[Republic of China]] was recognized as sovereign over [[Greater China|China]] from 1911 to 1971 despite that its [[mainland China]] territory became occupied by Communist Chinese forces since 1949. In 1971 it lost [[China and the United Nations|UN recognition]] to [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]]-led People's Republic of China and its [[political status of Taiwan|sovereign and political status as a state became disputed]] and it lost its ability to use "China" as its name and therefore became commonly known as [[Taiwan]].

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross#Legal status|International Committee of the Red Cross]] is commonly mistaken to be sovereign. It has been granted various degrees of special privileges and legal [[Immunity from prosecution|immunities]] in many countries,{{Which|date=November 2010}} that in cases like Switzerland are considerable,&lt;ref&gt;By formal agreement between the Swiss government and the ICRC, Switzerland grants full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand Switzerland [http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx does not recognize ICRC issued passports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510112534/http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx |date=10 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee is a private organisation governed by Swiss law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/who-we-are/overview-who-we-are.htm|title=About the International Committee of the Red Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared and pooled===
Just as the office of [[head of state]] can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or more consenting powers, notably in the form of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Likewise the member states of international organizations may voluntarily bind themselves by treaty to a supranational organization, such as a [[continental union]]. In the case of the [[Member state of the European Union#Sovereignty|European Union members states this is called "pooled sovereignty"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9248.00096/abstract|title=The European Union: Pooled Sovereignty, Divided Accountability | doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00096 | volume=45|journal=Political Studies|pages=559â578|first1=John|last1=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNaughton|first1=Neil|title=Understanding British and European political issues : a guide for A2 politics studies|date=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719062454|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMrD6RRoZkQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nation-states ===
A community of people who claim the right of [[self-determination]] based on a common ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a region, thus creating a [[nation-state]]. Such nations are sometimes recognised as [[autonomous area]]s rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.

===Federations===
In a [[federal republic|federal]] [[system of government]], ''sovereignty'' also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government. In a [[confederation]] constituent entities retain the right to withdraw from the national body, but in a federation{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} member states or republics do not hold that right.{{dubious|date=March 2012}}

Different interpretations of [[states' rights|state sovereignty]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], as it related to the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[fugitive slave laws]], led to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Depending on the particular issue, sometimes both northern and southern states justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty. Fearing that slavery would be threatened by results of the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], eleven slave states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new [[Confederate States of America|confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson|McPherson, James]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', (1988) pp. 40, 195, 214, 241&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government rejected the [[secession in the United States|secessions]] as rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was [[unconstitutional]], as the states were part of an indissolvable federation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Acquisition==
{{Main article|Acquisition of sovereignty}}

A number of modes of acquisition of sovereignty are presently or have historically been recognised by international law as lawful methods by which a state may acquire sovereignty over territory. The classification of these modes originally derived from Roman property law and from the 15th and 16th century with the development of international law. The modes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malanczuk|first=Peter|title=Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4doebHRhGT8C&amp;pg=PA147|series=International politics/Public international law|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415111201|pages=147â152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cession''' is the transfer of territory from one state to another usually by means of treaty;
* '''Occupation''' is the acquisition of territory that belongs to no state, or [[terra nullius]];
* '''Prescription''' is the effective control of territory of another acquiescing state;
* '''Operations of nature''' is the acquisition of territory through natural processes like river accretion or volcanism;
* '''Creation''' is the process by which new land is reclaimed from the sea such as in the Netherlands.
* '''Adjudication''' and
* '''Conquest'''

==Justifications==
There exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental polarity is between theories that assert that sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereigns by divine or natural right and theories that assert it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those that assert that the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those that assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the brief period of [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] in Europe, the [[divine right of kings]] was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty. The [[Mandate of Heaven]] had some similar implications in China.

A republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not granted through heritage.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A common modern definition of a republic is a government having a [[head of state]] who is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Democracy is based on the concept of ''[[popular sovereignty]]''. In a [[direct democracy]] the public plays an active role in shaping and deciding policy. [[Representative democracy]] permits a transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a [[legislature|legislative body]] or an executive (or to some combination of legislature, executive and [[Judiciary]]). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy through [[referendum]], [[initiative]], and [[recall election|recall]].

[[Parliamentary sovereignty]] refers to a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign and not the executive power nor the judiciary.

==Views==
* [[Classical liberalism|Classical liberals]] such as [[John Stuart Mill#Liberty|Stuart Mill]] consider every individual as sovereign.
* [[political Realism|Realists]] view sovereignty as being untouchable and as guaranteed to legitimate nation-states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Rationalism (politics)|Rationalists]] see sovereignty similarly to realists. However, rationalism states that the sovereignty of a nation-state may be violated in extreme circumstances, such as human rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalists]] believe that sovereignty is outdated and an unnecessary obstacle to achieving peace, in line with their belief of a 'global community'. In the light of the abuse of power by sovereign states such as Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union, they argue that human beings are not necessarily protected by the state whose citizens they are, and that the respect for state sovereignty on which the UN Charter is founded is an obstacle to humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Heuser: "Sovereignty, self-determination and security: new world orders in the 20th century", in Sohail Hashmi (ed.): ''State Sovereignty: Change and Persistence in International Relations'' (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anarchists and some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] deny the sovereignty of states and governments. Anarchists often argue for a specific individual kind of sovereignty, such as the [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|Anarch as a sovereign individual]]. [[Salvador DalÃ­]], for instance, talked of "anarcho-monarchist" (as usual for him, tongue in cheek); [[Antonin Artaud]] of ''[[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]]: Or, The Crowned Anarchist''; [[Max Stirner]] of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''; [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] of a kind of "antisovereignty". Therefore, anarchists join a classical conception of the individual as sovereign of himself, which forms the basis of [[political consciousness]]. The unified consciousness is sovereignty over one's own body, as [[Nietzsche]] demonstrated (see also [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s book on ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle''). ''See also [[sovereignty of the individual]] and [[self-ownership]]''.
* [[Imperialism|Imperialists]] hold a view of sovereignty where power rightfully exists with those states that hold the greatest ability to impose the will of said state, by force or threat of force, over the populace of other states with weaker military or political will. They effectively deny the sovereignty of the individual in deference to either the 'good' of the whole, or to [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to Matteo Laruffa "sovereignty resides in every public action and policy as the exercise of executive powers by institutions open to the participation of citizens to the decision-making processes"&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to rule of law==
Another topic is whether [[rule of law|the law is held to be sovereign]], that is, whether it is above political or other interference. Sovereign law constitutes a true state of law, meaning the [[letter of the law]] (if constitutionally correct) is applicable and enforceable, even when against the political will of the nation, as long as not formally changed following the constitutional procedure. Strictly speaking, any deviation from this principle constitutes a revolution or a coup d'Ã©tat, regardless of the intentions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Populations can be diverse topics such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;
See [[glossary of probability and statistics]].

When [[census]] data cannot be collected, [[statistician]]s collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey [[sample (statistics)|samples]]. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An [[experimental study]] involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an [[observational study]] does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: [[descriptive statistics]], which summarize data from a sample using [[Index (statistics)|indexes]] such as the [[mean]] or [[standard deviation]], and [[statistical inference|inferential statistics]], which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation).&lt;ref name=LundResearchLtd&gt;{{cite web|last=Lund Research Ltd. |url=https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/descriptive-inferential-statistics.php |title=Descriptive and Inferential Statistics |publisher=statistics.laerd.com |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a ''distribution'' (sample or population): ''[[central tendency]]'' (or ''location'') seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' (or ''variability'') characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on mathematical statistics are made under the framework of [[probability theory]], which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the [[statistical hypothesis testing|test of the relationship]] between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, and this is compared as an [[alternative hypothesis|alternative]] to an idealized [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: [[Type I error]]s (null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive") and [[Type II error]]s (null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Hypothesis Testing Errors?|url = http://statistics.about.com/od/Inferential-Statistics/a/Type-I-And-Type-II-Errors.htm|website = About.com Education|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework: ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic ([[Bias (statistics)|bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

Statistics can be said to have begun in ancient civilization, going back at least to the 5th century BC, but it was not until the 18th century that it started to draw more heavily from [[calculus]] and [[probability theory]]. In more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software to produce tests such as descriptive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.answers.org.za/index.php/tutorials|title= How to Calculate Descriptive Statistics|publisher=Answers Consulting|date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical statistics===
{{Main|Mathematical statistics}}

Mathematical statistics is the application of [[mathematics]] to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear algebra]], [[stochastic analysis]], [[differential equations]], and [[measure-theoretic probability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakshmikantham,|first=ed. by D. Kannan, V.|title=Handbook of stochastic analysis and applications|date=2002|publisher=M. Dekker|location=New York|isbn=0824706609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schervish|first=Mark J.|title=Theory of statistics|date=1995|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0387945466|edition=Corr. 2nd print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In applying statistics to a problem, it is common practice to start with a [[statistical population|population]] or process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all persons living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal".

Ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population (an operation called [[census]]). This may be organized by governmental statistical institutes. ''[[Descriptive statistics]]'' can be used to summarize the population data. Numerical descriptors include [[mean]] and [[standard deviation]] for [[Continuous probability distribution|continuous data]] types (like income), while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing [[categorical data]] (like race).

When a census is not feasible, a chosen subset of the population called a [[sampling (statistics)|sample]] is studied. Once a sample that is representative of the population is determined, data is collected for the sample members in an observational or [[experiment]]al setting. Again, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data. However, the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness, hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty. To still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population, ''[[inferential statistics]]'' is needed. It uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented, accounting for randomness. These inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data ([[hypothesis testing]]), estimating numerical characteristics of the data ([[Estimation theory|estimation]]), describing [[Association (statistics)|associations]] within the data ([[correlation and dependence|correlation]]) and modeling relationships within the data (for example, using [[regression analysis]]).  Inference can extend to [[forecasting]], [[prediction]] and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied; it can include [[extrapolation]] and [[interpolation]] of [[time series]] or [[spatial data analysis|spatial data]], and can also include [[data mining]].

== Data collection ==

===Sampling===
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific [[design of experiments|experiment designs]] and [[survey sampling|survey samples]]. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through [[statistical model]]s. The idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1082|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the [[mathematics|mathematical discipline]] of [[probability theory]]. Probability is used in [[statistical theory|mathematical statistics]] to study the [[sampling distribution]]s of [[sample statistic]]s and, more generally, the properties of [[statistical decision theory|statistical procedures]]. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method.
The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to [[deductive reasoning|deduce]] probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite directionâ[[inductive reasoning|inductively inferring]] from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

===Experimental and observational studies===
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate [[causality]], and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables on dependent variables]]. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: [[Experiment|experimental studies]] and [[Observational study|observational studies]]. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.
An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve [[Scientific control|experimental manipulation]]. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated.
While the tools of data analysis work best on data from [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized studies]], they are also applied to other kinds of dataâlike [[natural experiment]]s and [[Observational study|observational studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David A. Freedman (statistician)|Freedman, D.A.]] (2005) ''Statistical Models: Theory and Practice'', Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-67105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;âfor which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., [[Difference in differences|Difference in differences estimation]] and [[instrumental variable]]s, among many others) that produce [[consistent estimator]]s.

====Experiments====
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:
# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information:  preliminary estimates regarding the size of [[Average treatment effect|treatment effects]], [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], and the estimated [[experimental error|experimental variability]]. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.
# [[Design of experiments]], using [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding variable]]s, and  [[randomized assignment]] of treatments to subjects to allow [[bias of an estimator|unbiased estimates]] of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the ''[[protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]]'' that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the'' primary analysis'' of the experimental data.
# Performing the experiment following the [[Protocol (natural sciences)|experimental protocol]] and [[analysis of variance|analyzing the data]] following the experimental protocol.
# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.
# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous [[Hawthorne study]] examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the [[Western Electric Company]]. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the [[assembly line]] workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a [[control group]] and [[double-blind|blindness]]. The [[Hawthorne effect]] refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.&lt;ref name="pmid17608932"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCarney R, Warner J, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, Fisher P |title=The Hawthorne Effect: a randomised, controlled trial |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=7|pages=30 |year=2007 |pmid=17608932 |pmc=1936999 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-7-30 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observational study====
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a [[cohort study]], and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Rothman|editor1-first=Kenneth J|editor2-last=Greenland|editor2-first=Sander|editor3-last=Lash|editor3-first=Timothy|title=Modern Epidemiology|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|page=100|edition=3rd|language=English|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[case-control study]] is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

== Types of data ==
{{main|Statistical data type||Levels of measurement}}

Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of [[level of measurement|levels of measurement]]. The psychophysicist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with [[longitude]] and [[temperature]] measurements in [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]]), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as [[categorical variable]]s, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|quantitative variables]], which can be either [[Probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] or [[Probability distribution#Continuous probability distribution|continuous]], due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with [[data type]] in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the [[Boolean data type]], polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned [[integer]]s in the [[integer (computer science)|integral data type]], and continuous variables with the [[real data type]] involving [[floating point]] computation. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977)&lt;ref&gt;Mosteller, F., &amp; Tukey, J.W. (1977). ''Data analysis and regression''. Boston: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J.A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23â27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chrisman | first1 = Nicholas R | year = 1998 | title = Rethinking Levels of Measurement for Cartography | url = | journal = Cartography and Geographic Information Science | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 231â242 | doi=10.1559/152304098782383043}}&lt;/ref&gt; van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. "The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer" (Hand, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;82).&lt;ref&gt;Hand, D.J. (2004).

== Terminology and theory of inferential statistics ==

===Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities===
Consider [[Independent identically distributed|independent identically distributed (IID) random variables]] with a given [[probability distribution]]: standard [[statistical inference]] and [[estimation theory]] defines a [[random sample]] as the [[random vector]] given by the [[column vector]] of these IID variables.&lt;ref name=Piazza&gt;Piazza Elio, ProbabilitÃ  e Statistica, Esculapio 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistical population|population]] being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A [[statistic]] is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but ''not a function of unknown parameters''. The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.

Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an [[estimator]] is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include [[Sample mean#Sample mean|sample mean]], unbiased [[sample variance]] and [[Sample covariance#Sample covariance|sample covariance]].

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution ''does not depend on the unknown parameter'' is called a [[pivotal quantity]] or pivot. Widely used pivots include the [[z-score]], the [[Chi-squared distribution#Applications|chi square statistic]] and Student's [[Student's t-distribution#How the t-distribution arises|t-value]].

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower [[mean squared error]] is said to be more [[Efficient estimator|efficient]]. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be [[Unbiased estimator|unbiased]] if its [[expected value]] is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: [[UMVUE]] estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and [[Consistency (statistics)|consistent]] estimators which [[converges in probability]] to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the [[method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]], the [[maximum likelihood]] method, the [[least squares]] method and the more recent method of [[estimating equations]].

===Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis===
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a [[null hypothesis]] which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Everitt | first = Brian | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0521593468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourstatsguru.com/epar/rp-reviewed/cohen1994/|title=Cohen (1994) The Earth Is Round (p &lt; .05) |publisher=YourStatsGuru.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (status quo) stands in opposition to H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is maintained unless H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is supported by evidence "beyond a reasonable doubt". However, "failure to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;" in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily ''accept'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but ''fails to reject'' H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. While one can not "prove" a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a [[Statistical power|power test]], which tests for type II errors.

What [[statisticians]] call an [[alternative hypothesis]] is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the [[null hypothesis]].

===Error===
Working from a [[null hypothesis]], two basic forms of error are recognized:
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|Type I errors]] where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected giving a "false positive".
* [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|Type II errors]] where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed giving a "false negative".

[[Standard deviation]] refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while [[Standard error (statistics)#Standard error of the mean|Standard error]] refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|statistical error]] is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], a [[Errors and residuals in statistics#Introduction|residual]] is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

[[Mean squared error]] is used for obtaining [[efficient estimators]], a widely used class of estimators. [[Root mean square error]] is simply the square root of mean squared error.

[[File:Linear least squares(2).svg|thumb|right|A least squares fit: in red the points to be fitted, in blue the fitted line.]]

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the [[residual sum of squares]], and these are called "[[least squares|methods of least squares]]" in contrast to [[Least absolute deviations]]. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], which provides a handy property for doing [[regression analysis|regression]]. Least squares applied to [[linear regression]] is called [[ordinary least squares]] method and least squares applied to [[nonlinear regression]] is called [[non-linear least squares]]. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in [[polynomial least squares]], which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error.  Many of these errors are classified as [[Random error|random]] (noise) or [[Systematic error|systematic]] ([[bias]]), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of [[missing data]] or [[censoring (statistics)|censoring]] may result in [[bias (statistics)|biased estimates]] and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Donald B.; Little, Roderick J.A., Statistical analysis with missing data, New York: Wiley 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interval estimation===
{{main|Interval estimation}}

[[File:NYW-confidence-interval.svg|thumb|right|[[Confidence intervals]]: the red line is true value for the mean in this example, the blue lines are random confidence intervals for 100 realizations.]]

Most studies only sample part of a population, so results don't fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. [[Confidence intervals]] allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does ''not'' imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the [[frequentist inference|frequentist]] perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a [[random variable]].  Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed [[random variable]]s. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a [[credible interval]] from [[Bayesian statistics]]: this approach depends on a different way of [[Probability interpretations|interpreting what is meant by "probability"]], that is as a [[Bayesian probability]].

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

===Significance===
{{main|Statistical significance}}

Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the [[p-value]]).

[[File:P-value in statistical significance testing.svg|upright=1.8|thumb|right|In this graph the black line is probability distribution for the [[test statistic]], the [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values to the right of the observed data point (observed value of the test statistic) and the [[p-value]] is represented by the green area.]]

The standard approach&lt;ref name="Piazza"/&gt; is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A [[Critical region#Definition of terms|critical region]] is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true ([[statistical significance]]) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The [[statistical power]] of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of [[statistical significance]] may be subject to debate, the [[p-value]] is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the [[test statistic]]. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|criticism of hypothesis testing]]):
* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the [[significance level]] to include the [[p-value|''p''-value]] when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the [[effect size|size]] or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report [[confidence interval]]s. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or ''p''-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka [[prosecutor's fallacy]]: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the [[null hypothesis]]) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by [[Bayesian inference]], although it requires establishing a [[prior probability]].&lt;ref name=Ioannidis2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = J.P.A. | authorlink1 = John P.A.

* Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis.
* As everything in [[inferential statistics]] it relies on sample size, and therefore under [[fat tails]] p-values may be seriously mis-computed.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

== Misuse ==
{{main|Misuse of statistics}}

[[Misuse of statistics]] can produce subtle, but serious errors in description and interpretationâsubtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The [[statistical significance]] of a trend in the dataâwhich measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sampleâmay or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as [[statistical literacy]].

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally [[Misuse of statistics|misused]] by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter.&lt;ref name=Huff&gt;Huff, Darrell (1954) ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]'',  WW Norton &amp; Company, Inc. New York.  {{isbn|0-393-31072-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A  mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, "[[Lies, damned lies, and statistics|There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics]]". Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book ''[[How to Lie with Statistics]]''&lt;ref name=Huff/&gt; outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warne | first1 = R. Lazo | last2 = Ramos | first2 = T. | last3 = Ritter | first3 = N. | year = 2012 | title = Statistical Methods Used in Gifted Education Journals, 2006â2010 | url = | journal = Gifted Child Quarterly | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 134â149 | doi = 10.1177/0016986212444122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding [[Bias (statistics)|bias]].&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Statistics in archaeology | pages = 2093â2100 | first1 = Robert D. | last1 = Drennan | title =  Encyclopedia of Archaeology | year = 2008 | publisher = Elsevier Inc. | editor-first = Deborah M. | editor-last = Pearsall | isbn = 978-0-12-373962-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Misuse can occur when conclusions are [[Hasty generalization|overgeneralized]] and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias.&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jerome B. |title=Misuse of Statistics |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |date=December 1938 |volume=33 |issue=204 |pages=657â674 |location=JSTOR |doi=10.1080/01621459.1938.10502344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs.&lt;ref name="Statistics in Archaeology" /&gt; Unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well [[Sampling (statistics)|represented]].&lt;ref name="Misuse of Statistics" /&gt; To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole.&lt;ref name="Modern Elementary Statistics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freund|first=J.E.|authorlink = John E. Freund|title=Modern Elementary Statistics|journal=Credo Reference|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Huff, "The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huff|first=Darrell|title=How to Lie with Statistics|year=1954|publisher=Norton|location=New York|author2=Irving Geis |quote=The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:&lt;ref name="How to Lie with Statistics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Huff |first=Darrell |title=How to Lie with Statistics |year=1954 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |author2=Irving Geis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simple Confounding Case.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|The [[confounding variable]] problem: ''X'' and ''Y'' may be correlated, not because there is causal relationship between them, but because both depend on a third variable ''Z''. ''Z'' is called a confounding factor.]]

===Misinterpretation: correlation===
The concept of [[correlation]] is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a [[data set]] often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or [[confounding variable]]. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables. (See [[Correlation does not imply causation]].)

== History of statistical science ==

[[File:JerÃ´me Cardan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Gerolamo Cardano]], the earliest pioneer on the mathematics of probability.]]

{{main|History of statistics|Founders of statistics}}

Some scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1663, with the publication of ''Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality'' by [[John Graunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Willcox, Walter (1938) "The Founder of Statistics". ''Review of the [[International Statistical Institute]]'' 5(4): 321â328. {{jstor|1400906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its [[History of statistics#Etymology|''stat-'' etymology]]. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of the [[probability theory]] by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Mathematical [[probability theory]] arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in [[Medieval Roman law|medieval law]] and by philosophers such as [[Juan Caramuel]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability before Pascal, Johns Hopkins Univ Pr 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[method of least squares]] was first described by  [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805.

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1910.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[Karl Pearson]], a founder of mathematical statistics.]]

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYFRAAAAMAAJ|title=Studies in the history of statistical method|author=Helen Mary Walker|year=1975|publisher=Arno Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of [[Francis Galton]] and [[Karl Pearson]], who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of [[standard deviation]], [[correlation]], [[regression analysis]] and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristicsâheight, weight, eyelash length among others.&lt;ref name=Galton1877&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = F | year = 1877 | title = Typical laws of heredity | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 15 | issue = 388| pages = 492â553 | doi=10.1038/015492a0| bibcode = 1877Natur..15..492. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearson developed the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]], defined as a product-moment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1214/ss/1177012580 | last1 = Stigler | first1 = S.M. | year = 1989 | title = Francis Galton's Account of the Invention of Correlation | url = | journal = Statistical Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 73â79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Method of moments (statistics)|method of moments]] for the fitting of distributions to samples and the [[Pearson distribution]], among many other things.&lt;ref name="Pearson, On the criterion"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pearson|first1=K.|year=1900|title=On the Criterion that a given System of Deviations from the Probable in the Case of a Correlated System of Variables is such that it can be reasonably supposed to have arisen from Random Sampling|url=|journal=Philosophical Magazine |series=Series 5|volume=50|issue=302|pages=157â175|doi=10.1080/14786440009463897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton and Pearson founded ''[[Biometrika]]'' as the first journal of mathematical statistics and [[biostatistics]] (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=|title=Karl Pearson (1857â1936)|publisher=Department of Statistical Science&amp;nbsp;â [[University College London]]|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/stats/department/pearson.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925065418/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/stats/department/pearson.html|archivedate=2008-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Fisher]] coined the term [[null hypothesis]] during the [[Lady tasting tea]] experiment, which "is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher|1971|loc=Chapter II. The Principles of Experimentation, Illustrated by a Psycho-physical Experiment, Section 8. The Null Hypothesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;OED quote: '''1935''' R.A. Fisher, ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'' ii. 19, "We may speak of this hypothesis as the 'null hypothesis', and the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by [[William Gosset]], and reached its culmination in the insights of [[Ronald Fisher]], who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher's most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper ''[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]'', which was the first to use the statistical term, [[variance]], his classic 1925 work ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]'' and his 1935 ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/00028312003003223 | title = The Influence of Fisher's "The Design of Experiments" on Educational Research Thirty Years Later | year = 1966 | author = Stanley, J.C. | journal = American Educational Research Journal | volume = 3 | pages = 223 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Box, JF | title = R.A.

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between [[Egon Pearson]] and [[Jerzy Neyman]] in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of "[[Type I and type II errors|Type II]]" error, power of a test and [[confidence interval]]s. [[Jerzy Neyman]] in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neyman | first1 = J | year = 1934 | title = On the two different aspects of the representative method: The method of stratified sampling and the method of purposive selection | url = | journal = [[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]] | volume = 97 | issue = 4| pages = 557â625 | jstor=2342192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern [[computer]]s has expedited large-scale statistical computations, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze [[Big data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafe.edu/news/item/sfnm-wood-big-data/|title=Science in a Complex World â Big Data: Opportunity or Threat?|work=Santa Fe Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

===Applied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics===
''Applied statistics'' comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoletseas, M.M. (2014) "Statistics: Concepts and Examples." {{isbn|978-1500815684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, D.R.; Sweeney, D.J.; Williams, T.A. (1994) ''Introduction to Statistics: Concepts and Applications'', pp. 5â9. West Group. {{isbn|978-0-314-03309-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theoretical statistics'' concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to [[statistical inference]], as well as encompassing ''mathematical statistics''. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of [[probability distribution]]s necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of [[computational statistics]] and the [[design of experiments]].

===Machine learning and data mining===
There are two applications for [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]: data management and data analysis.  Statistics tools are necessary for the data analysis.

===Statistics in society===
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of [[academic discipline]]s, including [[natural]] and [[social science]]s, government, and business. [[Statistical consultant]]s can help organizations and companies that don't have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.

===Statistical computing===

[[File:Gretl screenshot.png|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[gretl]], an example of an [[List of open source statistical packages|open source statistical package]]]]

{{main|Computational statistics}}

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of [[linear model]]s, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical [[algorithms]], caused an increased interest in [[Nonlinear regression|nonlinear models]] (such as [[neural networks]]) as well as the creation of new types, such as [[generalized linear model]]s and [[multilevel model]]s.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]], such as permutation tests and the [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]], while techniques such as [[Gibbs sampling]] have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with new emphasis on "experimental" and "empirical" statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose [[List of statistical packages|statistical software]] are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as [[Mathematica]],  [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], and  [[R (programming language)|R]].

===Statistics applied to mathematics or the arts===
Traditionally, statistics was concerned with drawing inferences using a semi-standardized methodology that was "required learning" in most sciences.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This tradition has changed with use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. What was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically.{{according to whom|date=April 2014}} Initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.
* In [[number theory]], [[scatter plot]]s of data generated by a distribution function may be transformed with familiar tools used in statistics to reveal underlying patterns, which may then lead to hypotheses.
* Methods of statistics including predictive methods in [[forecasting]] are combined with [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]] to create video works that are considered to have great beauty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The [[process art]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] relied on artistic experiments whereby underlying distributions in nature were artistically revealed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With the advent of computers, statistical methods were applied to formalize such distribution-driven natural processes to make and analyze moving video art.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* Methods of statistics may be used predicatively in [[performance art]], as in a card trick based on a [[Markov process]] that only works some of the time, the occasion of which can be predicted using statistical methodology.
* Statistics can be used to predicatively create art, as in the statistical or [[stochastic music]] invented by [[Iannis Xenakis]], where the music is performance-specific. Though this type of artistry does not always come out as expected, it does behave in ways that are predictable and tunable using statistics.

== Specialized disciplines ==
{{main|List of fields of application of statistics}}

Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: [[biostatistics]],  [[computational biology]],  [[computational sociology]],  [[network biology]],  [[social science]],  [[sociology]] and  [[social research]]. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have [[specialized terminology]]. These disciplines include:

{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Actuarial science]] (assesses risk in the insurance and finance industries)
* [[Applied information economics]]
* [[Astrostatistics]] (statistical evaluation of astronomical data)
* [[Biostatistics]]
* [[Business statistics]]
* [[Chemometrics]] (for analysis of data from [[chemistry]])
* [[Data mining]] (applying statistics and [[pattern recognition]] to discover knowledge from data)
* [[Data science]]
* [[Demography]] (statistical study of populations)
* [[Econometrics]] (statistical analysis of economic data)
* [[E-statistics|Energy statistics]]
* [[Engineering statistics]]
* [[Epidemiology]] (statistical analysis of disease)
* [[Geography]] and [[geographic information system]]s, specifically in [[spatial analysis]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Medical statistics]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Psychological statistics]]
* [[Reliability engineering]]
* [[Social statistics]]
* [[Statistical mechanics]]
}}

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|Bootstrap]]{{\}}[[Resampling (statistics)|Jackknife resampling]]
* [[Multivariate statistics]]
* [[Statistical classification]]
* [[Structured data analysis (statistics)]]
* [[Structural equation modelling]]
* [[Survey methodology]]
* [[Survival analysis]]
* Statistics in various sports, particularly [[Baseball statistics|baseball]] â known as  [[Sabermetrics]] â and [[Cricket statistics|cricket]]
}}

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in [[statistical process control]] or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. In these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, BirkhÃ¤user (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonti|first1=Enzo|title=The Reason for Analogies in Physics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtOy8xKN-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term âglobal variablesâ is preferred to that of "integral variables".

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own âconfigurationâ, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term "space elements" we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term "time elements" we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a [[mechanical equilibrium]] to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

[[File:Ritaaa.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Left'') A two-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

[[File:Greta copia.png|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. ''Left'') A three-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function Ï (t) is defined as ÎÏ = + Ï (t + h)-Ï (t),  in order to conceive the "+" and "-" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as "sinks".

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

==The birth of the classification diagram &lt;ref&gt;Diagrams of the various physical theories can be downloaded from the website http://www.discretephysics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ==

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variablesâcontained in the horizontal linksâare ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb|'''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb|'''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.

A '''two-vector''' is a [[tensor]] of type (2,0) and it is the [[dual space|dual]] of a [[two-form]], meaning that it is a linear functional which maps two-forms to the real numbers (or more generally, to scalars).

The [[tensor product]] of a pair of [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s is a two-vector.  Then, any two-form can be expressed as a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of vectors, especially a linear combination of tensor products of pairs of basis vectors.  If '''f''' is a two-vector, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} = f^{\alpha \beta} \, \vec e_\alpha \otimes \vec e_\beta &lt;/math&gt;
where the ''f &lt;sup&gt;Î± Î²&lt;/sup&gt;'' are the components of the two-vector.  Notice that both indices of the components are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]].  This is always the case for two-vectors, by definition.

An example of a two-vector is the inverse ''g&lt;sup&gt;Î¼ Î½&lt;/sup&gt;'' of the [[metric tensor]].

The components of  a two-vector may be represented in a matrix-like array.  However, a two-vector, as a tensor, should not be confused with a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], since a matrix is a linear function
:&lt;math&gt; M : V \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;
which [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] vectors to vectors, whereas a two-vector is a linear functional
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} : \tilde{V} \rightarrow V &lt;/math&gt;
which maps [[one-form]]s to vectors.  In this sense, a matrix, considered as a tensor, is a [[mixed tensor]] of type (1,1) even though of the same rank as a two-vector.

'''WorldWinner''' is a cross-platform, skill-based games community that operates competitive cash tournaments for web, mobile web, and mobile ([[iOS]]) platforms. Games include Solitaire Rush, Wheel of FortuneÂ®, SCRABBLE Cubes, and TetrisÂ® Burst. In 2018, WorldWinner launched Angry Birds Champions, the official cash tournament version of [[Rovio Entertainment]]'s Angry Birds.

WorldWinner is based in Boston, MA and operates under the [[Game Show Network]]âs GSN Games division.

== History ==
Worldwinner was founded in 1999 in Newton, Massachusetts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/WorldWinner.com+Launches+Online+Gaming+Site+that+Rewards+Skilled...-a064329455|title=WorldWinner.com Launches Online Gaming Site that Rewards Skilled Players with Cash Prizes; New Gaming Destination Brings the Thrill of Competition to Familiar Games. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Alex Bloom (formerly Saidakovsky), Alex Ganelis, and Daniil Utin, raising over $17 million from leading venture capital firms, including HarbourVest Partners and Benchmark Capital.

WorldWinner launched on August 17, 2000 as the first online gaming destination allowing participants to compete in skill-based tournaments for real-money winnings. The company established partnerships with leading casual games sites, including Yahoo!, EA, Pogo, iWon, PAX TV, WildTangent, and Shockwave. By 2002, WorldWinner was hosting more than two million tournaments per month, with more than $100,000 in daily cash winnings.

From 2000 to 2004, WorldWinner reported a revenue increase of 2,386 percent, earning the number six spot on the Technology Fast 50 for New England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worldwinner-ranks-sixth-on-deloittes-technology-fast-50-list-55240512.html|title=WorldWinner Ranks Sixth on Deloitte's Technology Fast 50 List|last=Inc.|first=WorldWinner,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, Saidakovsky, Ganelis, and Utin obtained a patent for their tournament technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pimg-faiw.uspto.gov/fdd/79/2002/53/005/0.pdf|title=Minimizing the effects of chance, US Patent|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, WorldWinner had over 14 million registered players worldwide, hosting more than four million tournaments and awarding millions of dollars in prizes every month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worldwinner-explodes-in-2004-with-record-revenues-54063537.html|title=WorldWinner Explodes in 2004 with Record Revenues|last=Inc.|first=WorldWinner,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, WorldWinner was acquired by [[FUN Technologies]] and merged with SkillJam into WorldWinner, dropping the SkillJam brand.

In December 2007, [[Liberty Media]] acquired FUN Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ir.libertymedia.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=576103|title=Liberty Media Corporation Completes Acquisition of FUN Technologies Inc.|access-date=2018-01-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a transaction valuing the company at $484 million. As a result of the acquisition, WorldWinner integrated with the Liberty-owned Game Show Network, and FUN Technologies was discontinued as a brand. WorldWinner rebranded to GSN Cash Games in 2013. The company also launched its mobile web offering (GSN Cash Games Mobile) in 2014, allowing players to compete in cash tournaments on mobile devices.

In 2017, GSN Cash Games re-branded back to WorldWinner, simultaneously launching a cash tournament version of Solitaire TriPeaks, based on the Solitaire TriPeaks app by GSN Games.

In July 2017, WorldWinner launched its iOS app, followed by Android in May 2018.

As of June 2018, WorldWinner is no longer available in the [[European Union|EU]].

== Cash tournament model ==
WorldWinner hosts different types of cash tournaments with varying player pools, prize pools, entry fees, and difficulty level. Players are matched with other players of similar skill. Unlike gambling games that, from a legal standpoint, feature the elements of chance, prize, and consideration, WorldWinner games are modified so that player skill (as opposed to chance or luck) is the predominant factor in performance and winnings.

WorldWinner also offers free Warm-Up tournaments.

== Games ==
WorldWinnerâs portfolio includes online and mobile games based on popular [[card game]]s, [[Puzzle Game|puzzle games]], [[word game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[Game show|TV game show games]], arcade games, and match-three games.
