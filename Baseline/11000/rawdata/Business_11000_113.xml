'''Aarhus Symposium''' is an annual leadership conference taking place at the [[Aarhus University|University of Aarhus]], [[Denmark]], on the first Friday in November. The aim of the event is to connect leaders of today with leaders of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; To do so, a wide range of key decision-makers are invited to share their experiences and engage in discussions with students from various universities. Hereby, the symposium allows students to relate their academic insights to the broader business society.&lt;ref&gt;http://studerende.au.dk/nyheder-og-arrangementer/nyhedsarkiv/nyhed/artikel/danske-topledere-ruster-au-studerende-til-barsk-virkelighed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium was founded in 2011 and has since expanded its concept to also involve [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Focus|Aarhus Symposium Focus]]&lt;ref name="Faglig"&gt;http://www.netvaerksportalen.dk/artikler/studerende-og-topledere-moedes-i-faglig-debat-aarhus-symposium&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aarhus Symposium#Aarhus Symposium Challenge|Aarhus Symposium Challenge]].&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97854/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium is a non-profit organisation, and all symposia are organised by voluntary students together with a pro-bono board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/erhverv/ECE7183981/Leder-event-udsolgt-p%C3%A5-90-sekunder/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/become-a-partner/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Four students at [[Aarhus University]] established Aarhus Symposium in 2011: David Scherer, Jens Riis Andersen, Kasper Vinther Olesen, and Andreas Emmertsen. They gathered support from other students to organise the very first Aarhus Symposium with the objective of building a bridge between students, i.e. the future leaders, and leaders in today’s businesses and society.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/12/3184822/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://stiften.dk/aarhus/Erhvervslivets-tunge-drenge-yder-studiehjaelp/artikel/92572&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual Aarhus Symposium welcomed renowned speakers from the business society such as Carsten Bjerg (then CEO of [[Grundfos]]), Lars Rohde (then CEO of [[Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension|ATP]]), and Maria Rønn (CEO of [[DR (broadcaster)|Danmarks Radio]]).&lt;ref name="Growth"&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/past-symposia/growth-in-distressed-economies/&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the years, the programme has extended to include prominent speakers such as [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|His Royal Highness The Crown Prince of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;http://kongehuset.dk/menu/nyheder/abning-af-aarhus-symposium-2014&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Rebien Sørensen (president and CEO of [[Novo Nordisk]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://jyllands-posten.dk/aarhus/ECE8162162/Studerende-har-hyret-verdens-bedste-chef/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://jyskebank.tv/nutidens-og-fremtidens-ledere-modes-til-aarhus&lt;/ref&gt;

Aarhus Symposium has grown through the years as a result of wide support from students, speakers, partners, and others.&lt;ref name="Faglig"/&gt; In 2012, the Organising Committee introduced Battle of the Economists; an event to take place on Monday in the week of Aarhus Symposium. It provided a national focus to the overall theme of Aarhus Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/63904/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was renamed Aarhus Symposium Focus in 2016 to broaden the possibilities for topics that exceed economic issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/aarhussymposium/docs/booklet2016_final_rgb&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Aarhus Symposium Challenge was established to strengthen the connection between students and the leaders of today.&lt;ref name="Challenge"/&gt; Aarhus Symposium Challenge is an essay competition in which selected speakers put forth a challenge for students to solve. Through their essay, students obtain a seat at both Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus, and they potentially qualify for [[Aarhus Symposium#Leaders' Forum|Leaders’ Forum]]. Since its initiation in 2013, an increasing number of students have participated in Aarhus Symposium Challenge, making it the primary sign-up for Aarhus Symposium and Aarhus Symposium Focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/aarhus-symposium-challenge/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaders' Forum ===
[[File:ASForum.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders’ Forum session with Connie Hedegaard at Aarhus Symposium 2015.]]
Leaders’ Forum is an exclusive and intimate session where selected students discuss their essay contribution with the leader that put forth the respective challenge. Only the best essay contributions under each challenge topic qualifies for this informal session.&lt;ref&gt;http://aarhus-symposium.org/challenge-faq/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the years, Leaders’ Forum has attracted much attention from the media inasmuch as it is unique in a Danish context and provides both the attending students and the top leaders the opportunity to learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/97871/artikel.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business.dk/digital/jimmy-maymann-det-nytter-ikke-at-ville-holde-fremskridtet-tilbage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Adolf Seebold''' (1873–1951) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] impresario who commissioned and ran the [[Dome Cinema]] in the English coastal town of [[Worthing]] in [[West Sussex]].

Swiss-born Seebold was the son of a rope manufacturer from [[Zürich]].&lt;ref name="SWDome"/&gt; The father fell on hard times and turned to entertainment, playing the guitar and singing, to support a large family of nine sons and four daughters.&lt;ref name="SWDome"/&gt;  A violinist, Seebold became leader of his family's Swiss band, the [[Chamonix|Chamounix]] Orchestra in 1897.&lt;ref name="MEW"&gt;Elleray, D. Robert (1998). A Millennium Encyclopaedia of Worthing History. Worthing: Optimus Books. {{ISBN|0-9533132-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orchestra toured widely and were invited to play before many of the royal households of Europe.&lt;ref name="SWDome"/&gt;  They were invited to England by Sir [[Alfred Butt]], appearing at [[The Crystal Palace]], [[Queen's Hall]] and various resorts, including Worthing.&lt;ref name="MEW"/&gt;

Between 1900 and 1903, Seebold and his family had been lessees at [[Southend Pier]].&lt;ref name="MEW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SOOT"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2003/2/19/140052.html/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070813052636/http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2003/2/19/140052.html/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 August 2007 |title=Signs of Our Times |date=19 February 2003 |publisher=The Argus newspaper |accessdate=9 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1904, Seebold settled in Worthing, and was the proprietor of the town's New Theatre Royal in Bath Place.&lt;ref name="SWDome"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worthingdomecinema.com/key.php#1/|title=The Saving of Worthing Dome|date=2005–2008|publisher=Worthing Dome Cinema|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEW"/&gt;  He lived at Bedford House, on the town's seafront.  In 1909 Seebold built the entertainment centre known as the ''Kursaal'' (later the Dome) in the lawns of Bedford House.&lt;ref name="MEW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worthingdome.com/history.html|title=History of The Worthing Dome|website=www.worthingdome.com|access-date=2017-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210050054/http://worthingdome.com/history.html|archivedate=10 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seebold later moved out of Bedford House to 52 Richmond Road in Worthing.&lt;ref name="MEW"/&gt;

In 1924, Seebold opened the Rivoli cinema, also in [[Worthing]] and in 1926 he acquired a rival cinema, the [[Connaught Theatre|Picturedrome]].&lt;ref name="VCH18225"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pp105-108|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1: Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

She is currently serving as the honorary chairman of [[Dusit Thani Group]].

== Life and career ==
Thanpuying Chanut was born in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. Her father was a businessman who owned a saw mill in [[Bangkok]] and her mother ran a rice mill outside the city.
&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=Louise|title=Wives, Mistresses, and Matriarchs: Asian Women Today|date=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|isbn=9780810875258|edition=|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=s-9JXFpAHAYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Khunying+Chanut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A9U0eAx2YE&amp;sig=SGoa8PdIwPwPe3DmVQcGJUhJkow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Khunying%20Chanut&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|124}} In 1946, Thanpuying Chanut went to the United States hoping to attend [[Columbia University]]. Having been unsuccessful in her attempt to gain entrance due to her level of English, she was sent to an English school in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=IRON BUTTERFLIES: These powerful Asian businesswomen break down barriers with charm rather than militancy. Many were born to wealth, but don't underestimate their ambition. |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1991/10/07/75553/index.htm |publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 7, 1991|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After completing her studies, she traveled around the country, becoming fascinated with the hotels she visited and their modern facilities and quality of service.

Upon returning home in 1947, she aspired to build a hotel that would be like the ones she had visited in the US, but with a distinctively Thai touch. In 1948, Thanpuying Chanut opened her first hotel, the "Princess" on Bangkok's New Road.&lt;ref name="firstlady"/&gt; It had only 30 rooms but had the distinction of being the first modern hotel in Bangkok with a swimming pool. The hotel was the accommodation of choice for the flight crews of [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]] (Pan Am) for several years.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;{{RP|125}} 

At the time, Thanpuying Chanut took an opportunity to join Pan Am's "80 Days Around the World" program in order to see the world. The trip helped her to get valuable information and insights in the hotel trade that she could incorporate into her own business as a means of improving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Why shouldn't I be the one to build it?'|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/-why-shouldn-t-i-be-one-build-it--197075.html|publisher=|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Thanpuying Chanut founded the luxury Dusit Thani Hotel near [[Lumphini Park]] and became the flagship business for the Dusit Group. It was the first luxury hotel in Bangkok and quickly achieved widespread popularity among locals and foreigners. The 510-room hotel was the tallest building in Bangkok for several years. The Dusit Thani was one of the Thai hotels that attracted foreign visitors and helped tourism overtake rice exports as the leading source of income in 1983.{{CN|date=August 2017}}

Since the formation of Dusit Thani Group, Thanpuying Chanut served as the managing director and advisor to the board of the directors. In 1987 she acquired a hotel which was renovated to become the first resort property, Dusit Thani Pattaya, followed by another beach resort in [[Phuket]] - Dusit Thani Laguna Phuket. In 1989, a polo club and resort was opened in [[Cha-am]]. In the 1990s, four more luxury resorts and hotels, Royal Princess Chiang Mai and Dusit Island Resort Chiang Rai, Dusit Princess Korat and Dusit Princess Srinakarin Hotel opened in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Background|website=Dusit International|url=http://dtc.listedcompany.com/company_background.html|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, she had a major conflict with the building of a 243-km new Metropolitan Rapid Transit subway system, which passed near the Dusit Thani Hotel and needed access to some of its valuable land that was used for parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Threat Underground - Will Bangkok's venerable Dusit Thani close? |url=http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/97/0502/biz5.html |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=November 30, 2000|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanpuying Chanut made the first International expansion of Dusit Brand in 1995 with the acquisition of Dusit Hotel Nikko Manila in the [[Philippines]]. After the acquisition the hotel came under the management of Dusit Thani Hotels &amp; Resorts, and was renamed the Dusit Hotel Nikko, Manila. Continuing the expansion, the group opened its first property in the Middle East in 2001 in [[Dubai]], later entered [[India]], [[China]], [[United States]] and the [[Maldives]].

In 2001, Thanpuying Chanut introduced Devarana Spa which is now operating in 10 Dusit properties as its own signature.&lt;ref name="firstlady"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's First Lady of Hospitality|url=http://tourism-insider.com/en/2009/10/die-first-lady-der-thailaendischen-hotelbranche/|publisher=Tourism Insider|date=October 25, 2009|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Dusit Thani Guam opens new Devarana Spa and Soi restaurant  |url=http://www.incentivetravel.co.uk/news/hotel/29836-dusit-thani-guam-opens-new-devarana-spa-and-soi-restaurant|publisher=|date=November 11, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanpuying Chanut's leading hotel chain, has grown both in Thailand and internationally. The group now operates 13 hotels and resorts across Thailand and 18 properties around the world under five hotel brands: Dusit Thani Hotels &amp; Resorts, dusitD2 Hotels and Resorts, Dusit Princess Hotel and Resorts, Dusit Devarana Hotels and Resorts, and Dusit Residence Serviced Apartments.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Update: Dusit International|url=http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/21295-company-update-dusit-international/1/|publisher=Hotelier Middle East|date=August 25, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Thanpuying Chanut established [[Dusit Thani College]] in order to support Dusit International's expansion by providing hotel vocational training in Thailand. The Dusit group now has two hotels schools in Thailand offering bachelor's degrees of business administration in kitchen and restaurant management. It also has a culinary school, a joint venture with [[Le Cordon Bleu]] opened in 2007.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news| title='School with no paper' opens door to hotel jobs for Thailand's youth |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/09/travel/road-to-asean-thailand/ |publisher=[[CNN]]|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Dusit Thani College initiated a program with Lyceum University in the Philippines which opened in June 2009 with over 4,000 enrolled. A new hospitality school with fully integrated hotel is set to open in [[Manila]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dusit launches innovative hospitality school with fully integrated hotel in Manila |url=http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4075476.html |publisher=Hospitality Net|date=April 15, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Thanpuying Chanut retired from the position of managing director, handing it over to her son, Chanin Donavanik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Thailand Dusit on expansion drive in Middle East region |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/story/386742/Thailand-Dusit-on-expansion-drive-in-Middle-East-r |publisher=Gulf Times|date=April 1, 2014|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently serving as the honorary chairperson of Dusit Thani Group.

== Awards and recognition ==
For her great achievement in Thai hospitality industry, Chanut received the title "Thanpuying" which is the highest royal decoration of Thailand. She holds an honorary degree of Doctor of Business Administration in Hospitality Management awarded by [[Johnson &amp; Wales University]], an honorary degree of Doctor in Tourism and Hotel from [[Sripatum University]] and another honorary degree of Doctor of Arts in Tourism Industrial from [[Mahidol University]].

==Family and early life==

Conrad Penny was born on 31 May 1951 in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], the son of Errol Penny and Nina Hartdegen, Grandson of Magnus Penny and Elizabeth le Sueur,  Great-Grandson of [[Herbert Penny]] (founder of the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in the Cape which ultimately led to the formation of the [[South African Navy]]) and Carlotta Forssman (daughter of Chevalier Oscar Wilhelm Alric Forssman).  His mother was a granddaughter of Cuninghame Wilson Moore, the older brother of Sir Archibald [[Gordon Moore (Royal Navy officer)|Gordon Moore]], [[Admiral of the Fleet]].  In March 2015 he attended the reinterment of King [[Richard III of England]] as a guest of [[Leicester University]] and [[Leicester Cathedral]].  In addition to Penny's royal descent&lt;ref name = "ConradGenealogy1"&gt;http://www.thepeerage.com/p50976.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, Professor [[Kevin Sch%C3%BCrer]]&lt;ref name = "ConradGenealogy"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/25/richard-iii-battle-of-bosworth-descendants-meet-for-kings-reburial&lt;/ref&gt;  identified and recognised Penny as a descendant of at least ten other Lords, Knights and soldiers at the 1485 [[Battle of Bosworth]] where [[Richard III]] lost his life.

He was educated at [[St Stithians College]] (1964–65) and Hyde Park High School (1966–68) in [[Johannesburg]]. Penny was privately educated "in house" at Penny Brothers between 1970 and 1973 where Town Planner Professor EWN Mallows, Quantity Surveyor and Civil Engineer ACM Tyrrell, Company/Property Lawyer PJP Neall and Company/Tax Account AE Hirsowitz were put at his disposal for his tertiary education.  He later passed the Valuer’s Exam set by [http://www.sacpvp.co.za/ The South African Council for the Property Valuers Profession].  Penny married Baroness Maria-Therésia Kotz von Dobrz in [[Austria]] on 7 January 1978 and together they have two sons and two daughters.

==Career==

In 1996 Penny's company, Penny Brothers Brokers &amp; Valuers (Pty) Ltd., was awarded tenders for the valuation of the whole of [[Soweto]], in [[Johannesburg]], which valuation included over 325 000 dwellings. The tenders were awarded by the [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]] for taxing and rating purposes. This was the single largest valuation ever undertaken in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="SowetoPenny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pennybrothers.co.za/soweto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726060224/http://pennybrothers.co.za/soweto.html |archivedate=2013-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penny is a member of the [http://www.ieasa.co.za/ Institute of Estate Agents of South Africa Website], a member of the [http://www.saiv.org.za/ South African Institute of Valuers Website], Appraiser to the Hon. [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|South African Minister of Justice]] and is registered as a Professional Valuer with the [http://www.sacpvp.co.za/ South African Council for the Property Valuers Profession Website].   Given his interest in anthropology and paleontology, he is also a member of the [[Royal Society of South Africa]]. 

He is the owner of [https://www.chartwellcastle.co.za/maze.html Chartwell Castle] in north western [[Johannesburg]], where he laid out the largest permanent hedgerow [[Maze#South_Africa|Maze]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

==Philanthrophy and Civic Work==
 
'''Trees''' - Penny has also propagated approximately 7000 trees at Chartwell Castle which have been donated to the streets, pavements, parks, schools and Places of Worship and Refuge mainly within the [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]].

'''Chartwell Local Area Committee''' - In around 1988, Penny as Chairman of the Farmall and Farmall Ext. 1 Landowners Association, assisted in the creation of The Greater Chartwell Local Area Committee, in what was then the outlying regions of northern [[Johannesburg]].  The merger of the surrounding areas resulted in a rate based income being viable to afford the region with tarred roads along arterial routes and the provision of municipal water supply.  Consequently the sub-division of land became possible and the region has since been incorporated into the [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality]].

'''Rand Club''' - In 2016, Conrad Penny initiated the formation of the Rand Club Salvage Consortium (RCSC) which successfully resuscitated the historic (1887) [[Rand Club of Johannesburg]] (and its fine Edwardian building) after it had been mothballed because of a decline in membership following a general exodus from the old [[Johannesburg CBD|CBD]] of Johannesburg.

The '''Consumer Guidance Society of India''' (CGSI) is a Non-Profit consumer organization established in [[India]] in 1966 to protect and educate the Indian consumer about sub-standard products and services, adulterated foods, short weights and measures, spurious and hazardous drugs, exorbitant prices, endemic shortages leading to black marketing and profiteering, unfulfilled manufacture guarantees, and a host of other problems.

==History==
Since independence, India has been striving to develop and strengthen its industrial base. However, in this pursuit of “self-sufficiency,” exploitation of consumers by manufacturers and service providers became rampant in India. In the 1960s, only a few monopolistic business houses controlled industry. In one infamous case, forty persons suffered [[dropsy]] and [[glaucoma]] after consuming [[groundnut oil]] adulterated with toxic [[argemone oil]]. The victims did not get any justice and the culprits escaped without punishment. This outrage energized nine women to organize a movement to fight for consumer rights and to form the CGSI in 1966.

CGSI has on date has about 3000 lifetime members spread all over India with all Managing Committee Members and office bearers at helm being unpaid honorary volunteers.

==Legal framework==

CGSI was the first consumer organization to demand special Consumer Court for redressal of consumers' complaints. In 1975, CGSI led a delegation of five consumer organizations from different parts of India to the then Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Mr. T. A. Pai, and demand for a comprehensive Consumer Protection Act, Special Consumer Courts, and a Directorate for implementation of the Act.

CGSI’s constant follow-up was instrumental in enacting the “Consumer Protection Act 1986” by the “Government of India”.

==Consumer activities==

CGSI's activities include (1) Consumer Education (2) Holding talks and exhibitions to spread consumer rights awareness among urban poor and rural areas (3) Consumer Complaints Redressal (4) Testing of Consumer Products  (5) Publication of "KEEMAT" a bi-monthly news magazine now published for over 20 years having articles of general consumer awareness, for CGSI members and general public.

==Consumer education for schools and colleges==

CGSI's Education Committee members had been working with other likeminded educationists to introduce formal Consumer Education in the school curriculum. After two years of meetings and discussions, CGSI efforts bore fruit. In 1994, the Maharashtra Education Board introduced Consumer Education at the (9th) Ninth Standard Level, progressively covering students from the (4th) Forth Standard upwards. The subject taught are the Consumer Moment, Rights &amp; Responsibilities of Consumers, the Consumer in the Market Place, Food Adulteration, Weights and Measures, Environment protection, etc. These topics included under the existing subjects like Civics, Economics and Home science, are project-based, and more practical in nature than theoretical or examination oriented.

==Consumer education==

CGSI conducts programs and educates consumers in various topics, such as:
 
* General Consumer Awareness
* How to file a Grievance with the appropriate Authority
* Consumer Courts
* Right to Information Act
* Education Planning
* Food Adulteration &amp; Milk Adulteration
* Oils / Vanaspati - (Dangers of [[Trans-fats]])
* Soaps and Detergents –Types, Grades, How to purchase
* Cosmetics – Types, Grades, How to purchase
* Flavors &amp; Fragrances / Perfumes / Body sprays – Types, Grades, How to purchase, Dangers of using cheap products
* Property
* Telecommunications
* Electricity
* Energy Conservation
* Electrical appliances
* Insurance
* Cooperative Housing Societies
* Airlines &amp; Surface Transport
* Banking
* Specialized Finance Subjects like
* Commodities Exchange
* How to manage your finances
* How to stay out of debt
* The Debt Market
* Mutual Funds
* Stock Exchanges

==Consumer education project for rural consumers==

CGSI started a rural project in the villages of [[Thane District|Thane]] and [[Raigad District|Raigad]] districts ([[Maharashtra]]) in 1997, with a staff of six and funding from [[Action Aid]]. By 1999, CGSI had given consumer training to consumers in 112 villages. Over 32,300 people have received consumer education through 750 talks and demonstrations in the 2 years of the project, 107 training programs were organized and special training in [[consumer activism]] given to 5,767 potential activists.  Many local consumer groups have been set up in different areas by the consumers themselves that are now actively organizing exhibitions, holding talks and redressing complaints. In the years 2005–06 and 2006–07, CGSI conducted consumer clubs in 25 schools each in Thane &amp; Raigad District with the help of Maharashtra State Government. CGSI trained a total of 2500 students and teachers in the subject of consumer awareness.

==Holding talks and exhibitions to spread consumer rights awareness among urban poor and rural areas==

CGSI’s main thrust is in rural areas where consumer rights awareness is very low. With the help of its dedicated volunteers and their expertise in various fields, CGSI has been organizing consumer camps, exhibitions, imparting consumer education to school and college students, etc. Today, CGSI programs reach out to more than 20,000 consumers in a year. Now with the help of more and more experts from various fields, CGSI imparts knowledge about prudent investment, Telecom Services, food adulteration detection, medical negligence, mediation, legal redressal of complaints, etc.

==Complaint redressal==

CGSI handles consumer complaints and offers legal guidance to those wishing to file suits in the Consumer Courts. In cases where there are a larger number of complaints against a particular party, both sides are brought together to resolve the issue. The CGSI'S Complaints Committee meets twice a week. CGSI has redressed many thousands of consumer grievances over the years, with 70-80% success in favour of the consumers. complaints cover medical/surgical malpractice and negligence; insurance non-payment; sub-standard drugs and medicines; home remedies; defective household appliances; poor quality foods and drinks; misleading advertising claims; and grievances concerning investments, real estate, insurance, telephones, electricity supply, etc. CGSI handled over 400 complaints during the year through personal counseling sessions, correctly guiding complainants, sometimes even clearly saying that they do not have a case to fight for without wrongfully leading them on.

==Product testing==

As early as 1977, CGSI established formal product testing to evaluate quality by drawing samples directly from the market without involving the manufacturers in the testing process. Test results were a revelation for quality control regulatory authorities. It first assessed the safety and performance of domestic pressure stoves and found that two-third of the samples tested failed in safety Parameters. CGSI sent the results to the government and Indian Standards Institution (ISI) now Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), with a demand for mandatory certification. In 1986, with the passing of the Pressure Stoves Quality Control Order, ISI Certification for pressure stoves became mandatory. Subsequently CGSI did tests on electrical appliances and fittings - irons, immersion heaters, culminating in the enactment of the Household Electrical Appliances (Quality Control) Order. CGSI has developed a food adulteration testing kit and a milk adulteration testing kit for use by the lay consumers. Many other products were tested and reports published in the Society's monthly Journal, "KEEMAT": edible oils, powdered spices, 'surma' (kohl), geysers, clinical thermometers, plastic water bottles, rubber teats, milk, mineral water, breads, soft drinks, bath soaps, fabric detergents, and toothpastes.

==Publications==

''KEEMAT'' India’s first monthly consumer magazine is now in its 43rd year of publications. CGSI distributes KEEMAT to all its members. KEEMAT is also available as a free download to the public from dedicated CGSI website www.cgsiindia.org. CGSI has also produced a number of Consumer Guides on subjects like Electrical Appliances, Edible Oils, Pesticides, Food, Adulteration, Safety at Home, Safe Blood, etc.

==National award==

In 1991, CGSI received the National Award for Consumer Protection for its 25th year for service to Consumers. CGSI hopes to reach out to more and more consumers in the new millennium and to developed newer and more effective methods of serving consumers interest.

==CGSI Representation in various bodies==

Various government statutory bodies like the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]], [[Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Authority of India]], [[Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India]], Consumer Advisory Committee of Various Industries, etc., give representation to CGSI due to its dedicated work force and expertise at its disposal. Lately, the [[Maharashtra State Government]] has given representation to CGSI in its prestigious [[Maharashtra State Consumer Protection Council]].

Effective September 2011, the Maharashtra state government has entrusted CGSI to establish and manage the Maharashtra state consumer helpline.

Considering CGSI’s experience in consumer rights protection, the Maharashtra State Government has awarded consumer helpline project to CGSI since September 2011 on five years contract. The main objectives are as follows:
 
* Develop a resource centre at State level which will be networked with the National Resource Centre
* Develop Alternate Consumer Disputes Redressal mechanisms at the State level
* Resolve maximum number of disputes out of court
* Promote active participation of companies and service providers in resolving consumer disputes
* Early resolution of complaints
* Reach out to rural consumers
* Capacity building of State level Voluntary Consumer Organizations
* Provide service in regional language in addition to English language
 	
Consumers can call a dedicated toll-free number or send e-mail to seek information, advice, or guidance for their day-to-day consumer problems.

Under this project, counselors have guided nearly 20,000 aggrieved consumers in 2013–14. Maharashtra is among the top two states in terms of number of complains handled amongst nine states conducting consumer helpline project.

==CGSI’s documentary film ''Grahakpal'' on consumer rights==

CGSI has produced a documentary film ''[[Grahakpal]]'' on consumer rights by roping a few celebrities to spread the message of consumer rights awareness. The film is screened at various seminars conducted by CGSI resulting in the helpline message reaching to nearly 16,000 viewers in a year, majority of the viewers are college and school students who need to be responsible and aware consumers when they enter mainstream after completing their studies.

MEDIATION &amp; COUNSELLING CLINIC

Mr. Girish Bapat, Cabinet Minister for Consumer Protection, Government of Maharashtra and Mr. Arun Deshpande, Chairman, Consumer Welfare Advisory Committee, Maharashtra on October 20, 2015 inaugurated the ‘Mediation and Conciliation Clinic’ that primarily aims to resolve cases pertaining to consumer disputes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14548">In [[finance]], '''cornering the market''' consists of obtaining sufficient control of a particular [[stock]], [[commodity]], or other [[asset]] in an attempt to [[market manipulation|manipulate]] the market price. One definition of cornering a market is "having the greatest [[market share]] in a particular industry without having a [[monopoly]]."

Companies that have cornered their markets have usually done so in an attempt to gain greater leeway in their decisions; for example, they may desire to charge higher prices for their products without fears of losing too much business. The cornerer hopes to gain control of enough of the [[supply and demand|supply]] of the commodity to be able to set the price for it.

This can be attempted through several mechanisms. The most direct strategy is to simply buy up a large percentage of the available commodity offered for sale in some [[spot market]] and [[Hoarding (economics)|hoard]] it. With the advent of [[futures trading]], a cornerer may buy a large number of [[futures contract]]s on a commodity and then sell them at a profit after inflating the price.

Although there have been many attempts to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from [[tin]] to [[cattle]], to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, [[Edwin Lefèvre]] wrote, "very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them."&lt;ref&gt;Lefèvre, Edwin (1923), ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'', chapter 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A cornerer can become vulnerable due to the size of the [[Position (finance)|position]], especially if the attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. If the price starts to move against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially. In such a situation, many other parties could profit from the cornerer's need to unwind the position.

Cornering is a condition of market when most of the assets are held by a particular group of individuals in a market. It is an undesirable activity and may affect interest of other investors.

==Historical examples==

=== Thales of Miletus (c. 6th century BC) ===
According to [[Aristotle]] in ''[[The Politics]]'' (Book I Section 1259a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |translator=H. Rackham |title=Politics |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Pol.+1.1259a&amp;redirect=true |accessdate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales of Miletus]] once cornered the market in olive-oil presses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thales, so the story goes, because of his poverty was taunted with the uselessness of philosophy; but from his knowledge of astronomy he had observed while it was still winter that there was going to be a large crop of olives, so he raised a small sum of money and paid round deposits for the whole of the olive-presses in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at a low rent as nobody was running him up; and when the season arrived, there was a sudden demand for a number of presses at the same time, and by letting them out on what terms he liked he realized a large sum of money, so proving that it is easy for philosophers to be rich if they choose.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century: Classic examples by Edwin Lefèvre===
Journalist Edwin Lefèvre lists several examples of corners from the mid-19th century. He distinguishes corners as the result of manipulations from corners as the result of competitive buying.

====Cornelius Vanderbilt and the Harlem Railroad====
One of the few cornerers whose rationale was published and justified, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] started accumulating shares of the [[Harlem Railroad]] in 1862 because he anticipated its strategic value. He took control of the Harlem Railroad and later explained that he wanted to show that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. The corner of June 25, 1863 can be seen as just an episode in a strategic investment that served the public well.

====James Fisk, Jay Gould and the Black Friday (1869)====
The 1869 [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]] financial panic in the United States was caused by the efforts of [[Jay Gould]] and [[James Fisk (financier)|James Fisk]] to corner the gold market on the [[New York Gold Exchange]]. When the government gold hit the market, the premium plummeted within minutes and many investors were ruined. Fisk and Gould escaped significant financial harm.

====Lefèvre thoughts on corners of the old days====
In chapter 19 of his book, Edwin Lefèvre tries to summarize the rationale for the corners of the 19th century.
{{quote|A wise old broker told me that all the big operators of the 60s and 70s had one ambition, and that was to work a corner. In many cases this was the offspring of vanity; in others, of the desire for revenge. [...] It was more than the prospective money profit that prompted the engineers of corners to do their damnedest. It was the vanity complex asserting itself among cold-bloodest operators.}}

===20th century: The Northern Pacific Railway===
The corner of The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] on May 9, 1901, is a well documented case of competitive buying, resulting in a panic. The 2009 Annotated Edition of ''[[Reminiscences of a Stock Operator]]'' contains Lefèvre's original account in chapter 3 as well as modern annotations explaining the actual locations and personalities on the page margins.

===1920s: The Stutz Motor Company===
Called "a forerunner of the Livermore and Cutten operations of a few years later" by historian [[Robert Sobel]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} the March 1920 corner of The [[Stutz Motor Company]] is an example of a manipulated corner ruining everyone involved, especially its originator Allan Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1969/08/23/1969_08_23_074_TNY_CARDS_000296736 The New Yorker: A Corner in Stutz, 23 August 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s: The onion market===
In the late 1950s, [[United States]] [[onion]] [[farmer]]s alleged that Sam Seigel and [[Vincent Kosuga]], [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] traders, were attempting to corner the market on onions. Their complaints resulted in the passage of the [[Onion Futures Act]], which banned trading in onion futures in the United States and remains in effect {{As of|2018|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Romer|last=Kieth|title=The Great Onion Corner And The Futures Market|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/22/450769853/the-great-onion-corner-and-the-futures-market|newspaper=[[NPR]]|location= |date=22 October 2015|access-date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s: The Hunt brothers and the silver market===
Brothers [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and [[William Herbert Hunt]] attempted to corner the world [[silver]] markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to more than half of the world's deliverable silver.&lt;REF NAME="TEXAS"&gt;{{Cite magazine

===2008: Porsche and shares in Volkswagen===
During the [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] [[Porsche]] cornered the market in shares of [[Volkswagen]], which briefly saw Volkswagen become the world's most valuable company.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite news| title = Hedge funds make £18bn loss on VW | publisher = ''[[BBC]]'' | date = 2008-10-29 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7697082.stm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Porsche claimed that its actions were intended to gain control of Volkswagen rather than to manipulate the market: in this case, while cornering the market in Volkswagen shares, Porsche contracted with [[naked shorts]]—resulting in a [[short squeeze]] on them.&lt;ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Hawk received a B.Arch in Engineering from [[Iowa State University]] in 1971, a M.Arch. and a M.C.Planning in Fine Arts from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1974, and a Ph.D. in [[Systems Sciences]] in Corporate Planning from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia in 1979. His dissertation ''Regulation of Environmental Deterioration'' was Chaired by [[Russell L. Ackoff]] and supervised by [[Eric Trist]].&lt;ref name= "DH 2010"&gt;[http://davidhawk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/CV-for-David-Hawk-October-2010.pdf David L. Hawk, Resume]. 2010. Accessed Jan 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.L. Hawk. (2008) "[http://isss.org/world/en/20080717-0905-isss-hawk The Business Educators Dilemma: Teaching Analytics to those who Strive to Manage Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927101024/http://isss.org/world/en/20080717-0905-isss-hawk |date=2011-09-27 }}", in: ''Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Conference of ISSS''. July 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its research basis was on the 1975 US Legal Order system of regulation leading to climate change and other unmitigated consequences. The research proposed "Negotiated Order" as a more viable way to avoid ethical cynicism found in US trained lawyers and lead to serious reduction in the human impact on the larger environment of the world. Twenty major companies and ten nations helped with the research done via the Stockholm School of Economics. Sweden's Prime Minister presented the results to OECD. 

Before starting his academic career in 1974 Hawk worked in industry after serving in the U.S. Army in the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1968. From 1968 to 1974 he had a series of jobs such as design engineer for ACCO Loudon; architectural designer in Darmstadt, Germany; farm manager in Brighton, Iowa; Civic designer and planning officer at Westminster City Council, London, England in 1971-72; and designer and corporate researcher for multiple public and private organizations in the Philadelphia region from 1972 to 1974.&lt;ref name="DH 2012"/&gt;

Hawk started working as research associate at the Wharton School in 1974. He was a visiting researcher and faculty member at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1975 to 1977, then a visiting faculty member until 1996. From 1978 to 1981 he was an assistant Professor at Colleges of Engineering and Design of the Iowa State University, where he coordinated the graduate studies in Architecture. In 1981 he started at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]], was an associate dean in 1983-85 while designing several graduate programs. He became NJIT's only dual professor in 1991 in management at the School of Management,&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.njit.edu/people/hawk.php David L. Hawk profile at the School of Management, NJIT]&lt;/ref&gt; and in architecture at the College of Architecture and Design at NJIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://design.njit.edu/people/hawk.php David L.

From 1994 to 1996 Hawk was at Bell Labs AT&amp;T as an Industrial Ecology Fellow developing new models for reduced pollution via industrial redesign.&lt;ref name="DLH 1996"/&gt; In 2001, he was honored as a Master Teacher at NJIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njit.edu/provost/teachingandresearch/master-teachers.php Master Teachers], NJIT Office of the Provost. Accessed Jan 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as Senior Adviser to one of China's largest firms, [[China State Construction Engineering|China State Construction]]. In 2003 hawk began serving two years on the Congressional Commission set up to study the role of business in government leadership: ''Committee on Business Strategies for Public Capital Investment'', for the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GSThaCgH1VwC&amp;pg=PT4&amp;lpg=PT4&amp;dq=%22david+l+hawk%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22david%20l%20hawk%22&amp;f=false Investments in federal facilities: asset management strategies for the 21st century]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010 Hawk was formally fired by NJIT's President Altenkirch for being 1) "non-collegial" to faculty missing their classes, for 2) opposing the President's initiative to get students to pay for bringing NCAA to NJIT, 3) for Hawk developing close ties to Tsinghua University in Beijing, which the President had never heard of, 4) for hiring a friend that was one of the world's leading researchers into international entrepreneurship thus attracting $2 million for a Chair in NJ Entrepreneurship that Hawk refused to use for an athletics expansion on campus, 5) for spending $415 on mini bar expenses in a Beijing Hotel, that turned out to be $30 and was for bottles of coke and Evian Water, not any alcohol. NJIT legal team continued to argue that Evian is French Liquor, not water, and that China uses US Dollars as its currency, not Yuan. NJIT pressed another 20 charges like these against Hawk, then resorted to "hiring" a NJ judge via the NJ Judicial Code to review the charges at $500/hour for 18 months and "objectively" find Hawk guilty of 1 of the 25 charges.  The judge was very nice and quite smart, but could not work his way from a Faustian Dilemma. 

Hawk continued to advise a number of foreign corporate leaders on US investments. Since 2008 they stopped investing in New Jersey based on the NJIT vs. Hawk case being on a cloud website in Chinese and German. Based on his familiarity with Donald Trump and how a growing number of Hawk's white male students liking the Donald Style, although the female students did not, Hawk initiated the Eternal Feminine Foundation in 2015.  It now manages around $700 million where it supports young poor girls in college attendance (not NJIT) via 6%/year.  Its investments take in about 10%/year.  Wealthy businessmen with daughters continue to donate money to the Foundation's objective of keeping men like Trump from inheriting leadership positions while also preparing females to manage the consequences of failure in this objective.  The 2015 beginning of the Foundation seems like a long way in the past. 

Hawk is also Director of Center of Corporate Rehabilitation on his farm in Iowa.

A '''director of nursing''' ('''DON''') is a [[registered nurse]] who supervises the care of all the [[patient]]s at a [[health care]] facility.&lt;ref&gt;Nursing home litigation: pretrial practice and trials By Ruben J. Krisztal, Stephen Appelbaum: Page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The director of nursing has special training beyond the training of a staff nurse for the position that pertains to health care management, and in some places, a director of nursing must hold a special license in order to be employed in that capacity.

The director of nursing is one of up to seven directors at a typical health care facility. The other are the directors of [[dietician|food (or dietary) services]], [[social work]], activities, business management, housekeeping/laundry, and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Effective Management of Long Term Care Facilities By Douglas A. Singh: Page 61&lt;/ref&gt; In most facilities, the director of nursing is only second to the facility's [[Administrator (business)|administrator]], and will fill in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in the administrator's absence.&lt;ref&gt;Effective Management of Long Term Care Facilities By Douglas A. Singh: Page 283&lt;/ref&gt;

In some facilities, there is also an '''assistant director of nursing''' ('''ADON''') who backs up the director of nursing, especially in the DON's absence or off-hours.

The director of nursing is the one who is responsible for communicating between the nursing staff and the [[physician]]s at a health care facility. It is the director of nursing who communicates to physicians the needs of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;Nursing home litigation: investigation and case preparation By Patricia W. Iyer: Page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of nursing has the duty of testifying in any criminal or civil legal cases that arise out of the nursing care at the facility and can be held legally liable in the event that his/her own negligence in practice was responsible for a mishap at a facility resulting in death or personal injury to a patient.

==Laws relating to the director of nursing==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], federal OBRA regulations set the requirements for directors of nursing.&lt;ref&gt;Long-term care and the law: a legal guide for health care professionals By George D. Pozgar: Page 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The director of nursing is a [[full-time]] position. Either one person can work in this position for 35 hours in a week, or two or more registered nurses can fulfill the duties for a combined 40 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;Nursing home litigation: investigation and case preparation By Patricia W. Iyer: Page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
The duties of a director of nursing may be as follows:
*Development and implementation of nursing policy and procedure. These must be aimed at preventing accidents at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Long-term care and the law: a legal guide for health care professionals By George D. Pozgar: Page 200&lt;/ref&gt;
*Overseeing the hiring and continued employment of nursing staff
*Ensuring there is adequate nursing staff, and that the staff's skills remain current
*Overseeing nursing employee conduct
*Being a witness at a trial in the event of litigation
*Being knowledgeable of incidents at the facility
*Assessing the health needs of each resident
*Communicating the needs of the residents of the facility to the physicians

The {{Nihongo|'''Japan Fair Trade Commission'''|公正取引委員会|Kōsei Torihiki Iinkai|JFTC}} is a commission of the [[Japanese government]] responsible for regulating [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]], as well as enforcement of the [[Antimonopoly Act (Japan)|Antimonopoly Act]]. Headed by a chairman, the commission is commonly known as {{Nihongo|''Kōtori''|公取}} or {{Nihongo|''Kōtorii''|公取委}}.

On July 13, 2004, the commission asked [[Microsoft]] to remove a clause which it thinks is hurting activities of Japanese companies getting licenses of [[Microsoft Windows]] from Microsoft.

The '''Grainer evaporation process''' is a method of producing [[salt]].

This method uses shallow open pans with [[steam]]-heated immersion coils to evaporate the [[brine]] into salt.  

Sometimes it is paired with a partial-vacuum, to speed evaporation.

In June 2011, Reuters reported that the Iraqi government had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Al Uzri, stemming from an investigation into the Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kami|first=Aseel|title=Iraq seeks bank head's arrest, denies witchhunt|work=[[Reuters]]|date=2011-06-06|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/05/idINIndia-57509620110605|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As yet no details of the allegations, or any supporting evidence have been presented. In the same year Mr. Al Uzri featured in The Middle East Magazine's 'Top 50 Arabs'. 

During Hussein Al Uzri’s stewardship, TBI grew from nothing to the largest bank in Iraq. It issued almost all government letters of credit, which in Iraq's state-driven economy was a substantial number. Investigations by Iraq's government claimed the bank was troubled, despite regular auditing and annual reporting, the latest of which was published in 2010 on the Bank's website and was audited by PWC. Though state-owned, Mr. Al Uzri successfully operated the Bank commercially, overseeing a number of landmark successes and achievements.   

Mr. Al Uzri previously worked at Card Tech for 20 years in banking, commercial and project management across the Middle East, Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU). Between 1992 and 2000 Mr. Al Uzri worked in Moscow as manager of INPASS, a joint venture between Finland’s OKO Bank and UK financial technology firm CTL. In this capacity Mr. Al Uzri was responsible for the introduction of a number of financial services in the FSU including the first VISA cards (1992), the first Electronic Point of Sale machines (1992), and the first Automatic Teller Machines (1993). From 2000-2003 Mr. Al Uzri was CTL's general manager for the Former Soviet Union and the Middle East, based at their London headquarters.  

Al Uzri is a 1985 graduate of [[Texas Tech University]], where he received a degree in electrical and computer engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waston|first=Kelly|title=Tech grad, Iraqi official visits campus|work=[[The Daily Toreador]]|date=2010-04-23|url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/tech-grad-iraqi-official-visits-campus-1.2237576|accessdate=2010-04-23}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Achievements at TBI'''

Under the stewardship of Mr. Al Uzri the Trade Bank of Iraq quickly developed into a highly credible and effective organization. In a short period of time, TBI built relationships with an international network of 134 prime banks covering 63 cities in 39 countries. This gave TBI a global reach, a competitive advantage and the ability to provide a diverse range of services. By the end of 2010 TBI’s equity was US$1.5 billion and the Bank had total assets of over US$15 billion. Profits at the Bank in 2010 were $361 million.

Early success saw TBI sign agreements with 17 of the largest Export Credit Agencies in the world, making it one of the first Iraqi banks to receive lines of credit from major international financial institutions. Among the many 'firsts' the bank can claim are the introduction of Iraq's first fully automated online banking system, the first Iraqi bank to issue VISA credit cards, and the development of the first nationwide network of ATMs. 

Building on early success, Mr. Al Uzri’s leadership introduced modern, innovative products and services to the Iraqi market. These included Project Finance, Salary Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Credit Cards.

In 2011 TBI employed over 450 people, operating across fifteen branches throughout Iraq.  More than 5,000 Letters of Credit (L/Cs) had been issued by early 2011 totalling US$65 billion.  TBI was voted ‘Best Trade Bank in the Middle East' by the Trade and Forfeiting Review in 2007, 2008 and 2010.

Under Mr. Al Uzri, TBI engaged EY, and subsequently PWC, to audit the Bank’s systems and annual results.  EY carried out this function for five years and PWC for two (2009 and 2010).  No concerns were raised regarding the bank’s operations and results and reports were published on TBI’s website. 
Following the removal of Al Uzri in 2011, the Prime Minister’s office appointed Mrs. Hamdia Al Jaf, a close friend of the Al Maliki family, to take over leadership of the Bank. 

Formerly a branch manager at Radifain Bank, Al Jaf’s tenure has become synonymous with TBI’s decline. The Bank has not published an annual report since 2010 and its operations are considered to be mysterious. Since 2011, no financial statements have been published by independent auditors. The bank has lost its semi-independent status and is now under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office.

The '''International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use''' ('''ICH''') is a project that brings together the regulatory authorities of [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] and experts from the [[pharmaceutical industry]] in the three regions to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product registration.

The purpose of ICH is to reduce or eliminate the need to duplicate the testing carried out during the research and development of new medicines by recommending ways to achieve greater harmonisation in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for product registration. Harmonisation would lead to a more economical use of human, non-human animal and material resources, and the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability of new medicines while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, and efficacy, and regulatory obligations to protect public health.

ICH guidelines have been adopted as law in several countries, but are only used as guidance for the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Institutional Review Board |first=Elizabeth A |last=Bankert |author2=Robert J. Amdur |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |year=2006 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1980s, what is today the [[European Union]] began harmonising regulatory requirements. In 1989, Europe, Japan, and the United States began creating plans for harmonisation; '''International Council of Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use''' (ICH) was created in April 1990 at a meeting in [[Brussels]].

In 2015, International Conference on Harmonisation changed its name to the International Council for Harmonisation while becoming a legal entity in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2015/10/26/23473/ICH-Makes-Organizational-Changes/ ICH Makes Organizational Changes], Zachary Brennan, 26 October 2015, Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jliedu"&gt;[http://www.jliedu.com/blog/ich-is-now-international-council-on-harmonisation-a-legal-swiss-entity/ ICH is now International Council for Harmonisation – a Legal Swiss Entity], James Lind Institute&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2015 ICH conducted the initial meeting of their new assembly.&lt;ref name="jliedu" /&gt;

==Structure==
The ICH has four major parts:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ich.org/about/faqs/article/how-is-ich-structured.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ICH Steering Committee
# ICH Coordinators
# ICH Secretariat
# ICH Working Groups

The Steering Committee, made of six ICH Parties, governs the ICH, determining the policies and procedures, selecting topics for harmonisation and monitoring progress of harmonisation initiatives. The ICH consists of:
* [[European Commission]]
* [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] (EFPIA)
* [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)]] (MHLW)
* [[Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association]] (JPMA)
* [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)
* [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA)

The ICH Coordinators represents each ICH Party to the ICH Secretariat on a day-to-day basis.

The ICH Secretariat is primarily concerned with preparations for, and documentation of, meetings of the Steering Committee as well as coordination of preparations for Working Group (EWG (Expert Working Group), IWG (Implementation Working Group), Informal WG) and Discussion Group meetings.

The ICH Working Groups are created by the Steering Committee when a new topic is accepted for harmonisation, and is charged with developing a harmonised guideline that meets the objectives outlined in the Concept Paper and Business Plan.

Face-to-face meetings of the EWG will normally only take place during the biannual SC meetings. Interim reports are made at each meeting of the SC.

If consensus is reached the EWG will sign the ''Step 2 Experts Signoff'' sheet and submit it to the SC to request adoption.
If there is no agreement in the EWG within the time frame the SC may extend the time frame, suspend or abandon the harmonization project.

===Step 2: Confirmation of EWG consensus by the SC===
Step 2 is reached when the SC agrees, based on the report of the EWG, that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the technical issues for the draft guideline. This text is signed off by the SC as ''Step 2 Final Document''.

===Step 3: Regulatory consultation and discussion===
The draft becomes subject of consultation in the three regions. It is published in the European Union (as draft [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use|CHMP]] or [[Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use|CVMP]] guideline), Japan (after translation by [[MHLW]]), and the USA (as draft guideline in the [[Federal Register]]) and everybody within these regions can comment on it. There is also an opportunity for companies, associations and authorities in non-ICH regions to comment on the draft, which is distributed by [[IFPMA]] and [[WHO]]. After obtaining all consultation results, the EWG will be resumed. A new rapporteur will be appointed from the regulatory party, preferably from the same region as the previous rapporteur. The same procedure described in Step 1 is used to address the consultation results into the ''Step 2 Final Document''. The draft document to be generated as a result of the Step 3 phase is called [[Step 4 Experts Document]].

If industry and regulatory EWG members agree on the alterations as a result of the consultation, the Step 4 Experts Document is signed by the EWG regulatory experts only (''Step 4 Experts Signoff'') and submitted to the SC to request adoption as Step 4 of the ICH process.

===Step 4: Adoption of an ICH harmonised tripartite guideline===
Step 4 is reached when the SC agrees that there is sufficient scientific consensus on the technical issues.
If one industry party has strong objections to the adoption of the guideline due to deviations of the revised draft from the original consensus the regulatory parties may agree that a revised document should be submitted for further consultation. In this case, the EWG discussion may be resumed.

The Step 4 Final Document is signed off by the SC signatories for the regulatory parties of ICH as an [[ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline]].

===Step 5: Implementation===
The ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline moves immediately to the final step of the process that is the regulatory implementation. This step is carried out according to the same national/regional procedures that apply to other regional regulatory guidelines and requirements, in the [[European Union]], Japan, and the United States.

Information on the regulatory action taken and implementation dates are reported back to the SC and published by the ICH Secretariat on the ICH website and in the annual press statement.

'''Jacques Lebaudy''' (1868 - January 11, 1919) was a Frenchman from a wealthy family of sugar refiners known for his eccentricity and his attempt to establish a new nation, the Empire of the Sahara. The circumstances of his death in 1919 in [[Westbury, New York|Westbury, Long Island]], resulted in a sensational grand jury proceeding.

==Family and early life==
Born in 1868, Jacques Lebaudy was the oldest son of Jules Lebaudy (1828-1892), who with his brother Gustave (1827-1889) owned the family sugar refining business, [[Lebaudy Frères]]. Jules also owned property in Paris, including the [[Théâtre du Vaudeville]]. Jacques' mother Amicie (1847-1917) founded a charity to provide low-cost housing to the working poor which is still in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fondationlebaudy.fr|title=Accueil - Fondation de Madame Jules Lebaudy|last=|first=|date=|website=Fondation de Madame Jules Lebaudy|language=fr-FR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Jacques' younger brother Max (1873-1895) in a military hospital in 1895 after being called up for military service despite a serious illness caused a scandal in France. Lebaudy had inherited about $15 million on the death of his father.

Jacques' cousins Paul and Pierre Lebaudy were notable builders of airships, such as [[La République (airship)|''La République'']].

==The Empire of the Sahara==
[[File:Drapeau Empire Du Sahara.gif|thumb|Flag of the Empire of the Sahara]]
In June 1903, Lebaudy sailed with his yacht ''Frasquita'' and two other boats to an area near [[Cape Juby]] on the Moroccan coast and proclaimed the "Empire of the Sahara". Backed by as many as 400 hired soldiers and sixteen [[Hotchkiss gun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Current Literature'', October 1903, p. 412-3&lt;/ref&gt; Lebaudy established a camp and set up a throne for himself in a large tent. He had various projects for ruling and improving his new domain, but European governments disapproved of his venture, and some of his mercenaries were captured by local Moorish bandits. (They later sued Lebaudy for damages for abandoning them, after being rescued by a French warship.&lt;ref&gt;"Empire Building" in ''Occasional, Critical, and Political Writings'', [[James Joyce]], Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 100 - 101&lt;/ref&gt;) By October 1903 Lebaudy was installed at the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and soon installed his government there, appointing American adventurer [[George Edward Gouraud]] as his "Governor-General".&lt;ref&gt;"Emperor of the Sahara", ''Oamaru Mail'', 28 January 1904, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: George Gouraud was not closely related to [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], a French officer active at that time in West Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly the orchestra in the Savoy restaurant would play his national anthem whenever he entered to dine under his imperial purple canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-emperor-of-the-sahara-1198247.html|title=The Emperor of the Sahara|last=Maxwell|first=Bennet|date=15 September 1998|work=The Independent|access-date=16 October 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several years the embarrassed French government issued a warrant for his arrest and Lebaudy left North Africa for good.

==United States==
About 1908 Lebaudy moved to the United States with his wife Augustine and daughter Jacqueline, residing mostly in expensive New York City hotels, and his behavior became more erratic. In 1915 he was placed in an asylum at the request of his wife; he at first fled the local sheriff on horseback, before surrendering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/19/104652535.pdf|title=Emperor of the Sahara surrenders to U.S.|last=|first=|date=19 August 1915|work=New York Times|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon escaped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/08/20/105038289.pdf|title=Sahara's 'Emperor' Flees Sanitarium|last=|first=|date=20 August 1915|work=New York Times|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;only to be recaptured after a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/docview/145414535|title=Emperor goes cattle shopping|last=|first=|date=24 August 1915|work=Washington Post (1877-1922)|access-date=17 October 2018|subscription=yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lebaudy reportedly tried several times to have his wife and daughter killed, and was finally shot and killed by his wife on January 11, 1919 at her home in Westbury on [[Long Island|Long Island.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP19190322.2.125|title=Jaques Lebaudy "Emperor of the Sahara" shot dead by his wife"|last=|first=|date=22 March 1919|work=Evening Post|access-date=16 October 2018|via=Papers Past}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grand jury refused to indict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/22/97060820.pdf|title=Clear Mrs.Lebaudy of killing husband|last=|first=|date=22 January 1919|work=New York TImes|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left a large estate, having inherited additional portions of the family money from his brother Max and his mother. He also had the reputation, despite his mental problems, of being at times a shrewd investor in stocks and property; he reportedly made a profit of over $1,000,000 in the stock of the [[Erie Railroad]] in 1907 when it became the subject of a takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/01/12/103454944.pdf|title=Jaques Lebaudy shot dead by his wife in her home|last=|first=|date=12 January 1919|work=New York TImes|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebaudy was buried in the Catholic parish cemetery of St. Brigid's, Westbury, now part of the Catholic [[Cemetery of the Holy Rood]].

In 1922 his wife remarrried a French detective in a double wedding with her daughter, who married his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19221005.2.55&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Widow of Jacques Lebaudy and Daughter Have Double Wedding|last=|first=|date=5 October 1922|work=Sacramento Union|access-date=16 October 2018|issue=26134|volume=228|page=2|via=California Digital Newspaper Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier life==

Koh Lay Huan was from [[T'ung-an]] county,&lt;ref name="franke"&gt;Chinese Epigraphic Materials in Malaysia: Collected, Annotated, and Edited by Wolfgang Franke and Chen Tieh Fan By Wolfgang Franke, Tiefan Chen Published by University of Malaysia Press, 1982; Item notes: v.1-2; p. 717&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Zhou]] Prefecture in the [[Fujian]] Province,&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"/&gt; on the [[East China|southeast coast]] of [[China]]. At the time, Fujian was at the focus of the activities of [[Tiandihui]] ([[Heaven and Earth Society]]), a secret society aiming at the overthrow of the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. Having become involved in rebellious activity, Koh Lay Huan was forced to flee to the south part of [[Siam]], where he settled successfully.&lt;ref name="zhongguo"&gt;Zhongguo hai yang fa zhan shi lun wen ji By Zhongguo hai yang fa zhan shi lun wen ji bian ji wei yuan hui, Zhong yang yan jiu yuan San min zhu yi yan jiu suo, Zhong yang yan jiu yuan Zhongshan ren wen she hui ke xue yan jiu suo Published by Zhong yang yan jiu yuan san min zhu yi yan jiu suo, 1984 Item notes: v.5 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a close ally of the headman/[[penghulu]] of [[Nakhon Srithammarat]] (who would,  around 1821, marry one of Koh's daughters in Penang).&lt;ref name="cswong"&gt;C.S.Wong, A Gallery of Chinese Kapitans (Singapore Government Printing Office, 1964), p.15. and The Burney Papers, Vol. II, Part I (London : Gregg International Publishers, 1971), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phuwado"&gt;[http://www.penangstory.net.my/docs/Abs-PhuwadolSongprasert.doc The Implication of Penang Connection in Southern Thailand by Phuwadol Songprasert, Department of History, Faculty of Social Sciences Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand  presented at The Penang Story – International Conference 2002 18-21 April 2002, The City Bayview Hotel, Penang, Malaysia; Organisers: The Penang Heritage Trust &amp; STAR Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, encouraged by commercial prospects, he moved to [[Kedah]] where he again settled successfully,&lt;ref name="zhongguo"/&gt; kept a second family,&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Settlements 1826-67: Indian Presidency to Crown Colony by M Stenson - 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and became  [[Kapitan Cina]] of [[Kedah]] at [[Kuala Muda]].&lt;ref&gt;Penang Po Leung Kuk:Records and Recollections (1889-1934): Chinese Women, Prostitution &amp; a Welfare Organisation By Neil Jin Keong Khor, Keat Siew Khoo, Izrin Muaz Md.

==Participation in the founding of Penang==
{{main article| History of Penang}}

In 1786 [[Francis Light]] claimed the island of Pulau Pinang on behalf of the King of England and renamed it Prince of Wales Island. There were only about a hundred Malay fishermen inhabiting the island at that time, but the population would grow fast - to 5,000 in 1789 and 10,000 ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldfacts.us/Malaysia-Penang.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Koh Lay Huan had a share in that success. Already a shortly time after Light arrived, Koh Lay Huan came to visit him &lt;ref name="patriarch"&gt;The Patriarch By Joo Kim Yeap Published by Times Books International, 1984; {{ISBN|9971-65-150-5}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-65-150-3}}; p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and brought with him, from [[Kuala Muda]], [[Kedah]], several boatloads of Chinese and Malays to clear the land, inhabit, trade and generally develop the island.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Transformation: A History of South-East, South, and East Asia By Gilbert Khoo, Dorothy Lo Published by Heinemann Educational Books (Asia), 1977&lt;/ref&gt; At their inaugural meeting, Koh presented Light with a present of some fishing nets.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"&gt;Chinese Business in the Making of a Malay State, 1882-1941: Kedah and Penang By Wu Xiao An, Xiao An Wu Published by Routledge, 2003; {{ISBN|0-415-30176-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30176-3}}; p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1787 Light appointed Koh as the first Kapitan Cina of [[Penang]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Personalities of Penang By Historical Personalities of Penang Committee, Historical Personalities of Penang Committee Published by Historical Personalities of Penang Committee, 1986; p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Light respected Koh's canniness, enterprise and social and political acumen and connections. He was recorded to have said about Koh, "Tuanka (towkay) China is an [[cultural depictions of foxes|old fox]]. He has little to do with the government but being rich and having married a daughter of the old King he bears a considerable sway in their Becharas or Council"&lt;ref&gt;Tregonning 1965: 79&lt;/ref&gt; By appointing Koh Kapitan China, Light had gained an able administrator and judge.

Koh was known as Chewan in official documents.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"/&gt; He was also known as Koh Lay Hwan,&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;Twentieth Impressions of British Malaya, Arnold Wright, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Cheki,&lt;ref&gt;This name appeared in the list of mortgages granted at Prince of Wales Island on 24 February 1795. On 5 August 1794, Cheki, the Chinese Captain mortgaged his pepper plantation at Sungai Kluang to James Scott for 1,300 Spanish dollars with an interest of 12 percent per annum&lt;/ref&gt; Chu Khee,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of Chinese inhabitants residing in Georgetown, Prince of Wales Island, in December 1788. Chu Khee came from Kedah together with 18 members  of his family. He was mainly a merchant.&lt;/ref&gt; Ku Li-huan and Patcan.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Growth and Municipal Development in Colonial Port-town Penang 1786-1830 by Dr. Nordin Hussin Pusat Sejarah, Politik dan Strategik FSSK UKM nordin@pkrisc.cc.ukm.my; The Fourth International Malaysian Studies Conference (MSC4) 3–5 August 2004 Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Koh Lay Huan's original residence has been restored and is now a boutique hotel (The East Indies Mansion) at 25 Lebuh China (China Street) in George Town, Penang.

==And Origin of Penang's Municipal Assessments==
In 1795, Light's business partner, James Scott, sought representation when it was decided that properties should be taxed, the revenue being needed to fund the police force, maintain roads and ensure cleanliness. It was at this time that Kapitan Cina Koh Lay Huan, his counterpart for the Indian community ([[Kapitan Keling]]) [[Cauder Mohideen]], and other prominent members of the community, formed the first Committee of Assessors to decide the rates and collection of taxes (assessments).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120717020615/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2008/8/3/lifefocus/1613963&amp;sec=lifefocus Recipe for rebellion: THE THIRD SPACE By NEIL KHOR and KHALDUN MALIK, The Sunday Star Sunday 3 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aceh Links and Pepper Cultivation==
Cultivation of pepper in Penang began through the initial effort of Francis Light and Koh Lay Huan.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Koh had been involved with pepper cultivation already long before his arrival at Penang, having had experience in this field both in [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and in [[Kedah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccm.um.edu.my/umweb/fsss/images/persidangan/Kertas%20Kerja/K.T.%20Joseph.doc LANDMARKS IN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA – CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INDONESIA. (K.T. Joseph)]&lt;/ref&gt; This was facilitated by his being well connected with the English- and French-speaking [[Aceh Sultanate|Sultan of Acheh]], [[Jauhar al-Alam]].&lt;ref name="jmbras"/&gt; At the time, Aceh accounted for a large part of the worldwide production of pepper. In 1790 Francis Light sent Koh to Acheh to gather pepper plants for cultivation in Penang.

Koh retained his connection with the Acheh Sultan Jauhar al-Alam and around 1819 helped him to put down a rebellion by Achenese territorial chiefs .&lt;ref name="jmbras"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia By [[Nicholas Tarling]] Published by Cambridge University Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-521-66370-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66370-0}}; pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
Koh would go on to found a [[kongsi]]. His descendants played a major role in the Penang-Kedah Chinese community for generations.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Business in the Making of a Malay State, 1882-1941: Kedah and Penang By Wu Xiao An, Xiao An Wu Published by Routledge, 2003; {{ISBN|0-415-30176-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30176-3}}; p. 28&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He had six sons and two daughters by Saw It Neoh, his wife in Penang, and two sons and one daughter by Guan Boey Neoh, his wife in Kedah. His daughter, Luan, the wife of the headman/[[penghulu]] of [[Nakhon Srithammarat]], later became the mother of the governors of [[Phang Nga]] and [[Takuapa]],  who financially supported [[Khaw Su Chiang]]'s successful tax monopolies in those provinces and who with the support of this powerful lady later became the governor of Rating in 1844.&lt;ref name="phuwado"/&gt;

Koh's eldest son, Koh Kok Chye, was from his Penang wife and was promoted to be the governor of [[Kuala Kedah]] (1821–1841).&lt;ref name="cswong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phuwado"/&gt; Another son accompanied Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] to [[Singapore]] at its foundation in 1819.&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt; Koh Lay Huan's son also served as [[Raja]] of [[Pungah]] in [[Ligor]], and Agent for the [[Chau Phya]] of Ligor.&lt;ref&gt;The Western Malay States, 1850-1873: the effects of commercial development on Malay politics By Kay Kim Khoo Published by Oxford University Press, 1972; pp. 67, 209, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

His famous descendants also include [[Koh Teng Choon]], the planter and Teng Choon's son, [[Koh Seang Tat]] who together with [[Foo Tye Sin]] operated the successful firm of Tye Sin Tat &amp; Co.

A descendant of Koh Seang Teik (younger brother of Koh Seang Tat) was Koh Lip Cheng and Koh Lip Teng (Queens scholar of [[Penang Free School]]).

One more famous descendant of Koh Lip Cheng was Datuk Koh Sin Hock (DSPN, AMN, OBE, JP) who was actively in the [[British Malaya|Malayan]] politics under both the British and the Japanese.

Another descendant of Koh was [[Gu Hongming]], a Scottish-educated conservative Confucian cultural critic serving in minor Chinese government positions during the end of the Qing Dynasty.

'''Marcel Boussac''' (17 April 1889 – 21 March 1980) was a [[France|French]] entrepreneur best known for his ownership of the [[Christian Dior SA|Maison Dior]] and one of the most successful [[thoroughbred]] [[race horse]] breeding farms in [[Europe]]an history.

Born in [[Châteauroux]], [[Indre]], [[France]], Boussac made a fortune in [[textile]] manufacturing. In 1919 he acquired the Château de Mivoisin, a 36 square kilometre property located 1½ hours south of Paris in [[Dammarie-sur-Loing]], [[Loiret]].

In 1946, he financed [[Christian Dior SA|Christian Dior's]] new [[Paris]] fashion house that became one of the most famous clothing and perfume marques in history. In 1951 Boussac expanded into the newspaper business with the acquisition of ''[[L'Aurore (1944 newspaper)|L'Aurore]]''.

An avid horseman, Marcel Boussac acquired the [[Haras de Fresnay-le-Buffard]] horse breeding farm in [[Neuvy-au-Houlme]] in [[Lower Normandy]] and the [[Haras de Jardy]] in [[Marnes-la-Coquette]]. As part of his breeding operation, Boussac bought and sold horses from across Europe plus from the [[United States]]. He acquired the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] winner [[Whirlaway]] and sold the mare [[La Troienne (horse)|La Troienne]] to [[Edward R. Bradley|Edward R. Bradley's]] [[Idle Hour Stock Farm]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] who became one of the most influential mares to be imported into the U.S. in the 20th century.

Boussac's horses dominated French racing from the 1930s through to the 1960s making his stable the leading money winner fourteen times and the leading breeder on seventeen occasions. In addition to being a six-time winner of France's most important race, the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]], Boussac's horses also won the prestigious [[Epsom Derby]], [[Epsom Oaks]], [[2,000 Guineas Stakes|2,000 Guineas]], [[St. Leger Stakes]], [[Ascot Gold Cup]] and others in the [[United Kingdom]].

With the [[Fall of France]] in the Second World War, Boussac paid a British Royal Air Force officer on secret business to fly him from Paris to the UK. This caused the officer [[Sidney Cotton]] to be removed from his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/EDITIONS/4616/history/story02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807230255/http://defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4616/history/story02.htm |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], the [[Nazi]]s seized some of the best racehorses in the country. They shipped more than six hundred of them out of the country, some to [[Hungary]] but most back to [[Germany]] for racing or for breeding at the German National Stud. Among them was the champion [[Pharis (horse)|Pharis]], owned by Marcel Boussac.

He was married for many years to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[opera]] star [[Fanny Heldy]]. They are buried together in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in the [[Montmartre Quarter]] of Paris.

On his passing in 1980, Boussac's estate was liquidated and ''L'Aurore'' sold to [[Robert Hersant]] who merged it with his ''[[Le Figaro]]'' newspaper. The property itself would eventually be acquired by [[Stavros Niarchos]]. The [[Aga Khan IV]] had purchased the bulk of the Boussac farm's breeding stock in 1978 when Boussac's companies were declared bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baerlein|first1=Richard|title=Shergar : and the Aga Khan's thoroughbred empire|date=1984|publisher=Michael Joseph Ltd|location=London|isbn=0718121767|pages=57-61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his honor, the [[Prix Marcel Boussac]], a [[Group One]] Stakes Race, is run annually at the [[Longchamp Racecourse]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12544">In economics, the '''marginal product of labor''' ('''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''') is the change in output that results from employing an added unit of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Sullivan | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin  | title = Economics: Principles in Action | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ  | page = 108 | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[marginal product]] of a [[factor of production]] is generally defined as the change in output associated with a change in that factor, holding other inputs into production constant.

The marginal product of labor is then the change in output (''Y'') per unit change in labor (''L''). In discrete terms the marginal product of labor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\Delta Y} {\Delta L}.&lt;/math&gt;

In continuous terms, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the first [[derivative]] of the [[production function]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial Y} {\partial L}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Perloff173"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphically, the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the slope of the production function.

==Examples==
[[File:Marginal Product of Labor1 copy.png|frame|right|Marginal product of labor table (EDIT: Marginal Product of Labor at Labor = 7 is 4 not 3)]]

There is a factory which produces toys. When there are no workers in the factory, no toys are produced. When there is one worker in the factory, six toys are produced per hour. When there are two workers in the factory, eleven toys are produced per hour. There is a marginal product of labor of five when there are two workers in the factory compared to one. When the marginal product of labor is increasing, this is called [[increasing marginal returns]]. However, as the number of workers increases, the marginal product of labor may not increase indefinitely. When not [[scale (social sciences)|scale]]d properly, the marginal product of labor may go down when the number of employees goes up, creating a situation known as [[diminishing marginal returns]]. When the marginal product of labor becomes negative, it is known as [[negative marginal returns]].

==Marginal costs==

The marginal product of labor is directly related to [[Cost-of-production theory of value|costs of production]]. [[Cost]]s are divided between [[Fixed cost|fixed]] and [[variable cost]]s. Fixed costs are costs that relate to the fixed input, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], or ''rK'', where ''r'' is the rental cost of capital and ''K'' is the quantity of capital. Variable costs (VC) are the costs of the variable input, labor, or ''wL'', where ''w'' is the wage rate and ''L'' is the amount of labor employed. Thus, VC = wL . Marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost per unit change in output or ∆C/∆Q. In the short run, production can be varied only by changing the variable input. Thus only variable costs change as output increases:  ∆C = ∆VC = ∆(wL). Marginal cost is ∆(Lw)/∆Q. Now, ∆L/∆Q is the reciprocal of the marginal product of labor  (∆Q/∆L). Therefore, marginal cost is simply the wage rate w divided by the marginal product of labor

:MC = ∆VC∕∆Q;
:∆VC = w∆L;
:∆L∕∆Q (the change in quantity of labor to effect a one unit change in output) = 1∕MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.
:Therefore MC = w ∕ MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

Thus if the marginal product of labor is rising then marginal costs will be falling and if the marginal product of labor is falling marginal costs will be rising (assuming a constant wage rate).&lt;ref&gt;Pindyck, R. and D. Rubinfeld, ''Microeconomics'', 5th ed. Prentice-Hall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;==

The average product of labor is the total product of labor divided by the number of units of labor employed, or ''Q/L''.&lt;ref name="Perloff173"/&gt; The average product of labor is a common measure of labor productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W. and C. Snyder, ''Intermediate Microeconomics'', Thomson 2007, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, W., ''Microeconomic Theory'', 9th ed. Thomson 2005, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is shaped like an inverted “u”. At low production levels the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tends to increase as additional labor is added. The primary reason for the increase is specialization and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; reaches its maximum value  AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Binger, B. and E. Hoffman, ''Microeconomics with Calculus'', 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley 1998, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; falls.

During the early stages of production MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Eventually the ''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches it maximum value at the point of diminishing returns. Beyond this point MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease. However, at the point of diminishing returns the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is still above the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will continue to increase until MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; equals AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. When MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is below AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; will decrease.

Graphically, the ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' curve can be derived from the total product curve by drawing secants from the origin that intersect (cut) the total product curve. The slope of the secant line equals the average product of labor, where the slope = dQ/dL.&lt;ref name="Perloff176"/&gt; The slope of the curve at each intersection marks a point on the average product curve. The slope increases until the line reaches a point of tangency with the total product curve. This point marks the maximum average product of labor. It also marks the point where MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (which is the slope of the total product curve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Microeconomics|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=978-1429277914|authorlink=Paul Krugman|author2=Robin Wells |authorlink2=Robin Wells (economist) |page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; equals the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (the slope of the secant).&lt;ref&gt;Perloff, J: Microeconomics Theory &amp; Applications with Calculus page 177. Pearson 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this point the slope of the secants become progressively smaller as ''AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' declines. The MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve intersects the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve from above at the maximum point of the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Thereafter, the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve is below the AP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; curve.

==Diminishing marginal returns==

The falling MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is due to the law of diminishing marginal returns. The law states, "as units of one input are added (with all other inputs held constant) a point will be reached where the resulting additions to output will begin to decrease; that is marginal product will decline."&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"&gt;Samuelson, W. and S. Marks, ''Managerial Economics'', 4th ed. Wiley 2003, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of diminishing marginal returns applies regardless of whether the production function exhibits increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale. The key factor is that the variable input is being changed while all other factors of production are being held constant. Under such circumstances diminishing marginal returns are inevitable at some level of production.&lt;ref name="Varian1992"&gt;[[Hal Varian]], ''Microeconomic Analysis'', 3rd ed. Norton 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diminishing marginal returns differs from diminishing returns. Diminishing marginal returns means that the marginal product of the variable input is falling. Diminishing returns occur when the marginal product of the variable input is negative. That is when a unit increase in the variable input causes total product to fall. At the point that diminishing returns begin the MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is zero.&lt;ref name="Perloff178"&gt;Perloff, J., ''Microeconomics Theory and Applications with Calculus'', Pearson 2008, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and profit maximization==

The general rule is that a firm maximizes profit by producing that quantity of output where [[marginal revenue]] equals marginal costs. The [[profit maximization]] issue can also be approached from the input side. That is, what is the profit maximizing usage of the variable input? To maximize profits the firm should increase usage "up to the point where the input’s marginal revenue product equals its marginal costs". So, mathematically the profit maximizing rule is MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; The marginal profit per unit of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor minus the marginal cost of labor or Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;MC&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;A firm maximizes profits where Mπ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.

The marginal revenue product is the change in total revenue per unit change in the variable input assume labor.&lt;ref name="Samuelson227" /&gt; That is, MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆TR/∆L. MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the product of marginal revenue and the marginal product of labor or MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.

*Derivation:
:MR = ∆TR/∆Q
:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L
:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MR × MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) × (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

===Example===

*Assume that the production function is &lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuelson227"/&gt;
	•	&lt;math&gt; MC_L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;

	•	Output price is $40 per unit.
:&lt;math&gt; MP_L = 90 - 2L &lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 40(90 - 2L) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = 3600 - 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; MRP_L = MC_L &lt;/math&gt; (Profit Max Rule)
:&lt;math&gt; 3600 - 80L = 30 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 3570 = 80L &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt;
:44.625 is the profit maximizing number of workers.
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90L - L^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 90(44.625) - (44.625)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q= 4016.25 - 1991.39 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q = 2024.86 &lt;/math&gt;
:Thus, the profit maximizing output is 2025 units
	•	And the profit is
:&lt;math&gt; TR - TC = \Pi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 40(2025) - 30(2025) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 81,000 - 60,750 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Pi = 20,250 &lt;/math&gt;

* Some might be confused by the fact that &lt;math&gt; L = 44.625 &lt;/math&gt; as intuition would say that labor should be discrete. Remember, however, that labor is actually a time measure as well. Thus, it can be thought of as a worker not working the entire hour.

==Marginal productivity ethics==

In the aftermath of the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]] in economics, a number of economists including [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Thomas Nixon Carver]] sought to derive an ethical theory of income distribution based on the idea that workers were morally entitled to receive a wage exactly equal to their marginal product. In the 20th century, marginal productivity ethics found few supporters among economists, being criticised not only by egalitarians but by economists associated with the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago school]] such as [[Frank Knight]] (in ''The Ethics of Competition'') and the [[Austrian School]], such as [[Leland Yeager]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1663&amp;chapter=37668&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Can a Liberal Be an Equalitarian?

Yeager - Toward Liberty: Essays in Honor of Ludwig von Mises, vol. 2 |publisher=Online Library of Liberty |date=1971-09-29 |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, marginal productivity ethics were defended by [[George Stigler]].

'''Michael Zampelas''' (born 1942)&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite web|title=Elections – Nicosia candidates hopeful for success|url=http://www.hri.org/news/cyprus/cna/2001/01-12-16.cna.html|publisher=[[Cyprus News Agency]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Cypriot businessman, politician and philanthropist.

==Career==
Michael Zampelas, a Cypriot by birth was educated in the UK and became a Chartered Accountant in 1965. 

In 1970, together with his associates, he established Coopers &amp; Lybrand an accounting and consulting firm in Cyprus and Athens, thus opening new horizons for the development of the accounting profession in Cyprus and Greece.  As a result of a merger in 1998 the firm was renamed PricewaterhouseCoopers.  He served as an elected member of the board of the European Organisation of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Europe (1991-1999). Michael Zampelas served the firm as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from its establishment in 1970 until 2001 and as a non- Executive Chairman from 2002 until 2005. Today, PricewaterhouseCoopers in Cyprus employs around 1000 partners and staff. It is the leading professional services firm on the island, providing industry-focused assurance, tax, advisory services, global compliance for public and private clients.

He is the Honorary Consul General of Estonia in Cyprus, since 1997. He has contributed substantially to the development of the commercial and cultural relations between the two countries.  The President of Estonia  awarded him the title of the Order of the National Coat of Arms. 
 
Michael Zampelas, as an independent candidate, won the municipal elections and took office as the Mayor of Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, on 1 January 2002. He served as Mayor until 31 December 2006. In 2007 he was honored by the next Mayor and the Municipal Council for his services as Mayor and he was awarded the honorary medal of the city of Nicosia.
 

Parallel with his professional activities, Michael Zampelas has been developing a very intense activity for the promotion of Cyprus internationally focusing on the financial rebuild and development of the country. It is widely accepted that he puts forward suggestions to the Cyprus Government which bring about very positive financial results for Cyprus.

Furthermore, he is actively promoting Cyprus through the extensive network of PricewaterhouseCoopers worldwide and through his connections with large banking and financial organisations, law firms and other offices abroad by delivering presentations at seminars and meetings in various countries and by giving interviews in the international media. A count of around 160 such presentations all over the world was recorded in a period of 20 years.

He was one of the initiators who contributed greatly to the enhancement of the image of the accounting profession in Cyprus which is now considered by international experts as equal to that of UK, USA and other developed countries. In 2007  he was honored by the board of The Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus  for his visionary services to the accounting and auditing profession in Cyprus and in 2010 he was awarded by the same Institute the first prize for his contribution in the development  of the accounting and auditing profession and the economy of Cyprus. 

His social contribution to the educational, cultural, community and business levels has been continuous. He was honoured and decorated by a number of social and business institutions.

Michael and Loukia are great lovers of organic agriculture including the growing of organic fruits and vegetables and producers of organic poultry and eggs. 

They are also great lovers and collectors of art and have played a very important role in promoting Cypriot Art. 

In 1999, Michael Zampelas founded the company Zampelas Art with the purpose of establishing a complete Art Centre for the promotion of art and culture in Cyprus and abroad.

The company has created the Loukia and Michael Zampelas Art Museum, a non-profit private organisation, which houses the permanent collection of the Zampelas family and also organises temporary exhibitions of artists from Cyprus and abroad. 

Furthermore, other art-related ventures were created, under the brand name Zmart. These are: Zmart Education, Zmart Gallery, Zmart Shop, Zmart Café and Zmart Framing.

'''Nigerian Railway Corporation''' (commonly abbreviated as '''NRC''') is the state-owned enterprise with exclusive rights to operate railways in [[Nigeria]].

== History and legislative background ==
The Nigerian Railway Corporation traces its history to the year 1898, when the first railroad in Nigeria was constructed by the British colonial government.  On October 3, 1912 the Lagos Government Railway and the Baro-Kano Railway were amalgamated,&lt;ref name="Stocker"&gt;Stocker, John. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=Vn6CUtDOBYPMsQSTxoK4Bg&amp;id=-lEEAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Baro-Kano+Railway+amalgamation&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Nigerian+railway+amalgamation Nigerian Railway Jubilee, 1901-1951: An Illustrated and Descriptive History of the Nigerian Railway (Lagos Railway, Wushishi Tramway, Baro Kano Railway)], 1951. Retrieved November 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; starting nationwide rail service under the name Government Department of Railways.  With the passing of the Nigerian Railway Corporation Act of 1955, the company gained its current name as well as the exclusive legal right to construct and operate rail service in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="NRC Website"&gt;http://nrc-ng.org/projects/about-nrc&lt;/ref&gt; The rail network reached its maximum extent shortly after Nigerian independence, in 1964.  Shortly after that, the NRC entered a long period of decline, inept management, and eventually a complete lack of maintenance of rail and locomotive assets.  In 1988, NRC declared bankruptcy, and all rail traffic stopped for six months.  After that, trains resumed, where the tracks were usable.  By 2002, passenger service was again discontinued altogether.&lt;ref name="Nigeria World article Website"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nigeriaworld.com/articles/2006/oct/316.html|title=Nigeriaworld Feature Article -  The urgent need for rail transportation in Nigeria|website=nigeriaworld.com|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 2006, plans were made to restore the rail lines and add new locomotives with foreign assistance.  In December 2012 regular, scheduled passenger service was restored on the Lagos to Kano line.

== Infrastructure and operations ==

{{main|Rail transport in Nigeria}}

Nigerian Railway Corporation operates a network of {{convert|3505|km|mi|sp=us}} of single track lines {{RailGauge|1067mm}} [[rail gauge|gauge]], as well as {{RailGauge|standard}} from Abuja to Kaduna.

=== Stations ===

{{main|Railway stations in Nigeria}}

=== Trains ===

Trains offer relatively new rolling stock consisting of Couchette-type sleepers, air-conditioned first class sitting coaches and non-air conditioned economy class coaches. Trains to/from Lagos also offer buffet cars. Between Lagos and Ifaw, a distance of {{convert|48|km|mi|sp=us}}, a local service operates on working days on behalf of the city of Lagos.

All trains are [[diesel locomotive]] operated. The railways owns nearly 200 locomotives, of which up to 75% are not operational. It also owns about 54 [[switcher|shunters]], 480 passenger coaches and over 4900 freight wagons; less than 50% of the coaches and wagons are in serviceable conditions.

No trains have run on the [[Gusau]] branch since a bridge collapsed in Tsafe in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2010/11/rail-closure-prejudices-economy/|accessdate=2010-11-17|title=RAIL CLOSURE PREJUDICES ECONOMY | publisher =Railways Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
NRC went more than once into bankruptcy during the last 20 years. Lack of maintenance on [[infrastructure]] and [[rolling stock]] and a high number of employees the railway produced huge deficits, not taken over by the state. In 2005 after several re-organisations of the system passenger transport was reduced to four departures weekly from Lagos of which two went to Kano, one to Jos and one to Maiduguri; from Port Harcourt four trains every week ran to Kano (two weekly), one weekly to Jos and one to Maiduguri.

== Status in 2008 ==
According to the critique by Mazi Jetson Nwakwo, acting managing director of the NRC the rail system is suffering from the lack of political will by the nation's politicians. While the NRC had employed about 45,000 people between 1954 and 1975, current employment is only 6,516.&lt;ref&gt;[http://railwaysafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2229&amp;Itemid=35 Railways Africa report, accessed 2/6/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that no new wagons had been bought since 1993, and some wagons date back to 1948. Track condition limit trains to a speed of 35&amp;nbsp;km/h.

'''Norah Kathleen Barlow''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (born 1957) is a New Zealand business executive. She was formerly the managing director and chief executive of aged-care business [[Summerset Holdings|Summerset Group]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11265796|title=Queen's Birthday Honours: Norah Barlow|date=2 June 2014|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|issn=1170-0777|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women.govt.nz/news/new-chair-and-members-nacew|title=New chair and members of NACEW | publisher=Ministry for Women|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Barlow was born in [[Liverpool]], England, in 1957. Her family emigrated to New Zealand in 1960, settling in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/business/266350/summerset-ceo-down-earth|title=Summerset CEO down to earth | work=Otago Daily Times | accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow was educated at [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. After completing her first year's study full-time, she went on to study part-time while raising her children and working.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She worked in taxation at the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] and New Zealand [[Guardian Trust]], and set up her own accountancy business, Barlow and McCormack, in 1992.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ageingwellchallenge.co.nz/our-people/governance-group/|title=Governance Group – Ageing Well|website=www.ageingwellchallenge.co.nz|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Barlow's firm was hired in 1993 by the founder of Summerset Group, John O'Sullivan, to provide accountancy services.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She moved to Summerset full-time in 1999, becoming the group accountant. She became CEO in 2001.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insitemagazine.co.nz/issues/march-2014/norah-barlow-and-julian-cook/#.V4oCTPl97IU|title=INsite asks incoming and outgoing Summerset chief executives their thoughts...|website=www.insitemagazine.co.nz|date=March 2014|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time as CEO, Barlow grew the business from a small network of seven villages in the lower North Island to a nationwide group of 17 villages. In 2011 Barlow led the company through the [[initial public offering]] (IPO) process on the [[New Zealand Exchange|New Zealand Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the company was listed, she became one of only two female chief executives of NZX companies, the other being [[Theresa Gattung]] of [[Spark New Zealand|Telecom New Zealand]].

During her career, she held the position of president of the Retirement Village Association for seven years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also chaired the committee that developed the 2008 Code of Practice for retirement villages in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Barlow retired from her position at Summerset at the end of 2013, but remains on the board as a director.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She holds directorships and advisory positions with a number of business and community organisations, including the Wellington regional netball board, life insurance company [[Cigna]], and retirement community business Ingenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mynetball.co.nz/zones/central/community-netball/news/3641-norah-barlow-appointed-to-netball-central-zone-board.html|title=Norah Barlow Appointed to Netball Central Zone Board|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1403/S00998/norah-barlow-appointed-non-executive-director.htm|title=Norah Barlow appointed Non-Executive Director | work=Scoop Independent News | accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barlow has frequently commented on the unconscious bias of recruitment and promotion that often leads to women being overlooked. She has served on the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women for the [[Ministry of Women's Affairs (New Zealand)|Ministry of Women's Affairs]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''open music model''' is an economic and technological framework for the [[recording industry]] based on research conducted at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It predicts that the playback of prerecorded music will be regarded as a service rather than as individually sold products, and that the only system for the [[digital distribution]] of music that will be viable against piracy is a subscription-based system supporting [[file sharing]] and free of [[digital rights management]]. The research also indicated that [[United States dollar|US$]]9 per month for unlimited use would be the [[market clearing]] price at that time, but recommended $5 per month as the long-term optimal price.&lt;ref name=MIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/8438|title=Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models|author=[[Shuman Ghosemajumder]]|publisher=[[MIT Sloan School of Management]]|date=May 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its creation in 2002, a number of its principles have been adopted throughout the recording industry,&lt;ref name=irunway&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-runway.com/blog/on-demand-music-streaming-to-battle-piracy/|title=On-Demand Music Streaming to battle Piracy|author=Gautham Somraj Koorma|publisher=[[iRunway]]|date=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been cited as the basis for the business model of many [[Comparison of on-demand streaming music services|music subscription services]].&lt;ref name=lespresso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/affari/2014/07/01/news/spotify-il-business-folle-sbarca-a-wall-street-1.171553|title=Spotify, il business folle sbarca a Wall Street|author=Marco Consoli|publisher=[[L'Espresso]]|date=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazeta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologie.gazeta.pl/internet/1,104665,18056619,Dla_uzytkownikow_streaming_muzyki_jest_spelnieniem.html|title=Dla użytkowników streaming muzyki jest spełnieniem marzeń, a dla wytwórni – źródłem obaw|author=Karol Kopańko|publisher=[[Gazeta.pl]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model asserts that there are five [[necessary and sufficient|necessary]] requirements for a viable commercial music digital distribution network:
{| class="wikitable"
! # !! style="width: 20%;" | Requirement !! Description
|-
| 1 || Open file sharing || users must be free to [[file sharing|share files]] with each other
|-
| 2 || Open file formats || content must be distributed in open formats with no [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions
|-
| 3 || Open membership || [[copyright]] holders must be able to freely register to receive payment
|-
| 4 || Open payment || payment should be accepted via multiple means, not a closed system
|-
| 5 || Open competition || multiple such systems must exist which can interoperate, not a designed monopoly
|}The model was proposed by [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] in his 2002 research paper ''Advanced Peer-Based Technology Business Models''&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt; at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. The following year, it was publicly referred to as the Open Music Model.&lt;ref name="opensource"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.com/life/11/11/drm-graveyard-brief-history-digital-rights-management-music|title=The DRM graveyard: A brief history of digital rights management in music|author=Ruth Suehle|publisher=[[Red Hat]] Magazine|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model suggests changing the way consumers interact with the digital property market: rather than being seen as a good to be purchased from online vendor, music would be treated as a service being provided by the industry, with firms based on the model serving as intermediaries between the music industry and its consumers. The model proposed giving consumers unlimited access to music for the price of [[United States dollar|US$]]5 per month&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt; (as of 2002), based on research showing that this could be a long-term optimal price, expected to bring in a total revenue of over [[United States dollar|US$]]3&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research demonstrated the demand for third-party file sharing programs. Insofar as the interest for a particular piece of digital property is high, and the risk of acquiring the good via illegitimate means is low, people will naturally flock towards third-party services such as [[Napster]] and Morpheus (more recently, [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]] and [[The Pirate Bay]]).&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

The research showed that consumers would use file sharing services not primarily due to cost but because of convenience, indicating that services which provided access to the most music would be the most successful.&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

== Industry adoption ==
The model predicted the failure of [[digital distribution|online music distribution]] systems based on [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref name=opensource /&gt;&lt;ref name=CollectiveCopyright&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602197|title=Collective Copyright|author1=Emanuele Lunadei |author2=Christian Valdiva Torres |author3=Erik Cambria |publisher=[[International World Wide Web Conference]] 2014|date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms of the model included that it would not eliminate the issue of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/120018441/Music-Distribution-Technology-and-the-Value-of-Art-in-Society|title=Music Distribution: Technology and the Value of Art in Society|author=Sungwon Peter Choe|publisher=[[KAIST]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others countered that it was in fact the most viable solution to piracy,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|title=Open music model|author=Andrew Traub|publisher=US Intellectual Property Law|date=November 25, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101061826/http://www.iplawintheus.com/open-music-model/|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; since piracy was "inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cse.tkk.fi/Datacommunications/Doctoral_dissertations/Lic-Yrjo_Raivio.pdf | title=Mobile Services and the Internet: A Study of Emerging Business Models|author=Yrjö Raivio|publisher=[[Helsinki University of Technology]]|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argued that it offered a superior alternative to the current [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|law-enforcement based methods]] used by the recording industry.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://mujlt.law.muni.cz/storage/1234798737_sb_06_myska.pdf|title=Flat Fee Music|author=Matěj Myška|publisher=[[Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology]]|date=December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718175953/http://mujlt.law.muni.cz/storage/1234798737_sb_06_myska.pdf|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One startup in Germany, Playment, announced plans to adapt the entire model to a commercial setting as the basis for its business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playment.net/solution/index.html|title=Playment – Our Solution|author=Playment|publisher=playment.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several aspects of the model have been adopted by the recording industry and its partners over time:

|quote=Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven't worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy.
|source=– [[Steve Jobs]], ''Thoughts on Music''&lt;ref name=stevejobs /&gt; open letter, 2007
}}

* The abolition of digital rights management represented a major shift for the industry. In 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], published a letter&lt;ref name=stevejobs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/kr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/|title=Thoughts on Music|author=[[Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for an end to DRM in music. A few months later, [[Amazon.com]] launched a store single individual DRM-free mp3's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/amazon_mp3.php|title=Amazon MP3 Launches DRM-Free Music Store|author=Marshall Kirkpatrick|publisher=[[ReadWriteWeb]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, iTunes Store abolished DRM on most of its individual tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137946/2009/01/itunestore.html|title=iTunes Store goes DRM-free|author=Peter Cohen|publisher=[[MacWorld]]|date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open payment was relatively straightforward to implement, and the [[iTunes Store]] offered gift cards, which could be purchased with cash, from its launch in 2003.
* In 2010, [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] announced a download ability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1627779/rhapsody-streaming-music-mp3-playlists-iphone-itunes-apple-ipad-entertainment|title=Rhapsody First Subscription Service in U.S. to Offer Offline Music on iPhone|author=Kit Eaton|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their subscribers using [[iPhones]].
* In 2011, Apple launched its [[iTunes Match]] service with a subscription model, supporting file-sharing between a user's own devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erikras.com/2011/11/16/cloud-music-and-itunes-match/|title=Cloud Music and iTunes Match|author=Erik Rasmussen|date=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subscription price did not include the cost of acquiring content, which would still have to be purchased on a per track basis from the iTunes Store.
* Pricing close to the model's suggested $5 per month price, or its $9 per month market clearing price, has been adopted by many platforms:
** In 2005, [[Yahoo! Music]] was launched at $5 per month with [[digital rights management]].
** In 2011, [[Spotify]] introduced a $5 per month premium subscription in the United States with [[digital rights management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/07/spotify-launches-in-the-u-s-at-last/|title=Spotify Launches in the U.S at Last|author=Charlie Sorrel|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2011, [[Microsoft]] [[Zune]] offered a subscription service for music downloads with [[digital rights management]] known as a [[Zune Pass]], at $10 a month.
** in 2012, [[Google Play Music]] launched unlimited music streaming for a subscription price of $9.99 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/06/24/first-look---google-play-music-has-1000s-of-free-music-playlists/29220015/|title=First Look – Google Play Music has 1000s of free music playlists|author=Jefferson Graham|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can upload their own MP3s to the service and download them, but cannot download songs they have not uploaded themselves.
** In 2014, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added DRM music streaming to their Amazon Prime service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.windowsobserver.com/2014/06/12/the-gotchas-of-the-amazon-prime-music-service/&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 2015, Apple announced [[Apple Music]], which would offer unlimited streaming of songs encrypted with [[FairPlay]] DRM for a subscription price of $9.99 per month, and compensate artists on the basis of song popularity. Apple reportedly wanted to enter the market with a lower price but was pressured by record labels to adopt a higher subscription fee.&lt;ref name="Verge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8729481/apple-music-streaming-service-wwdc-15 |accessdate=June 8, 2015 |title=Apple announces its streaming music service, Apple Music |last1=Popper |first1=Ben |last2=Singleton |first2=Micah |date=June 8, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8hZFUn5?url=http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8729481/apple-music-streaming-service-wwdc-15 |archivedate=June 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paracopyright''' ("pseudocopyright" or "metacopyright") is legal protection above and beyond traditional [[copyright]]. The most often cited example is "legal protection for technical measures" from the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]] Internet treaties. Paracopyright provisions in these treaties are not about the term or scope of copyright, but instead are about providing legal protections for the technologies that may be used by copyright holders. 

Paracopyrights afford legal protection to technologies that claim to be used to protect copyrights, but that are ineffective in that goal. A technical measure can not stop a technically sophisticated person who wishes to infringe copyright.  To use the "digital locks" analogy, there is no need to "pick the lock" as the keys necessary to decode the content are embedded within authorized access technology.  Both the locked content and the technology containing the key are commercially available to an infringer.  Once a single person decodes a technical measure, the decoded content can be made available to others in the same way as if the technical measure never existed.

The effect of these technical measures are to impose specific contractual [[license agreement]]s on those conforming to copyright law. As a concept, therefore, paracopyrights are perhaps better understood as a part of [[contract law]] and not copyright law. Unfortunately, important regulations regarding consumer protection and the "freedom to contract" are not imported directly into paracopyright laws, potentially creating imbalances in the law and harmful [[unintended consequence]]s.

Copyright is traditionally understood as a statutorily defined [[Bundle of rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] provided to copyright holders. An [[Copyright infringement|infringement of copyright]] takes place when someone exercises one or more of the copyright holder’s exclusive rights without his or her permission. Anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions do not fit under this paradigm of a bundle of exclusive rights. On one hand, a copyright owner has the exclusive right to copy his or her work, and that exclusive right is infringed when someone else copies the work without permission. It is quite another story, however, to think about copyright holders having the exclusive right to circumvent TPMs ([[Technical Protection Measure]]) that they apply to their works, and the exclusive right to make and distribute devices that enable or facilitate circumvention of TPMs.  Even assuming that this problem could be overcome, attempting to force anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions to fit the mold of the [[bundle of rights]] paradigm seems to necessitate adding a number of related rights to the bundle, including the exclusive right to apply a TPM to a copyright work.

'''Patricia Quintana Fernández''' (28 October 1946 – 26 November 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/obituaries/wolfgang-zuckermann-dead.html |title=Patricia Quintana, Champion of Mexican Cuisine, Dies at 72 |first=Tejal |last=Rao |date=November 29, 2018 |work= | website = nytimes.com |accessdate=November 30, 2018|archive-url= http://archive.fo/esbey |archive-date= 2018-11-30 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was a Mexican [[chef]], writer, businesswoman and professor. She was a recognized international cook and expert in Mexican gastronomy.

== Biography ==
Patricia Quintana was a specialist in Mexican regional cooking who was born in México and studied abroad in Canada, Switzerland and France — later returning to Mexico as a recognized chef. She studied and taught ancestral [[Mexican cuisine]] mixed with the classical cuisine. She was the owner of the restaurant Izote in [[Mexico City|City of Mexico]] from 2001 to the 2013, but resigned to start a banquet catering company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.starchefs.com/chefs/PQuintana/html/bio.shtml|title = Patricia Quintana Biografía|author = Start Chefs|location = United States|date = |access-date = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/76558.html|title = El Izote renace|author = El Universal|location = México|date = 28 February 2013|access-date = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the creator of the brand of dressings "Gavilla", a brand under which today has about 16 products. She directed the menus that were served aboard Mexican airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.madridfusion.net/chefs_largo.php?id=0000000095|title = Una cocinera mexicana en busca del tiempo perdido|author = Madrid Fusión|location = Spain|date = |access-date = 28 July 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She collaborated in many television programs and wrote articles about cuisine for several newspapers and magazines, both domestic and international.

She was the mother of Patricio Pasquel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.soyentrepreneur.com/21998-liderazgo-con-sello-propio.html|title = Patricia Quintana: Liderazgo con sello propio|author = soyentrepreneur|location = México|date = 28 August 2012|access-date = 28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia passed away at the age of 72, on Nov 26 2018 of natural causes.

== Prizes and honours ==

Baccaglini is an eccentric personality, known for his career in television.&lt;ref name="lemons"&gt;{{cite web|title=Said &amp; Done: ‘He will be a serious president. I leave Palermo in safe hands’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/12/said-and-done-football-diary-carlo-tavecchio-fifa-palermo|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, he made news by attempting to acquire the Palermo soccer club from former owner [[Maurizio Zamparini]]; the takeover, originally agreed in March 2017, was called off by June of the same year before being finalized.

== Biography ==
Raised in the [[United States]] with an [[United States|American]] father and [[Italy|Italian]] mother, Baccaglini was born in [[Chicago]] but spent most of his youth in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Baccaglini's mother came to the [[United States]] to study [[Neuroscience|Neurobiology]] at [[Harvard University]], while his father is from Washington. His parents separated when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Il Palermo? Come una bella donna da conquistare|url=https://www.vanityfair.it/news/sport/17/03/22/paul-baccaglini-chi-presidente-palermo-iene-pif-intervista|language=it|publisher=Vanity Fair Italia|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from high school, Baccaglini later moved to his mother's native Italy to pursue a career in [[Basketball]]. Baccaglini played two years with the Serie C Gold Unione Basket Padova basketball club from 2002 to 2003,&lt;ref name="basketball"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Baccaglini Player Profile|url=http://basketball.eurobasket.com/player/Paul-Baccaglini/Italy/Unione-Basket-Padova/50810|publisher=Euro Basket|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding his brief career with the Solesino basketball club.

=== Television Personality ===
Leaving behind his sporting career, Baccaglini transitioned into work in radio, working for [[Radio Padova]] as host of the program "The Groove" for three years on RTL 102.5. Following his success in radio, Baccaglini began work for [[MTV]] and [[Italia 1]], appearing regularly on the program Le Iene, on which he interviewed numerous personalities in politics. Baccaglini was known for his use of sarcasm and irony, and the program was well-known for deploying its hosts to dupe public figures for comic effect.&lt;ref name="leIene"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palermo chaos continues despite Zamparini supposedly stepping back|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/20/palermo-maurizio-zamparini-chaos-serie-a|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baccaglini claimed in an interview with ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' that he has more than 60 tattoos.&lt;ref name="negoc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baccaglini: 'Palermo collaboration'|url=http://www.football-italia.net/99841/baccaglini-palermo-collaboration|publisher=Football Italia|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Città di Palermo===

Baccaglini negotiated the purchase of [[U.S. Città di Palermo]] in secret for more than one year before finally coming to terms with former owner [[Maurizio Zamparini]] in March 2017.&lt;ref name="negoc" /&gt; As part of the agreement, he was named as club chairman until the takeover was not finalized. In his initial press conference, he declared that his goal was to bring Palermo to be one of the best teams in [[Serie A]], and to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

Baccaglini claims that an investment in the club is better than investing in [[Chelsea F.C.]] due to the potential higher return on investment.&lt;ref name="chelsea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Palermo are a better investment than Premier League leaders Chelsea, says new club president Paul Baccaglini|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4309904/Better-invest-Palermo-Chelsea-says-Baccaglini.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his initial enthusiasm for the potential takeover, Palermo's win-loss record did not improve enough to prevent the club from relegating to [[Serie B]] for the 2017-18 season.

On 4 July 2017, Baccaglini resigned as Palermo chairman, falling back into the hands of Zamparini, after the necessary funds were not in place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-italia.net/105234/baccaglini-resigns-palermo-president&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">In financial markets '''payment for order flow''' refers to the compensation that a [[Stockbroker|broker]] receives, not from its client, but from a third party that wants to influence how the broker routes client orders.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/answers/payordf.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, [[market maker]]s such as [[Broker-dealer|dealers]] and [[securities exchange]]s are willing to pay a broker for the right to transact with that broker's clients because they believe those clients will be uninformed traders—retail or other investors who are trading because of emotion or the need to raise cash and not because they know an asset is misvalued.&lt;ref&gt;Div. of Mkt. Reg., SEC, [https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/market2000.pdf Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments], 22 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

By purchasing what it expects to be uninformed order flow, a market-maker can buy at the [[bid price|bid]] and sell at the [[ask price|ask]] with less risk of trading at a loss than with an informed trader who knows that the market is mispricing the security.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Larry |title=Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2003 |pages=155, 518–519 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&amp;q=Madoff#search_anchor |isbn=0195144708 |accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, market-makers who pay for order flow can capture the [[bid-offer spread|spread]] while reducing the risk that the spread is too narrow to adequately compensate them for the risk of loss.

==History==
Payment for order flow was a practice pioneered by [[Bernard Madoff]], and the practice has long been controversial.&lt;ref name="FTFarrell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grasso"&gt;{{cite news | last =Frank | first =Allan Dodd | title =Former NYSE Chairman Grasso Speaks, Part II | work =The [[Daily Beast]] | pages = |publisher = | date =March 31, 2009 | url =http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-31/former-nyse-chairman-grasso-speaks-part-ii/full/ | accessdate =April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAlpha"&gt;{{cite web | last =Pellecchia | first =Ray | title ='Payment for Order Flow': Madoff's Earlier Days
 | work =Seeking Alpha| publisher = | date =December 30, 2008 | url =http://seekingalpha.com/article/112537-payment-for-order-flow-madoff-s-earlier-days | accessdate =April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing payment for order flow, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] sought permission from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) to allow payment for order flow on its electronic exchange(s).&lt;ref name="NyseSEC"&gt;{{cite web | last =NYSE Alternext US, LLC | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Proposed Rule Change Amending Schedule of Fees and Charges for Exchange  Services | work =www.sec.gov | publisher =U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | date =February 27, 2009 | url =https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysealtr/2009/34-59478.pdf| format =PDF | doi = | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NYSE is proposing to pay for [[limit order]]s in order to put more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of payment for order flow that pays only for [[market order]]s.  
Payment for order flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the [[tick size]] and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, payments for order flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FTFarrell"&gt;{{cite news 
  | last =Farrell  | first =Greg  | title =SEC inaction that helped fuel scheme  | work =[[Financial Times]]
  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =  | date =December 23, 2008 
  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c510411e-d12e-11dd-8cc3-000077b07658.html  | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of [[E-Trade]]'s transaction revenue came from payment for order flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt;

==Analysis==
The benign view is that in competitive markets, the payments that brokers receive for selling uninformed order flow reduce commissions for retail investors so that the retail investors are no worse off.&lt;ref name="TnEHarris" /&gt; Payment for order flow may also allow smaller [[trading venue]]s to compete more effectively with the NYSE.&lt;ref name="Joel Seligman 2002"&gt;Joel Seligman, "Rethinking Securities Markets", 57 ''Bus. Law''. 665 (2001-2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more negative view is that exchanges and other market-makers who pay for order flow reduce [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] on exchanges that do not pay for order flow and thus increase the bid–ask spread. This means that traders whose orders do not receive payment bear the cost to their detriment.&lt;ref name="CNNfn"&gt;{{cite web | last =McMillan | first =Alex Frew|title =Q&amp;A: Madoff talks trading, The founder of one of Wall Street's big market makers goes one-on-one | work =CNNMoney| date =May 29, 2000 | url =http://money.cnn.com/2000/05/29/investing/q_madoff/ | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes122008"&gt;{{cite news | last =Henriques | first =Diana B. |  title =Madoff Scheme Kept Rippling Outward, Across Borders| work =[[New York Times]] | date =December 19, 2008 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/20/business/20madoff.html?pagewanted=2 | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel Seligman]] has noted that "Few practices are more likely to subvert quote competition" than payment for order flow.&lt;ref name="Joel Seligman 2002"/&gt; [[John C. Coffee]] has described it as a "bribe".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Coffee, "Brokers and Bribery", ''N.Y.L.J.'' Sept. 27, 1990 at 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes, however, that the SEC permits the practice because it sustained competitors to the NYSE and reduces the likelihood that NYSE specialists will obtain monopoly power.&lt;ref&gt;John. C. Coffee and Hillary A. Sale, ''Securities Regulation'', p. 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
In the United States, accepting payment for order flow is only allowed if no other trading venue is quoting a better price on the [[National Market System]]. Moreover, the broker must inform its client in writing that it accepts payment for order flow:
* Upon the opening of the [[brokerage account]]
* On an ongoing annual basis
* On trade confirmations&lt;ref name="SECpfof"&gt;{{cite web
  | last =  | first = | title =Payment for Order Flow  | work =www.sec.gov
  | publisher =[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] 
  | url =https://www.sec.gov/answers/payordf.htm  | doi =  | accessdate =April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The notification on trade confirmations may read as follows "[Brokerage] receives remuneration for directing orders to particular broker/dealers or market centers for execution. Such remuneration is considered compensation to the firm and the source and amount of any compensation received by the firm in connection with your transaction will be disclosed upon request."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Pearse Lyons'''&lt;ref&gt;Name confirmed 20 May 2014, by Lynne Adderton, Alumni and Business Engagement, University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; (3 August 1944 – 8 March 2018) was an Irish businessman and the founder and President of [[Kentucky]]-based [[Alltech]] Inc., an American global animal health and nutrition company that is centred on innovation, research and development.&lt;ref name="Who's who" /&gt; Lyons was considered an "entrepreneur, salesman, marketer and scientist all rolled into one", and was widely regarded in the agribusiness sector as an innovator and industry leader.&lt;ref name="Who's who"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's Who in Irish Business, 2010|url=http://Businessandfinance.ie|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=Business and Finance|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623035043/http://www.businessandfinance.ie/|archivedate=23 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Lyons was born and raised in [[Dundalk]], [[County Louth]].&lt;ref name=Reflection /&gt; He graduated from [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) with a first class honours degree in [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="Who's who" /&gt; He worked in [[Harp Lager]] in Dundalk while at college. Lyons also graduated with a Master of Science in Brewing Science from the [[British School of Malting and Brewing]] (now the [[School of Biochemistry]]&lt;ref&gt;School name confirmed 20 May 2014, by Lynne Adderton, Alumni and Business Engagement, University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt;), [[University of Birmingham]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Degree confirmed 20 May 2014, by Lynne Adderton, Alumni and Business Engagement, University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 Lyons received a PhD Biochemistry, also from the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He later started an MBA at UCD, but didn't complete it.&lt;ref name="The Lyons share" /&gt; He moved to [[Irish Distillers]], which he described as his 'dream job'.&lt;ref name="The Lyons share" /&gt;

Lyons received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www1.hw.ac.uk/committees/court/minutes/min131204.pdf|title = HW Minutes 2004|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alltech==

His work led to him to [[Kentucky]] in 1976, and, in 1980, Lyons set up Alltech in his garage.&lt;ref name=Reflection&gt;{{cite news|title=Dr. Pearse Lyons; A Reflection in the Mirror|newspaper=Irish Examiner|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an initial investment of $10,000 and enough money set aside to pay the mortgage and buy groceries for the family for a year (by this stage he was married with two children), Lyons used his [[fermentation]] expertise to continue helping brewers.&lt;ref name=Reflection /&gt;"We started in October and we were in profit by Christmas," he says. "We had to be in profit by Christmas.&lt;ref name="The Lyons share"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Lyons Share Just keeps on growing|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Not only was Lyons in profit by Christmas, but he did a million dollars' worth of business in his first year.&lt;ref name="The Lyons share" /&gt; Lyons then turned his attention to animal feed in the belief that [[yeasts]], [[enzymes]] and certain bacteria could help animals use feed more efficiently – a concept which was not new but lacked scientific data and research.&lt;ref name=Dundalk&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundalk Democrat|newspaper=Dundalk Democrat|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "And that first million became two ... We have never, ever had a month where Alltech has not made a profit, a good profit," he said. "We've been growing at 20 percent for the best part of 30 years.&lt;ref name=Reflection /&gt; " By 1985, the animal nutrition side of the business had superseded the alcohol side in importance "even though there are similarities between the products on both sides," according to Lyons.&lt;ref name=Reflection /&gt; Today, the company is a global animal health company, employing more than 3,000 people with a presence in 128 countries and offices in 85 countries, including North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/gavin-megaw/growing-your-reputation-t_b_3394720.html|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons has built Alltech into the fastest growing company in the global animal health industry through innovative technology, creative marketing, and strong branding.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://Harvardcasestudies.com|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is growing rapidly in the Chinese market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2011-09/23/content_13775959.htm |title=Alltech aims to build Chinese revenue to $1b by '15 |publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alltech was the title sponsor of the [[2010 FEI World Equestrian Games]] held in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topsinlex.com/Read/3057/Alltech's+Dr.+Pearse+Lyons|title=Lexington, KY|first=Tops in Lex|last=Contributor|website=www.topsinlex.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was both the company and the event’s first title sponsorship.The company invested more than $32 million plus event staffing into the 2010 edition of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronofhorse.com/article/pearse-lyons-sees-opportunities-everywhere?page=2|title=Pearse Lyons Sees Opportunities Everywhere|website=www.chronofhorse.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alltech also committed to sponsor the next edition in France, the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2013/04/09/alltech-opens-office-weg-normandy/#axzz2W5rmgP00|title=Alltech opens office in WEG 2014 Normandy HQ - Horsetalk.co.nz|date=9 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 saw Alltech open one of the largest commercial algae production sites in the world.

The ''Pearse Lyons Distillery'' opened in a converted church on Dublin's Thomas Street in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.alltech.com/uk/news/alltech-announce-pearse-lyons-distillery|title=Alltech Announce Pearse Lyons Distillery|last=|first=|date=18 March 2016|website=global.alltech.com|publisher=|access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/news/business/bourbon-industry/article44469639.html|title=Alltech's Irish distillery goes Gothic with restoration of Anglican church|last=|first=|date=3 February 2014|website=www.kentucky.com|publisher=|access-date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lyons's day started at 3.50am, giving him a five-hour head start on the company’s global headquarters in Kentucky, where he was based. One of the first things he did was put in a call to the company's European headquarters in [[Dunboyne]], [[County Meath]].&lt;ref name="The Lyons share" /&gt; Lyons ran every morning, regardless of where he was working.&lt;ref name="The Lyons share" /&gt;  Lyons also established Alltech’s [[Lexington Brewing and Distilling Company]], which includes a line of beers – Kentucky Ale, Kentucky Light, Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale and Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout – and spirits including Town Branch Bourbon, Pearse Lyons Reserve malt whiskey and Bluegrass Sundown, a bourbon-infused coffee drink. In 2012, Alltech partnered with Ireland’s Carlow Brewing Company to begin distilling its first genuine Irish whiskey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dairybusiness.com/seo/article.php?title=alltech-s-dr-pearse-lyons-named-ireland-s-bus&amp;date=2012-12-21#ixzz2W5j5CQtH� {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053120/http://dairybusiness.com/seo/article.php?title=alltech-s-dr-pearse-lyons-named-ireland-s-bus&amp;date=2012-12-21 |date=8 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Alltech and the Muhammad Ali Center announced the creation of a joint charitable fund, the Alltech-Muhammad Ali Center Global Education and Charitable Fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30831794/ns/us_news-giving/t/muhammad-ali-appears-charity-event/&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons’ wealth was estimated to be in the region of €1.5bn &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/richest-300-irish-now-worth-62bn-26835339.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Richest 300 Irish now worth €62bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Sunday Times Rich List&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-sunday-times-rich-list-2012-jbm3mppw3hd|title=The Sunday Times Rich List 2012|first=The Sunday|last=Times|date=29 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=9 March 2018|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the sixth richest Irish person in 2012.

'''''Pizza Tycoon''''' (known as '''''Pizza Connection''''' in Europe) is a [[business simulation game|business simulation video game]]. The game was designed by the German company Cybernetic Corporation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/spiele/gallery120615650/Das-sind-die-besten-deutschen-Computerspiele.html Das sind die besten deutschen Computerspiele] on [[welt.de]] "1994: Pizza Connection" (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Software 2000]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurogamer.de/articles/2017-01-05-pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich pizza-connection-1-und-2-auf-gog-com-erhaeltlich] on [[Eurogamer]] by Benjamin Jakobs (05/01/2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and was published by Assemble Entertainment after its re-release in 2017. It was published and adapted for the American market by [[MicroProse]] with changed artwork and locations.

== Gameplay ==
The game is centered on being the manager of a [[pizza]] [[restaurant]] in a town in [[Europe]] or the [[United States|U.S.]]. It gives the player the option to choose among more than thirty different characters, to create one's own pizza, have cooking contests and modify the display of the restaurant and kitchen. The player can call upon local [[mafia]] to sabotage competitor restaurants or get money from criminal activities such as weapon and [[drug deal]]ing.

The game displays a playful sense of humor from the graphics and cartoonish drawings, game messages, and animated faces that are put on interacting characters. The original European version ("Pizza Connection") featured a graphical style very similar to [[MAD magazine|MAD]] artist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]].&lt;ref name="greer"/&gt; Microprose's adapted version ("Pizza Tycoon") for the American market distanced itself from this style due to copyright concerns with newly created characters in a different style modeled after famous people as [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]] or [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name="greer"&gt;[http://www.terrygreer.com/microprosemisc.html ''Terry Greer's Microprose Misc graphics page'' Page] the Microprose artist who worked on the conversion from the original German game.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Pizza Tycoon'' was followed by ''Pizza Tycoon 2'', developed by [[Software 2000]].

Both games were released on [[GOG.com]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.destructoid.com/the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com-409984.phtml the-delightfully-odd-pizza-tycoon-is-now-on-gog-com] on [[Destructoid]] by Jordan Devore (2017-01-05)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The [[Amiga Joker]] 2/94 magazine gave ''Pizza Connection'' 88 of 100%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&amp;id=12291&amp;s=2 Pizza Connection review] on Amiga Joker (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Powerplay magazin rated the Amiga version 82 of 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultpower.de/powerplay_testbericht_extern.php3?im=pizzaconnection.jpg Pizza connection] on PowerPlay (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that "Not a game for die hard action fans, but a winner for just about everyone else."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard "Dick" Baker''' (September 3, 1946 &amp;ndash; April 14, 2009) was an  [[United States|American]] businessman and [[surfing|surf]] apparel executive for [[Ocean Pacific]]. Baker helped to shape the surf apparel industry as president and chief executive of Ocean Pacific, also known as OP.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam|last=Tschorn|title=Richard Baker dies at 62; former Ocean Pacific president bridged surf industry and Wall Street|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dick-baker16-2009apr16,0,648591.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-04-16|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baker was born on September 3, 1946 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He grew up in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and earned his bachelor's degree from  [[California State University, Northridge]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Career===
Baker first entered the apparel industry as a college student.  He became a [[buyer]] at a men's specialty store to pay for school.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He later became a buyer for the now defunct [[Bullock's]] [[department store]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker became head of the [[Marithé François Girbaud]]'s U.S. division, based in [[New York City]], in 1980.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He gradually moved on to head other clothing brands.  In 1983, Baker became the president and [[chief executive]] of [[Izod|Izod Ltd]].'s [[Fashion|menswear]] division.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He became president of [[Esprit Sport]] in 1986 before later moving on to become the head of [[Tommy Hilfiger]]'s women's clothing division.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Ocean Pacific===
In 1998, Baker and his partners at the Doyle &amp; Boissiere investment group, which is based in [[Burlingame, California]], acquired the [[Ocean Pacific]] heritage surf [[brand]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Ocean Pacific was in financial trouble at the time as [[consumer preference]]s had changed over the years.

Baker became the chief executive of Ocean Pacific following the 1998 acquisition.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He was able to successfully revive the flagging label.  Under his helm, Baker led Ocean Pacific through two sales.  The first was to [[Warnaco Group]] in 2004, which acquired Ocean Pacific for $40 million.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The second sale, in 2006, was to [[Iconix Brand Group]], a [[surf wear]] maker, for an estimated $54 million.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker remained the president of Ocean Pacific until he stepped down in 2006, and continued as a [[consultant]] with the company until 2007.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Surf Industry Manufacturers Association===
Baker joined the board of directors of the [[Surf Industry Manufacturers Association]] ([[SIMA]]), based in [[Aliso Viejo, California]], in 2000 while he was the chief executive of Ocean Pacific.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He served as the head of SIMA for nine years before becoming the chairman [[emeritus]] of the organization.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that as head of SIMA, Baker directed the business of "selling [[Surfing|surf]] to the suits" in the larger business community.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He also served as a mentor to the CEOs and heads of other surf oriented apparel brands. [[Fernando Aguerre]], the co-founder of [[Reef (company)|Reef]] clothing company and current chief executive of [[Liquid Tribe]], later called Baker, "part father, part brother and part friend."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

In a speech to a surf insutry gathering in  [[San José del Cabo]], [[Mexico]], in May 2005, Baker told attendees that, "Surf is on the [[world stage]], and this hard-core, laid-back industry has been discovered by the suits. The non- endemic business types see this as an area of growth, and if you see this as a threat, then get a life -- it's a compliment."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker also told the surf industry to use their influence to do good works saying in 2006, "Pick your spot and make a difference...Whether you're big or small, give back what you can."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Death===
Richard Baker died on April 14, 2009, at [[Mission Hospital]] in [[Mission Viejo, California]], after a two-year battle with cancer.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He was 62 years old and was survived by his wife of 19 years, Una Baker; sons, Ryan and Jack; his father, Donald Baker, and his sister, Donna Smith Vigil.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

The Surf Industry Manufacturers Association announced that its plans to honor Baker with its Lifetime Achievement Award at its 20th annual [[Waterman's Ball]] in August 2009.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

[[Richard Woolcott]], the founder and CEO of [[Volcom]] told the ''LA Times'', "Dick was a great friend, [[mentor]] and [[role model]] to many of us in the industry. He understood the magic of [[action sports]] and helped us harness it into big-picture thinking and execution. But most of all, he was a wonderful human being with a loving heart and spirit. He was always supportive in what we were doing, lending his advice and positive feedback. He was a blessing to this industry and will be deeply missed."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Fernando Aguerre, founder of Reef, said in reaction to Baker's death, "And I feel like an orphan today."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

'''Service innovation''' is used to refer to many things. These include but not limited to:

# [[Innovation]] in [[Service (economics)|services]], in ''service products''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved service products (commodities or public services). Often this is contrasted with “[[technological innovation]]”, though service products can have technological elements. This sense of service innovation is closely related to [[service design]] and "new service development".
# Innovation in ''service processes''&amp;nbsp;– new or improved ways of designing and producing services. This may include innovation in service delivery systems, though often this will be regarded instead as a service product innovation. Innovation of this sort may be technological, technique- or expertise-based,or a matter of work organization (e.g. restructuring work between professionals and [[paraprofessional]]s).
# Innovation in ''service firms'', organizations, and industries&amp;nbsp;– organizational innovations, as well as service product and process innovations, and the management of innovation processes, within service organizations.

== Definitions ==
The [[Finland|Finnish]] research agency [[Tekes (agency)|TEKES]] defines service innovation as "a new or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept or a combination of them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them. A service innovation benefits both the service producer and customers and it improves its developer’s competitive edge. A service innovation is a service product or service process that is based on some technology or systematic method. In services however, the innovation does not necessarily relate to the novelty of the technology itself but the innovation often lies in the non-technological areas. Service innovations can for instance be new solutions in the customer interface, new distribution methods, novel application of technology in the service process, new forms of operation with the supply chain or new ways to organize and manage services."

Another definition proposed by Van Ark et al. (2003){{ref|vanark}} states it as a "new or considerably changed service concept, client interaction channel, service delivery system or technological concept that individually, but most likely in combination, leads to one or more (re)new(ed) service functions that are new to the firm and do change the service/good offered on the market and do require structurally new technological, human or organizational capabilities of the service organization." This definition covers the notions of technological and non-technological innovation. Non-technological innovations in services mainly arise from investment in intangible inputs.

== Service Innovation Research ==
Many literatures on what makes for successful innovations of this kind comes from the New Service Development research field (e.g. Johne and Storey, 1998;{{ref|Johne_Storey}} Nijssen et al., 2006{{ref|Nijssen}}). Service design practitioners have also extensively discussed the features of effective service products and experiences. One of the key aspects of many service activities is the high involvement of the client/customer/user in the production of the final service. Without this co-production (i.e. interactivity of service production), the service would often not be created. This co-production, together with the intangibility of many service products, causes service innovation to often take forms rather different from those familiar through studies of innovation in manufacturing. Innovation researchers have, for this reason, stressed that much service innovation is hard to capture in traditional categories like product or process innovation. The co-production process, and the interactions between service provider and client, can also form the focus of innovation. A growing number of professional association have service sections that promote service innovation research, including [[INFORMS]], [[ISSIP]], and others.

=== Areas of innovation – den Hertog's model ===
Thus den Hertog (2000){{ref|den Hertog}} who identifies four “dimensions” of service innovation, takes quite a different direction to much standard innovation theorizing.
# '''The Service Concept''' refers to a service concept that is new to its particular market&amp;nbsp;– a new service in effect, or in Edvardsson’s (1996,{{ref|Edvardsson1}} 1997{{ref|Edvardsson2}}) terminology, a “new value proposition”. Many service innovations involve fairly intangible characteristics of the service, and others involve new ways of organizing solutions to problems (be these new or familiar ones). Examples might include new types of bank account or information service.  In some service sectors, such as retail, there is much talk about “formats”, such as the organization of shops in different ways (more or less specialized, more or less focused on quality or cost-saving, etc.).
# '''The Client Interface''' refers to innovation in the interface between the service provider and its customers. Clients are often highly involved in service production, and changes in the way in which they play their roles and are related to suppliers can be major innovations for many services. Examples might include a greater amount of self-service for clients visiting service organizations. There is a French literature on service innovation that focuses especially on this type of innovation, identifying it as innovation in “servuction”.
# '''The Service Delivery System''' also often relates to the linkage between the service provider and its client, since delivery does involve an interaction across this interface. However, there are also internal organizational arrangements that relate to the ways in which service workers perform their job so as to deliver the critical services.  Much innovation concerns the electronic delivery of services, but we can also think of, for instance, transport and packaging innovations (e.g. pizza delivery). An emerging concept of SDP is the idea of taking a "factory" approach to Service Innovation. A [http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/By_Industry/Communications/ServiceSolutions.htm "service factory" approach] is a standardized and [[industrialized]] environment for more effective service innovation, development and operations for the IP era.
# '''Technological Options''' resemble most familiar process innovation in manufacturing sectors. New information technology is especially important to services, since it allows for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the information-processing elements that are, as we have seen, prevalent to a great extent in services sectors. We also often see physical products accompanying services, such as customer loyalty cards and “smart” RFID cards for transactions, and a wide range of devices for communication services.

In practice, the majority of service innovations will almost certainly involve various combinations of these four dimensions. For instance:
* A new IT system (technology dimension) may be used to enable customer self-service (interface dimension) as in the case of a bank contacting its customers.
* The ability to track one’s order or the location of an item that one has posted or is expecting to receive.
* Services may be delivered electronically, as in the case of much online banking and cash withdrawals from ATMs.
* A new service allowing a client to examine various options and calculate what they would be paying with different types of accounts.
* A new service will often require a new service delivery system, and changes at the client interface.

An elaboration of this model to suggest six dimensions of innovation was developed in the course of work on creative sectors, by Green, Miles and Rutter. [http://www.nesta.org.uk/assets/pdf/hidden_innovation_creative_sectors_working_paper_NESTA.pdf] As well as Technology and Production process, four dimensions were specified whose linkages are very strong in creative sectors like videogames, advertising and design: Cultural Product, Cultural Concept, Delivery and User Interface.

The service innovation literature is surprisingly poorly related to the literature on new product development, which has spawned a line of study on new service development. This often focuses on the managerially important issue of what makes for successful service innovation.  See for example Johne and Storey (1998),{{ref|Johne_Storey|4|b}} who reviewed numerous New Service Development studies.

=== Services Features and Innovation Potential: Miles (1993) influential article on 'Service Innovation' ===

Ian Miles of the [[Manchester Institute of Innovation Research]] (MIoIR), The University of Manchester, is one of the scholars on the study of 'Service Innovation'. He coined the term in his 1993 article in the journal ''FUTURES'', (Vol. 25, No. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;653–672,) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V65-45P15VV-7C&amp;_user=494590&amp;_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1993&amp;_fmt=abstract&amp;_orig=search&amp;_cdi=5805&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000024058&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=494590&amp;md5=8c83cb9d00e681e9af5eb61b70d80682&amp;ref=full]. He listed a series of characteristic features of services, and associated these with particular types of innovation.  Such innovations are often aimed at overcoming problems associated with service characteristics like the difficulty in demonstrating the service to the client, or the problems in storing and building up stocks of the service.

After Miles (1993), numerous studies were made, one of the more recent studies that reaches similar conclusions was from a qualitative survey of service organizations by Candi (2007).&lt;ref&gt;Candi (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;) Note that the “product” related innovations below have a lot in common with new service development as discussed above.  In the following list, features of services are linked to innovation strategies by the symbol &gt;&gt;&gt;.
# '''Features of services associated with service production'''
## Technology and Plant (Low levels of capital equipment; heavy investment in buildings &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce costs of buildings by use of teleservices, toll-free phone numbers, etc.)
## Labor (Some services highly professional, esp. requiring interpersonal skills);  others relatively unskilled, often involving casual or part-time labor.  Specialist knowledge may be important, but rarely technological skills (other than Information Technology) &gt;&gt;&gt; Reduce reliance on expensive and scarce skills by use of expert systems and related innovations; Relocation of key operations to areas of low labor costs (using telecommunications to maintain coordination).
## Organization of Labor Process (Workforce often engaged in craft-like production with limited management control of details of work. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use IT to monitor workforce (e.g. tachometers and mobile communications for transport staff;  Aim for 'flatter' organizational structures, with data from field and front-office workers directly entering databases and thence Management Information Systems.)
## Features of Production (Production is often non-continuous and economies of scale are limited &gt;&gt;&gt; Standardize production (e.g. 'fast-food' chains), reorganize in more assembly-line-like feature with more standard components and higher division of labor.)
## Organization of Industry  (Some services state-run public services; Others often small-scale with high preponderance of family firms and self-employed &gt;&gt;&gt; Externalization and privatization of public services; combination of small firms using network technologies; IT-based service management systems.)
# '''Features of services associated with service product'''
## Nature of Product (Immaterial, often information-intensive;  Hard to store or transport; Process and product hard to distinguish. &gt;&gt;&gt; Add material components (e.g. client cards, membership cards).  Use telematics for ordering, reservation, and if possible&amp;nbsp;– delivery.  Maintain elements of familiar 'user-interfaces'.)
## Features of Product (Often customized to consumer requirements.&gt;&gt;&gt; Use of Electronic Data Interchange or Internet for remote input of client details; use software to record client requirements and match to service product.
# '''Features of services associated with services consumption'''
## Delivery of Product (Production and consumption coterminous in time and space; often client or supplier has to move to meet the other party. &gt;&gt;&gt; Telematics; Automated Teller Machines and equivalent information services.)
## Role of Consumer (Services are ''consumer-intensive'', requiring inputs from consumer into design/production process. &gt;&gt;&gt;  Consumer use of standardized ''menus and new modes of delivering orders''.)
## Organization of Consumption (Often hard to separate production from consumption; Self-service in formal and informal economies commonplace.&gt;&gt;&gt; Increased use of self-service, utilizing existing consumer (or intermediate producer) technology&amp;nbsp;– e.g. telephones, PCs&amp;nbsp;– and user-friendly software interfaces.)
# '''Features of services associated with services markets'''
## Organization of Markets (Some services delivered via public sector bureaucratic provision; Some costs are invisibly bundled with goods (e.g. retail sector).&gt;&gt;&gt; Introduction of ''quasi-markets'' and/or privatization of services; New modes of charging (''pay per'' society), new reservation systems; more volatility in pricing using features of EPOS and related systems.)
## Regulation (Professional regulation common in some services. &gt;&gt;&gt; Use of databases by regulatory institutions and service providers to supply and examine performance indicators and diagnostic evidence.)
## Marketing (Difficult to demonstrate products in advance.&gt;&gt;&gt; Guarantees; demonstration packages (e.g. ''demo'' software, shareware, trial periods of use).)

Additionally, a number of more general tendencies in the innovation process in services have been noted.  These include:

# The industrialization of services, involving efforts to standardize services, to yield service products of predictable characteristics and quality, with economies of scale and improved delivery times. This typically involves the introduction of high levels of division of labor, with the use of pre-packaged and automated elements (such as pre-prepared meals, word processed templates for form letters, and the like). Standardization of the service products has become a competitive strategy for many firms.
# Organizational is innovation. Survey data suggest that services place particular emphasis on organizational change. Many innovations in services involve combinations of specific new technologies together with organization change. The role of organizational innovations in services is very apparent&amp;nbsp;– developments such as supermarkets and other self-service facilities are significant in the development of modern service industries. Such organizational innovations will often have a technological dimension, whether this be very basic (e.g. shopping trolleys), or relatively high-tech (EPOS&amp;nbsp;– electronic point of sale&amp;nbsp;– equipment or ATMs linked into networks).
# An important trajectory of organizational change has been towards [[self-servicing]], without necessarily following this development all the way toward the vision of the client sitting at home interacting with the service provider via a remote terminal. Instead, reorganization of the facilities of the service provider permits customer self-service in the service establishment, saving on labor costs and often increasing user satisfaction as it is possible to make decisions anonymously and at one's own pace.
# Beyond self-servicing, the involvement of clients as coproducers is particularly important for knowledge-intensive business services, with the emphasis being laid upon clients' role in advancing the expertise of service suppliers, and identifying new avenues for its application. Web2.0 has brought “''user innovation''” to the fore in electronic services.

== Service Innovation Design Methodology ==
There have been many methods for service innovation design and one of these is Dominant Innovation methodology which is a systematic approach to discover the gaps of service value delivery through a [[Scenario planning|scenario-based]] mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominantinnovation.com/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218220259/http://dominantinnovation.com/english/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-12-18|title=Dominant Innovation Official Website|website=www.dominantinnovation.com|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant Innovation methodology is based on a visible/ and invisible matrix to map the growth gaps of product value and further develop an innovation ecosystem between evidence and supply sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=AbuAli|first2=Mohamed|date=2011-01-01|title=Innovative Product Advanced Service Systems (I-PASS): methodology, tools, and applications for dominant service design|journal=The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology|volume=52|issue=9–12|pages=1161–1173|doi=10.1007/s00170-010-2763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and service innovation have also been combined in the context of business acceleration using the Minimum Valuable Service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pinheiro|first=Tenny|date=2014-01-01|title=The Service Startup - Design Thinking gets Lean|url=http://www.theservicestartup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MVS is an open source methodology that integrates [[lean startup]] and Service Design and it has been largely adopted by startups and large organizations like [[General Electric|Ge]] and [[Cisco]] in Silicon Valley.

== Service Innovation using IoT and Big Data Analytics ==
In the traditional [[product-service system]] (PSS) business model, industries develop product with value-added service instead of single product itself, and provide their customers services that are needed. In this relationship, the market goal of manufacturers is not one-time product selling, but continuous profit from customers by total service solution, which can satisfy unmet customers’ needs.   Most of PSS systems focus on ‘human-generated or human-related data’ instead of ‘machine-generated data or industrial data’, which may include machine controllers, sensors, manufacturing systems, etc.  Early work using web-based product monitoring for remote product services including GM OnStar Telematics, Otis Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM), and GE Medical InSite during 1990s.  Service innovation using web-based system was further developed for e-service applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|date=2003-01-01|title=Smart products and service systems for e-business transformation|journal=International Journal of Technology Management|volume=26|issue=1|pages=45–52|doi=10.1504/IJTM.2003.003143|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently, more advanced approaches using predictive analytics and cyber physical systems (CPS) can harvest  large amounts of data of a variety of types to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information from industrial and manufacturing systems and integrate with business automation software for improved productivity and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|last2=Kao|first2=Hung-An|last3=Yang|first3=Shanhu|date=2014-01-01|title=Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827114000857|journal=Procedia CIRP|volume=16|pages=3–8|doi=10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/|title=Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems             —                  IMS Center|website=www.imscenter.net|access-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service innovation and public policy ==
In recent years policy makers have begun to consider the potential for promoting services innovation as part of their economic development strategies. Such consideration has, in part, been driven by the growing contribution that services activities make to national and regional economies. It also reflects the emerging recognition that traditional policy measures such as R&amp;D grants and technology transfer supports have been developed from a manufacturing perspective of the innovation process.

The [[European Commission]] and the [[OECD]] has been particularly active in seeking to generate reflection on services innovation and its policy implications. This has resulted in studies such as the OECD’s reports into knowledge intensive services,{{ref|OECD}} and the European Commission Expert Group report on services innovation&amp;nbsp;– the report of the group, "Fostering Innovation in Services"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN Europe Innovatiob] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021052443/http://www.europe-innova.org/servlet/Doc?cid=7550&amp;lg=EN |date=2007-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various TrendChart studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 Pro-innovation Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924232640/http://www.proinno-europe.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&amp;topicID=104&amp;parentID=52 |date=2009-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission has also launched a number of Knowledge Intensive Services Platforms designed to act as laboratories for new public policies for services innovation. Few economic development agencies at the member state level, and fewer still at the regional level, have translated this new thinking on services innovation into policy action.  Finland is an exception, where [[knowledge intensive business services]] have been a focus of much regional work (esp. the [[Uusimaa]] region).

Finland has been active in thinking about the policy implications of services innovation. This has seen '''TEKES'''&amp;nbsp;– the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation&amp;nbsp;– launch the ''SERVE'' initiative, designed to support ‘Finnish companies and research organisations in the development of innovative service concepts that can be reproduced or replicated and where some technology or systematic method is applied .’{{ref|Tekes_definition|a}}  [[Germany]] has also undertaken initiatives for services R&amp;D, and [[Canada]] and [[Norway]] have programs as well.

Ireland has been considering a services-focused innovation policy, with ''Forfás''&amp;nbsp;– its national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation&amp;nbsp;– having undertaken a review of Ireland’s existing policy and support measures for innovation, and outlined options for a new policy and framework environment in support of service innovation activity.{{ref|Forfas}}

At the regional level, limited information is available on how Europe’s regions are responding to the challenges presented by service innovation. [CM International] has recently published a European survey on services innovation and regional policy responses. The results of this suggest that very few regions in France, the UK and Ireland have an explicit focus on services and innovation. Many do, however, express a desire to address this issue in the coming future.{{ref|CMInternational}}

More recent high-tech establishments have been raised in [[Jerusalem]], and in towns such as [[Yokneam Illit]] and Israel's first "private city," Airport City, near Tel Aviv.

==Origin of the term==
Silicon Wadi is a pun based on the [[California]]n region of [[Silicon Valley]]. "[[Wadi]]" is the Arabic word for a valley or dry river bed, also commonly used in colloquial [[Hebrew]].

==History==
Israeli high-tech firms originally began to form in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; In 1961 [[ECI Telecom]] was founded, followed in 1962 by [[Tadiran]] and [[Elron Electronic Industries]] regarded by many to be the "Fairchild of Israel."&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The number of internationally successful firms grew slowly, with only one or two new successful firms each year until the early 1990s. [[Motorola]] was the first US corporation to set up an R&amp;D unit in Israel, in 1964.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The center initially developed wireless products including remote irrigation systems and later developed leading chips such as the 68030.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Following the 1967 French arms embargo, Israel was forced to develop a domestic military industry, focusing on developing a technological edge over its neighbors.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Some of these military firms started to seek and develop civilian applications of military technology.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; In the 1970s more commercial innovations began, many of which were based on military R&amp;D, including: [[Scitex]] digital printing systems, which were based on fast rotation drums from fast-rotation electronic warfare systems,&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; and [[Elscint]], which developed innovative [[medical imaging]] and became a leading force in its market.&lt;ref name=fu&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Elscint-Ltd-Company-History.html Elscint Ltd. - Company history] FundingUniverse&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech firms continued to struggle throughout this period with marketing and many products, such as a mini-computer developed in the 1970s by [[Elbit]], who were unable to successfully commercialise the product.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

===World software market takes off===
Slowly, the international computing industry shifted the emphasis from hardware (in which Israel had no comparative advantage) to software products (in which human capital plays a larger role).&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The country became one of the first nations to compete in global software markets.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; By the 1980s a diverse set of software firms had developed. Each found niches which were not dominated by US firms and between 1984 and 1991 "pure" software exports increased from $5 million to $110 million. Many of the important ideas here were developed by graduates of [[Mamram]], the Israeli computer corps, established by the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

During the 1980s and early 1990s several successful software companies emerged from Israel, including: [[Amdocs]] (established in 1982 as Aurec Information), [[Cimatron]] (established in 1982), [[Magic Software Enterprises]] (established in 1983), [[Comverse]] (established in 1983 as Efrat Future Technologies), [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]] (established in 1985), [[NICE Systems]]  (established in 1986), [[Mercury Interactive]] (established in 1989) and [[Check Point|Check Point Software Technologies]] (established in 1993).

The 1990s saw the real takeoff of high-tech industries in Israel, with international media attention increasing awareness of innovation in the country.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Growth increased, whilst new [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1990s|immigrants from the Soviet Union]] increased the available high-tech workforce.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Peace agreements including the 1993 [[Oslo Peace Accord]] increased the investment environment and Silicon Wadi began to develop into a noticeable high-tech cluster.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

===Dot-com boom===
In 1998, Mirabilis, an [[Israel]]i company that developed the [[ICQ]] [[instant messaging]] program, which revolutionized communication over the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.themarker.com/47-yair-goldfinger-serial-entrepreneur-an-intensely-private-technology-angel-1.382778 Yair Goldfinger, serial entrepreneur / An intensely private technology angel, [[The Marker]] ]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was purchased by [[America Online]] (AOL) for $407 million in cash, 18 months after it was founded and having no revenues. The free service attracted a user base of 15 million in that period and by 2001, ICQ had over 100 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is the ICQ experiment working?|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-257294.html|newspaper=CNET News|date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Mirabilis triggered the [[dot-com boom]] in Israel; thousands of start-up companies were established between 1998 and 2001, while [[venture capital]] raised by Israeli companies reached $1,851 million in 1999, peaking at $3,701 million in 2000. Over fifty Israeli companies had [[initial public offering]]s on [[NASDAQ]] and other international stock markets during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/41/56/2491258.pdf|title=Page not found|work=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silicon Wadi today===
For more than 50 years, local demand fueled Israeli industrial expansion, as the country's population grew rapidly and the standard of living rose. More recently, world demand for Israeli advanced technologies, software, electronics, and other sophisticated equipment has stimulated industrial growth. Israel's high status in new technologies is the result of its emphasis on [[higher education]] and research and development. Cultural factors contributing to the expansion includes [[chutzpah]] and openness to immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Chutzpah of Israeli Startups, {{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/05/chutzpah-of-israeli-startups/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=5 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208121328/http://radoff.com/blog/2009/12/05/chutzpah-of-israeli-startups/ |archivedate=8 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government also assists industrial growth by providing low-rate loans from its development budget. The main limitations experienced by industry are the scarcity of domestic raw materials and sources of energy and the restricted size of the local market. One certain advantage is that many Israeli university graduates are likely to become IT entrepreneurs or join startups, about twice as much as US university graduates, who are also attracted to traditional corporate executive positions, according to [[Charles A. Holloway]], co-director of the [[Center for Entrepreneurial Studies]] and a professor at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/13769/edition_id/266/format/html/displaystory.html|title=Silicon Wadi not that far from Silicon Valley, prof says|work=[[j.]]|first=Buzzy|last=Gordon|date=26 May 2000|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICQ]], for instance, is one of the world's most famous Israeli software products, developed by 4 young entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jobcircle.com/career/articles/x/njtc/2934.xml New Jersey Technology Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928213113/http://jobcircle.com/career/articles/x/njtc/2934.xml |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has its IBM Content Discovery Engineering Team in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs"&gt;[http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/jerusalem_facility.html IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701012401/http://www.haifa.il.ibm.com/jerusalem_facility.html |date=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of a number of [[IBM R&amp;D Labs in Israel]].

===Genealogical research===
According to research conducted by Prof. Shmuel Ellis, Chair of the Management Department at [[Tel Aviv University]]'s Faculty of Management, together with Prof. Israel Drori of the School of Business Administration at the College of Management and Prof. Zur Shapira, Chair of the Management and Organizations Department at [[New York University]], the [[RAD Group]], founded in 1981 by brothers Yehuda and [[Zohar Zisapel]], has been "the most fertile ground" for creating Israeli entrepreneurs, having produced 56 "serial entrepreneurs" who established more than one start-up each. [[RAD Group]] "graduates" were responsible for the establishment of a total of 111 significant high-tech initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mother of the Start-Ups: The RAD Group Gave Birth to 110 Companies|newspaper=The Marker|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 16203 kiryat gat.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Intel]] and [[Micron Technology|Micron]] production plants in [[Kiryat Gat]]]]
Due to the small size of Israel, the concentration of high-tech firms across much of the country is enough for it to be recognised as one large cluster. Most activity is located in the densely populated areas of metropolitan [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]] ([[Matam, Haifa|Matam]]), and Jerusalem ([[Jerusalem Technology Park|Technology Park, Malha]], [[Har Hotzvim]] and [[Jerusalem Venture Partners|JVP Media Quarter]] in [[Talpiot]]), and the [[Startup Village, Yokneam|Startup Village Ecosystem in the Yokneam area]], although some secondary with additional activity include the corridor to [[Beer Sheba]], including [[Kiryat Gat]], and the Western Galilee. In all, this is an area no larger than 6000 square kilometers, half of the extended Silicon Valley's geographical coverage.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;Catherine de Fontenay and Erran Carmel, [http://www.mbs.edu/home/defontenay/IsraelSiliconWadiJune2002.pdf Israel’s Silicon Wadi: The forces behind cluster formation], June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Many international technology companies have [[research and development]] facilities in this region, including companies such as [[Intel]], [[IBM]],&lt;ref name="IBM Research | IBM Haifa Labs"/&gt; [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Philips]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[BMC Software]], [[Microsoft]], [[Motorola]] and [[CA, Inc.|CA]]. Many Israeli high-tech companies are based in the region, including [[Zoran Corporation]], [[CEVA, Inc.]], [[Aladdin Knowledge Systems]], [[Mellanox]], [[NICE Systems]], Horizon Semiconductors, [[RAD Data Communications]], [[Radwin|RADWIN]], [[Radware]], [[Tadiran Telecom]], [[Radvision Ltd.|Radvision]], [[Check Point|Check Point Software Technologies]], [[Amdocs]], [[Babylon (program)|Babylon Ltd.]], [[Elbit]], [[Israel Aerospace Industries]] and the solar thermal equipment designer and manufacturer [[Solel]], with most of them being listed on the [[NASDAQ]], which even has an Israel Index. Intel developed its [[dual-core]] [[Intel Core 2|Core Duo]] processor at its Israel Development Center located at the ''Merkaz Ta'asiya ve'Meida'' ([[Matam, Haifa|Matam - Scientific Industries Center]]) in the city of [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isrealli.org/israel-saves-intel Israel Saves Intel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824020303/http://www.isrealli.org/israel-saves-intel |date=24 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, more than 3,000 [[startup company|start-ups]] were created in Israel, a number that is only second to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/090e5dd2-e88e-11db-b2c3-000b5df10621.html|title=Business as usual|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek Magazine]] has also named [[Tel Aviv]] as one of the world's top ten "Hot High-Tech Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelemb.org/chicago/newsleter.htm|title=Error-2010-f3|work=israelemb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Tel Aviv]] was named by ''[[Newsweek]]'' as one of the ten technologically most influential cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Economy/telaviv.html |title=Tel Aviv One of The World’s Top High-Tech Centers |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the city was also named one of the best places for high-tech startup companies, placed only second behind its [[Silicon Valley|California counterpart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-deals/2012-11-21-after-silicon-valley-tel-aviv-ranks-best-for-tech-startups-study/ | work=Bloomberg | title=After Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv Ranks Best for Tech Startups: Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israel21c.org/news/tel-aviv-named-top-startup-center/|title=Tel Aviv named top startup center|work=ISRAEL21c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance===
The importance of Silicon Wadi was first recognised internationally by Wired magazine, who in 2000, ranked locations by the strength of cluster effects, giving the Israeli high-tech cluster the same rank as Boston, Helsinki, London, and Kista in Sweden, second only to Silicon Valley.

===Sectors===
* A cluster of software companies, who are monetizing "free" software downloads by [[adware]] or altering user's systems, has been dubbed [[Download Valley]].&lt;ref name=Inbal&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hirschauge |first1=Orr |title=Conduit Diversifies Away From 'Download Valley' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/conduit-seeks-diversifies-away-from-download-valley-1400152825?tesla=y |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orpaz |first1=Inbal |last2=Smolsky |first2=Raz |title=Amazon to Expand Its Operations in Israel |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-amazon-to-expand-its-operations-in-israel-1.5371061 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli venture capital industry==
{{main article|Venture capital in Israel}}
[[File:Madpis.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jerusalem Venture Partners]] (JVP) compound in [[Jerusalem]], one of Israel's largest Venture Capital firms.]]
The origins of the now thriving venture capital industry in Israel can be traced to a government initiative in 1993 named the Yozma program ("Initiative" in Hebrew); which offered attractive tax incentives to any foreign venture-capital investments in Israel and offered to double any investment with funds from the government.&lt;ref name=Gilder&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Between 1991 and 2000, Israel's annual venture-capital outlays, nearly all private, rose nearly 60-fold, from $58 million to $3.3 billion; companies launched by Israeli venture funds rose from 100 to 800; and Israel's information-technology revenues rose from $1.6 billion to $12.5 billion. By 1999, Israel ranked second only to the United States in invested private-equity capital as a share of GDP. And it led the world in the share of its growth attributable to high-tech ventures: 70 percent.&lt;ref name="Gilder"/&gt;

Israel's thriving venture capital industry has played an important role in financing and funding Silicon Wadi. The [[financial crisis of 2007-2010]] affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 [[mergers and acquisitions]] in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired.&lt;ref name=VC&gt;[http://www.investinisrael.gov.il/NR/exeres/A19A138D-87A7-416B-8D62-1C968E035E13.htm Venture Capital in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218080510/http://www.investinisrael.gov.il/NR/exeres/A19A138D-87A7-416B-8D62-1C968E035E13.htm |date=18 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous high tech Israeli companies have been acquired by global corporations for its provision of reliable and quality corporate personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfunders.org/sites/default/files/docs/events/briefing_book_final.pdf |title=FUNDING THE FUTURE: Advancing STEM in Israeli Education |publisher=STEM Israel |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's venture capital industry has about 70 active venture capital funds, of which 14 international VCs with Israeli offices. Additionally, there are some 220 international funds, including [[Polaris Venture Partners]], [[Accel Partners]] and [[Greylock Partners]], that do not have branches in Israel, but actively invest in Israel through an in-house specialist.

In 2009, the [[life sciences]] sector led the market with $272 million or 24% of total capital raised, followed by the [[software]] sector with $258 million or 23%, the [[communications]] sector with $219 million or 20%, and the [[Internet]] sector with 13% of capital raised in 2009.&lt;ref name="VC"/&gt;

{{Capitalism |Systems}}
'''State capitalism''' is an [[economic system]] in which the [[State (polity)|state]] undertakes commercial (i.e. [[Profit (economics)|for-profit]]) economic activity and where the [[means of production]] are organized and managed as [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned business enterprises]] (including the processes of [[capital accumulation]], [[wage labor]] and [[Centralisation|centralized management]]), or where there is otherwise a dominance of [[Corporatization|corporatized]] government agencies (agencies organized along business-management practices) or of [[Public company|publicly listed corporations]] in which the state has controlling shares.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "state capitalism" is also used by some in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, often meaning a privately owned economy that is subject to [[statist]] economic planning. This term was often used to describe the controlled economies of the [[Great Powers]] in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought|editor1=David Miller|editor2=Janet Coleman|editor3=William Conolly|editor4=Alan Ryan|publisher=Blackwell|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; State capitalism has also come to refer to an economic system where the means of production are owned privately, but the state has considerable control over the allocation of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1873|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1873/statism-anarchy.htm|website=marxists.org|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State capitalism|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/state_capitalism.htm|website=tititudorancea.com|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of France during the period of [[dirigisme]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. State capitalism may be used (sometimes interchangeably with [[state monopoly capitalism]]) to describe a system where the state intervenes in the economy to protect and advance the interests of [[Big business|large-scale businesses]].

[[Libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialist]] [[Noam Chomsky]] applies the term "state capitalism" to economies such as that of the [[United States]], where large enterprises that are deemed "too big to fail" receive publicly funded government bailouts that mitigate the firms' assumption of risk and undermine market laws and where the state largely funds private production [[Lemon socialism|at public expense, but private owners reap the profits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chomsky.info/20110407-2/|title=The State-Corporate Complex: A Threat to Freedom and Survival|author=Noam Chomsky|date=7 April 2011|publisher=Chomsky.info|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History Doesn't Go In a Straight Line {{!}} Jacobin|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/noam-chomsky-bernie-sanders-greece-tsipras-grexit-austerity-neoliberalism-protest/|website=jacobinmag.com|accessdate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State and Corp., Noam Chomsky interviewed by uncredited interviewer|url=http://chomsky.info/20050518/|website=chomsky.info|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is often claimed to be in contrast with the ideals of both [[socialism]] and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Johnson. ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology''. (2000). Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}. p. 306. In 2008, the U.S. National Intelligence Council used the term in ''Global Trends 2025: A World Transformed'' to describe the development of Russia, India and China.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various theories and critiques of state capitalism, some of which existed before the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. The common themes among them identify that the workers do not meaningfully control the means of production and detect that commodity relations and production for profit still occur within state capitalism. In ''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'' (1880), [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that state ownership does not do away with capitalism by itself, but rather would be the final stage of capitalism, consisting of ownership and management of large-scale production and communication by the [[Capitalist state|bourgeois state]]. He argued that the tools for ending capitalism are found in state capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frederick Engels |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm |title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 3)|website=marxists.org|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and early uses of the term==
[[File:Wilhelm Liebknecht 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Liebknecht]]: "Nobody has combated State Socialism more than we German Socialists"]]
The term was first used by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] in 1896 who said: "Nobody has combated [[State Socialism (Germany)|State Socialism]] more than we [[German socialism|German Socialists]]; nobody has shown more distinctively than I, that State Socialism is really State capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Wilhelm|last=Liebknecht|authorlink=Wilhelm Liebknecht|title=Our Recent Congress|journal=Justice|year=1896|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/liebknecht-w/1896/08/our-congress.htm|accessdate=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the concept of state capitalism can be traced back to [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s critique during the [[First International]] of the potential for state exploitation under Marxist-inspired socialism, or to [[Jan Waclav Machajski]]'s argument in ''The Intellectual Worker'' (1905) that socialism was a movement of the [[intelligentsia]] as a class, resulting in a new type of society he termed state capitalism.&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Slavic Review'', 50, no. 1 (Spring 1991): 127-143. Published in Croatian translation in ?asopis za suvremenu povijest [Journal of Contemporary History], Zagreb, no. 3, 1994, 427-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Bakunin: Gouldner, A.W. 1982. 'Marx's last battle: Bakunin and the First International', ''Theory and Society'' 11(6), November, pp. 853-84. Gouldner argues that Bakunin formulated an original critique of Marxism as 'the ideology, not of the working class, but of a new class of scientific intelligentsia—who would corrupt socialism, make themselves a new elite, and impose their rule on the majority' (pp. 860-1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Machajski: [[Marshall S. Shatz]] {{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/cont.html|title=''Jan Waclaw Machajski: A Radical Critic Of The Russian Intelligentsia And Socialism''|accessdate=October 26, 2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026180626/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/cont.html|archivedate=October 26, 2009|df=}}; TB Bottomore ''Elites and Society'' p.54&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchists, [[state socialism]] is equivalent to state capitalism, hence oppressive and merely a shift from private capitalists to the state being the sole employer and capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secH3.html#sech313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219024910/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secH3.html#sech313|date=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], using [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s idea that [[Czarism]] was taking a "Prussian path" to capitalism, the [[Bolshevik]] [[Nikolai Bukharin]] identified a new stage in the development of capitalism in which all sectors of national production and all important social institutions had become managed by the state—he termed this new stage "state capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Bukharin, N. 1915 [1972]. ''Imperialism and World Economy''. London: Merlin. p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

After the October Revolution, Lenin used the term positively. In spring 1918, during a brief period of economic liberalism prior to the introduction of [[war communism]] and again during the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921, Lenin justified the introduction of state capitalism controlled politically by the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to further central control and develop the productive forces: &lt;blockquote&gt;Reality tells us that state capitalism would be a step forward. If in a small space of time we could achieve state capitalism, that would be a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume27.htm Collected Works Vol. 27], p. 293, quoted by [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html Aufheben]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also David S. Pena "[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/5869/ Tasks of Working-Class Governments under the Socialist-oriented Market Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230042/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/5869/|date=September 5, 2008}}", PoliticalAffairs.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lenin argued the state should temporarily run the economy, which would eventually be taken over by workers.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s4|title=The State and Revolution — Chapter 5 |publisher=[[Marxists.org]]|date=March 25, 2006|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Lenin, "state capitalism" did not mean the state would run most of the economy, but that "state capitalism" would be one of five elements of the economy:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; {{quote|text=State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months' time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/apr/21.htm|title=The Tax in Kind|publisher=[[Marxists.org]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Use of the term by the left==

===Socialists===
The term "state capitalism" has been used by various [[socialists]], including [[anarchists]], [[Marxists]] and [[Leninists]].

===Anarchists ===
Perhaps the earliest critique of the [[Soviet Union]] as state capitalist was formulated by the Russian anarchists as documented in Paul Avrich's work on Russian anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Avrich, 1967, ''The Russian Anarchists'', Princeton University Press, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim would become standard in anarchist works. For example, the prominent anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in an article from 1935 titled "There Is No Communism in Russia" said of the Soviet Union: &lt;blockquote&gt;Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-there-is-no-communism-in-russia|title=There Is No Communism in Russia|author=Emma Goldman|date=1935|work=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When speaking about [[Marxism]], [[Murray Bookchin]] said the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement—notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian 'socialism' turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described 'socialism' as 'nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people'. This is an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-listen-marxist#fn_back9|title=Listen, Marxist!|author=Murray Bookchin|date=1971|work=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While speaking about [[Leninism]], the authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] say: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. At worse, these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionH5#sech510|title=An Anarchist FAQ - H.5 What was the Kronstadt Rebellion? (What is vanguardism and why do anarchists reject it?)|date=|publisher=Infoshop|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Russian communist left===
{{Left communism sidebar}}
Another early analysis of the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating [[left communism]]. One major tendency of the [[Left communism#Russian left communism|1918 Russian communist left]] criticised the re-employment of [[authoritarian]] capitalist relations and methods of production. As [[Valerian Osinsky]] in particular argued, "one-man management" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/brinton/1970/workers-control/02.htm|title=The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control: The State and Counter-Revolution|author=Maurice Brinton|date=1970|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production—[[Taylorism]] converted workers into the appendages of machines and [[piece work]] imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling [[petty bourgeois]] values into workers. In sum, these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. The working class, it was argued, had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of [[Marx's critique of alienation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', ''Survey'' 62, January, pp. 58-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

These criticisms were revived on the left of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] after the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Congress]] in 1921, which introduced the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP). Many members of the [[Workers' Opposition]] and the [[Decists]] (both later banned) and two new underground Left Communist groups, [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EH Carr, ''The Interregnum 1923-1924'', London, 1954, p80&lt;/ref&gt; The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Shatz {{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |title="Makhaevism After Machajski" |accessdate=2014-04-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132629/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/machg.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mensheviks and orthodox Marxists===
{{Marxism}}
Immediately after the Russian Revolution, many Western Marxists questioned whether socialism was possible in Russia. Specifically, [[Karl Kautsky]] said: {{quote|It is only the old feudal large landed property which exists no longer. Conditions in Russia were ripe for its abolition but they were not ripe for the abolition of capitalism. Capitalism is now once again celebrating a resurrection, but in forms that are more oppressive and harrowing for the proletariat than of old. Instead of assuming higher industrialised forms, private capitalism has assumed the most wretched and shabby forms of black marketeering and money speculation. Industrial capitalism has developed to become state capitalism. Formerly state officials and officials from private capital were critical, often very hostile towards each other. Consequently the working man found that his advantage lay with one or the other in turn. Today the state bureaucracy and capitalist bureaucracy are merged into one—that is the upshot of the great socialist revolution brought about by the Bolsheviks. It constitutes the most oppressive of all despotisms that Russia has ever had to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Kautsky, K. 1919 [1983]. Terrorism and Communism. Cited from P. Goode (ed.), Karl Kautsky: Selected Political Writings. London: Macmillan, 1983, cited in [http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf/34-A-08.pdf  'State Capitalism' in the Soviet Union M.C. Howard and J.E. King]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After 1929, exiled [[Mensheviks]] such as [[Fyodor Dan]] began to argue that Stalin's Russia constituted a state capitalist society.&lt;ref&gt;Liebich, A. 1987. 'Marxism and totalitarianism: Rudolf Hilferding and the Mensheviks', ''Dissent'' 34, Spring, pp. 223-40&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the orthodox Marxist group the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] independently developed a similar doctrine. Although initially beginning with the idea that Soviet capitalism differed little from western capitalism, they later began to argue that the bureaucracy held its productive property in common, much like the [[Catholic Church]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;State capitalism: the wages system under new management / Adam Buick and John Crump.

[[Rudolf Hilferding]], writing in the Menshevik journal ''Socialist Courier'' April 25 1940 rejected the concept of state capitalism, noting that, as practiced in the Soviet Union, it lacked the dynamic aspects of capitalism such as a market which set prices or a set of entrepreneurs and investors which allocated capital. Thus, state capitalism was not a form of capitalism but a form of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Marxist"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rudolf Hilferding |authorlink1=Rudolf Hilferding |title=State Capitalism or Totalitarian State Economy |website=marxists.org |publisher=Socialist Courier |accessdate=June 17, 2018 |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/hilferding/1940/statecapitalism.htm |date=April 25, 1940 |quote=A capitalist economy is governed by the laws of the market (analyzed by Marx) and the autonomy of these laws constitutes the decisive symptom of the capitalist system of production}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shachtmanite Trotskyists===
{{Third Camp}}
[[Leon Trotsky]] said the term state capitalism "originally arose to designate the phenomena which arise when a bourgeois state takes direct charge of the means of transport or of industrial enterprises" and is therefore a "partial negation" of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After [[World War II]], [[Orthodox Trotskyism|most Trotskyists]] accepted an analysis of the Soviet bloc countries as being [[deformed workers' states]]. However, alternative opinions of the Trotskyist tradition have developed the theory of state capitalism as a [[New Class]] theory to explain what they regard as the essentially non-socialist nature of the Soviet Union, [[Cuba]], [[China]] and other self-proclaimed [[socialist states]].

The discussion goes back to internal debates in the [[Left Opposition]] during the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Ante Ciliga]], a member of the Left Opposition imprisoned at Verkhne-Uralsk in the 1930s, described the evolution of many Left Oppositionists to a theory of state capitalism influenced by [[Gavril Myasnikov]]'s Workers Group and other Left Communist factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ante|last=Ciliga|title=Au pays du grand mensonge|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael S.|last=Fox|url=http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |title=Ante Ciliga, Trotskii and State Capitalism: Theory, Tactics and Reevaluation during the Purge Era, 1935-1939 |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027132653/http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/ciliga_trotsky.pdf |archivedate=October 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Bourrinet]] "[http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/ciliga.htm An Ambiguous Journey]"&lt;/ref&gt; On release and returning to activity in the [[International Left Opposition]], Ciliga "was one of the first, after 1936, to raise the theory [of state capitalism] in Trotskyist circles".&lt;ref name="Fox - Ante Ciliga" /&gt; [[George Orwell]], who was an [[anti-Stalinist left]]ist like Ciliga, used the term in his ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).

After 1940, dissident Trotskyists developed more theoretically sophisticated accounts of state capitalism. One influential formulation has been that of the [[Johnson–Forest Tendency]] of [[C. L. R. James]] and [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] who formulated her theory in the early 1940s on the basis of a study of the first three [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]]s alongside readings of Marx's [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|early humanist writings]]. Their political evolution would lead them away from Trotskyism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWA0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= ''State-capitalism and World Revolution by Johnson-Forest''], Socialist Workers Party, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is that of [[Tony Cliff]], associated with the [[International Socialist Tendency]] and the British [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), dating back to the late 1940s. Unlike Johnson-Forest, Cliff formulated a theory of state capitalism that would enable his group to remain Trotskyists, albeit heterodox ones.&lt;ref&gt;Aufheben [http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 Cliff and the [[neo-Trotskyist]] theory of the USSR as state capitalist] in What Was The USSR?&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively recent text by [[Stephen Resnick]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]], ''Class Theory and History'', explores what they term state capitalism in the former Soviet Union, continuing a theme that has been debated within Trotskyist theory for most of the past century.

Compare with other left-wing theories regarding Soviet-style societies: [[deformed workers' state]]s, [[degenerated workers' state]]s, [[new class]], [[state socialism]] and [[bureaucratic collectivism]].

===Use by later left communists and council communists===
The [[left communist]]/[[council communist]] traditions outside Russia consider the Soviet system as state capitalist. [[Otto Rühle]], a major German left communist, developed this idea from the 1920s and it was later articulated by Dutch council communist [[Anton Pannekoek]], for instance in [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm "State Capitalism and Dictatorship"] (1936).

===Use by Maoists and anti-revisionists===
From 1956 to the late 1970s, the [[Communist Party of China]] and their [[Maoist]] or [[anti-revisionist]] adherents around the world often described the Soviet Union as state capitalist, essentially using the accepted Marxist definition, albeit on a different basis and in reference to a different span of time from either the Trotskyists or the left-communists. Specifically, the Maoists and their descendants use the term state capitalism as part of their description of the style and politics of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and his successors as well as to similar leaders and policies in other self-styled "socialist" states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mltranslations.org/Ireland/ico.htm ''The Economics of Revisionism''] by the Irish Communist Organisation, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; This was involved in the ideological [[Sino-Soviet Split]].

After [[Mao Zedong]]'s death, amidst the supporters of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the "[[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]]", most extended the state capitalist formulation to China itself and ceased to support the Communist Party of China, which likewise distanced itself from these former [[Fraternal party|fraternal]] groups. The related theory of [[Hoxhaism]] was developed in 1978, largely by [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Socialist Albanian]] President [[Enver Hoxha]], who insisted that Mao himself had pursued state capitalist and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/toc.htm ''Imperialism and the Revolution''] by Enver Hoxha, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most current communist groups descended from the Maoist ideological tradition still adopt the description of both China and the Soviet Union as being "state capitalist" from a certain point in their history onwards—most commonly, the Soviet Union from 1956 to its collapse in 1991 and China from 1976 to the present. Maoists and "anti-revisionists" also sometimes use the term "[[social imperialism]]" to describe socialist states that they consider to be actually capitalist in essence—their phrase, "socialist in words, imperialist in deeds" denotes this.

[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|left|Murray Rothbard advanced a [[right-libertarian]] analysis of state capitalism]]
[[Murray Rothbard]], an [[anarcho-capitalist]] philosopher, uses the term interchangeably with the term [[state monopoly capitalism]] and uses it to describe a partnership of government and big business in which the state intervenes on behalf of large capitalists against the interests of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This usage dates from the 1960s, when [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] described the post-New Deal economy of the United States as "state capitalism".

The term is not used by the [[classical liberals]] to describe the public ownership of the means of production. The [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] explained the reason: "The socialist movement takes great pains to circulate frequently new labels for its ideally constructed state. Each worn-out label is replaced by another which raises hopes of an ultimate solution of the insoluble basic problem of Socialism—until it becomes obvious that nothing has been changed but the name. The most recent slogan is "State Capitalism." It is not commonly realized that this covers nothing more than what used to be called Planned Economy and State Socialism, and that State Capitalism, Planned Economy, and State Socialism diverge only in non-essentials from the "classic" ideal of egalitarian Socialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Use by Italian Fascists==
[[File:Mussolini biografia.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Benito Mussolini]] claimed that the modern phase of capitalism is [[state socialism]] "turned on its head"]]
On economic issues, [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]] claimed in 1933 that were Fascism to follow the modern phase of capitalism, its path would "lead inexorably into state capitalism, which is nothing more nor less than [[state socialism]] turned on its head. In either event, [whether the outcome be state capitalism or state socialism] the result is the bureaucratization of the economic activities of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933)". ''Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions''. Fertig, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that capitalism had degenerated in three stages, starting with dynamic or [[heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870), followed by static capitalism (1870–1914) and then reaching its final form of decadent capitalism, also known as [[Supercapitalism (concept in Italian Fascism)|supercapitalism]] beginning in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini denounced supercapitalism for causing the "standardization of humankind" and for causing excessive consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi, Simonetta. ''Fascist Spectacle: The Aesthetics of Power in Mussolini's Italy''. University of California Press, 2000. Pp. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini claimed that at this stage of supercapitalism "[it] is then that a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously".&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 Pp. 158"&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. Pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability of businesses to operate properly when facing economic difficulties, Mussolini claimed that this proved that state intervention into the economy was necessary to stabilize the economy.&lt;ref name="Mussolini, Benito 1933 Pp. 158"/&gt;

Mussolini claimed that dynamic or heroic capitalism and the [[bourgeoisie]] could be prevented from degenerating into static capitalism and then supercapitalism only if the concept of economic [[individualism]] were abandoned and if state supervision of the economy was introduced.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"&gt;Salvemini, Gaetano. Under the Axe of Fascism. READ BOOKS, 2006. Pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private enterprise]] would control production, but it would be supervised by the state.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"/&gt; Italian Fascism presented the economic system of [[corporatism]] as the solution that would preserve private enterprise and property while allowing the state to intervene in the economy when private enterprise failed.&lt;ref name="Salvemini. Pp. 134"/&gt;

==In Western countries==
An alternate definition is that state capitalism is a close relationship between the government and private capitalism, such as one in which the private capitalists produce for a guaranteed market. An example of this would be the [[military–industrial complex]] in which autonomous [[entrepreneurial]] firms produce for lucrative government contracts and are not subject to the discipline of competitive markets.  

Both the Trotskyist definition and this one derive from discussion among Marxists at the beginning of the 20th century, most notably [[Nikolai Bukharin]], who in his book ''Imperialism and the world economy'' thought that advanced, [[imperialist]] countries exhibited the latter definition and considered (and rejected) the possibility that they could arrive at the former.

State capitalism is practised by a variety of Western countries with respect to certain strategic resources important for [[national security]]. These may involve private investment as well. For example, a government may own or even monopolize oil production or transport infrastructure to ensure availability in the case of war. Examples include [[Neste]], [[Statoil]] and [[OMV]].

There are limits according to arguments that state capitalism exists to ensure that wealth creation does not threaten the ruling elite's political power, which remains unthreatened by tight connections between the government and the industries while state capitalist fears of capitalism's "creative destruction", of the threat of revolution and of any significant changes in the system result in the persistence of industries that have outlived their economic usefulness and an inefficient economic environment that is ill equipped to inspire innovation.

==In European studies==
Several European scholars and political economists have used the term to describe one of the three major varieties of capitalism that prevail in the modern context of the [[European Union]]. This approach is mainly influenced by Schmidt's (2002) article on ''The Futures of European Capitalism'', in which he divides modern European capitalism in three groups: "Market", "Managed" and "State". Here, state capitalism refers to a system where high coordination between the state, large companies and labour unions ensures economic growth and development in a quasi-[[corporatist]] model. The author cites France and to a lesser extent Italy as the prime examples of modern European state capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Wolff]] and [[Stephen Resnick]] identify state capitalism as the dominant class system throughout the history of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Resnick, Stephen &amp; Wolff, Richard (2002) Class Theory and History: Capitalism and Communism in the U.S.S.R. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State monopoly capitalism==
The theory of [[state monopoly capitalism]] was initially a [[neo-Stalinist]] doctrine popularised after [[World War II]]. Lenin had claimed in 1916 that [[World War I]] had transformed ''laissez-faire'' capitalism into [[monopoly capitalism]], but he did not publish any extensive theory about the topic. The term refers to an environment where the state intervenes in the economy to protect large monopolistic or [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic]] businesses from competition by smaller firms.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought&lt;/ref&gt; The main principle of the ideology is that big business, having achieved a [[monopoly]] or [[cartel]] position in most markets of importance, fuses with the government apparatus. A kind of financial [[oligarchy]] or conglomerate therefore results, whereby government officials aim to provide the social and legal framework within which giant corporations can operate most effectively. This is a close partnership between big business and government and it is argued that the aim is to integrate labour-unions completely in that partnership.

State monopoly capitalist (stamocap) theory aims to define the final historical stage of capitalism following monopoly capitalism, consistent with Lenin's definition of the characteristics of imperialism in his short pamphlet of the same name. Occasionally the stamocap concept also appears in [[neo-Trotskyist]] theories of state capitalism as well as in [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] anti-state theories. The analysis made is usually identical in its main features, but very different political conclusions are drawn from it.

===Political implications===
{{quote|Ever since monopoly capital took over the world, it has kept the greater part of humanity in poverty, dividing all the profits among the group of the most powerful countries. The standard of living in those countries is based on the extreme poverty of our countries.| [[Che Guevara]], 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/02/24.htm At the Afro-Asian Conference in Algeria] by Che Guevara, Delivered at the Second Economic Seminar of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers, Algeria - on February 24, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The strategic political implication of stamocap theory towards the end of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era and afterwards was that the labour movement should form a "people's democratic alliance" under the leadership of the Communist Party with the progressive middle classes and small business against the state and big business (called "monopoly" for short). Sometimes this alliance was also called the "anti-monopoly alliance".

===Neo-Trotskyist theory===
In neo-Trotskyist theory, such an alliance was rejected as being based either on a false strategy of [[popular front]]s, or on political [[opportunism]], said to be incompatible either with a [[permanent revolution]] or with the principle of independent [[working class]] political action.

The [[State (polity)|state]] in Soviet-type societies was redefined by the neo-Trotskyists as being also state-monopoly capitalist. There was no difference between the West and the East in this regard. Consequently, some kind of anti-bureaucratic revolution was said to be required, but different Trotskyist groups quarreled about what form such a revolution would need to take, or could take.

Some Trotskyists believed the anti-bureaucratic revolution would happen spontaneously, inevitably and naturally, others believed it needed to be organised—the aim being to establish a society owned and operated by the working class. According to the neo-Trotskyists, the Communist Party could not play its leading role because it did not represent the interests of the working class.

===Criticism===
When Varga introduced the theory, orthodox Stalinist economists attacked it as incompatible with the doctrine that state planning was a feature only of socialism and that "under capitalism anarchy of production reigns".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevskaya/works/1949/varga.htm The Case of Eugene Varga] Raya Dunayevskaya 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the stamocap theory (e.g. [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Leo Kofler]]) claimed the following:
* Stamocap theory wrongly implied that the state could somehow overrule inter-capitalist [[competition]], the laws of motion of capitalism and market forces generally, supposedly cancelling out the operation of the [[law of value]]. 
* Stamocap theory lacked any sophisticated account of the class basis of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the real linkages between governments and elites. It postulated a monolithic structure of [[wikt:domination|domination]] which in reality did not exist in that way.
* Stamocap theory failed to explain the rise of [[neo-liberal]] ideology in the business class, which claims precisely that an important social goal should be a reduction of the state's influence in the economy. 
* Stamocap theory failed to show clearly what the difference was between a socialist state and a bourgeois state, except that in a socialist state the Communist Party (or, rather, its central committee) played the leading political role. In that case, the class-content of the state itself was defined purely in terms of the policy of the ruling political party (or its central committee).

===In popular culture===
* ''[[WALL-E]]'' has the "Buy n' Large" corporation, which acted as the ''[[de facto]]'' and possibly ''[[de jure]]'' government in the decades before, and after, the evacuation of Earth.
* The Druuge, an alien race in ''[[Star Control]]'', are governed by the Crimson Corporation, which owns the Druuge home planet and everything on it. All Druuge are employees and/or shareholders of this corporation and Druuge who lose their jobs are immediately executed for stealing the planet's air, which the company owns, by breathing it.

==Current forms in the 21st century==
State capitalism is distinguished from capitalist [[mixed economies]] where the state [[State interventionism|intervenes]] in markets to correct market failures or to establish social regulation or social welfare provisions in the following way: the state operates [[business]]es for the purpose of accumulating capital and directing investment in the framework of either a free market or a mixed-market economy. In such a system, governmental functions and public services are often organized as [[corporation]]s, companies or business enterprises.

===China===
Many analysts assert that China is one of the main examples of state capitalism in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives], by Vahan Janjigian, forbes.com, Mar. 22 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/ The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism], by Gady Epstein, forbes.com, Aug. 31 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'' (2012). "State Capitalism: The Visible Hand". Special Report.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations]]'', political scientist [[Ian Bremmer]] describes China as the primary driver for the rise of state capitalism as a challenge to the free market economies of the developed world, particularly in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/439ccee0-bec6-11df-a755-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=9bee261a-bec7-11df-a755-00144feab49a.html#axzz17YEJxrzO | title=State capitalism: China's 'market-Leninism' has yet to face biggest test | first=Geoff | last=Dyer | work=Financial Times | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremmer draws a broad definition of state capitalism as such:&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/09/we_re_all_state_capitalists_now | title=We're All State Capitalists Now | first=Niall | last=Ferguson |work=Foreign Policy |date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|In this system, governments use various kinds of state-owned companies to manage the exploitation of resources that they consider the state's crown jewels and to create and maintain large numbers of jobs. They use select privately owned companies to dominate certain economic sectors. They use so-called sovereign wealth funds to invest their extra cash in ways that maximize the state's profits. In all three cases, the state is using markets to create wealth that can be directed as political officials see fit. And in all three cases, the ultimate motive is not economic (maximizing growth) but political (maximizing the state's power and the leadership's chances of survival). This is a form of capitalism but one in which the state acts as the dominant economic player and uses markets primarily for political gain.}}

Following on Bremmer, Aligica and Tarko&lt;ref&gt;Aligica, Paul and Vlad Tarko (2012). "State Capitalism and the Rent-SeekingConjecture", ''Constitutional Political Economy ''23(4): 357-379&lt;/ref&gt; further develop the theory that state capitalism in countries like modern day China and Russia is an example of a [[rent-seeking]] society. They argue that following the realization that the centrally planned socialist systems could not effectively compete with capitalist economies, formerly Communist Party political elites are trying to engineer a limited form of economic liberalization that increases efficiency while still allowing them to maintain political control and power.

In his article "We're All State Capitalists Now", British historian and Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at [[Harvard University]] [[Niall Ferguson]] warns against "an unhelpful oversimplification to divide the world into 'market capitalist' and 'state capitalist' camps. The reality is that most countries are arranged along a spectrum where both the intent and the extent of state intervention in the economy vary".&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; He then notes:&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; {{quotation|The real contest of our time is not between a state-capitalist China and a market-capitalist America, with Europe somewhere in the middle. It is a contest that goes on within all three regions as we all struggle to strike the right balance between the economic institutions that generate wealth and the political institutions that regulate and redistribute it.}}

Analysis of the "[[Socialist market economy|Chinese model]]" by the economists Julan Du and Chenggang Xu finds that the contemporary [[Economy of China|economic system of the People's Republic of China]] represents a state capitalist system as opposed to a market socialist system. The reason for this categorization is the existence of [[financial market]]s in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in the market socialist literature and in the classic models of market socialism; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a [[basic income]]/[[social dividend]] or similar scheme, which are major features in the market socialist literature. They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism or Capitalism?

===Norway===
The [[government of Norway]] has ownership stakes in many of the country's largest publicly listed companies, owning 37% of the Oslo stockmarket&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570842-oil-makes-norway-different-rest-region-only-up-point-rich|title=Norway: The rich cousin – Oil makes Norway different from the rest of the region, but only up to a point|date=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates the country's largest non-listed companies including [[Statoil]] and [[Statkraft]]. The government also operates a sovereign wealth fund, the [[Government Pension Fund of Norway]], whose partial objective is to prepare Norway for a post-oil future.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

Modern Norwegian state capitalism has its origins in public ownership of the country's oil reserves and in the country's [[post-World War II]] [[social democratic]] reforms.

===Singapore===

===Taiwan===
Taiwan's economy has been classified as a state capitalist system influenced by its Leninist model of political control, a legacy which still lingers in the decision-making process. [[Taiwan's economy]] includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the Taiwanese state's role in the economy shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dittmer |first= Lowell |title= Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace |publisher= University of California Press|year= 2017|isbn= 978-0520295988|page = 118|quote=A decade after Taiwan made its democratic transition, the KMT’s Leninist control model has yet to fade from the decision-making process. In short, both China’s and Taiwan’s state capitalism have their roots in the Leninist legacy...To be specific, Taiwan’s state capitalism has experienced a transformation from ‘leviathan as entrepreneur’ in the pre-1989 period to ‘leviathan as a minority investor’ with the agenda of democratization in the late 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Taiwanese economists refer to Taiwan's economy model as "[[party-state capitalism]]".

'''Temporary Assistance for Needy Families''' ('''TANF''' {{IPAc-en||t|æ|n|f}}) is one of the [[United States of America]]'s [[federal assistance]] programs.  It began on July 1, 1997, and succeeded the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program, providing cash assistance to indigent American families through the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2011. "TANF". Accessed 12/9/2011 from {{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314134457/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cash benefit is often referred to simply as "welfare."

TANF was created by the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] instituted under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 1996. The Act provides temporary financial assistance while aiming to get people off of that assistance, primarily through employment. There is a maximum of 60 months of benefits within one's lifetime, but some states have instituted shorter periods.&lt;ref&gt;http://cqresearcherblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/are-safety-nets-working.html Are "Safety Nets" Working. CQ Researcher Blog&lt;/ref&gt;  The reform granted states wide discretion of how to distribute TANF entitlements. States also have the authority to eliminate payments to recipients altogether. Under the new act, TANF recipients are required to find a job within 24 months of receiving aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Dorothy|title=Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty|year=1997|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In enforcing the 60-month time limit, some states place limits on the adult portion of the assistance only, while still aiding the otherwise eligible children in the household.

==Background==
Prior to TANF, [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] was a major [[federal assistance]] program that was coming under heavy criticism. Some argued that such programs were ineffective, promoted dependency on the government, and encouraged behaviors detrimental to escaping from [[poverty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mead |first=Lawrence M. |year=1986 |title=Beyond Entitlement: The Social Obligations of Citizenship |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0-02-920890-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7VD5plVv_YC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people also argued that TANF is detrimental to its recipients because using these programs have a stigma attached to them, which makes the people that use them less likely to participate politically to defend this program, and thus the programs have been subsequently weakened.  Beginning with President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration and continuing through the first few years of the Clinton administration, growing dissatisfaction with AFDC, particularly the rise in welfare caseloads, led an increasing number of states to seek waivers from AFDC rules to allow states to more stringently enforce work requirements for welfare recipients. The 27 percent increase in caseloads between 1990 and 1994 accelerated the push by states to implement more radical [[welfare reform]].&lt;ref name="Blank2002"/&gt;

States that were granted waivers from AFDC program rules to run mandatory welfare-to-work programs were also required to rigorously evaluate the success of their programs. As a result, many types of mandatory welfare-to-work programs were evaluated in the early 1990s. While reviews of such programs found that almost all programs led to significant increases in employment and reductions in welfare rolls, there was little evidence that income among former welfare recipients had increased. In effect, increases in earnings from jobs were offset by losses in public income, leading many to conclude that these programs had no anti-poverty effects.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Dan and Charles Michalopoulos. 2001. ''How Welfare and Work Policies Affect Employment and Income: A Synthesis of Research''. New York: Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; However, the findings that welfare-to-work programs did have some effect in reducing dependence on government increased support among policymakers for moving welfare recipients into employment.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordschool.umich.edu/research/pdf/Isrconference.pdf|last=Danziger|first=Sheldon|title=Welfare Reform Policy from Nixon to Clinton: What Role for Social Science?|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy]]|date=December 1999|accessdate=2011-12-11}} Paper prepared for Conference, "The Social Science and Policy Making". Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan, March 13–14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

While liberals and conservatives agreed on the importance of transitioning families from government assistance to jobs, they disagreed on how to accomplish this goal. Liberals thought that welfare reform should expand opportunities for welfare mothers to receive training and work experience that would help them raise their families' living standards by working more and at higher wages.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998"/&gt; Conservatives emphasized work requirements and time limits, paying little attention to whether or not families' incomes increased. More specifically, conservatives wanted to impose a five-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits and provide block grants for states to fund programs for poor families.&lt;ref name ="NW"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Institute for Policy Research |publisher=Northwestern University |title=A Look Back at Welfare Reform |year=2008 |volume=30 |issue=1 |accessdate=2011-10-11 |url=http://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/publications/docs/newsletter/NLW08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives argued that welfare to work reform would be beneficial by creating role models out of mothers, promoting maternal self-esteem and sense of control, and introducing productive daily routines into family life. Furthermore, they argued that reforms would eliminate welfare dependence by sending a powerful message to teens and young women to postpone childbearing. Liberals responded that the reform sought by conservatives would overwhelm severely stressed parents, deepen the poverty of many families, and force young children into unsafe and unstimulating child care situations. In addition, they asserted that welfare reform would reduce parents' ability to monitor the behaviors of their children, leading to problems in child and adolescent functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Greg J. and P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale. 2001. "For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families." In ''For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of children and Families''. New York: [[Russell Sage Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, as a presidential candidate, Bill Clinton pledged to "end welfare as we know it" by requiring families receiving welfare to work after two years. As president, Clinton was attracted to welfare expert and [[Harvard University]] Professor [[David T. Ellwood|David Ellwood]]'s proposal on welfare reform and thus Clinton eventually appointed Ellwood to co-chair his welfare task force. Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system. He advocated providing assistance to families for a limited time, after which recipients would be required to earn wages from a regular job or a work opportunity program.&lt;ref name="Danziger1998" /&gt; Low wages would be supplemented by expanded tax credits, access to subsidized childcare and health insurance, and guaranteed child support.

In 1994, Clinton introduced a welfare reform proposal that would provide job training coupled with time limits and subsidized jobs for those having difficulty finding work, but it was defeated.&lt;ref name ="NW" /&gt; Later that year, when Republicans attained a Congressional majority in November 1994, the focus shifted toward the Republican proposal to end [[entitlement]]s to assistance, repeal AFDC and instead provide states with blocks grants.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" &gt;Greenberg, Mark et al. 2000. Welfare Reauthorization: An Early Guide to the Issues. Center for Law and Social Policy&lt;/ref&gt; The debates in Congress about welfare reform centered around five themes:&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" /&gt;
* '' '''Reforming Welfare to Promote Work and Time Limits:''' '' The welfare reform discussions were dominated by the perception that the then-existing cash assistance program, AFDC, did not do enough to encourage and require employment, and instead incentivized non-work. Supporters of welfare reform also argued that AFDC fostered divorce and out-of-wedlock birth, and created a culture of dependency on government assistance. Both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans emphasized the need to transform the cash assistance system into a work-focused, time-limited program.
* '' '''Reducing Projected Spending:''' '' Republicans argued that projected federal spending for low-income families needed to be reduced because it was too high and that this reduction was necessary to reduce federal spending.
[[File:Clinton prwora.PNG|thumb|250px|right|President [[Bill Clinton]] signing welfare reform legislation.]]
* '' '''Promoting Parental Responsibility:''' '' There was broad agreement among politicians that both parents should support their children. For custodial parents, this meant an emphasis on work and cooperation with child support enforcement. For non-custodial parents, it meant a set of initiatives to strengthen the effectiveness of the child support enforcement.
* '' '''Addressing Out-of-Wedlock Birth:''' '' Republicans argued that out of wedlock birth was presenting an increasingly serious social problem and that the federal government should work to reduce out-of-wedlock births.
* '' '''Promoting Devolution:''' '' A common theme in the debates was that the federal government had failed and that states were more successful in providing for the needy, and thus reform needed to provide more power and authority to states to shape such policy.

Clinton twice vetoed the welfare reform bill put forward by Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. Then just before the Democratic Convention he signed a third version after the [[United States Senate|Senate]] voted 74-24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=104&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00232|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|work=senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] voted 256-170&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll331.xml&lt;/ref&gt;  in favor of welfare reform legislation, formally known as the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] of 1996 (PRWORA).  Clinton signed the bill into law on August 22, 1996. PRWORA replaced AFDC with TANF and dramatically changed the way the federal government and states determine eligibility and provide aid for needy families.

Before 1997, the federal government designed the overall program requirements and guidelines, while states administered the program and determined eligibility for benefits.  Since 1997, states have been given block grants and both design and administer their own programs.  Access to welfare and amount of assistance varied quite a bit by state and locality under AFDC, both because of the differences in state standards of need and considerable subjectivity in caseworker evaluation of qualifying "suitable homes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lieberman |first=Robert |title=Shifting the Color Line: Race and the American Welfare State |location=Boston |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-674-00711-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, welfare recipients under TANF are actually in completely different programs depending on their state of residence, with different social services available to them and different requirements for maintaining aid.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Darren S. "Aid to Families with Dependent Children (ADFC)", in ''Encyclopedia of Health Care Management'', ed. Michael J. Stahl. SAGE Publications, 2003, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding and eligibility==

PRWORA replaced AFDC with TANF and ended entitlement to cash assistance for low-income families, meaning that some families may be denied aid even if they are eligible. Under TANF, states have broad discretion to determine who is eligible for benefits and services. In general, states must use funds to serve families with children, with the only exceptions related to efforts to reduce non-marital childbearing and promote marriage. States cannot use TANF funds to assist most legal immigrants until they have been in the country for at least five years. TANF sets forth the following work requirements in order to qualify for benefits:&lt;ref name="Schott"&gt;Schott, Liz. 2011. Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF. Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Accessed 11/2/2011 from http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=936&lt;/ref&gt;

# Recipients (with few exceptions) must work as soon as they are job ready or no later than two years after coming on assistance.
# Single parents are required to participate in work activities for at least 30 hours per week. Two-parent families must participate in work activities 35 or 55 hours a week, depending upon circumstance.
# Failure to participate in work requirements can result in a reduction or termination of benefits to the family.
# States, in [[fiscal year]] 2004, have to ensure that 50 percent of all families and 90 percent of two-parent families are participating in work activities. If a state meets these goals without restricting eligibility, it can receive a caseload reduction credit. This credit reduces the minimum participation rates the state must achieve to continue receiving federal funding.

While states are given more flexibility in the design and implementation of public assistance, they must do so within various provisions of the law:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. About TANF.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Accessed 11/2/2011 from {{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314134457/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/tanf/about.html |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide [[federal assistance|assistance]] to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;
# end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;
# prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies;
# and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.

[[File:TANF Program Spending.png|thumb|right|TANF Program Spending&lt;ref name="Schott" /&gt;]]

Since these four goals are deeply general, "states can use TANF funds much more broadly than the core welfare reform areas of providing a safety net and connecting families to work; some states use a substantial share of funding for these other services and program".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-an-introduction-to-tanf|title=Policy Basics: An Introduction to TANF|date=2008-11-17|work=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|access-date=2017-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for TANF underwent several changes from its predecessor, AFDC. Under AFDC, states provided cash assistance to families with children, and the federal government paid half or more of all program costs.&lt;ref name="Greenberg2000" /&gt; Federal spending was provided to states on an open-ended basis, meaning that funding was tied to the number of caseloads. Federal law mandated that states provide some level of cash assistance to eligible poor families but states had broad discretion in setting the benefit levels. Under TANF, states qualify for block grants. The funding for these block grants are fixed and the amount each state receives is based on the level of federal contributions to the state for the AFDC program in 1994&lt;ref&gt;Loprest, Pamela, Stefanie Schmidt, and Anne Dryden White. 2000. "Welfare Reform under PRWORA: Aid to Children with Working Families?" in ''Tax Policy and the Economy'' edited by James M. Poterba: 157-203&lt;/ref&gt;  States are required to  maintain their spending for welfare programs at 80 percent of their 1994 spending levels, with a reduction to 75 percent if states meet other work-participation requirements. States have greater flexibility in deciding how they spend funds as long as they meet the provisions of TANF described above.

In July 2012, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] released a memo notifying states that they are able to apply for a waiver for the work requirements of the TANF program. Critics claim the waiver would allow states to provide assistance without having to enforce the work component of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republicans accuse HHS of gutting welfare reform with quiet policy change |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/07/13/republicans-accuse-hhs-gutting-welfare-reform-with-quiet-policy-change/ |work=FoxNews.com |date=July 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administration has stipulated that any waivers that weaken the work requirement will be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Romney's starting his race to the bottom

==Impact==
Discussions about the effectiveness of TANF by policymakers and proponents of welfare reform has centered on the rapid decline in the number of families on welfare since TANF went into effect. Indeed, if measured by the reduction in welfare caseloads, TANF has been a success. Between 1996 and 2000, the number of welfare recipients plunged by 6.5 million, or 53% nationally. Furthermore, the number of caseloads was lower in 2000 than at any time since 1969, and the percentages of persons receiving public assistance income (less than 3%) was the lowest on record.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002"&gt;Lichter, Daniel T. and Rukamalie Jayakody. 2002. "Welfare Reform: How Do We Measure Success?" ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 28:117-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the implementation of TANF occurred during a period of strong economic growth, there are questions about how much of the decline in caseloads is attributable to TANF program requirements. First, the number of caseloads began declining after 1994, the year with the highest number of caseloads, well before the enactment of TANF, suggesting that TANF was not solely responsible for the caseload decline.&lt;ref name ="Blank2002"&gt;Blank, Rebecca. 2002. "Evaluating Welfare Reform in the United States." Journal of Economic Literature, American Economic Association 40(4): 1105-116&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that both changes in welfare policy and economic growth played a substantial role in this decline, and that no larger than one-third of the decline in caseloads is attributable to TANF&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bavier2001"&gt;Bavier, Richard. 2001. "Welfare Reform Data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation." Monthly Labor Review (July): 13-24&lt;/ref&gt;

While declining caseloads dominates discussion about TANF's effect, declining caseloads are an incomplete and misleading indicator of TANF's success. Caseload reductions indicate less reliance on government assistance, but they do not account for the well-being of poor families and children. As such, other factors have been taken into account in assessing the impact of TANF: work, earnings, and poverty of former welfare-recipients; marriage and fertility of mothers; well-being of mothers; and child well-being.

===Work, earnings, and poverty===
One of the major goals of TANF was to increase work among welfare recipients. During the post-welfare reform period, employment did increase among single mothers.  Single mothers with children showed little changes in their labor force participation rates throughout the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, but between 1994-1999, their labor force participation rose by 10%.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; Among welfare recipients, the percentage that reported earnings from employment increased from 6.7% in 1990 to 28.1% by 1999.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; While employment of TANF recipients increased in the early years of reform, it declined in the later period after reform, particularly after 2000. From 2000-2005, employment among TANF recipients declined by 6.5%.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007"&gt;Acs, Gregory and Pamela Loprest. 2007. "TANF Caseload Composition and Leavers Synthesis Report". The Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Among welfare leavers, it was estimated that close to two-thirds worked at a future point in time&lt;ref name="Moffitt2000"&gt;Moffitt, Robert A. and Jennifer Roff. 2000. "The Diversity of Welfare Leavers, Welfare Children, and Families: A Three City Study." Johns Hopkins University Policy Brief 00-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devere, Christine. 2001. "Welfare Reform Research: What Do We Know About Those Who Leave Welfare?" CRS Report for Congress. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research service&lt;/ref&gt;  About 20 percent of welfare leavers are not working, without a spouse, and without any public assistance.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007" /&gt; Those who left welfare because of sanctions (time limits or failure to meet program requirements) fared comparably worse than those who left welfare voluntarily. Sanctioned welfare recipients have employment rates that are, on average, 20 percent below those who left for reasons other than sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Tweedie, Jack. 2001. "Sanctions and Exists: What States Know about Families that leave Welfare Because of Sanctions and Time Limits." In ''For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

While the participation of many low-income single parents in the labor market has increased, their earnings and wages remained low, and their employment was concentrated in low-wage occupations and industries. Over three quarters (78 percent) of employed low-income single parents were concentrated in 4 typically low-wage occupations: service; administrative support and clerical; operators, fabricators, and laborers; and sales and related jobs.&lt;ref name="Peterson2002"&gt;Peterson, Janice et al. 2002. Life After Welfare Reform: Low-income Single Parent Families, Pre- and Post-TANF. Institute for Women's Policy Research #D446&lt;/ref&gt; While the average income among TANF recipients increased over the early years of reform, it has become stagnant in the later period; for welfare leavers, their average income remained steady or declined in the later years.&lt;ref name="Loprest2007" /&gt; Studies that compared household income (includes welfare benefits) before and after leaving welfare find that between one-third and one-half of welfare leavers had decreased income after leaving welfare.&lt;ref name="Bavier2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cancian2000"&gt;
Cancian, Maria. 2000. Before and After TANF: The Economic Well-Being of Women Leaving Welfare. Institute for Research on Poverty. Special Report no.77&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, poverty among single-mother and their families declined rapidly from 35.4% in 1992 to 24.7% in 2000, a new historic low.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; However, due to the fact that low-income mothers who left welfare are likely to be concentrated in low-wage occupations, the decline in public assistance caseloads has not translated easily into reduction in poverty. The number of poor female-headed families with children dropped from 3.8 million to 3.1 million between 1994 and 1999, a 22% decline compared to a 48% decline in caseloads.&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt; As a result, the share of [[working poor]] in the U.S. population rose, as some women left public assistance for employment but remained poor.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt; Most studies have found that poverty is quite high among welfare leavers. Depending on the source of the data, estimates of poverty among leavers vary from about 48% to 74%.&lt;ref name="Moffitt2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Loprest 2001"&gt;Loprest, Pamela. 2001.

===Marriage and fertility===

A major impetus for welfare reform was concern about increases in out-of-wedlock births and declining marriage rates, especially among low-income women.  The major goals of the 1996 legislation included reducing out-of-wedlock births and increasing rates and stability of marriages.&lt;ref name="Blank2002" /&gt;

Studies have produced only modest or inconsistent evidence that marital and cohabitation decisions are influenced by welfare program policies.  Schoeni and Blank (2003) found that pre-1996 welfare waivers were associated with modest increases in probabilities of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schoeni |first=Robert F. |first2=Rebecca M. |last2=Blank |title=What Has Welfare Reform Accomplished? Impacts on Welfare Participation, Employment, Income, Poverty, and Family Structure |work=PSC Research Report |volume=No. 03-544 |date=December 2003 |url=http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/pdf/rr03-544.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a similar analysis of post-TANF effect revealed less consistent results. Nationally, only 0.4% of closed cases gave marriage as the reason for leaving welfare.&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt; Using data on marriage and divorces from 1989-2000 to examine the role of welfare reform on marriage and divorce, Bitler (2004) found that both state waivers and TANF program requirements were associated with reductions in transitions into marriage and reductions from marriage to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Bitler, Marianne. 2004. "The Impact of Welfare Reform on Marriage and Divorce". ''Demography'' 41(2):213-236&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals who were not married were more likely to stay unmarried, and those who were married were more likely to stay married. Her explanation behind this, which is consistent with other studies, is that after reform single women were required to work more, increasing their income and reducing their incentive to give up independence for marriage, whereas for married women, post-reform there was potentially a significant increase in the number of hours they would have to work when single, discouraging divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Harknett, K. and L.A. Gennetian. 2003. "How An Earning Supplement Can Affect Union Formation Among Low-Income Single Mothers." Demography 40:451-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, D. T. and C. Jencks. 2001. "The Growing Differences in Family Structure: What Do We Know? Where Do We Look for Answers?" Unpublished manuscript, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to marriage and divorce, welfare reform was also concerned about unwed childbearing. Specific provisions in TANF were aimed at reducing unwed childbearing. For example, TANF provided cash bonuses to states with the largest reductions in unwed childbearing that are not accompanied by more abortions. States were also required to eliminate cash benefits to unwed teens under age 18 who did not reside with their parents. TANF allowed states to impose family caps on the receipt of additional cash benefits from unwed childbearing. Between 1994 and 1999, unwed childbearing among teenagers declined 20 percent among 15- to 17-year-olds and 10 percent among 18- and 19-year-olds.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt;  In a comprehensive cross-state comparison, Horvath-Rose &amp; Peters (2002) studied nonmarital birth ratios with and without family cap waivers over the 1986-1996 period, and they found that family caps reduced nonmarital ratios.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath-Rose, A. and HE Peters. 2002. "Welfare waivers and nonmarital fertility". in ''For Better and For Worse: Welfare Reform and Well-Being of Children and Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 222-245&lt;/ref&gt;  Any fears that family caps would lead to more abortions was allayed by declining numbers and rates of abortion  during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, S. K. 2001. ''Birth and abortion data. In Data Needs for Measuring Family and Fertility Change After Welfare Reform'', ed. D. J. Basharov. College Park, MD: Welfare Reform Academy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child well-being===
Proponents of welfare reform argued that encouraging maternal employment will enhance children's [[cognitive development|cognitive]] and emotional development. A working mother, proponents assert, provides a positive role model for her children. Opponents, on the other hand, argued that requiring women to work at low pay puts additional stress on mothers, reduces the quality time spent with children, and diverts income to work-related expenses such as transportation and childcare.&lt;ref name ="Lichter2002" /&gt; Evidence is mixed on the impact of TANF on child welfare. Duncan &amp; Chase-Lansdale (2001) found that the impact of welfare reform varied by age of the children, with generally positive effects on school achievement among elementary-school age children and negative effects on adolescents, especially with regards to risky or problematic behaviors.&lt;ref name ="Duncan2001"&gt;Duncan, G. J. and L. Chase-Lansdale. 2002. ''For Better and For Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-Being of Children and Families''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found large and significant effects of welfare reform on educational achievement and aspirations, and on social behavior (i.e. teacher assessment of compliance and self-control, competence and sensitivity). The positive effects were largely due to the quality of childcare arrangement and afterschool programs that accompanied the move from welfare to work for these recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Mistry, R.S., D.A. Crosby, AC Huston, and DM Casey, M Ripke. 2002. Lessons from New Hope: the impact on children's well-being of a work-based [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]] for parents. See Duncan and Chase-Landsdale 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another study found that substitution from maternal care to other informal care had caused a significant drop in performance of young children.&lt;ref name ="BernalKeane"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bernal |first=R. |first2=M. P. |last2=Keane |title=Child care choices and children's cognitive achievement: The case of single mothers |journal=[[Journal of Labor Economics]] |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=459–512 |doi=10.1086/659343 |citeseerx=10.1.1.378.9391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a program with less generous benefits, Kalili et al. (2002) found that maternal work (measured in months and hours per week) had little overall effect on children's antisocial behavior, anxious/depressed behavior or positive behavior. They find no evidence that children were harmed by such transitions; if anything, their mothers report that their children are better behaved and have better mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Kalili, Ariel et al. 2001. "Does Maternal Employment Mandated by Welfare Reform Affect Children's Behavior?"  In For Better and for Worse: Welfare Reform and the Well-being of Children Families. New York: Russell Sage Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthesizing findings from an extensive selection of publications, Golden (2005) reached the conclusion that children's outcomes were largely unchanged when examining children's developmental risk, including health status, behavior or emotional problems, suspensions from school, and lack of participation in extracurricular activities.&lt;ref name="Golden2005" &gt;Golden, Olivia. 2005. Assessing the New Federalism, Eight Years Later. Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that contrary to the fears of many, welfare reform and an increase in parental work did not seem to have reduced children's well-being overall. More abused and neglected children had not entered the child welfare system. However, at the same time, improvement in parental earnings and reductions in child poverty had not consistently improved outcomes for children.

===Maternal well-being===
While the material and economic well-being of welfare mothers after the enactment of TANF has been the subject of countless studies, their mental and physical well-being has received little attention. Research on the latter has found that welfare recipients face mental and physical problems at rates that are higher than the general population.&lt;ref name="Danziger2001"&gt;Danziger, S. K. 2001. ''Why some fail to achieve economic security: Low job skills and mental health problems are key barriers''. Forum 4(2):1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Such problems which include [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[domestic violence]] mean that welfare recipients face many more barriers to employment and are more at risk of welfare sanctions due to noncompliance with work requirements and other TANF regulations&lt;ref name="Lichter2002" /&gt;  Research on the health status of welfare leavers have indicated positive results. Findings from the Women's Employment Study, a [[longitudinal survey]] of welfare recipients in Michigan, indicated that women on welfare but not working are more likely to have mental health and other problems than are former welfare recipients now working.&lt;ref name="Danziger2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollack |first=H. |first2=S. |last2=Danziger |first3=R. |last3=Jayakody |first4=K. |last4=Seefeldt |title=Drug Testing Welfare Recipients—False Positives, False Negatives, Unanticipated Opportunities |journal=Women's Health Issues |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=23–31 |doi=10.1016/S1049-3867(01)00139-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, interviews with now employed welfare recipients find that partly as a result of their increased material resources from working, the women felt that work has led to higher [[self-esteem]], new opportunities to expand their [[social support]] networks, and increased feelings of [[self-efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;London, A. S., Scott, E. K., Edin, K. and Hunter, V. (2004), "Welfare Reform, Work-Family Tradeoffs, and Child Well-Being". ''Family Relations'' 53: 148–158&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they became less socially isolated and potentially less prone to depression. At the same time, however, many women were experiencing stress and exhaustion from trying to balance work and family responsibilities.

==Reauthorization==
Enacted in July 1997, TANF was set for reauthorization in Congress in 2002. However, Congress was unable to reach an agreement for the next several years, and as a result, several extensions were granted to continue funding the program. TANF was finally reauthorized under the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005|Deficit Reduction ACT (DRA) of 2005]]. DRA included several changes to the original TANF program. It raised work participation rates, increased the share of welfare recipients subject to work requirements, limited the activities that could be counted as work, prescribed hours that could be spent doing certain work activities, and required states to verify activities for each adult beneficiary.&lt;ref name="Zedlewski2010"&gt;Zedlewski, Sheila and Olivia Golden.  2010. "Next Steps for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families." The Urban Institute: Brief(11) accessed December 12/2011 from http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412047_next_steps_brief11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (ARRA), Congress created a new TANF Emergency Fund (TANF EF), funded at $5 billion and available to states, territories, and tribes for federal fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  The original TANF law provided for a Contingency Fund (CF) funded at $2 billion which allows states meeting economic triggers to draw additional funds based upon high levels of state MOE spending. This fund was expected to (and did) run out in FY 2010.  The TANF Emergency Fund provided states 80 percent of the funding for spending increases in three categories of TANF-related expenditures in FYs 2009 or 2010 over FYs 2007 or 2008.  The three categories of expenditures that could be claimed were basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term benefits, and subsidized employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

TANF was scheduled for reauthorization again in 2010. However, Congress did not work on legislation to reauthorize the program and instead they extended the TANF block grant through September 30, 2011, as part of the [[Claims Resolution Act of 2010|Claims Resolution Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Law and Social Policy. 2010. "TANF Reauthorization." Accessed 12/12/2011 from http://www.clasp.org/federal_policy/pages?id=0021&lt;/ref&gt; During this period Congress once again did not reauthorize the program but passed a three-month extension through December 31, 2011.

== Exiting The TANF Program ==
When transitioning out of the TANF program, individuals find themselves in one of three situations that constitute the reasons for exiting:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irving|first=Shelley K.|date=2008-12-01|title=State Welfare Rules, TANF Exits, and Geographic Context: Does Place Matter?*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1526/003601108786471549/abstract|journal=Rural Sociology|language=en|volume=73|issue=4|pages=605–630|doi=10.1526/003601108786471549|issn=1549-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first situation involves work related TANF exit, in which individuals no longer qualify for TANF assistance due to acquired employment.
# The second type of situation is non- work TANF related exit in which the recipient no longer qualifies for assistance due to reaching the maximum time allowed to be enrolled in the assistance program. Once their time limit has been reached, individuals are removed from receiving assistance.
# The third type of situation is continued TANF receipt in which employed recipients earning a wage that does not help cover expenses continue receiving assistance.
It has been observed that certain situations of TANF exit are more prominent depending on the geographic area which recipients live in. Focusing the comparison between metropolitan (urban) areas and non-metropolitan (rural) areas, the number of recipients experiencing non work TANF related exit is highest among rural areas (rural areas in the South experience the highest cases of this type of exiting the program).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Information asymmetry or lack of knowledge among recipients on the various TANF work incentive programs is a contributor to recipients experiencing non work related TANF exits. Not being aware of the offered programs impacts their use and creates misconceptions that influence the responsiveness of those who qualify for such programs, resulting in longer time periods requiring TANF services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven G.|date=2002-01-01|title=Ensuring the Stability of Welfare-to-Work Exits: The Importance of Recipient Knowledge about Work Incentives|jstor=23717936|journal=Social Work|volume=47|issue=2|pages=162–170|doi=10.1093/sw/47.2.162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients who exit TANF due to work are also affected by information asymmetry due to lack of awareness on the "transitional support" programs available to facilitate their transitioning into the work field. Programs such as childcare, food stamps, and Medicaid are meant increase work incentive but many TANF recipients transitioning into work do not know they are eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Steven G.|last2=Schuldt|first2=Richard|last3=Halter|first3=Anthony P.|last4=Scott|first4=Jeff|date=2003-01-01|title=Employment Experiences and Support Services Use Following TANF Exits|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J185v02n01_04|journal=The Social Policy Journal|volume=2|issue=1|pages=35–56|doi=10.1300/J185v02n01_04|issn=1533-2942}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that TANF-exiting working women who use and maintain the transitional incentive services described above are less likely to return to receiving assistance and are more likely to experience long term employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/research/publication/helping-women-stay-welfare|title=Helping Women Stay Off Welfare: The Role of Post-Exit Receipt of Work Supports|last=Acs|first=Gregory|date=August 2007|website=[[The Urban Institute]]|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Peter Edelman]], an assistant secretary in the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned from the Clinton administration in protest of Clinton signing the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], which he called, "The worst thing Bill Clinton has done."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/us/two-clinton-aides-resign-to-protest-new-welfare-law.html Two Clinton Aides Resign to Protest New Welfare Law] by Alison Mitchell, ''The New York Times'', September 12, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; According to Edelman, the 1996 welfare reform law destroyed the safety net. It increased poverty, lowered income for single mothers, put people from welfare into homeless shelters, and left states free to eliminate welfare entirely. It moved mothers and children from welfare to work, but many of them aren't making enough to survive. Many of them were pushed off welfare rolls because they didn't show up for an appointment, when they had no transportation to get to the appointment, or weren't informed about the appointment, said Edelman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=fac_lectures Poverty &amp; Welfare: Does Compassionate Conservatism Have a Heart?

Critics later said that TANF was successful during the Clinton Administration when the economy was booming, but failed to support the poor when jobs were no longer available during the downturn, particularly the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]], and particularly after the lifetime limits imposed by TANF may have been reached by many recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/As_Progressives_Predicted_Clinton_Welfare_Reform_Law_Fails_Families_8029.html As Progressives Predicted, Clinton Welfare Reform Law Fails Families] by Randy Shaw in BeyondChron (April 19‚ 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheJoyOfWork.jpg|thumb|150px|''The Joy of Work'' by Scott Adams]]
'''''The Joy of Work''''' (1998) by [[Scott Adams]] is a two-part book. The first part offers recommendations as to how office workers can find [[happiness]] at their [[cubicle desk]]s and the second part is a formula for creating [[humor]], based on the author's experience penning the ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="Touzet2010"&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|author=Claude Touzet|title=Conscience, Intelligence, Libre-arbitre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekkODUMG-t0C&amp;pg=PA87|year=2010|publisher=Touzet|isbn=978-2-919411-00-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The title is a comic reference to the 1972 sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The first part of the book explains "how to find happiness at the expense of your co-workers", including how to deal with superiors, meetings and co-workers and how to avoid work while having fun; an entire chapter is devoted to office [[Practical joke|pranks]]. The second part is an analysis of humor and how to write funny material. Adams writes, "The third part of the book is made entirely out of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that's why."

The book includes a response to [[Norman Solomon]], who attempted to depict Scott Adams as a proponent of downsizing in his 1997 book, ''The Trouble with Dilbert''. People who were offended by certain Dilbert strips are also addressed, with Adams concluding that it is the "proximity" of sensitive subjects to negative concepts that causes "people who are angry for no good reason (nuts)" to take offense.

The '''Thompson Trophy''' race was one of the [[National Air Races]] of the heyday of early airplane racing in the 1930s. Established in 1929, the last race was held in 1961. The race was {{convert|10|mi}} long with {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} pylons marking the turns, and emphasized low altitude flying and maneuverability at high speeds. As the race was flown around a closed course, crowds in the grandstands could easily see much of the spectacle.

There were two series of Thompson races. The first series followed the award of a "Thompson Cup" in the 1929 National Air Races to the winner of the "International Land Plane Free-For-All" (that is, the unlimited class race). Thompson Products (a predecessor to [[TRW Inc.|TRW]]) decided to sponsor a trophy to be awarded for the next ten years for unlimited class racing (though a stipulation was eventually added excluding women pilots). The trophy was designed by [[Walter Sinz]]&lt;ref&gt; Campen, Richard N., Outdoor Sculpture of Ohio, Chagrin Falls, Ohio: West Summit Press, 1980 p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; and is now at [[National Air and Space Museum|Air and Space Museum]]. Sinz also made a pair of {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} models of the trophy for promotional purposes. Races were held for the next ten years, ending in 1939. Further races in this series were precluded by the onset of war.

After [[World War II]] the original trophy was (according to stipulation) retired. Also, advances in airplane technology, especially the advent of the [[turbojet]], complicated matters. It was decided to establish a new series, with "R" (piston engine) and "J" (jet-powered) divisions. The "R" class was for civilian competition; the "J" division was for military pilots and was administered by the [[United States Air Force]]. [[Roscoe Turner]], the last winner of the pre-war trophy, refused to relinquish it, but the original molds were located, and two additional casts were made, differing only in the legend engraved at the base and by placards identifying the division. Division "R" races were held from 1946 to 1949; Division "J" races (also known as "Military Speed Dashes") were held from 1951 to 1961, except 1952 and 1960.

'''Walter Lewis "Wally" Bridgland A.M., O.B.E., J.P.''' (23 March 1908 &amp;ndash; 30 July 1987) was a prominent South Australian businessman and a [[List of mayors and lord mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor of Adelaide]].

==History==
Wally was born at the tin mining town of [[Greenbushes, Western Australia]], where his newly-wed parents Harrie Walter Bridgland (31 May 1879 – 17 October 1947) and Hannah Maud Bridgland, née Cohen, (1876 – 13 June 1958) had set up a store. A year later they returned to Adelaide, living for much of his early life at the Barnard Street, North Adelaide home of the hospitable grandparents [[Lewis Cohen (mayor)|Lewis and Selina Cohen]]; his mother helped run the household. Around 1925 the Cohens moved into an apartment in Colley Terrace, Glenelg and Wally's parents moved to 59 Partridge Street, Glenelg

He was a student at Pulteney Street School (later to become [[Pulteney Grammar School]]), then at Queen's College in North Adelaide. He excelled at schoolboy athletics, cricket and football but like his father, his passion was for swimming, eventually becoming President and a Life Member of the SA Amateur Swimming Association. In 1932 he was instrumental in saving a man who was drowning in the sea off Glenelg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46854182 |title=Rescue From Drowning At Glenelg. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=23 April 1932 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |page=17 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society. His home for most of his adult life was in Pier Street Glenelg, just a few minutes' walk from the beach.

Wally joined the Cadets while at high school, then after leaving school in 1924, while working as accountant for his father's finance company, enrolled with the [[Citizens' Military Forces|CMF]], and served in the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] during World War II, initially with the Light Horse Regiment, which became the Armoured Corps. Because of his experience in the CMF he received a commission and later became a captain. He was transferred to the RAEME in a Docks Operating Company in charge of the harbour at [[Madang]]. Later he was stationed at a hotel in Willunga in charge of Italian POWs who were working farms south of Adelaide. After the war he rejoined the CMF, retiring in 1957.

In 1946, after demobbing, he set up a business at 91a [[Gawler Place, Adelaide|Gawler Place]] "W. L. Bridgland children's furnishings" selling nursery furniture. The shop grew to specialise in play equipment, toys and hobbies. His son Michael joined the business in 1951 and was made a partner in 1957 and a second shop in 81 [[Gawler Place, Adelaide|Gawler Place]] specialising in models, particularly model trains was opened and as "Bridgland's Hobbies" became their sole outlet some time around 1970. The business closed in 1986.

==Public Life==
*Chairman of the board, Adelaide Botanic Gardens.
*President of the Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women's Association (SA Branch)
*served as a Justice of the Peace
*He and daughter Margot were actively involved in the Liberal and Country League (LCL) and were delegates to the State Council.
*In July 1956 he won the Young ward in the Adelaide City Council (as an endorsed LCL candidate) by a majority of six votes. He held the seat for 26 continuous years. He was Lord Mayor from 1966 to 1968, then an Alderman until he retired from Council in 1984. Among the posts he held during this time were Chairman of the Traffic Committee, Public Health Committee and the Health, Welfare, Recreation and Parks Committee. He represented the Council on the Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board for ten years. While Lord Mayor, he was the Council's representative on the Municipal Association of S.A., the Metropolitan County Board, the Council of the Royal Zoological Society, the National Parks Commission, St. Johns Ambulance Association and the Royal Humane Society.
*President of the Adelaide Festival of Arts 1968

==Family==
Walter was the only son of Harrie Walter Bridgland (31 May 1879 – 17 October 1947) whose father Walter James Bridgland died on 20 September 1878 and whose mother Mary Ann Bridgland (née Wigzell) (ca.June 1856 – 7 January 1885) subsequently married [[Vaiben Louis Solomon]] on 6 December 1880 in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]]. Harrie grew up with the surname Solomon, but the relationship with his adoptive father broke down irrevocably some time before 1903 and he resumed his birth name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4931468 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=17 March 1903 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later he acknowledged the father he never knew and not his stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46860182 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=21 May 1932 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain '''Ángel Rivero Méndez'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Rivero'''|'''Méndez'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (October 2, 1856 – February 23, 1930) was a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] soldier, writer, journalist and a businessman who is credited with inventing the "Kola Champagne" soft drink. Rivero Méndez was a Captain in the [[Spanish Army]] during the [[Spanish–American War]]. He is credited with ordering the first shot against the [[United States]] in [[Puerto Rico]] in said conflict.&lt;ref name="SARB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perso.wanadoo.es/padron/rivero/|title=Angel RIVERO. Crónica de la Guerra Hispanoamericana en Puerto Rico.|website=perso.wanadoo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/index.htm|title=1898 La Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico|website=home.coqui.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Rivero Méndez was born on October 2, 1856 in [[Puerto Rico|Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico]] to Juan Rivero and Rosa Méndez, who had immigrated to Puerto Rico from the [[Canary Islands]]. Rivero received his secondary education at the "Colegio de Jesuitas" in Santurce (a section of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], the capital of [[Puerto Rico]]). After graduation, he enlisted in the Spanish Army and entered the Infantry Academy of Puerto Rico. He was given an officer's commission upon graduation from the Academy on August 2, 1882.&lt;ref name="SARB" /&gt;

On October 16, 1882, Rivero Méndez married Manuela Boneta Babel from San Juan. In 1885, he was accepted in the General Military Academy of Toledo in [[Spain]]. There he wrote ''Toledo'', a book about the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. In 1886, Rivero Méndez was transferred to the Academy of Artillery in [[Segovia]] and, on February 28, 1889, he earned a degree in [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]].

==Military career==
[[File:USS Yale.jpg|160px|left|thumb|USS ''Yale'' in Cuban waters in 1898, after leaving Puerto Rico.]]
On January 1, 1890, Rivero Méndez returned to Puerto Rico and was assigned to the 12th Battalion of Plaza. He taught at the Military Preparatory Academy in San Juan and, in 1896, was promoted to the rank of captain. He was active in politics in the ranks of the [[Unconditional Spanish Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/bio.rivero.htm|title=Biografía del capitán Angel Rivero Méndez|website=home.coqui.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a captain, he was assigned to teach math and chemistry at the Civil Institution of Secondary Education. During this time in his life, he became active in politics as member of the Unconditional Spanish Party. Rivero Méndez also founded a newspaper called ''La Integridad Nacional'' (The National Integrity), a political paper which represented the views of the party. Rivero Méndez, along with some others was expelled from the party and together they formed another political party. An article criticizing the government, written by Rivero Méndez, was published and as a consequence, he was arrested and sent to jail. Due to the rumors of war, he was pardoned by Governor Macias and, on March 1, 1898, was assigned the command of the 3rd Company of the 12th Artillery Battalion at [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Fort San Cristobal]] in San Juan.

==Spanish–American War==
When the [[United States]] declared war against Spain, the [[U.S. Navy]] sent the [[USS Yale (1889)|USS ''Yale'']] to form a blockade in [[San Juan Bay]]. On May 10, 1898, Captain Rivero Méndez ordered his men to fire upon the ''Yale'', thus becoming the first attack against the Americans in Puerto Rico of [[Spanish–American War]]. For his actions, he was awarded the "Cruz de la Orden del Mérito Militar 1ra Clase con Distintivo Rojo" ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Spain#Military Decorations|The Cross of the Order of the Military Merit first class]]). The residents of San Juan were furious with Rivero Méndez and blamed him for the destruction caused to their city by the responding bombardments, however nothing came of those accusations.

===Battle of Fajardo===
On August 1, the {{USS|Puritan|BM-1|6}} under the command of Captain Frederic W. Rodgers, was sailing by the coastline of the city of [[Fajardo]], when Rogers noticed the "Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan" ([[Cape San Juan Light|Cape San Juan lighthouse]]) which was supposed to be the landing site for the US Army in Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered some of his men ashore, which included Puerto Rican volunteers, with the mission of posting the American Flag atop the lighthouse.&lt;ref name="FLH"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-02|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/14_puertorico.html|title=Fajardo lighthouse|publisher=Home of Heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fajardo lighthouse 1898.jpg|thumb|Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan (Cape San Juan lighthouse), c. 1898.]]
On August 2, three more ships, the {{USS|Amphitrite|BM-2|6}}, {{USS|Leyden|1865|6}}, and the {{USS|Hannibal|1898|6}} arrived and joined the ''Puritan''. The 25-man Spanish garrison stationed in the city became aware of the American presence and, after notifying their superiors in San Juan, were told to withdraw. When Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada, the mayor of the city, realized that the garrison was gone and that the city was defenseless against the invading Americans, he implored the Spanish authorities in San Juan to dispatch troops to defend his city.&lt;ref name="FLH" /&gt; Believing that the Spanish forces would not come to his aid, Dr. Santiago Veve Calzada then went to the lighthouse to seek protection for the city from the Americans. On the afternoon of August 3, Dr. Veve Calzada entered the city with a contingent of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and the United States flag was hoisted over the Fajardo Customs House and City Hall.&lt;ref name="FLH" /&gt;

Rivero Méndez was ordered to investigate the situation in Fajardo. He was told that the Americans no longer occupied the city and that it would be an easy task to capture the people of Fajardo who had betrayed Spain. Rivero Méndez passed the information to General Ortega who suggested to General Macías take the town with 200 soldiers and an artillery battery. Macías was told to capture Dr. Veve and all those involved in the revolt, including the Americans in the lighthouse, even it meant the destruction of the lighthouse. Macías refused to accept Ortega's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/incidente.fajardo.htm#anchor239953|title=incidente.fajardo.htm|website=home.coqui.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, Governor General Macías sent Colonel Pedro del Pino and 200 men to recapture the city. When Colonel Pino entered Fajardo he found it nearly deserted because the residents, fearing a battle, had fled to the Fajardo lighthouse. Pino waited until darkness fell and then ordered his men to attack the lighthouse. The Marines signaled the ships that they were under attack and the ships began to bombard the shore in a protective pattern. The Spanish forces retreated back to the city.&lt;ref name="FLH" /&gt;

The following day [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Lieutenant [[John A. Lejeune]] came ashore with a detachment of Marines and evacuated the civilians and Marines for transport to Ponce, and the lighthouse was abandoned. Meanwhile, in the City of Fajardo, Pino’s men tore down the United States flags that flew over the Customs House and City Hall and returned to San Juan after verifying that the lighthouse was abandoned, displaying the flags as his trophies of war. It was the only time that American forces were forced to withdraw from any position during the campaign in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="FLH" /&gt;

==End of the conflict==
Spain surrendered and Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States as an outcome of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. On October 18, 1898, Rivero Méndez was ordered to turn over the keys of all the military installations in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the [[U.S. Army]]. Captain Rivero Méndez was offered a military position by both the American and Spanish governments. He declined both offers and, on April 18, 1899, he officially retired from the Spanish Army.

==Later years==

===Kola Champagne===

[[File:Polo Norte San Juan.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Fábrica Polo Norte]]
After Rivero Méndez retired, he founded the ''Polo Norte Fábrica de Sodas'' (North Pole Soda Factory), a soft drink company. Rivero Méndez is credited with the invention and elaboration of Kola Champagne, which became, and still is, a popular soft drink in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/especiales/emigracion/item/1015-%C3%A1ngel-rivero-m%C3%A9ndez-las-peripecias-de-un-emigrante-canario|title=Ángel Rivero Méndez: las peripecias de un emigrante canario|website=www.canariascnnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kola Champagne is elaborated and sold in the United States and [[Mexico]] by Goya Foods. Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/goya-foods-inc-history/|title=History of Goya Foods Inc. – FundingUniverse|website=www.fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries who have also produced the product are [[Colombia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/colombian-refajo-refajo-colombiano|title=Colombian Refajo (Refajo Colombiano) - My Colombian Recipes|website=My Colombian Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jamaica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingjamaica.com/|title=Ting - Ting Jamaica|website=Ting - Ting Jamaica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Author===
Rivero Méndez dedicated much of his later years to obtaining records and information for a book he ultimately wrote, on the Spanish–American War in Puerto Rico.  He also wrote articles for the newspapers ''[[El Imparcial]]'', ''[[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]]'' and ''La Correspondencia de Puerto Rico'', where he defended Puerto Rican nationalism and the ideal of Puerto Rican independence. In 1922, Rivero Méndez published his book ''Crónica de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico'' (Chronicles of the Spanish–American War in Puerto Rico), which is considered one of the most complete works written in regard to that military action.

Rivero Méndez and his wife were devotees of the [[Lourdes#Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes|Virgin of Lourdes]]. In 1924, he built a shrine dedicated to the Virgin of Lourdes, on his land in Trujillo Alto. The shrine, which still stands today and is considered an important landmark of the area, was blessed by San Juan's Bishop Jorge Caruana on January 6, 1925.
