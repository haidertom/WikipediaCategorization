      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4707">'''Anthony Hopkins Davis''' (c. August 1796 – 4 June 1866) was a businessman and horticulturist in the early days of the Colony of [[South Australia]].

==History==
Davis was a partner in the firm of Wesley &amp; Davis of London, publisher of religious tracts and such worthy titles as ''Life of William Grimes, the Runaway Slave'' and Samuel Wilderspin's ''Early discipline'' (both 1832). Business may have been precarious, as in 1837 he and  his wife Mary and four children  were among the earliest emigrants to South Australia, aboard ''Lord Goderich'', arriving in April 1838.

He immediately set about establishing Moore Farm Garden at [[The Reedbeds, South Australia|The Reedbeds]] (now part of [[Fulham, South Australia|Fulham]], [[Lockleys, South Australia|Lockleys]] and [[Underdale, South Australia|Underdale]]). He did more to advance farming in the infant colony than any other person, with the exception of [[George Stevenson (editor)|George Stevenson]]. For many years, he was one of the most successful exhibitors at the [[Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia|Agricultural and Horticultural]] shows.

He was a conspicuous critic of [[Governor Gawler]]'s spending policy, but in the recession attendant on  [[George Grey#Governor of South Australia|Governor Grey]]'s stringent financial measures of 1841–1842, he lost a considerable part of his fortune, and abandoned his business interests to concentrate on the farm.

He was elected an alderman on the first Adelaide City Council, which was disbanded in 1843 as unaffordable.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28788012 |title=The Late Mr. A. H. Davis |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 June 1866 |accessdate=28 September 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, he took part in the protests against state-sponsored religion and was one of four secretaries to the Anti - State Aid League, the other three being Chief Justice [[Richard Hanson (Australian politician)|R. D. Hanson]], [[John Baker (Australian politician)|John Baker]] and [[William Bakewell (Australian politician)|William Bakewell]].

He was a member of the Central Roads Board during the fierce agitation against the dray and land taxes in 1849-50, both of which the Government was forced to abandon.

He was appointed Justice of the Peace.

In 1849, he supported representative government, and denounced attempts to establish a peerage, whether life or hereditary. He stood for West Torrens at the first elections for the unicameral [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in [[South Australian colonial election, 1851|1851]], but was defeated by [[Charles Simeon Hare]], by a majority of two. He never again stood for public office, but was for some years Chairman of the District Council of West Torrens. His political views then changed remarkably – in 1953 he supported, in letters under the signature of "Vigil", the conservative view of an upper house appointed for life. He expounded these views in the journal ''Thursday Review'' he edited in 1859. He frequently aired his views in "Letters to the Editor".  His obituary noted that "... though in his writings he displayed some want of respect for the opinions of others, and although many complained of a bitterness of manner in dealing with political questions and political men, all acknowledged his sincerity, and respected his never-failing moral courage ...  and who, in his various public positions, displayed the qualities of an able man and a good citizen."&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

He suffered ill-health through the last years of his life and died at Moore Farm, Reedbeds.

==Family==
Abraham Hopkins Davis (c. August 1896 – 4 June 1866) was married to Mary Davis (c. 1793 – 3 April 1846). Their children who emigrated were:
*Mary Ann Davis (ca. 1819 – 29 November 1857) married Henry Stanford ( – 1872? 1881?) of Meadows on 31 October 1844
*Emily Davis (c. 1820 – 26 March 1856) married Thomas Stanford ( – 1887?) on 19 January 1848
*Frederick Charles Davis (c. 1827 – 23 March 1881) married Nancy Nicholls ( – 1874) on 10 December 1851, settled at [[Crystal Brook, South Australia|Crystal Brook]]
*Alfred Davis ( – c. 8 May 1873) married Ellen Frances Palmer (c. 1834 – 17 March 1862) on 12 June 1856
He married a second time, to Harriet Williams (c. 1803 – 17 September 1866) on 8 May 1848. Her mother died at Moore Farm on 21 May 1849.

'''Alex Faickney Osborn''' (May 24, 1888 – May 5, 1966) was an advertising executive and the author of the [[creativity techniques|creativity technique]] named ''[[brainstorming]]''.

==Founding of BBDO==
In 1919, Osborn joined with [[Bruce Fairchild Barton]] and Roy Sarles Durstine to form the BDO advertising agency.  Osborn acted as manager of BDO's Buffalo branch. He was largely responsible for the 1928 merger of BDO (Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn) with the George Batten Company to create [[BBDO]].

After years of success and having survived the [[Great Depression]], BBDO underwent a crisis in 1938, losing many of its clients and key personnel. Osborn commuted to [[New York City]] and eventually saved the company by securing the Goodrich [[tire]] [[Account (accountancy)|account]].  In 1939, he became BBDO's executive vice president after Durstine resigned.  Osborn was crucial in recruiting many top employees, including Ben Duffy, who eventually became the president of BBDO.

==Creativity theorist==
Osborn became increasingly active as an author, and published several books on [[creative thinking]].  In his 1942 book ''How To Think Up'' he presented the technique of "[[brainstorming]]", which had been used{{by whom|date=June 2016}} at BBDO.  Eventually, Osborn's writing career overtook his work in advertising, and in 1960, after more than forty years, he resigned from BBDO's [[board of directors]].

In 1954, Osborn set up the [[Creative Education Foundation]], sustained by the [[royalties]] earned from his books. Along with [[Sid Parnes|Sidney Parnes]], Osborn developed the "Osborn-Parnes [[Creative Problem Solving#Creative Problem Solving|Creative Problem Solving Process]]" (commonly referred to as CPS). He co-founded the [[Creative Education Foundation]]'s Creative Problem Solving Institute, the world's longest-running international creativity conference,{{citation needed |date=December 2012}} and CPS has been taught{{by whom|date=June 2016}} at that conference - as well as year-round in other venues - for more{{quantify|date=June 2016}} than 50 years.

==Family life==
On September 15, 1916 he married Helen Coatsworth, the daughter of a wealthy Buffalo [[lawyer]]. They had five children: Katharine, Joan, Marion, Russell, and Elinor. Alex F. Osborn, the nationally known advertising executive who made "creative thinking" and "brainstorming" household words, died of cancer (May 5, 1966) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute, where he had been a patient since April 1,(1966). He was 77 years old. [3]  He was cremated and his ashes are in a niche at Forest Lawn Cemetery (Buffalo-NY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835538,00.html |title=TIME Obituaries|accessdate=2007-12-26 |date=1966-05-13 |publisher=TIME magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Accounting}}
Founded in 1904, the '''Association of Chartered Certified Accountants''' ('''ACCA''') is the global [[professional accounting body]] offering the [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] qualification (ACCA or FCCA). In March 2018, ACCA recorded that it has 208,000 members and 503,000 students in 179 countries. ACCA's headquarters are in [[London]] with principal administrative office in [[Glasgow]]. ACCA works through a network of over 100 offices and centres and more than 7,300 Approved Employers worldwide, who provide employee development.

The term 'Chartered' in ACCA qualification refers to the [[Royal Charter]] granted in 1974.

[[Chartered Certified Accountant]] is a legally protected term. Individuals who describe themselves as Chartered Certified Accountants must be members of ACCA and if they carry out public practice engagements, must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, carrying liability insurance and submitting to inspections.

The [[Association of Authorised Public Accountants|Association of Authorised Public Accountants (AAPA)]], one of the [[British qualified accountants|British professional bodies for public accountants]], has been a subsidiary of ACCA since 1996.

ACCA works in the public interest, assuring that its members are appropriately regulated. It promotes [[Accounting ethics#Principles and rules|principles-based regulation]]. ACCA actively seeks to enhance the value of accounting in society through international research. It takes progressive stances on global issues to ensure accountancy as a profession continues to grow in reputation and influence.
{{toclimit|3}}

==History==
ACCA traces its origin to 1904, when eight people formed the London Association of Accountants to allow more open access to the profession than was available through the accounting bodies at the time, notably the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]]. {{As of|2006}}, the goal of ACCA is to become the world’s largest global professional body.

Key dates in ACCA history include:

===Foundation-level qualifications – Foundations in Accountancy ===

ACCA offers a range of foundation-level certificates and diplomas - collectively referred to as Foundations in Accountancy - which provide an entry point for anyone new to accounting and finance and who doesn't meet the minimum entry requirements for the ACCA Qualification (which is three GCSEs and 2 A Levels or equivalent, in five separate subjects). Students can start at any level within the Foundation level, but it is recommended that students without any formal academic qualifications start with the Introductory Certificate in Financial and Management Accounting and complete exams FA1, Recording Financial Transactions and MA1, Management Information; then progress to Intermediate Certificate in Financial and Management Accounting and complete exams FA2, Maintaining Financial Records and MA2, Managing Costs and Finance; before progressing to the Diploma in Accounting and Business and completing FAB, Accountant in Business, FMA, Management Accounting and FFA Financial Accounting. Students can use the Foundation-level awards as an entry route onto the ACCA Qualification. Students who complete the Diploma in Accounting and Business will be given exemption from the first three exams of the ACCA Qualification (F1, F2 and F3) and can start their studies on the ACCA Qualification with Paper F4, Corporate and Business Law.

In order to achieve a certificate for the exams completed students must also complete a foundation ethics module called Foundations in Professionalism, but this only has to be completed once, even if a student wishes to achieve both certificates and the diploma.

The Foundation-level exams are available as paper-based exams held in June and December or as on-demand computer-based exams throughout the year at ACCA Licensed exam centres.

==Legal and mutual recognition==

===Europe===

====United Kingdom and Ireland====
* The ACCA or [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] qualification is fully recognised in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].
** Under its [[Charter]], ACCA works in the public interest.
** ACCA is a Designated Professional Body under the Financial Services and Markets Act, business activities.
** ACCA is a Recognised Professional Body under the Insolvency Act to issue permits to individual ''[[Chartered Certified Accountant]]s'' to conduct insolvency appointments.
** ACCA is a ''Recognised Qualifying Body'' and ''Recognised Supervisory Body'' in relation to company auditing under the Companies Act of 1989.
** ACCA is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]] (CCAB). Members of these bodies are deemed to hold equivalent-level qualifications and advertisements for jobs often state that an organisation is looking for a CCAB-qualified individual.
** Full members of [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]] organisations including ACCA could apply for [[ICAEW]] membership subject to certain criteria, but in 2013 this was made redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaew.co.uk/index.cfm?route=125720 |title=Details |publisher=Icaew.co.uk |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Only ACCA, [[ICAEW]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] and [[Association of International Accountants]] are able to authorise members to conduct ''audit'', ''insolvency'' and ''investment business work'' in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].
* Outside these countries, legal recognition by government authorities and mutual recognition by equivalent overseas institutes, varies. Where full legal or mutual recognition is not available, ACCA members can sometimes obtain ''[[advanced standing]]'' in terms of sitting local accountancy examinations. ACCA's strong global reputation may make it unnecessary to acquire a local designation.
* Similarly, many universities and educational providers will recognise ACCA as equivalent to at least a [[Bachelor degree]] in [[accountancy]], for the purpose of obtaining credit towards a local master's degree or an advanced study program.

The Irish Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) assigned ACCA Qualification to Level 9 of the Irish National Qualifications Framework (NQF) in 2008. Level 9 holds Irish postgraduate qualifications, such as postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees.

In 2011, the [[Professional Oversight Board]] published information for the first time about its concerns over self-regulation by particular institutes. Press reports highlighted comments about ACCA, which had implemented recommendations to improve its examination syllabus, but needed to pay greater attention to monitoring long-time members.&lt;ref name=aa20110722&gt;{{cite news|last=Orlik|first=Rose|title=POB regulation report names and shames institutes|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2095994/pob-regulation-report-names-shames-institutes|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=Accountancy Age|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 2012 and 2013 the ACCA professional body had the highest percentage of A&amp;B (best) outcomes from the Financial Reporting Council's Recognised Supervisory Body (RSB) visits to a sample of 'Registered UK Audit Firms'. Though it must be noted that ACCA firms tend to audit smaller and less complex clients.

At the end of 2016 there were over 88,000 members and 90,000 students in the UK &amp; Ireland

====European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) &amp; Switzerland====
* The ACCA qualification is legally recognized by all member countries of the [[European Union]] under the [[European professional qualification directives|Mutual Recognition Directive]].  This recognition extends to the [[European Economic Area]] nations and [[Switzerland]]. For example, a holder of the ACCA or [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] qualification could practice as an accountant in all member countries of the [[European Union]], [[European Economic Area]] and [[Switzerland]], describing him/herself as ''ACCA'' or ''Chartered Certified Accountant''. Access to local professional qualifications requires a separate test.

At the end of 2016 there were over 16,000 members and almost 60,000 students in Europe (excluding the UK &amp; Ireland).

====Turkey====
* ACCA and TÜRMOB (The Union of Chambers of Certified Public Accountants of Turkey) at [[Turkey]] signed a partnership agreement in 2004 which enables TÜRMOB members resident in [[Turkey]] to follow the ACCA Professional Scheme qualification and achieve ACCA membership.

====Others====
* ACCA is recognized by national accounting institutes with joint scheme relationships in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/footertoolbar/contact-us/jes.html|title=Joint Examination Partnerships - ACCA Global|first=ACCA -|last=http://www.accaglobal.com|website=www.accaglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''
* In June 2012, ACCA and IMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imanet.org/ima_home.aspx |title=IMA – The association of accountants and financial professionals working in business |publisher=Imanet.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731031800/http://www.imanet.org/ima_home.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; announced a strategic partnership. The two bodies joined forces to empower accountants and financial professionals to drive business performance. In January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/en/discover/news/2013/01/credential-ima.html |title=ALL ACCA MEMBERS NOW HAVE ACCESS TO A US MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING CREDENTIAL |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2013-06-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808005544/http://www.accaglobal.com/en/discover/news/2013/01/credential-ima.html |archivedate=2013-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICMA Board of Regents, representing the certification division of IMA, voted to waive its usual bachelor's degree requirement for ACCA members wishing to earn IMA’s CMA (Certified Management Accountant) credential. The bachelor's degree waiver will allow all ACCA members around the world, regardless of background, access to IMA’s CMA credential. This is a benefit to ACCA members who wish to have a US-based credential. However, the exemption on CMA exam requirement has been ended in 2013.
* There is no mutual recognition between ACCA and  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([[AICPA]])/[[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/documents/us_fallwinter_2006.pdf |title=Focus – News From ACCA US |format=PDF |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722094720/http://www2.accaglobal.com/documents/us_fallwinter_2006.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At the end of 2016 there were 2,015 members in the US.

====Canada====
ACCA announced a Mutual Recognition Agreement with [[Certified General Accountant|CGA Canada]] effective from 1 January 2007; renewed in 2011 for a further 5 years period until December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/members/mutual_memberships/resources |title=CGA-Canada Mutual Recognition Agreement &amp;#124; Mutual memberships &amp;#124; Members &amp;#124; ACCA |publisher=Accaglobal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001180156/http://www2.accaglobal.com/members/mutual_memberships/resources |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]], [[World Education Services]] and the Odette School of Business at the [[University of Windsor]] indicated that the evaluation recognized ACCA as having the Canadian equivalence of a bachelor's degree (four years) in Accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canada.accaglobal.com/canada/resources/reports/ca_ar_2003.pdf?session=fffffffeffffffff0a01213844ec48d4024089288d4d7e7f57c1776ef5981ed4 |accessdate=August 31, 2006}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian branch of ACCA is pursuing recognition for statutory audit purposes in the province of [[Ontario]] under the province's ''Public Accounting Act of 2004''

Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) and Certified Management Accountants in Canada (CMA Canada) announced a joint qualification “Chartered Professional Accountant or CPA Designation”, but whether this designation will impinge on ACCA's application for recognition in Ontario is uncertain. Already the newly formed CPA has labelled ACCA as 'advancing a global expansion strategy that targets Canada'&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpacanada.ca/controlling-our-destiny-in-a-rapidly-evolving-professional-environment/ Controlling our destiny in a rapidly evolving professional environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017161608/http://cpacanada.ca/controlling-our-destiny-in-a-rapidly-evolving-professional-environment |date=2012-10-17 }}, CPA Canada&lt;/ref&gt; and many feel the CICA deem ACCA a threat. On November 29, 2012, the ACCA opened up legal proceedings against the CICA to operate in Canada, complicated by the merger of the accounting profession in Canada, incorporating CICA, CMA Canada and CGA is to use “Chartered Professional Accountant” or CPA. A 10-year transitional period  requires all CPA members to use CPA,"legacy designation" rather than the newer designation. The merger completed in 2015.

At the end of 2016 there were 3,011 members in Canada.

===Asia===

====China====
ACCA entered China in the late 1980s, and has developed its China base rapidly in recent years. It has entered into agreements with 83 Chinese Universities, many of which are leading in the disciplines of finance and accounting as well as having excellent academic reputations in a wider range of subjects. The most well known institutions include Tsinghua University, Xiamen University, Central University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Sichuan University, Xi'an Jiaotong University and Sun Yat-Sen University.

At the end of 2016 there were 24,000 members and over 63,000 students in Mainland China.

=====Hong Kong=====
An Agreement of Recognition Arrangement (ARA) between ACCA and [[HKICPA]] (Local statutory accountancy body) was put in place on 22 August 2006, backdated to 1 July 2005. This was less flexible than the previous rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/hongkong/members/recognition/ |title=Details |publisher=Accaglobal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old agreement was terminated on 30 June 2005 forcing ACCA members to accept the so-called "8 unfair terms" e.g., hold a degree recognised by HKICPA, work under HKICPA authorised employers, attend workshops and pass HKICPA's Final Professional Examination (FPE), etc.

This notwithstanding, HKICPA members could join in ACCA without any further requirement.

The ACCA qualification is highly accepted by the [[Hong Kong]] employment market. Most HKICPA members qualified through a joint scheme with Hong Kong Society of Accountants (HKSA) which operated for more than 20 years. HKSA later became HKICPA.

At the end of 2016 there were 18,238 members and over 8,000 students in Hong Kong.

=====Macau=====
The ACCA currently is legally recognised with the joint scheme relationships by Macau Society of Certified Practising Accountants (Local statutory accountancy body) in [[Macau]].

====Singapore====
In 2013, holders of ACCA had until 31 December 2016 and existing students have until 31 December 2018 to complete the ICPAS PAC and qualify for the “[[Chartered Accountant of Singapore]]” professional designation through the previous transitional arrangements.&lt;ref name="AsiaOne article 1"&gt;[http://business.asiaone.com/investments-and-savings/mof-announces-details-new-professional-accountancy-designation MOF Announces Details of New Professional Accountancy Designation (2 April 2013)] ''AsiaOne''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BT article 2"&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Business/Story/A1Story20130402-413059.html Singapore Prepares for a 2-tier Accounting Profession (4 April 2013)] ''The Business Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsiaOne article 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BT article 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeqp.com/singapore-qp-framework Singapore QP Framework] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309015635/http://singaporeqp.com/singapore-qp-framework |date=2013-03-09 }} ''Singapore Qualification Programme''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
According to rules 6(iii) &amp; 9 of accountancy examination published by [[Taiwan]] government, ACCA members are entitled to obtain advanced standing in the examinations to become a [[Certified Public Accountant]] in Taiwan.

====Malaysia====
On 13 August 2007 ACCA and the Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants (MICPA) signed an MRA that provided a route for members to join the other body. The ACCA or Chartered Certified Accountant qualification is recognised by the [[Malaysian Institute of Accountants]] (MIA). Only MIA members qualify as accountants in [[Malaysia]] under the Accountants Act, 1967.

ACCA is statutorily recognised in Part II of the First Schedule of the Accountants Act, 1967.

At the end of 2016 there were 12,521 members and 42,000 students in Malaysia.

====Pakistan====
The ACCA qualification confers the Qualified Company Secretary designation in [[Pakistan]]. ACCA and the local statutory accounting body ([[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan]]) offer  partial recognition of each other.

ACCA in Pakistan saw tremendous growth beginning in 2007, with thousands of students enrolling every year into ACCA programs. Local colleges and universities offer ACCA programs in all major cities.

The [[Higher Education Commission (Pakistan)|Higher Education Commission]] (HEC) of Pakistan recognises ACCA members qualifications as equal to master's degree in Commerce (M.Co.
Also [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan|ICAP]] awards some exemptions to ACCA affiliates. Recently ICAP has reduced the exemptions to ACCA affiliates/members. Previously, ACCA affiliates or members were given exemptions up to Module D. Now ACCA affiliates/members can get a maximum of seven exemptions.
ICAPs discriminatory behaviour to ACCA students caused a massive decrease in ACCAs market share in Pakistan.
Recently ICAP issued a letter to all Pakistan's firms not to give any contracts to foreign qualification such as ACCA and ICAEW. On January 10, 2013, Pakistan’s Apex regulatory body, Competition Commission of Pakistan ruled in favor of ACCA and ICAEW students imposing a Rs 25 million penalty on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan for the violation, and restrained ICAP from issuing similar directives to its members in the future. As per the order, the relevant course of action for affected would be to pursue compensation from the courts of competent jurisdictions. Later, on the application of ICAP, the Lahore High Court removed the penalty imposed by CCP stating ICAP is a statutory body and is a regulator of the accountancy profession in Pakistan and the CCP had no right to impose such fine on ICAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanacca.com/2013/01/10/for-icap-a-million-a-day-will-keep-ccp-away/|title=pakistanacca.com|website=www.pakistanacca.com|access-date=2013-01-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114040736/http://www.pakistanacca.com/2013/01/10/for-icap-a-million-a-day-will-keep-ccp-away/|archive-date=2013-01-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Becton, Dickinson and Company''' ('''BD''') is an American [[Health technology|medical technology]] company that manufactures and sells medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents. Founded in 1897 and [[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]], BD employs nearly 50,000 people in more than 50 countries throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:BDX|title=Google Finance:BDX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, 60% of BD sales were generated from non-U.S. markets.

The company's customers include [[health care]] institutions, science researchers, [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and the general public. BD was one of the first companies to sell U.S.-made glass syringes. It was also a pioneer in the production of hypodermic needles. Today, BD is divided into two segments: BD Medical and BD Life Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Becton, Dickinson and Co Stock Report, Standard &amp; Poor's, January 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; BD is ranked #251 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm in October 2014 agreed to acquire [[CareFusion]] for a price of $12.2 billion in cash and stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Reuters| date=5 October 2014| title=Becton Dickinson to buy CareFusion for $12 billion in cash, stock | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/06/us-carefusion-m-a-bectondickinson-idUSKCN0HU0U420141006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 Becton Dickinson agreed to acquire [[C. R. Bard]] for $24 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bd-acquire-bard-24-billion-210400916.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
===1897–1947===
BD was founded in 1897 by [[Maxwell Becton|Maxwell W. Becton]] and [[Fairleigh S. Dickinson]], two American businessmen who met on a sales trip. The same year the company made its first sale, a Luer-all-glass [[syringe]] that sold for $2.50. In 1898, BD acquired its first [[patent]] for a medical product. In 1899 the company introduced its first logo which was meant to symbolize guaranteed superior quality of the products provided by BD. In 1904, BD acquired the Philadelphia Surgical Company. This very first acquisition and other early acquisitions significantly expanded the company's manufacturing ability and product offering. Two years later, BD incorporated in the state of [[New Jersey]] and built a manufacturing facility in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey|East Rutherford]], the first in the U.S. created specifically for the production of [[thermometer]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and syringes. In 1924, BD manufactured its first syringe designed specifically for [[insulin]] injection. One year later, BD introduced the BD Yale Luer-Lok Syringe, designed and patented by Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Sr. It provided a simple and secure method of attaching and removing the needle to and from the syringe. Today, [[Luer taper]] connectors are the standard for syringes in the U.S. In 1947 Joseph Kleiner developed the Evacutainer—a device used to draw blood by vacuum through a needle into a test tube. This product eventually evolved to become the BD [[Vacutainer]] Blood Collection system.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/aboutbd/history/|title=BD Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948–1970===
In 1948, BD faced new leadership as [[Fairleigh Dickinson, Jr.|Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr.]] and Henry P. Becton, sons of the founders, took over the company. Their 24-year tenure was a time of rapid development for BD. The company grew within the U.S. as well as internationally. In 1949, it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in [[Columbus, Nebraska]]. In 1961, it established a manufacturing facility in [[Canaan, Connecticut]]. BD also soon expanded to [[Canada]] (1951), [[Mexico]] (1952), [[France]] (1955), and [[Brazil]] (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950, BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954, BD introduced the first completely disposable syringe made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] [[vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]]. One year later, BD entered the [[microbiology]] field through the acquisition of the Baltimore Biological Laboratory. In 1961, the company introduced its disposable BD Plastipak syringe. Under the new leadership the company also went public (1962) and appeared for the first time in the [[Fortune 500]] list (1970).&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1973–1995===
In 1973, BD added another U.S. facility&amp;nbsp;— a research center in [[Durham, North Carolina]] in [[Research Triangle Park]]. The center was established to help the company meet [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and process methods, and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting [[heparin]]. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]] testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company's development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in [[Plymouth]], [[England]] was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to [[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]] ([[Becton, Dickinson and Company headquarters|current HQ location]].) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a [[Blood vessel|vascular]] access devices manufacturer. The last three years of the 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe, the BD Safety-Lok (1988), and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD's development. The company opened a central distribution center in [[Temse]], [[Belgium]] (1992) and entered [[India]] and [[China]] (1995). BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following [[Venipuncture|blood-drawing]] procedures, the BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===1999–2006===
In 1999, as BD passed more than 100 years of presence in the medical devices industry, BD announced its new [[corporate identity]]. Numerous independent brand names were replaced by a single name: BD. In addition, the company symbol that is used today was introduced. BD also named Edward J. Ludwig as the company's [[president (corporate title)|president]]. Ludwig was also named [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]] (2000) and [[Chairman|Chairman of the Board of Directors]] (2002). On February 9, 1999, BD announced the acquisition of Biometric Imaging, Inc. (BMI), a privately held company serving the transfusion medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21195&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=Becton Dickinson and Company Announces the Acquisition of Biometric Imaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2000, BD signed an agreement to acquire Gentest Corporation, a privately held company serving the life sciences market in the areas of drug metabolism and toxicology testing of pharmaceutical candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=21347&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=&amp;s=press&amp;dTitle=Press&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=| title=BD Signs Agreement to Acquire Gentest Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, BD also got heavily involved in global health issues announcing a five-year maternal and neonatal tetanus worldwide elimination partnership with [[UNICEF]] (1999), launching the BD Safety Compliance Initiative (2000), and pledging $1 million contribution to the [[International AIDS Vaccine Initiative]] (2002.) In 2003 and 2004, BD introduced several innovative products: BD FACSAria Cell Sorter—the first entirely new instrument in the next-generation portfolio of flow cytometers (2003), BD Accuspray—a nasal drug delivery system for administering vaccines (2003), BD.id—a patient identification system designed to limit the potential for medical errors in [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] collection (2003), and the world's first "intelligent" [[insulin pump]] and [[Blood glucose monitoring|glucose monitoring]] system, a wireless system consisting of a Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512 Insulin Pump and Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor, co-developed with BD. In the beginning of the 21st century BD also invested in growing its business by acquiring several strategically important companies. In 2001, it acquired the Gentest Corporation, a leading in drug metabolism and toxicology testing company. In 2004, BD completed the acquisition of Atto Bioscience Acquired, a company specializing in [[Optics|optical]] instrumentation, software, and [[reagent]]s for real-time analysis of interactions taking place in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. In 2005 BD entered the field of [[proteomics]] through its acquisition of FFE Weber GmbH, which specialized in the [[separation process|separation]] and [[fractionation]] of complex proteins. 2006 was also an important year to document BD's growth as the company acquired GeneOhm Sciences—a leader in the development of [[Molecule|molecular]] diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of [[bacteria]]l organisms and TriPath Imaging, a [[cancer]] diagnostics company.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;

===2007 Discardit II incident in Poland===
In mid-2007, the firm's Discardit II series of syringes numbered 0607186 was withdrawn from hospitals and other medical services around [[Poland]], about half a year after the discovery of remains of dark dust in some syringes, which were alleged to have been from this series.&lt;ref name="dziennik_BDDiscardit"&gt;{{cite news | first=Leszek | last=Kraskowski | pages= | language = Polish| title= For over half a year, hospitals used tainted syringes | date=2007-08-01 | publisher=Dziennik Online |url= http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=96&amp;amp;ShowArticleId=54999 | access-date=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper Dziennik Online claimed that other series such as 06022444, 0603266, and 0607297 were also suspected of being contaminated.  BD recalled and tested the syringes in question, and revealed sterile particulates in 0.013 percent of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN0640879120070806|title=Reuters: Becton Dickinson expands syringe recall in Poland | date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal proceedings related to the incident started in December 2006.&lt;ref name="dziennik_BDDiscardit" /&gt; According to an article published in Dziennik on Monday, 21 April 2008, the prosecutor's office in Lublin discontinued the inquiry, because the disposable syringes were not dangerous.

===2010 Q-Syte Luer and IV Catheter partial recall===
In February 2010 BD announced a voluntary product recall of certain lots of BD Q-Syte Luer Access Devices and BD Nexiva Closed IV Catheter Systems. BD stated that the use of the affected devices may cause an air embolism or leakage of blood and/or therapy, which may result in serious injury or death. The approximately 2.8 million BD Q-Syte and 2.9 million BD Nexiva units containing 5 million BD Q-Syte devices that were recalled were distributed in the United States, Asia, Canada, Europe, Mexico, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28, 2009 after BD received complaints of problems due to air entry through a part of the device. BD stated that the cause of the problem was manufacturing deviation and claimed that it corrected the problem. BD announced that it notified customers about the recall by letter and has been working with the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] and worldwide health agencies to coordinate recall activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0815057720100208|title=Reuters: Becton Dickinson recalls intravenous devices | date=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/contentmanager/b_article.asp?Item_ID=24486&amp;ContentType_ID=1&amp;BusinessCode=20001&amp;d=BD+Worldwide&amp;s=&amp;dTitle=&amp;dc=&amp;dcTitle=|title=BD Press Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health and safety issues ===
In April 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health and Administration fined BD $112,700 for safety violations. They found repeat and serious violations of health and safety law that had resulted in two employees having partial finger amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=NEWS_RELEASES&amp;p_id=31062|title=OSHA finds dozen violations at Becton, Dickinson and Co. in Holdrege after two workers suffer finger amputations|last=|first=|date=April 12, 2016|website=|publisher=OSHA|access-date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breakthrough Software''' was a software company based in [[Novato, California]].

Negotiations to merge Breakthrough into Integrated Software Systems Corp.

It would only begin to experience significant consolidation from 2012 onwards.

After some controversy in the first part of the 20th Century, it has been generally agreed that regulation of the '''Canadian accounting profession''' falls within provincial jurisdiction over matters of a local and private nature,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;held ''[[obiter]]'' by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in {{cite CanLII|litigants=Reference Re Securities Act|link=Reference Re Securities Act|year=2011|court=scc|num=6|pinpoint=par. 34|parallelcite=[2011] 3 SCR 837|date=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as under the provincial education power with respect to training for achieving such professional qualifications.{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=9}}

==Creation of different specialties==
===Chartered accountants===
====Organization of provincial societies====
Demand for trained accountants arose as early as the 1840s, when the first Canadian professional accounting firms were organized in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]].{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}}

The Association of Accountants in Montreal was organized as the first accounting organization in North America in 1879&lt;ref name="5Things"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadian-accountant.com/content/business/canada-150-five-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-history-of-accounting-in-canada|title= Canada 150: Five things you didn't know about the history of accounting in Canada|last= Ellis|first= Colin|date= June 30, 2017|publisher= Canadian Accountant}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and only the fifth such organization in the world),{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=559}} and was incorporated by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]].&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = An Act to incorporate the Association of Accountants in Montreal|abbr = S.Q.|year = 1880|chapter = 88|link = https://books.google.com/books?id=PoMwAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;ots=WFl3OaPENZ&amp;pg=PA404#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario would follow several weeks later with the formation of the Institute of Accountants and Adjusters of Ontario,&lt;ref name="5Things"/&gt; which was later incorporated as the Institute of Accountants of Ontario in 1883 under the direction of E.R.C. Clarkson, one of the founding members of Clarkson Gordon &amp; Co, and a key member in the growth of the accounting and insolvency consulting industry in Canada. E.R.C. Further acted as a frequent advisor to the Canadian Senate in regard to the banking committee.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = An Act to Incorporate the Institute of Accountants of Ontario|abbr = S.O.|year = 1883|chapter = 62|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1883onta#page/494/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, The Clarkson Gordon Story 1864-1989, (University of Toronto Press, 1989) 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was reconstituted as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario ("ICAO") in 1911.&lt;ref name="CA1911" group="na"/&gt;

As the AAM tended to have an [[anglophone]] membership, the Institute of Accountants and Auditors of the Province of Quebec was later incorporated to service growing demand within Quebec's [[francophone]] population.{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}}&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = Loi constituant en corporation l'Institut des comptables et auditeurs de la Province de Québec|abbr = S.Q.|year = 1912-13|chapter = 94|link = https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=128059}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the AAM began to offer admission for members of the IAAPQ.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=575}}

Manitoba would be the third province to organize its chartered accountants, and it would later be instrumental in organizing similar professional bodies in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=564-565}}

Nova Scotia organized in 1900,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to incorporate the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nova Scotia|abbr =S.N.S.|year =1900|chapter =154|link=http://0-nsleg-edeposit.gov.ns.ca.legcat.gov.ns.ca/deposit/Statutes/1900.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by New Brunswick in 1916&lt;ref group="na"&gt;S.N.B. 1916, c. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and Prince Edward Island in 1921.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;S.P.E.I. 1921, c. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two bodies were organized in an irregular manner compared to those of other provinces,{{efn|the New Brunswick Institute conferred membership on anyone who was a member of any incorporated society of accountants in the [[British Empire]] or the [[United States]],{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=572-573}} and the PEI Institute was formed without the knowledge or consent of existing CAs.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=578}}}} which resulted in their qualifications not being recognized by Nova Scotia until 1925,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=581}} and by Quebec and Ontario until 1926.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=582}}

Outside Canada, the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] incorporated the Institute of Accountants in 1905,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to Incorporate the Institute of Accountants of Newfoundland|abbr =S.N.|year =1905|chapter =16|link=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns/ActsoftheGeneralAssemblyofNewfoundland1905.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was pressured to revoke statutory protection of its designation the following year.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to Amend 5 Ed. VII., Cap. 16, entitled "An Act to Incorporate the Institute of Accountants of Newfoundland"|abbr =S.N.|year =1906|chapter =29|link=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns_tools/ActsoftheGeneralAssemblyofNewfoundland1906.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not reversed until Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Chartered Accountants Act, 1949|abbr =S.N.|year =1949|chapter =30|link=http://collections.mun.ca/PDFs/cns_tools/StatutesofNewfoundland1949.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempt to nationalize the profession====
Tensions erupted following a disciplinary hearing in 1890 held by the Institute of Accountants of Ontario into an audit conducted with respect to [[Confederation Life]].{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=561}} While the action itself affirmed the importance of auditor independence, it caused a rift in the IAO membership and the resignation of several prominent members of the governing Council in 1891.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=561}}

The early CA bodies, with the exception of the AAM, also started to relax their entrance requirements to allow the admission of accountants who were not in public practice.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=563}} An initial effort to create a national organization in 1901 was quashed due to local opposition, but this caused a concerted effort, sponsored by the AAM, to create one that would be restricted to practicing accountants.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=563}} As a result, the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants ("DACA") was created in 1902, in an attempt to create a national status for the profession through direct entry of qualified applicants to membership.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to incorporate the Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants|abbr =S.C.|year =1902|chapter =58|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1902v02cana#page/67/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontario passed an Act in 1908 granting the ICAO exclusive rights to the CA designation,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = An Act to revise and amend The Chartered Accountants Act|abbr = S.O.|year = 1908|chapter = 42|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1908onta#page/386/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on DACA's petition, the [[Governor in Council]] [[Disallowance and reservation|disallowed]] it in 1909, on grounds of [[Paramountcy (Canada)|federal paramountcy]] in having created a national body, as described in a memo by [[Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada]] [[Allen Bristol Aylesworth|Sir Allen Aylesworth]] recommending the measure.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite web|title = P.C. 870: Disallowance Statute of Ontario, Cap. 42., intituled An Act to Revise and Amend the Chartered Accountants Act - Min.

===Certified general accountants===
The creation of large business and governmental organizations increased the demand for accountants on their payrolls, which called for efforts to address their unique needs without the necessity of [[apprenticeship]]s demanded by the CA firms.{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}} The Canadian Association of Accountants was formed in 1908,{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}} arising from a technical self-study group of accountants working at the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]],{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=110}} which led to the creation of the General Accountants Association in 1913.{{efn|It had to change its name because of opposition from the CA bodies, as "CAA" would have been too similar a designation to use.{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=89}}}}&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to incorporate the General Accountants Association|abbr =S.C.|year =1913|chapter =116|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1913v02cana#page/193/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial assurances that its members would refrain from practicing public accounting, it began advertising examinations in that field in 1917, thus triggering conflicts with the CA bodies that would last for decades.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=573}}

Because of such protracted opposition, it was only in 1999 that the GAA was able to change its name to the [[Certified General Accountants Association of Canada]].&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act respecting the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada|abbr =S.C.|year =1999|chapter =38|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1999v02cana#page/n296/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, portions of its membership would be admitted into membership of other professional bodies, such as the admission into Quebec's Association of Accountants in 1920,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;S.Q. 1919-20, c. 118&lt;/ref&gt; the CGA/CA merger in Quebec in 1946,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=592}} the CGA/CPA merger in 1949,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=595}} and the CGA/CPA merger in Manitoba in 1950.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=595}}

===Cost and management accounting: from CA possession to the creation of RIAs and CMAs===
Towards the end of the [[First World War]], several significant issues forced organizations to invest resources into the creation of [[cost accounting]] functions:{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=566}}

:* the [[Russian Revolution]], together with worldwide labour unrest, created pressure on business organizations to demonstrate that they were earning fair returns;
:* wartime procurement by the [[Imperial Munitions Board]] and the introduction of [[income tax]]&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Business Profits War Tax Act, 1916|abbr = S.C.|year = 1916|chapter = 11|link = https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1916v01cana#page/60/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Income War Tax Act, 1917|abbr = S.C.|year = 1917|chapter = 28|link = https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1917v01cana#page/170/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; necessitated proving the actual cost of manufacturing goods; and
:* the high rate of postwar bankruptcies brought about by the [[Post–World War I recession]] and the [[Depression of 1920–21]] created the need to demonstrate that the price of manufactured goods covered their cost.

In a move designed to prevent the newly-created General Accountants Association from moving into that field,{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=110}} DACA created the Canadian Society of Cost Accountants ("CSCA"), with membership originally restricted to chartered accountants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= The Canadian Society of Cost Accountants|url= https://archive.org/stream/canadianchartere10canauoft#page/30/mode/2up|journal= The Canadian Chartered Accountant|location= Toronto|publisher= Dominion Association of Chartered Accountants|date= July 1920|volume = X|issue = 1|pages = 31{{en dash}}34|accessdate= June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSCA would initiate efforts to standardize education in cost accounting, and entered into an affiliation agreement with the US [[National Association of Cost Accountants]] in 1922.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=580}} When the CSCA tried to obtain NACA's educational materials at a more reasonable cost in 1926, NACA proposed a merger of the two organizations. This was rejected, and the affiliation was subsequently dissolved.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=582-583}} The Society began to issue "Certificates of efficiency" in 1927 to its graduates.{{sfn|Allan|1982|p= 21}}{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=90}}

In the 1930s, there would be internal tensions as to what areas of company accounting the CSCA should focus on, and, in 1939, members wishing to concentrate more on [[management accounting]] left to form the Controllers' Institute of Canada (later part of the [[Financial Executives International|Financial Executives Institute]]).{{sfn|Richardson|1996|p=90}}

When provincial societies began to be formed in 1941, the "Registered Industrial and Cost Accountant" ("RIA") was created for its members.{{sfn|Richardson|2000|p=112}}&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Society of Industrial and Cost Accountants of Ontario Act, 1941|abbr = S.O.|year = 1941|chapter = 77|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1941onta#page/316/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative was generally accepted in most provinces, but there was resistance in British Columbia as the promoters of that effort were only CGAs and independent accountants.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=591}} It would pass only when the enabling Act specified that the RIA designation was available only to those members who were also CAs.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=591}}

The designation was simplified as "Registered Industrial Accountant" in some, but not all, provinces around 1967.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title = The Society of Industrial Accountants of Ontario Act, 1967|abbr = S.O.|year = 1967|chapter = 129|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1967onta#page/548/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be replaced by the [[Certified Management Accountants of Canada|Certified Management Accountant]] ("CMA") designation beginning in 1976,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=611}} but the province-by-province implementation would be completed only in 1985.

===Certified public accountants: the first CPAs===
The first Canadian CPA designation arose from several parallel moves:

:* In Quebec, the Licentiate in Accountancy was first granted by [[McGill University]] in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/about/history|title= Desautels: History|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= mcgill.ca|publisher= [[Desautels Faculty of Management]], [[McGill University]]|access-date= September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was granted statutory recognition as a professional designation in 1920.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Loi constituant en corporation l'Association des comptables|abbr =S.Q.|year =1919-20|chapter =118|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=126287}}{{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently replaced by "Certified Public Accountant" in 1927.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Loi modifiant la Loi des comptables|abbr =S.Q.|year =1927|chapter =61|link= https://www.bibliotheque.assnat.qc.ca/DepotNumerique_v2/AffichageFichier.aspx?idf=123700}}{{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In English Canada, the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors was formed in 1918 and incorporated in 1919 by members of the GAA.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 13, 1919|title= The Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=14647&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|volume= 53|issue= 24|page= 1783}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would become the United Accountants and Auditors of Canada in 1920,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 29, 1920|title= Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors|url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=6680&amp;f=p|journal= [[Canada Gazette]]|volume= 53|issue= 48|page= 4140}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferring the "United Accountant" ("UA") designation.{{sfn|Richardson|1993a|pp=221-222}}{{efn|The UA designation was held not to infringe the protected designation of CA.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Institute of Chartered Accountants of Manitoba v Bellamy|year=1926|court=MBQB|num=242|format=canlii|parallelcite=[1926] 4 DLR 230|date=1926-07-07|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It would later engage in a failed attempt to take over the GAA.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=576}}
:* In Ontario, the UAs (formed mainly from accountants and auditors working in government tax offices){{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=10}} were successful in obtaining statutory recognition as the Association of Accountants and Auditors. The designation originated as LA (Licentiate in Accountancy) during 1926{{en dash}}1931,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Association of Accountants and Auditors Act, 1926|abbr =S.O.|year =1926|chapter =124|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1926onta#page/682/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; changing to IPA (Incorporated Public Accountant) during 1931{{en dash}}1936,&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Association of Accountants and Auditors Act, 1931|abbr =S.O.|year =1931|chapter =143|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1931onta#page/504/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming CPA.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Certified Public Accountants Act, 1936|abbr =S.O.|year =1936|chapter =68|link = https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1936onta#page/290/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPAs subsequently gained statutory recognition in most, but not all, provinces. Because of CA opposition in Nova Scotia, it was only able to use the designation of "Registered Public Accountant".{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=598}}

The Quebec CPAs were forced to merge with the ICAPQ in 1946 upon the reorganization of the Quebec profession.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;S.Q. 1946, c. 47, s. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the CAs and CPAs agreed to merge nationally, and the remaining provincial CPA bodies either dissolved or became dormant.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=603}}

===Accredited public accountants===
The "International Society of Commerce" ("ISC") was first noted in an advertisement in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], as early as 1921,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=578}} and its members were conferred with the designation of "Accredited Public Accountant" ("APA"). The ISC, located in [[Winnipeg]], formed the "Institute of Accredited Public Accountants" in 1938,{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=587}} which was federally incorporated in 1946.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=592}}&lt;ref name="CIAPA"/&gt; It initially attempted to organize a provincial institute in British Columbia in 1937, but failed to receive legislative approval.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=587}}

When Quebec consolidated the auditing profession in 1946, APAs in the province who had practiced accounting continuously from 1942 received statutory recognition in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;S.Q. 1946, c. 47,s. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The APA designation later received statutory protection in New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

An attempt was made to form a body in Ontario by way of [[private bill]] in 1949,&lt;ref group="nc"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/v1ontariobills1949ontauoft#page/65/mode/1up Bill 5, 1st Session, 23rd Legislature] (Ontario, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was withdrawn at second reading on grounds advanced by the CA and CPA bodies that a [[public bill]] would be a more appropriate choice for action.&lt;ref name="HansardON1949" group="nc"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= Ontario|title= Institute of Accredited Public Accountants of Ontario|url= https://archive.org/stream/v2hansard1949ontauoft#page/1223/mode/1up|house= [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]|date= March 24, 1949|page_start= 1223|page_end= 1226}}&lt;/ref&gt; That option was never subsequently pursued. Similar efforts to secure recognition in British Columbia and Alberta were also pursued at the time,&lt;ref name="HansardON1949" group="nc"/&gt; but they failed as well. Provincial societies were later organized in British Columbia and Ontario in 1957.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|pp=597, 599}}

The APAs would later consolidate with other accounting organizations. They merged with the CPAs in New Brunswick in 1952, but other APAs revived the organization in 1961.{{efn|reactivated upon [[writ of mandamus]] issued by the [[New Brunswick Court of Appeal]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Ex Parte Goodwin et al|link=|year=1961|court=nbca|num=421|format=canlii|parallelcite=27 DLR (2d) 667|date=1961-03-24|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Later efforts by other provincial bodies to merge with the CGAs proved to be more conclusive. The Ontario society, however, decided in 1963 to restrict its membership to those members who held public accounting licenses. As no future licenses would be conferred on APAs after 1962 as a result of that year's reorganization of the Public Accountants Council, it would gradually cease to exist over time.{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=603}}

While the APA designation is not now recognized by any Canadian jurisdiction as a professional designation in active usage, the Canadian Institute of Accredited Public Accountants continues to exist,&lt;ref name="CIAPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=462195|title= Federal Corporation Information - 046219-5|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=ic.gc.ca|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in alliance with the Society of Professional Accountants of Canada.{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=2744503|title= Federal Corporation Information - 274450-3|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=ic.gc.ca|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPAC confers the APA designation as an [[title of honor|honorary title]] to [[registered professional accountant|Registered Professional Accountant]]s of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://professionalaccountant.org/about-spac/designations/|title= Designations|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= professionalaccountant.org|publisher= Society of Professional Accountants of Canada|access-date= April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of uniform accounting standards==
From 1946, the chartered accountants took the initiative to codify [[generally accepted accounting principles]] and [[generally accepted auditing standards]] in Canada:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://accountinghistory.blogspot.ca/2011/11/brief-history-of-evolution-of.html|title= A Brief History of Accounting and Auditing Standards in Canada|last= Roy|first= Paul-Émile|date= November 16, 2011|website= accountinghistory.blogspot.ca|publisher= Digital Archives for Chartered Accountants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* DACA's Accounting and Auditing Research Committee began to issuing bulletins in 1946, setting out recommended standards of practice on accounting and auditing.
:* The CICA started the production of research studies in 1963 on topics of current interest to the profession.
:* The ''CICA Handbook'' was created in 1968 to consolidate the CICA's pronouncements. Its requirements would attain mandatory in 1975, through regulations issued under the ''[[Canada Business Corporations Act]]''.&lt;ref group="na"&gt;currently the {{Cite canlaw|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-512/section-70.html|type= reg|regtitle= Canada Business Corporations Regulations, 2001|regnumber= SOR/2001-512}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] and [[International Auditing Standards]] would be incorporated by reference in the ''Handbook'', effective in 2011.
:* It would be renamed in 2014 as the ''CPA Canada Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/business-and-accounting-resources/cpa-canada-handbook-the-standards-and-guidance-collection|title= CPA Canada Handbook: The standards and guidance collection|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher= [[CPA Canada]] |access-date= April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing of public accounting==
In addition to conferring exclusive rights to use specified designations on the members of the various professional bodies, most provinces have also required those who pursued [[public accounting]] to obtain a separate permit. The permit is issued by:

#a specified professional body, either with or without the supervision of a provincial agency;
#a provincial agency (which could be effectively dominated by a professional body), either generally or where a qualified accountant does not belong to a specified body (as in BC from 1973).&lt;ref group="na"&gt;''Companies Act'', S.B.C. 1973, c. 18, s. 203; currently {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Business Corporations Act|abbr =S.B.C.|year =2002|chapter =57|part =7|division =4|link=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/02057_08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richardson|1993b|p=609}}

==Consolidation: Rise of the Chartered Professional Accountants (2012-)==
===Implementation by jurisdiction===
The various provincial bodies were federated nationally in the following bodies:

:* [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]]
:* [[Certified General Accountants Association of Canada]]
:* [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]]

After a failed merger attempt in 2004, the CAs and CMAs began new discussions in 2011, and invited the CGAs to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Buckstein|first= Jeff|date= July 2011|title= Two out of three in on merger talks|url= http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=519|dead-url= yes|work= The Bottom Line|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010539/http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=519|archive-date= April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the three national bodies supported merger discussions, there was significant tension among their memberships, notably within the CAs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Buckstein|first= Jeff|date= March 2012|title= Case for unity to be laid out|url= http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca:80/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=564|dead-url= yes|work= The Bottom Line|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120221165608/http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca:80/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=564|archive-date= February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point the CGAs and CMAs in Ontario withdrew from talks because of concerns over the potential loss of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Buckstein|first= Jeff|date= August 2012|title= Uneasy calm after bruising merger battles|url= http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca:80/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=587|dead-url= yes|work= The Bottom Line|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120811034246/http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca:80/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=587|archive-date= August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the proposal argued that it would strengthen the influence, relevance and contribution of the Canadian accounting profession with domestic and international stakeholders and serve the public interest through common codes of conduct, disciplinary systems and licensing regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1= Kirby|first1= Michael|author-link1= Michael J.

In addition, Yukon and British Columbia have several other protected designations in use:

:* AAT ("Associate Accounting Technologist")
:* ACPA ("Associate of the Chartered Professional Accountants")

Yukon also grants an honorary designation known as "CPA (Hon)".

Alberta has opted to allow all those with legacy designations to use them in conjunction with "CPA" during the first 10 years from July 1, 2015, or to use the legacy designation alone during that time. After the 10-year transition period, the "CPA" designation can be used on its own by such legacy holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Designation Use|url = http://www.cpaalberta.ca/Members/Designation-Use|publisher = CPA Alberta|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704204438/http://www.cpaalberta.ca/Members/Designation-Use|archivedate = 2015-07-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on the Canadian landscape===
During the years running up to the 2012-2018 consolidation, as well as thereafter, there has been debate as to the practical impact of the merger.

The 2010-2011 CA/CMA position paper on the proposed merger gave five reasons why it should be pursued:{{sfn|Richardson|Kilfoyle|2012|pp=19-22}}

#The existing regulatory framework was complex and costly.
#The differences in the functions pursued by the various designation holders were disappearing.
#A strong Canadian voice was needed on the world stage.
#It was necessary to compete with other accounting designations that were going global, such as the [[Chartered Global Management Accountant]] (promoted by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]) and [[CPA Australia]].
#It was desirable to act proactively, instead of waiting for reforms imposed by various governments.

There was significant resistance by the CA membership at the time, who were concerned that their collective image would be diminished as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richardson|first1= Alan J.|last2= Jones|first2= D.G. Brian|year= 2007|title= Professional "brand", personal identity and resistance to change in the Canadian accounting profession: a comparative history of two accounting association merger negotiations|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1032373207076035|journal= Accounting History|publisher= |volume= 12|issue= 2|pages=  135{{en dash}}164|doi= 10.1177/1032373207076035|issn=1032-3732|accessdate=May 16, 2014}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the consolidation, the following observations have been made:

#Based on a [[social network theory]] analysis, it appears that those associated with the former chartered accountant bodies have generally had a disproportionate impact in the attainment of [[political power]] within the new CPA bodies, extending even to ousting the [[knowledge base]] that had been accumulated within the other legacy bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Richardson|first1= Alan J.|date= 2017|title= Merging the Profession: A Social Network Analysis of the Consolidation of the Accounting Profession in Canada|url= |journal= Accounting Perspectives|volume= 16|issue= 2|pages= 83–104|doi= 10.1111/1911-3838.12139}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The new CPA bodies have adopted a more passive approach in recruiting new members, in contrast to the activity undertaken by the previous legacy bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brouard|first1= François|last2= Bujaki|first2= Merridee|last3= Durocher|first3= Sylvain|date=2017 |title= Attracting Prospective Professional Accountants Before and After the CPA Merger in Canada|url= |journal= Accounting Perspectives|volume= 16|issue= 2|pages= 105–127|doi= 10.1111/1911-3838.12138}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign professional bodies active in Canada==
As possession of a Canadian professional accounting designation is not generally a mandatory requirement to hold a Canadian financial position, other professional bodies have members who also work in Canada, of which the most significant are:

:* [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Official website|https://www.cimaglobal.com/Our-locations/Canada/|name=CIMA - Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.accaglobal.com/ca/en/footertoolbar/contact-us/national-offices.html|title= Our national offices|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher= ACCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the sale of the company, Bently subsequently remained active in his other family-owned businesses representing a diverse range of interests including [[rotordynamics]], [[agriculture]], [[biofuels]], [[real estate]], [[fluid bearing|externally pressurized fluid bearings]], and machinery diagnostics.

==Education and military service==

Born in Muscatine, Iowa, Bently served in the U.S. Navy during [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowalum.com/daa/Bently.html |title=Donald E. Bently

He attended the [[University of Iowa]], receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1949, followed by a master's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1950.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/alumni-friends/honor-wall/distinguished-engineering-alumni-academy-members/donald-e-bently|title=Donald Bently - College of Engineering - The University of Iowa|website=www.engineering.uiowa.edu|access-date=2013-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531234603/http://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/alumni-friends/honor-wall/distinguished-engineering-alumni-academy-members/donald-e-bently|archive-date=2013-05-31|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bently worked as the lead azide and mercury fulminate assembly line engineer at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant|Iowa Ordnance Plant]] in [[Burlington, Iowa]]. He then worked for [[North American Aviation]] and [[Rocketdyne]] in California.  He later completed graduate-level coursework at [[UC Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb-co.com/corporate/founder.php|title=Externally Pressurized Porous Gas Bearings – Bently Bearings|website=Bently Bearings|access-date=2013-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125075624/http://bpb-co.com/corporate/founder.php|archive-date=2012-01-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working for an aerospace company. He experimented the [[eddy-current]] sensing technology that was later the foundation of Bently Nevada Corporation.

==Bently Nevada history==

{{main|Bently Nevada}}

During Bently's brief employment in the aerospace industry in the mid-1950s, he assisted with research into the use of electronic sensing technologies for aircraft control systems.  At the time, his employer concluded that there was limited use for the eddy-current technology in aircraft controls.  Bently, however, felt the technology showed commercial promise elsewhere and received permission to use it in his own endeavors.  In 1956, he left to form Bently Scientific Company, manufacturing and selling eddy-current products via mail order from his garage in Berkeley, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald  Bently Obituary |url=http://funeralinnovations.com/obituary/95327/Donald-Bently |website=funeralinnovations.com |accessdate=22 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823105708/http://funeralinnovations.com/obituary/95327/Donald-Bently |archive-date=2018-08-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1961, Bently relocated the company to Minden, Nevada, and incorporated it there as Bently Nevada Corporation with three people.&lt;ref name=munson/&gt;&lt;ref name="gemc"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.gemeasurement.com/sites/gemc.dev/files/orbit_v33n1_2013_q1.pdf |title=In-Memoriam – The Life of a Great Man |journal=Orbit|page=4|volume=33 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827171915/https://www.gemeasurement.com/sites/gemc.dev/files/orbit_v33n1_2013_q1.pdf |archivedate=August 27, 2018| number=1 | date=January 2013 |publisher= GE Oil &amp; Gas}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bently's primary application of eddy-current technology was for non-contacting displacement sensors.  Often thought of as a type of electronic [[dial indicator]], such sensors are typically used to measure very small distances between the tip of the sensor and a conductive surface, such as rotating shaft.  The displacements measured are extremely small, typically on the order of several thousandths of an inch.  

Initially, Bently's sensors were sold mainly for laboratory rather than industrial measurements.  However, beginning in the early 1960s, users began to experiment with eddy-current sensors for measuring vibration on turbines, compressors, pumps, electric motors, and other [[turbomachinery]].  This application proved to be extremely successful, allowing machinery operators a practical method of observing actual shaft vibratory motion for the first time.  Soon thereafter, Bently augmented his sensors with monitoring instrumentation that accepted his sensors as inputs and provided simple visual indication of the amount of vibration.  Users could set alarm levels for annunication and machine shutdown purposes when vibration levels became excessive.  From that time forward, Bently began to focus his company's efforts almost exclusively on instrumentation for rotating machinery condition measurements.  

In 2001, Bently Nevada built a new $30 million, 283,000-square-foot hadquarters outside Minden at Orchard and Buckeye, previously known as Ferris Heights.&lt;ref name="munson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Munson |first1=Jeff |title=GE’s purchase of Bently complete |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/ges-purchase-of-bently-complete/ |website=Tahoe Daily Tribune |publisher=Tribune News Service |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=January 28, 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822213921/https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/ges-purchase-of-bently-complete/ |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new location consolidated operations previously located at eight different locations around Carson Valley.&lt;ref name=carter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Sharon |title=Bently breaks ground for new facility at Science Park |url=https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/bently-breaks-ground-for-new-facility-at-science-park/ |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=December 19, 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822213915/https://www.recordcourier.com/news/local/bently-breaks-ground-for-new-facility-at-science-park/ |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bently acquired the Buckeye Ranch in 1978, the former location of the Dangberg sheep operation. Bently renamed the location Bently Science Park.&lt;ref name=carter/&gt;

This specialized focus resulted in substantial growth. When Bently sold Bently Nevada to GE Energy in January 2002 for between $600 million and $900 million,&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt; the company had 1,200 people at its headquarters in Minden, Nevada and 2,100 employees worldwide, operated in more than 40 countries, and had global sales exceeding $235 million USD.&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GE Power Systems Completes Acquisition of Bently Nevada |url=http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-power-systems-completes-acquisition-of-bently-nevada-270415 |website=GE Newsroom |accessdate=22 August 2018 |language=en |date=25 January 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822214149/http://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-power-systems-completes-acquisition-of-bently-nevada-270415 |archive-date=2018-08-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bently said he sold Bently Nevada so he could concentrate on other interests.

==Other business interests==

Bently founded other businesses, including Bently Pressurized Bearing Company, which manufactured a bearing that can hold a rotating axle in place. The technology injected [[fluid bearing|highly pressurized air]] between the bearing and the rotating machinery, preventing the axle from touching the bearing, virtually eliminating friction.&lt;ref name=twp/&gt; 

=== Bently Rotordynamics  ===

In 1981, Bently established a pure research organization called Bently Rotordynamics Research Corporation (BRDRC or "Birdrock"). BRDRC's objective was to conduct rotordynamic research, furthering the knowledge of rotating machinery behavior, modeling techniques, and malfunction diagnostic methodologies.  Its mission was considered complementary to Bently Nevada, with BRDRC focused on understanding how machinery behaved, and Bently Nevada focused on understanding and building instrumentation to measure machinery behavior. 

BRDRC made a number of important contributions to the field of rotordynamics such as a better understanding of fluid-induced instabilities, advanced models for understanding shaft crack behavior, insight into rubbing malfunctions between stationary and rotating parts, and enhancement of the rotordynamic equations via introduction of a new variable lambda (λ) which denoted the fluid circumferential average velocity ratio and more accurately modeled hydrodynamic effects.  Bently was personally responsible for many of these developments, publishing his work under the auspices of BRDRC. BRDRC also introduced several new data presentation formats, such as so-called "full" spectrum plots and "acceptance region" trend plots. Its research findings were published extensively in relevant technical journals, and the research that had practical commercial applications often found its way into the Bently Nevada product line. In 2002, BRDRC was sold along with Bently Nevada to GE Energy.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"/&gt;

=== Other Bently businesses ===

Bently founded Bently Agrowdynamics, which focused on environmentally sustainable agricultural practices and innovative uses of renewable resources. The company led reconstruction of Mud Lake Dam which had been damaged during the 1994 Double Springs Flat earthquake. They converted the 100-year-old earth filled dam to a rock filled structure, ensuring a supply of irrigation water for Bently Agrowdynamics’ South Ranch properties and improving the dam's resistance to earthquakes, protecting the surrounding community.&lt;ref name=uiowa&gt;{{cite web |title=Donald Bently {{!}} College of Engineering {{!}} The University of Iowa |url=https://www.engineering.uiowa.edu/alumni/awards/honor-wall/donald-bently |website=www.engineering.uiowa.edu |accessdate=27 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other businesses included Bently Tribology Services, Bently Biofuels, Gibson Tool and Supply, and RoMaDyn, a mechanical engineering services and diagnostics company.&lt;ref name=wittich/&gt; He also held more than {{convert|38,000|acres}} of agricultural land in and around [[Douglas County, Nevada|Carson Valley, Nevada]] and numerous real estate holdings in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="munson"/&gt;

All of Bently's businesses were privately held, allowing him to focus on a long-term strategy without the pressure of quarterly stockholder reports. This also enabled him to keep his company in the front of his field technologically.  He successfully competed against subsidized Japanese companies and from U.S. government-funded entities.&lt;ref name=twp/&gt;

===Founded ISCORMA===

A significant amount of Bently's rotordynamic research efforts were about rotor dynamic stability.  In 2001, he established ISCORMA, (International Symposium on Stability Control of Rotating Machinery), a bi-annual industry event.  Bently was an active organizer and participant in all ISCORMA conferences until his death.&lt;ref name="uiowa.edu"/&gt;

===Work with NASA===

[[File:ERP Modules.png|500px|thumb|right|Diagram showing some typical ERP modules]]

'''Enterprise resource planning''' ('''ERP''') is the integrated management of core business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.

ERP is usually referred to as a category of business-[[management]] software — typically a suite of integrated [[application software|application]]s—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many [[business sector|business]] activities.

ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated  view of core business processes using common [[database]]s maintained by a [[database management system]]. ERP systems track business resources—cash, [[raw material]]s, [[production capacity]]—and the status of business commitments: orders, [[purchase order]]s, and [[payroll]]. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, [[accounting]], etc.) that provide the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|title=Antecedents of ERP systems implementation success: a study on Jordanian healthcare sector|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=549|last=Almajali|first=Dmaithan|date=|website=|publisher=Emeralad|access-date=|accessdate=January 6, 2016|doi=10.1108/JEIM-03-2015-0024|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Radovilsky |first=Zinovy |editor-last=Bidgoli |editor-first=Hossein |year=2004 |title=The Internet Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |page=707 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACfBmYiNaTcC&amp;pg=PA707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have become the largest category of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses over the past{{which|date=November 2015}} decade. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rubina Adam, Paula Kotze, Alta van der Merwe. 2011. Acceptance of enterprise resource planning systems by small manufacturing Enterprises. In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems, edited by Runtong Zhang, José Cordeiro, Xuewei Li, Zhenji Zhang and Juliang Zhang, SciTePress, p. 229 - 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2012 | title = CSFs along ERP life-cycle in SMEs: a field study | url = | journal = Industrial Management &amp; Data Systems | volume = 112 | issue = 3| pages = 360–384 | doi=10.1108/02635571211210031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP systems run on a variety of [[computer hardware]] and [[Computer network|network]] configurations, typically using a [[database]] as an [[information repository]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Gartner Group first used the abbreviation ERP in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2583660/e-commerce/extended-erp-technology-reborn-in-b2b.html|title=Extended ERP technology reborn in B2B|last=InfoWorld|first=Heather Harreld,|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Vision of Next Generation MRP II", Scenario S-300-339, Gartner Group, April 12, 1990{{Third-party-inline|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extend upon the capabilities of [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), and the later [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|last= Anderegg |first= Travis |title= MRP/MRPII/ERP/ERM&amp;nbsp;— Confusing Terms and Definitions for a Murkey Alphabet Soup |url= http://wiki.wlug.org.nz/EnterpriseSpeak |accessdate= September 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.erp.com/component/content/article/324-erp-archive/4407-erp.html |title= ERP|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[computer-integrated manufacturing]]. Without replacing these terms, ERP came to represent a larger whole that reflected the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sheilds |first=Mureell G. |title=E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning |year=2005 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all ERP packages developed from a manufacturing core; ERP vendors variously began assembling their packages with finance-and-accounting, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], and human-resource components. By the mid-1990s ERP systems addressed all core enterprise functions. Governments and non–profit organizations also began to use ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=SI |last=Chang |author2=Guy Gable |author3= Errol Smythe |author4= Greg Timbrell  |conference= International Conference on Information Systems |title= A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues |pages= 494–500 |publisher= [[Association for Information Systems]] |year= 2000 |location= Atlanta |url= http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359640.359793|accessdate= September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

ERP systems experienced rapid growth in the 1990s. Because of the [[year 2000 problem]] and the introduction of the [[euro]] that disrupted legacy systems, many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with ERP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thin Enterprise Resource Planning |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |location=Boston |edition=Second |isbn=0-619-21663-8 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP systems initially focused on automating [[back office]] functions that did not directly affect [[customer]]s and the public. [[Front office]] functions, such as [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), dealt directly with customers, or [[electronic business|e-business]] systems such as [[e-commerce]], [[e-government]], e-telecom, and [[e-finance]]—or [[Supply chain management|supplier relationship management]] (SRM) became integrated later, when the internet simplified communicating with external parties.&lt;ref name="HaymanERP00"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ERP in the Internet Economy |journal=Information Systems Frontiers |author=Hayman, L. |volume=2000 |issue=2 |pages=137–139 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1026595923192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"ERP II" was coined in 2000 in an article by Gartner Publications entitled ''ERP Is Dead—Long Live ERP II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ERP II role expands traditional ERP resource optimization and [[transaction processing]]. Rather than just manage buying, selling, etc.—ERP II leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/bae/people/holderness/readings/ERP_is_Dead--Long_Live_ERP_II.pdf |title=The Bryan School of Business and Economics at UNCG—Exceptional Problem Solvers |publisher=Uncg.edu |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ERP II is more flexible than the first generation ERP. Rather than confine ERP system capabilities within the organization, it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems. Enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems. ERP II systems are typically used to enable collaborative initiatives such as [[Supply chain management|supply chain management (SCM)]], [[Customer relationship management|customer relationship management (CRM)]], and [[Business intelligence|business intelligence (BI)]] among business partner organizations through the use of various [[Electronic business|e-business technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles Møller|date=August 1, 2005|title=ERP II: a conceptual framework for next‐generation enterprise systems?|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17410390510609626|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=18|issue=4|pages=483–497|doi=10.1108/17410390510609626|issn=1741-0398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhi|first=Umar|date=July 1, 2016|title=An experiential learning pedagogical framework for enterprise systems education in business schools|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1472811716300222|journal=The International Journal of Management Education|volume=14|issue=2|pages=198–211|doi=10.1016/j.ijme.2016.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the ERP system. ERP vendors are extending ERP to these devices, along with other business applications. Technical stakes of modern ERP concern integration—hardware, applications, networking, supply chains. ERP now covers more functions and roles—including [[decision making]], stakeholders' relationships, [[standardization]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[globalization]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaul | first1 = L. | last2 = Tauber | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Critical Success Factors in Enterprise Resource Planning Systems: Review of the Last Decade | doi = 10.1145/2501654.2501669 | journal = ACM Computing Surveys | volume = 45 | issue = 4| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
ERP  systems typically include the following characteristics:
* An integrated system 
* Operates in (or near) real time
* A common database that supports all the applications
* A consistent look and feel across modules
* Installation of the system with elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department, provided the implementation is not done in small steps&lt;ref&gt;Sheilds, Mureell G., E-Business and ERP: Rapid Implementation and Project Planning. (2001) John Wiley and Sons, Inc. p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deployment options include: [[on-premises]], cloud hosted, or [[SaaS]]

==Functional areas==
An ERP system covers the following common functional areas. In many ERP systems, these are called and grouped together as ERP modules:
* [[Finance &amp; Accounting]]: [[General Ledger]],  [[Fixed assets|Fixed Assets]], [[Accounts Payable|payables]] including vouchering, matching and payment,  [[Accounts Receivable|receivables]] Cash Management and collections, [[cash management]],  [[Consolidation (business)|Financial Consolidation]]
* [[Management Accounting]]: [[Budgeting]], Costing, [[cost management]], [[activity based costing]]
* [[Human resources]]: [[Recruitment|Recruiting]], [[training]], [[Schedule (workplace)|rostering]], [[payroll]], [[Employee benefit|benefits]], [[Pensions|retirement and pension plans]], [[Diversity (business)|diversity management]], [[retirement]], [[Employee exit management|separation]]
* Manufacturing: [[Engineering]], [[bill of materials]], work orders, [[scheduling]], [[capacity utilization|capacity]], [[workflow management system|workflow management]], [[quality control]], manufacturing process, manufacturing projects, manufacturing flow,  [[product life cycle management]]
* Order Processing: [[Order to cash]], order entry, credit checking, [[pricing]], available to promise, [[inventory]], [[shipping]], sales analysis and reporting, sales commissioning.
* [[Supply chain management]]: Supply chain planning, supplier scheduling, [[product configurator]], [[order to cash]], [[purchasing]], [[inventory]], claim processing, [[warehousing]] (receiving, putaway, [[Order picking|picking]] and [[Packaging and labeling|packing]]).
* [[Project management]]: Project planning, resource planning, project costing, [[work breakdown structure]], [[Invoice|billing]], time and expense, performance units, activity management
* Customer relationship management: Sales and marketing, commissions, service, customer contact, [[call center]] support&amp;nbsp;— CRM systems are not always considered part of ERP systems but rather Business Support systems (BSS).
* Data services : Various "self–service" interfaces for customers, suppliers and/or employees

=== GRP ===
Government resource planning (GRP) is the equivalent of an ERP for the [[public sector]] and an  integrated office automation system for government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;
Yunliang, Xiongtao, Qing, Jing and  Ning (2010) "Design of E-Government Information Management Platform Based on SOA Framework", 2010 First International Conference on Networking and Distributed Computing, Hangzhou, doi:10.1109/ICNDC.2010.42.&lt;/ref&gt; The software structure, modularization, core algorithms and main interfaces do not differ from other ERPs, and ERP software suppliers manage to adapt their systems to government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Kern and Havenhand (2000) "ERP Critical Success Factors: an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector institutions", Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Gable, Smythe and Timbrell (2000) "A Delphi examination of public sector ERP implementation issues" Proceedings of ICIS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebrahim | first1 = Zakareya | last2 = Irani | first2 = Zahir | year = 2005 | title = E‐government adoption: architecture and barriers | url = | journal = Business Process Management Journal | volume =  11| issue = 5| pages =  589–611| doi = 10.1108/14637150510619902 | citeseerx =10.1.1.453.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both system implementations, in private and public organizations, are adopted to improve productivity and overall business performance in organizations, but comparisons (private vs. public) of implementations shows that the main factors influencing ERP implementation success in the public sector are cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Wingreen, Maryam  and Hritik (2014) "An Investigation into Enterprise Resource Planning Implementation Success: Evidence from Private and Public Sector Organizations", [http://aisel.aisnet.org/pacis2014/339 PACIS 2014/339].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2860.pdf Shafqat, Enhong and Faisal (2012)], "Enterprise Resource Planning - 'real blessing' or 'a blessing in disguise': an exploration of the contextual factors in public sector"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coelho | first1 = Cunha | last2 = Meirelles | first2 =  | year = 2015 | title = The client-consultant relationship in the implementation of ERP in government: exploring the dynamic between power and knowledge | url = | journal = DGO | volume =  | issue = | pages = 140 | page =  | doi = 10.1145/2757401.2757405 | isbn = 9781450336000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
* [[Database transaction|Transactional database]]
* Management portal/[[dashboard (business)|dashboard]]
* People
* Software

==Best practices==
Most ERP systems incorporate [[best practice]]s. This means the software reflects the vendor's interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process. Systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Ellen and Wagner, Brett."Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning" 3rd.ed.Course Technology Cengage Learning.Boston, Massachusetts.2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, best practices reduced risk by 71% compared to other software implementations.&lt;ref&gt;"Enhanced Project Success Through SAP Best Practices&amp;nbsp;– International Benchmarking Study". {{ISBN|1-59229-031-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as [[IFRS]], [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], or [[Basel II]]. They can also help comply with de facto industry standards, such as [[electronic funds transfer]]. This is because the procedure can be readily codified within the ERP software and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses who share that business requirement.&lt;ref name="IngolfoEstab11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Establishing Regulatory Compliance for Software Requirements |journal=Conceptual Modeling - ER 2011 | last1=Ingolfo | first1=S. | last2=Siena | first2=A. | last3=Mylopoulos | first3=J. |pages=47–61 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24606-7_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSITSys"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metricstream.com/insights/IT_sys_val.htm |title=IT Systems Validation for SOx and Regulatory Compliance |work=Insights |publisher=MetricStream, Inc |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity to plant floor information==
ERP systems connect to real–time data and transaction data in a variety of ways. These systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator]]s, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.

'''Direct integration'''—ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.

'''Database integration'''—ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.

'''[[Enterprise appliance transaction module]]s (EATM)'''—These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system–specific program interfaces ([[Api|APIs]]). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off–the–shelf solution.

'''Custom–integration solutions'''—Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom–integrated solutions typically run on [[workstation]] or server-class computers.

==Implementation==
ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/erp.shtml |title=ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) |publisher=Tech-faq.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.&lt;ref name="tech-faq.com" /&gt; Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project. Modular ERP systems can be implemented in stages. The typical project for a large enterprise takes about 14 months and requires around 150 consultants.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Critical Issues Affecting an ERP Implementation |url=http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |publisher=Auerbach Publications |work=Information Systems Management |volume=16 |issue=3 |page=7 |year=1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103032912/http://carl.sandiego.edu/gba573/critical_issues_affecting_an_erp.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small projects can require months; multinational and other large implementations can take years.&lt;ref name="SankarImplement06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVS9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Implementation Strategies for SAP R/3 in a Multinational Organization: Lessons from a Real-World Case Study |last1=Sankar |first1=C. |last2=Rau |first2=K.-H. |publisher=Cybertech Publishing |page=8 |year=2006 |isbn=9781591407782 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PelphreyDirecting15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJO9BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 |title=Directing the ERP Implementation: A Best Practice Guide to Avoiding Program Failure Traps While Tuning System Performance |author=Pelphrey, M.W. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=92–111 |year=2015 |isbn=9781482248425}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mass customization|Customization]] can substantially increase implementation times.&lt;ref name="carl.sandiego.edu" /&gt;

Besides that, information processing influences various business functions e.g. some large corporations like [[Wal-Mart]] use a [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] inventory system. This reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency, and requires up-to-date data. Before 2014, Walmart used a system called Inforem developed by [[IBM]] to manage replenishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitywire.com/node/31165 |title=Wal-Mart slow to roll out new replenishment system |publisher=Thecitywire.com |location=Arkansas |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process preparation===
Implementing ERP typically requires changes in existing business processes.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., pp. 300–343. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = C. | last2 = Vessey | first2 = I. | title = Managing the Next Wave of Enterprise Systems: Leveraging Lessons from ERP | url = | journal = MIS Quarterly Executive | volume = 2 | issue = 1| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulties could be related to the system, business process, infrastructure, training, or lack of motivation.

It is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement ERP software. Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:
* Linking current processes to the organization's strategy
* Analyzing the effectiveness of each process
* Understanding existing automated solutions&lt;ref&gt;King. W., "Ensuring ERP implementation success," ''Information Systems Management'', Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, Y., A. Gunasekaran, and M. Abthorpe, "Enterprise Information Systems Project Implementation: A Case Study of ERP in Rolls-Royce," ''International Journal of Production Economics'', 87(3), February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP implementation is considerably more difficult (and politically charged) in decentralized organizations, because they often have different processes, business rules, data semantics, authorization hierarchies, and decision centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Requirements Engineering for Cross-organizational ERP Implementation: Undocumented Assumptions and Potential Mismatches | first1=Maya |last1=Daneva |author2=Roel Wieringa |author2-link=Roel Wieringa |publisher=University of Twente |url=http://www.vital-project.org/papers/Daneva-Wieringa-Camera-Ready-RE-Paper.pdf |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may require migrating some business units before others, delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit, possibly reducing integration (e.g., linking via [[Master data management]]) or customizing the system to meet specific needs.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"&gt;Thomas H. Davenport, "Putting the Enterprise into the Enterprise System", ''Harvard Business Review'', July–August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential disadvantage is that adopting "standard" processes can lead to a loss of [[competitive advantage]]. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Turban et al. (2008). ''Information Technology for Management, Transforming Organizations in the Digital Economy''. Massachusetts: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., p. 320. {{ISBN|978-0-471-78712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Dehning|Dehning, B.]] and T.Stratopoulos, 'Determinants of a Sustainable Competitive Advantage Due to an IT-enabled Strategy,' Journal of Strategic Information Systems, Vol. 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Configuration===
Configuring an ERP system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work. ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting—[[FIFO and LIFO accounting|FIFO or LIFO]]—to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.&lt;ref name="Thomas H. Davenport 1998"/&gt;

===Two tier enterprise resource planning===

Two-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company’s customers. Each independent center or subsidiary may have its own [[business model]]s, [[workflow]]s, and [[business process]]es.

Given the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.&lt;ref name="ferdows"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferdows | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Making the most of foreign factories | url = | journal = [[Harvard Business Review]] | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 73–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model—separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations.&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;Gill, R. (2011). "The rise of two-tier ERP." ''Strategic Finance'', 93(5), 35-40, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that affect enterprises' adoption of two-tier ERP systems include:
* Manufacturing globalization, the economics of sourcing in emerging economies
* Potential for quicker, less costly ERP implementations at subsidiaries, based on selecting software more suited to smaller companies
* Extra effort, (often involving the use of [[Enterprise application integration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/workflow/system-centric-bpms.html#Back-End_EAI |title=Technical Workflows |publisher=[[CEITON]] |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is required where data must pass between two ERP systems&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Nigel (2010).[http://www.gartner.com/id=1412121 "Two-Tier ERP Suite Strategy: Considering Your Options."] Gartner Group. July 28, 2010. Retrieved September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Two-tier ERP strategies give enterprises agility in responding to market demands and in aligning IT systems at a corporate level while inevitably resulting in more systems as compared to one ERP system used throughout the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kovacs | first1 = G. L. | last2 = Paganelli | first2 = P. | year = 2003 | title = A planning and management infrastructure for large, complex, distributed projects&amp;nbsp;— beyond ERP and SCM | url = http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/~sa_hashemi/My Teachings/MS-CEIT-Supply Chain Management/W-Selected Papers for class seminars-last/scm-pm-A planning and management infrastructure for large%2C complex%2Cdistributed projects-beyond ERP and SCM.pdf| journal = Computers in Industry | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 165–165 | doi=10.1016/s0166-3615(03)00034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customization===
ERP systems are theoretically based on industry best practices, and their makers intend that organizations deploy them "as is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraemmerand|first=P.|title=ERP implementation: an integrated process of radical change and continuous learning|journal=Production Planning &amp; Control|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=228–248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vilpola|first=Inka Heidi|title=A method for improving ERP implementation success by the principles and process of user-centred design|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–76|doi=10.1080/17517570701793848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERP vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules, but gaps in features often remain even after configuration is complete.

ERP customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps, each with their own pros/cons. Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization—with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Estimating the impact of enterprise resource planning project management decisions on post-implementation maintenance costs: a case study using simulation modelling|journal=Enterprise Information Systems|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|pages=391–421|doi=10.1080/17517575.2010.519785|bibcode=2010EntIS...4..391F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:

* Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).
* The software is designed to handle various configurations, and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.
* The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.
* Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre–defined "hooks" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting. Other customizations (e.g., those involving changes to fundamental data structures) are overwritten during upgrades and must be re-implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakovlev|first=I.V.|title=An ERP implementation and business process reengineering at a Small University|journal=Educause Quarterly|year=2002|volume=2|pages=52–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customization advantages include that it:
* Improves user acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fryling|first=Meg|title=Total Cost of Ownership, System Acceptance and Perceived Success of Enterprise Resource Planning Software: Simulating a Dynamic Feedback Perspective of ERP in the Higher Education Environment|year=2010|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database|isbn=978-1-109-74428-6|page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Offers the potential to obtain competitive advantage vis-à-vis companies using only standard features

Customization disadvantages include that it may:
* Increase time and resources required to implement and maintain&lt;ref name="Fryling 2010 391–421"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZRqCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Modern ERP: Select, Implement, &amp; Use Today's Advanced Business Systems |author=Bradford, M. |pages=107–108 |year=2015 |isbn=9781312665989 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hinder seamless interfacing/integration between suppliers and customers due to the differences between systems&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Limit the company's ability to upgrade the ERP software in the future&lt;ref name="BradfordModern15" /&gt;
* Create over reliance on customization, undermining the principles of ERP as a standardizing software platform

===Extensions===
ERP systems can be extended with third–party software, often via vendor-supplied interfaces.&lt;ref name="BendolyStrat05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOHQvgpeNYC&amp;pg=PA95 |title=Strategic ERP Extension and Use |last1=Bendoly |first1=E. |last2=Jacobs |first2=F.R. |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=95 |year=2005 |isbn=9780804750981 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeonERP08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=95QiBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171 |title=ERP Demystified |author=Leon, A. |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |pages=170–171 |year=2008 |isbn=9780070656642}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions offer features such as:&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;
* product data management
* product life cycle management
* customer relations management
* [[data mining]]
* e-procurement

===Data migration===
[[Data migration]] is the process of moving, copying, and restructuring data from an existing system to the ERP system. Migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning. Unfortunately, since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase, it often receives insufficient attention. The following steps can structure migration planning:&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030160728/http://research.ittoolbox.com/white-papers/backoffice/erp/data-migration-strategies-in-erp-4620/ |title=Data Migration Strategy in ERP |author=Ramaswamy, V.K. |publisher=Information Technology Toolbox, Inc |date=27 September 2007 |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Identify the data to be migrated.
* Determine the migration timing.
* Generate data migration templates for key data components
* Freeze the toolset.
* Decide on the migration-related setup of key business accounts.
* Define [[data archiving]] policies and procedures.

Often, data migration is incomplete because some of the data in the existing system is either incompatible or not needed in the new system. As such, the existing system may need to be kept as an archived database to refer back to once the new ERP system is in place.&lt;ref name="RamaswamyData07" /&gt;

===Advantages===
The most fundamental advantage of ERP is that the integration of myriad business processes saves time and expense. Management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors. Data becomes visible across the organization. Tasks that benefit from this integration include:&lt;ref name="MeerBest05"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YaMB6tOd5oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Best Practices in ERP Software Applications |author=Meer, K.H. |pages=59 |year=2005 |isbn=0595345131 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sales forecasting, which allows [[inventory optimization]].
* Chronological history of every transaction through relevant data compilation in every area of operation.
* [[Order tracking]], from acceptance through fulfillment
* Revenue tracking, from [[invoice]] through cash receipt
* Matching [[purchase order]]s (what was ordered), inventory receipts (what arrived), and [[cost]]ing (what the vendor invoiced)

ERP systems centralize business data, which:
* Eliminates the need to synchronize changes between multiple systems—consolidation of finance, marketing, sales, human resource, and manufacturing applications
* Brings legitimacy and transparency to each bit of statistical data
* Facilitates standard [[Product naming convention|product naming/coding]]
* Provides a comprehensive enterprise view (no "islands of information"), making real–time information available to management anywhere, anytime to make proper decisions
* Protects sensitive data by consolidating multiple security systems into a single structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katherine |last=Walsh |url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/216940/The_ERP_Security_Challenge |title=The ERP Security Challenge |work=CSOonline |publisher=CXO Media Inc |date=January 2009 |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===

* ERP can improve quality and efficiency of the business. By keeping a company's internal business processes running smoothly, ERP can lead to better outputs that may benefit the company, such as in customer service and manufacturing.
* ERP  supports upper level management by providing information for decision making.
* ERP creates a more agile company that adapts better to change. It also makes a company more flexible and less rigidly structured so organization components operate more cohesively, enhancing the business—internally and externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=James|title=Management Information Systems(MIS)|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Irwin|location=New York|page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP can improve data security in a closed environment. A common control system, such as the kind offered by ERP systems, allows organizations the ability to more easily ensure key company data is not compromised. This changes, however, with a more open environment, requiring further scrutiny of ERP security features and internal company policies regarding security.&lt;ref name="SheSecurity07"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems |journal=Information Systems Security |last1=She |first1=W. |last2=Thuraisingham |first2=B. |volume=16 |pages=152–163 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10658980701401959}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ERP provides increased opportunities for [[collaboration]]. Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and [[email]]s. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration. ERP provides a collaborative platform that lets employees spend more time collaborating on content rather than mastering the learning curve of communicating in various formats across distributed systems.&lt;ref name="LeonERP08" /&gt;

===Disadvantages===
* Customization can be problematic. Compared to the best-of-breed approach, ERP can be seen as meeting an organization’s lowest common denominator needs, forcing the organization to find workarounds to meet unique demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Joanna |url=http://www.evolllution.com/opinions/audio-best-of-breed-vs-erp-whats-higher-ed-today/ |title=AUDIO &amp;#124; Best-of-Breed vs. ERP: What’s Best for Higher Ed Today? |publisher=The EvoLLLution |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Business process re-engineering|Re-engineering business processes]] to fit the ERP system may damage competitiveness or divert focus from other critical activities.
* ERP can cost more than less integrated or less comprehensive solutions.
* High ERP [[switching cost]]s can increase the ERP vendor's negotiating power, which can increase support, maintenance, and upgrade expenses.
* Overcoming resistance to sharing sensitive information between departments can divert management attention.
* Integration of truly independent businesses can create unnecessary dependencies.
* Extensive training requirements take resources from daily operations.
* Harmonization of ERP systems can be a mammoth task (especially for big companies) and requires a lot of time, planning, and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/reporting-forecasting/forecasting/the-minefield-of-harmonising-erp/ |title=The Minefied of Harmonising ERP |publisher=Cfo-insight.com |date=July 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727021524/http://www.cfo-insight.com/reporting-forecasting/forecasting/the-minefield-of-harmonising-erp |archivedate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postmodern ERP ==
The term "postmodern ERP" was coined by [[Gartner]] in 2013, when it first appeared in the paper series "Predicts 2014".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2633315/predicts--rise-postmodern-erp|title=Predicts 2014: The Rise of the Postmodern ERP and Enterprise Applications World|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gartner's definition of the postmodern ERP strategy, [[Legacy system|legacy]], [[Monolithic system|monolithic]] and highly customized ERP suites, in which all parts are heavily reliant on each other, should sooner or later be replaced by a mixture of both cloud-based and on-premises applications, which are more loosely coupled and can be easily exchanged if needed.

The basic idea is that there should still be a core ERP solution that would cover most important business functions, while other functions will be covered by specialist software solutions that merely extend the core ERP. This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3171517/postmodern-erp-strategy-bestofbreed-approach|title=Postmodern ERP Strategy Is Not a Best-of-Breed Approach|publisher=Gartner Group|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to software implementation, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.

There is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP [[On-premises software|on-premises]]. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.

The main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enterprise-resource-planning.cioreview.com/cxoinsight/5-factors-facilitating-the-transition-to-the-postmodern-erp-era-nid-7292-cid-96.html|title=5 Factors Facilitating the Transition to the Postmodern ERP Era|newspaper=CIOReview|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional [[Application Integration Architecture|integration]] challenges for the central IT.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">'''Management ''f''-Laws''' are subversive epigrams about common management practices. Based on observation and experience, they are used to draw attention to entrenched ways of thinking about management and business that are often at odds with common sense or our actual experience. 

Systems theorist [[Russell L. Ackoff]], his co-author Herbert J. Addison and Sally Bibb invented the term in 2006 to describe their series of over 100 distilled observations of bad leadership and the misplaced wisdom that often surrounds management in organizations. Ackoff and Addison's ''f''-Laws might seem counter-intuitive. They are designed to challenge organizations' unquestioning adherence to established management habits or beliefs.  Many of the ''f''-Laws describe a relationship of inverse proportionality, in example: ''"The lower the rank of managers, the more they know about fewer things."''

The ''f''-Laws advocate adopting a positive, forward-looking and interactive approach to structural or systematic change within organizations, following the principles of [[idealized design]].  This is a process that "involves redesigning the organization on the assumption that it was destroyed last night... The most effective way of creating the future is by closing or reducing the gap between the current state and the idealized design".

Three collections of ''f''-Laws entitled [http://www.triarchypress.net/a-little-book-of-f-laws.html A Little Book of f-Laws: 13 Common Sins of Management], [http://www.triarchypress.net/management-f-laws.html Management f-Laws: How Organizations Really Work] and [http://www.triarchypress.net/systems-thinking-for-curious-managers.html Systems Thinking for Curious Managers] have been published. While, if read in isolation, each ''f''-Law is a witty and thought-provoking axiom, the books provide a context that draws upon [[systems thinking]] and the debate over the importance of developing [[soft skills]] in business environments.

[[File:Kalklinbanan-Granhammar.jpg|thumb|The limestone cableway running north towards Arboga river]]The '''Forsby-Köping limestone cableway''', commonly referred to in Swedish as '''Kalklinbanan''', is a 42&amp;nbsp;km [[aerial tramway]] running from Forsby in [[Vingåker]] municipality to industrial town [[Köping, Sweden|Köping]] in central Sweden. Its final destination is the factory at the port of Köping, where cement was manufactured until 1978,  and later various [[limestone]] derivatives.&lt;ref name=resa&gt;{{Cite video

It was taken out of service in 1997 but kept in working order.

Despite its officially affirmed value as cultural heritage&lt;ref name=Niras /&gt; the cableway is being demolished starting June 26, 2013. The fully functioning cableway will be run one last time as carriages are removed from the track and sold for scrap. Cables will be removed later during the year and poles demolished towards the winter of 2013/14.

== Construction ==
[[File:Kalklinbanan-stolpe-form.jpg|thumb|left|Casting of concrete trestle in 1940]]The cableway was built in 1939 by AB Nordströms Linbanor for [[Skanska|Skånska Cement AB]] in concert with the construction of its Forsby limestone plant and cement factory in Köping. A 300 people workforce completed the installation at a pace of 2,1&amp;nbsp;km/month.&lt;ref name="Nordstroms"&gt;{{Cite book

| year = 1943
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a cableway was determined after evaluation of a number of modes of transportation, and special care was taken not to interfere with the surrounding landscape, particularly at the lake [[Hjälmaren]] strait.&lt;ref name="Nordstroms" /&gt;

|}The system consists of three types of stations: ''Power Stations'' with 135&amp;nbsp;hp (101&amp;nbsp;kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. ''Terminal stations'' in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. ''Angle stations'' lack motors and only change the angle of the cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying cable is divided into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.&lt;ref name="cementa" /&gt;

== Operation ==
Limestone from the Forsby quarry was coarsely crushed and sorted by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing cableway cars were automatically loaded from a storage silo, after the passage to Köping cars were automatically unloaded, the limestone was fine-ground and ready for cement production.&lt;ref name=cementa /&gt;
The cableway is supported by 235 concrete trestles and split into 4 sections with  stations in Forsby och Köping as well as the angle stations at Granhammar, Malmberga and Knotberget. Of these trestles, 10 are tall "special trestles" at the crossing of the Hjälmaren strait and [[Arboga River]], the tallest being 45&amp;nbsp;m. Power stations are located in Köping, Malmberga and Forsby. 12 tension stations line the track, and 8 road or railway intersections are protected by steel nets.&lt;ref name="cementa"&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Kalklinbanan-arbogaån-E20-panorama.jpg|thumb|350px|The limestone cableway crossing [[European route E20]] and Arboga River]]

== Decommissioning ==
In June 1997 the track was taken out of service and Forsby limestone is since transported by truck. By then, the cableway had transported a total of 25 million tons of limestone and been in operation for 56 years.&lt;ref name="levandeIndustriminnen"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the Forsby-Köping cableway the longest duration operating in the 10&amp;nbsp;km-class of cableways (closest second is the [[Mariquita-Manizales cableway]], which was run for 39 years). The limestone cableway has since been preserved as [[industrial heritage]], test run each year and subjected to some degree of maintenance. In 2003 it was appointed Industrial memorial of the year by [[Svenska industriminnesföreningen]].&lt;ref name="levandeIndustriminnen" /&gt;

November 2009 current owner [[Nordkalk]] announced that demolition is being planned, following unsuccessful attempts to transfer it to a suitable caretaker. In December 2011, evaluation for classification as cultural- or [[world heritage]] was proposed, but has not been carried out as of early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?showResults2562747=true&amp;a=2553257&amp;d=33831 |title=Nya försök rädda kalklinbanan |date=2011-10-03 |publisher=Sveriges Television |language=Swedish |trans-title=New attempts to save the limestone cableway |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722171242/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?showResults2562747=true&amp;a=2553257&amp;d=33831 |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this effort, demolition applications were submitted to the concerned municipalities in June 2012, and is planned to take place during the autumn.

The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage – [[TICCIH]] – was alerted of the urgent situation and wrote an open letter in February 2013 addressed to key organizations including the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Leo Victor]], as well as playing for the [[Suriname national football team|Suriname national team]]. He has also managed both Leo Victor and the Suriname national team during the span of his career.

He is considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the sport in Suriname, having finished as the league's top scorer twice, winning the [[Surinamese Footballer of the Year]] award on two occasions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/22329|title='Robinhood mi boi!'|publisher=Star Nieuws|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Purperhart began his career on the [[Mr. Bronsplein]] sport terrain in [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]] where he was picked up by one of the local clubs, namely [[Ajax Paramaribo|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/stut004eers01_01/stut004eers01_01_0037.php|title=Mr. Bronsplein; De eerste Surinaamse sportencyclopedie (1893-1988)|publisher=dbnl.org|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father urged him to transfer to [[NAKS]], where he was coaching at the time, and Purperhart stepped over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nakssuriname.com/?page_id=514|title=Stonfutu fu NAKS|publisher=Nakssuriname.com|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After two seasons Purperhart transferred to [[S.V. Leo Victor]]. He helped the club to secure its second national title in his first season with the club. Known for his ability to score from a free kick, he is considered one of Suriname's best goal scorers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strafschop.nl/gastcolumns/voetbal-in-suriname-deel-1/|title=Voetbal in Suriname (deel 1)|publisher=Strafschop.nl|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 and in 1967 he won the [[Surinamese Footballer of the Year]] award consecutively, and in 1965 he became captain of S.V.

'''Green Park''' is a [[business park]] near junction 11 of the [[M4 motorway]] on the outskirts of the English [[Reading, Berkshire|town of Reading]].  The park opened in 1999, and is currently owned by [[Mapletree Investments|Mapletree]]. It covers {{convert|195|acre}} and comprises 19 office buildings arranged around the ''Longwater'', a central lake and wildlife habitat. The buildings provide {{convert|1500000|sqft}} of office space, and in excess of 6,500 people work on site.&lt;ref name=topout&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/berkshire-history/pick-past-topping-out-ceremony-11194399 |title=Pick of the Past: Topping out ceremony for Green Park |work=getreading.co.uk |publisher=Trinity Mirror Southern |first=Hugh |last=Fort |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017 |archivedate=23 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423151523/http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/berkshire-history/pick-past-topping-out-ceremony-11194399 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pw2016&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.propertyweek.com/news/offices/mapletree-completes-%C2%A3560m-green-park-buy/5082071.article |title=Mapletree completes £560m Green Park buy |work=PropertyWeek.com |publisher=Property Week |date=18 May 2016 |first=Richard |last=Williams |accessdate=23 April 2017 |archivedate=23 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423154838/http://www.propertyweek.com/news/offices/mapletree-completes-%C2%A3560m-green-park-buy/5082071.article |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=landscape&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.landscapeinstitute.org/case-studies/greenpark/ |title=GreenPark |publisher=Landscape Institute |date=11 July 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is bounded by the M4 motorway to the south, the [[Madejski Stadium]] and the [[A33 road]] to the east, the site of the proposed [[Green Park Village]] to the north, and the [[Reading–Basingstoke line|Reading to Basingstoke railway line]] to the west. From a local government perspective it is largely located within the [[borough of Reading]], but partly in the [[Shinfield|civil parish of Shinfield]] within the [[borough of Wokingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpark.co.uk/about-us/park |title=About Green Park |publisher=Green Park |accessdate=25 April 2017 |archivedate=25 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425133222/http://www.greenpark.co.uk/about-us/park |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:GreenPark Lake.jpg|thumb|The central lake makes a virtue of the necessity of flood alleviation measures]]
Green Park was developed by [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] and [[Prudential Property Investment Managers|PRUPIM]] on what was once an area of low lying and poor quality agricultural land. The fact that the land was prone to flooding necessitated the construction of flood alleviation features, including the central ''Longwater'' lake and the realigned [[Foudry Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.greenpark.co.uk/wildlife-and-environment |title=Wildlife &amp; environment |publisher=Green Park |accessdate=24 April 2017 |archivedate=24 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424180501/http://my.greenpark.co.uk/wildlife-and-environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was opened in February 1999. Initially [[Cisco Systems]] committed to taking {{convert|607000|sqft}} of office space, with options on a further {{convert|617000|sqft}}. However the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2001 led to a severe scaling back of Cisco's requirements, and resulted in five of their buildings remaining empty for many years.&lt;ref name=topout/&gt;&lt;ref name=landscape/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Planet Property |last=Bill |first=Peter |publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd |date=1 December 2013| isbn=9781783061266 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fl88AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=green+park+reading+cisco+dotcom&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mfa0k3XFI2&amp;sig=cNP14UrDcxtlN_S1UiCKspCCCEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5wPrCmb3TAhUjIMAKHerlAvIQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=green%20park%20reading%20cisco%20dotcom&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was purchased by [[Oxford Properties]] in November 2011, and in the following year they came to an agreement with Cisco whereby the latter company paid a premium in order to surrender its leases on {{convert|517000|sqft}} of space, retaining only a much smaller amount of space. In 2014, the park was awarded a [[Civic Trust Awards|Civic Trust Award]] in the public realm class for its landscape design, architecture and community involvement. Green Park was sold to [[Mapletree Investments|Mapletree]] in May 2016 for [[Pound sterling|£]]560m.&lt;ref name=pw2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=civic/&gt;&lt;ref name=pw2012&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.propertyweek.com/news/cisco-surrenders-reading-offices-to-oxford-properties/5040208.article |title=Cisco surrenders Reading offices to Oxford Properties |work=PropertyWeek.com |publisher=Property Week |date=24 July 2012 |first=Patrick |last=Gower |accessdate=24 April 2017 |archivedate=24 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424140858/http://www.propertyweek.com/news/cisco-surrenders-reading-offices-to-oxford-properties/5040208.article |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2012/10/10/63373-reading-move-for-chinese-communication-giant/ |title=Reading move for Chinese communication giant |work=Readingchronicle.co.uk |publisher=Reading Chronicle |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |archivedate=23 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423152021/http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/news/13397812.Reading_move_for_Chinese_communication_giant/ |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Green Park is accessed from two junctions off the [[A33 road]], respectively {{convert|0.7|mi}} and {{convert|0.9|mi}} north of junction 11 of the [[M4 motorway]], and {{convert|2.4|mi}} and {{convert|2.6|mi}} south of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] town centre. A system of express bus routes operated by [[Reading Buses]] and branded ''greenwave'' connects Green Park to Reading town centre, [[Reading railway station]] and a [[park and ride]] site at Mereoak south of the M4. Between Reading and Green Park frequencies vary from 8 buses per hour during weekday peak periods to hourly on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading-buses.co.uk/files/timetables/current/greenwave%20green%20park%20times.pdf |title=Greenwave Green Park times |accessdate=25 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425125658/http://www.reading-buses.co.uk/files/timetables/current/greenwave%20green%20park%20times.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for a [[Reading Green Park railway station|Green Park station]] on the [[Reading–Basingstoke line|Reading to Basingstoke railway line]] were first mooted in the mid-2000s. Construction was approved in April 2015, with construction expected to start in October 2016, and an opening date in December 2018. However a subsequent delay to the planned electrification of the line beyond 2019 has raised fears that it may not be possible to provide a train service to the station on its opening, as the existing diesel trains lack sufficient acceleration to add an extra stop without reducing line capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-32516373 |title=Green Park railway station approved for Reading |work=News |publisher=BBC |date=30 April 2015 |accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/network-rail-attempt-green-park-12658687 |title=Network Rail attempt to get Green Park Station project back on track |work=getreading.co.uk |publisher=Trinity Mirror Southern |first=Nathan |last=Hyde |date=26 February 2017 |accessdate=2 May 2017 |archivedate=2 May 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502161039/http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/network-rail-attempt-green-park-12658687 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Cycle Route 23|Route 23]] of the [[National Cycle Network]] follows a traffic-free routing through the centre of Green Park, on its way from Reading to [[Basingstoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reading to Basingstoke |url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/reading20basingstoke.pdf |publisher=[[Sustrans]] |accessdate=26 April 2017 | archivedate=26 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426155113/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/reading20basingstoke.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Park wind turbine==
[[File:Pond &amp; Turbine, Green Park (geograph 4689804).jpg|thumb|Green Park wind turbine viewed from Lime Square]]
The most visible feature of Green Park is an [[Enercon]] E-70&lt;ref name="greenpark_e70"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-939697861.html |title=Green energy |date=1 November 2005

The blades are 33&amp;nbsp;m (108&amp;nbsp;ft) long, with a tower height of 85&amp;nbsp;m (279&amp;nbsp;ft). At a wind speed of 14&amp;nbsp;ms&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (31&amp;nbsp;mph) the machine generates 2.05&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity (less for lower wind speeds), which is enough to power around 1,500 homes. It is owned and operated by [[Ecotricity]] and was completed in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/our-green-electricity/from-the-wind/wind-parks-gallery/green-park-reading |title=Green Park, Reading - The most visible windmill in the world…? |publisher=[[Ecotricity]] |date=20 October 2012 |archivedate=20 October 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121020151131/http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/our-green-energy/our-green-electricity/from-the-wind/wind-parks-gallery/green-park-reading |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
Most of the facilities for Green Park are located on Lime Square, alongside the southern access road to the park and opposite the wind turbine. This offers a day nursery, ''Childbase'', for pre-school children, as well as a play area for children up to 10 years, ''The Mad House Play &amp; Party World''. There is also a [[Nuffield Health|Nuffield Health Fitness &amp; Wellbeing Centre]], a waterside brasserie called ''Zest at Lime Square'', an [[Asda|Asda Click &amp; Collect]], and a [[WH Smith]] store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities |title=Amenities in Green Park |publisher=Green Park |accessdate=26 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426123425/http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities |archivedate=26 April 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities/health-fitness |title=Health &amp; Fitness |publisher=Green Park |accessdate=26 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426123648/http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities/health-fitness |archivedate=26 April 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities/shopping |title=Shopping |publisher=Green Park |accessdate=26 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426123851/http://my.greenpark.co.uk/amenities/shopping |archivedate=26 April 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the opposite end of the park, 100 Longwater Avenue contains the ''Byte Café'' and is home to the ''Green Park Conference Centre'', which hosts meeting rooms and amenities for various sized meetings and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpark.co.uk/conference-centre/home |title=The Green Park Conference Centre |publisher=Mapletree |accessdate=23 April 2017 |archivedate=23 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423171651/http://www.greenpark.co.uk/conference-centre/home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==
The business park is adjacent to the [[Madejski Stadium]], home of [[Reading F.C.|Reading Football Club]] and the [[London Irish|London Irish rugby club]]. The UK's third largest annual running event, the [[Reading Half Marathon]] starts from within the business park, which provides the space needed for pre-race marshalling of the large numbers of competitors, and finishes in the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/reading-half-marathon-2015-how-8386169 |title=Reading Half Marathon 2015: How the course changeos for this year's run |first=Jennie |last=Slevin |work=getreading.co.uk |date=6 January 2015 |publisher=Trinity Mirror Southern | accessdate=14 January 2015 | archivedate=2 April 2015 | deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402180836/http://www.getreading.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/reading-half-marathon-2015-how-8386169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business park is also home to the annual Green Park Triathlon which encourages participants to 'Commit to get Fit' and raise money for [[Comic Relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenparktriathlon.co.uk/ |title=Green Park Triathlon |publisher=Green Park Triathlon |accessdate=23 April 2017 |archivedate=23 April 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423170952/http://www.greenparktriathlon.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Hilary McDonald Beckles''' [[Knight or Dame of St. Andrew (Barbados)|KA]] (born 11 August 1955) is a [[Barbados|Barbadian]] historian, he is the current [[vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI) and chairman of the [[CARICOM Reparations Committee]].

Educated at the [[University of Hull]] in England, Beckles began his academic career at UWI, and was granted a personal professorship at the age of 37, becoming the youngest in the university's history. He was named pro-vice-chancellor and chairman of UWI's Board for Undergraduate Studies in 1998, and in 2002 was named [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of the university's [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill]] campus. Although his focus has mainly been on [[Afro-Caribbean history]], especially the economic and social impacts of [[colonialism]] and the [[Atlantic slave trade]], Beckles has also had a longstanding involvement with [[Cricket in the West Indies|West Indian cricket]], and has previously served on the board of the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Beckles was born in Barbados, and began his secondary education at Coleridge and Parry Secondary School in [[Bridgetown]]. He was sent to England to complete his schooling, attending Pitmaston Secondary School and the [[Bournville College|Bournville College of Further Education]] in [[Birmingham]]. Beckles went on to the [[University of Hull]], completing a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA (Hons)]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] with the university's Department of Economic and Social History.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055057/http://aswadiaspora.org/candidates09/Beckles.pdf Curriculum vitae of Hilary Beckles] – Association for the Study of the Worldwide African Diaspora. Retrieved 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
Beckles joined the [[University of West Indies]] as a history lecturer at its campus in [[Mona, Jamaica|Mona]], [[Jamaica]], in 1979, but transferred to its [[Cave Hill campus]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/principal/biography.asp Office of the Principal: Biography] – University of the West Indies. Retrieved 3 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been named a senior research fellow at the [[London]]-based [[Institute of Commonwealth Studies]] in 1986, he was named Chairman of the History Department at UWI in 1992, a role he served in until 1996, and he subsequently served as dean of the Faculty of Humanities from 1994 to 1998.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt; Beckles received a personal professorship in 1993, the university's youngest appointment to the position.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; His work has covered a variety of areas within the broader topic of [[Afro-Caribbean history]], with works covering early slave rebellions in Barbados, the role of women in the slave trade, and the greater effects of [[colonialism]] on present Barbadian society. Other works have focused more specifically on [[History of Barbados|Barbadian history]], including education, telecommunications, the labour movement, and sporting culture.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

===Involvement with cricket===
Having authored several papers and essays on the role of cricket in British West Indian culture, Beckles was the driving force behind the establishment of the Centre for Cricket Research at the Cave Hill campus in 1994, which resulted in the refurbishment of the on-campus [[3Ws Oval]]. Two years later, in 1996, he convinced the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] (WICB) to organise a match between the touring New Zealanders and a team selected by the university's vice-chancellor.&lt;ref name="pelican"&gt;[http://sta.uwi.edu/pelican/archives/jj07/vcvpoint.asp VC Viewpoint: Symbols of the West Indian Spirit] – ''The Pelican''.

An '''international monetary system''' is a set of internationally agreed rules, conventions and supporting institutions that facilitate [[international trade]], [[Foreign direct investment|cross border investment]] and generally the [[redistribution (economics)|reallocation of capital]] between [[nation state]]s. It should provide means of payment acceptable to buyers and sellers of different nationalities, including deferred payment. To operate successfully, it needs to inspire confidence, to provide sufficient liquidity for fluctuating levels of trade, and to provide means by which global imbalances can be corrected. The system can grow organically as the collective result of numerous individual agreements between international economic factors spread over several decades. Alternatively, it can arise from a single architectural vision, as happened at [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] in 1944.

==Historical overview==
{{See also|Reserve currency}}
Throughout history, precious metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]] have been used for trade, sometimes in the form of [[bullion]], and from early history the coins of various issuers – generally kingdoms and empires – have been traded. The earliest known records of pre-coinage use of precious metals for monetary exchange are from Mesopotamia and Egypt,  dating from the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name = "money a history" &gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = British Museum Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early money took many forms, apart from bullion; for instance bronze [[spade money]] which became common in [[Zhou dynasty]] China in the late 7th century BC. At that time, forms of money were also developed in [[Lydia]] in [[Asia Minor]], from where its use spread to nearby Greek cities and later to many other places.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt;

Sometimes formal [[monetary system]]s have been imposed by regional rulers. For example, scholars have tentatively suggested that the Roman king [[Servius Tullius]] created a primitive monetary system in the early history of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Tullius reigned in the sixth century BC - several centuries before Rome is believed to have developed a formal coinage system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As with bullion, early use of coinage is believed to have been generally the preserve of the elite. But by about the 4th century BC coins were widely used in Greek cities. They were generally supported by the city state authorities, who endeavoured to ensure they retained their values regardless of fluctuations in the availability of whatever base or precious metals they were made from.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt; From Greece the use of coins spread slowly westwards throughout Europe, and eastwards to India. Coins were in use in India from about 400 BC; initially they played a greater role in religion than in trade, but by the 2nd century{{clarify|date=August 2018}} they had become central to commercial transactions.  Monetary systems that were developed in India were so successful that they spread through parts of Asia well into the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name = "money a history" /&gt;

As a variety of coins became common within a region, they were exchanged by [[moneychanger]]s, the predecessors of today's [[foreign exchange market]], as mentioned in the Biblical story of [[Jesus and the money changers]]. In Venice and the other Italian city states of the early Middle Ages, money changers would often have to struggle to perform calculations involving six or more currencies. This partly led to [[Fibonacci]] writing his [[Liber Abaci]] which popularised the use of [[Arabic numerals|Indo-Arabic numerals]], which displaced the more difficult Roman numerals then in use by western merchants.&lt;ref name="Ascent "&gt;

[[File:International money montage.jpg|thumb|left| Historic international currencies. From top left: crystalline [[gold]], a 5th-century BCE [[Persian daric]], an 8th-century English [[mancus]], and an 18th-century [[Spanish real]].]]
When a given nation or empire has achieved regional [[hegemony]], its currency has been a basis for international trade, and hence for a ''de facto'' monetary system. In the West – Europe and the Middle East – an early such coin was the [[Persian daric]]. This was succeeded by [[Roman currency]] of the [[Roman Empire]], such as the [[denarius]], then the [[Gold Dinar]] of the Ottoman Empire, and later – from the 16th to 20th centuries, during the [[Age of Imperialism]] – by the currency of European colonial powers: the [[Spanish dollar]], the [[Dutch guilder]], the [[French franc]] and the [[British pound sterling]]; at times one currency has been pre-eminent, at times no one dominated. With the growth of American power, the [[US dollar]] became the basis for the international monetary system, formalised in the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] agreement that established the post–World War II monetary order, with fixed exchange rates of other currencies to the dollar, and [[convertibility]] of the dollar into gold. The Bretton Woods system broke down, culminating in the [[Nixon shock]] of 1971, ending convertibility; but the US dollar has remained the ''de facto'' basis of the world monetary system, though no longer ''de jure''{{dubious|date=August 2018}}, with various European currencies and the [[Japanese yen]] also being prominent in foreign exchange markets. Since the formation of the [[Euro]], the Euro has also gained use as a [[reserve currency]] and a medium of transactions, though the dollar has remained the most important currency.

A dominant currency may be used directly or indirectly by other nations: for example, English kings minted the gold [[mancus]], presumably to function as dinars to exchange with [[Islamic Spain]]; colonial powers sometimes minted coins that resembled those already used in a distant territory; and more recently, a number of nations have used the US dollar as their local currency, a custom called [[dollarization]].

Until the 19th century, the global monetary system was loosely linked at best, with Europe, the Americas, India and China (among others) having largely separate economies, and hence monetary systems were regional. [[European colonization of the Americas]], starting with the Spanish empire, led to the integration of American and European economies and monetary systems, and European colonization of Asia led to the dominance of European currencies, notably the British pound sterling in the 19th century, succeeded by the US dollar in the 20th century. Some, such as [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], foresee the decline of a single base for the global monetary system, and the emergence instead of regional [[trade bloc]]s; he cites the emergence of the Euro as an example. See also [[Global financial system]]s, [[world-systems approach]] and [[polarity in international relations]]. It was in the later half of the 19th century that a monetary system with close to universal global participation emerged, based on the gold standard.

==History of modern global monetary orders==

===The pre WWI financial order: 1816–1919===
{{Main|Gold Standard#Establishment of the international gold standard}}

[[File:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|The [[gold standard]] widely adopted in this era rested on the conversion of paper notes into pre-set quantities of gold.]]
From the 1816 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the world benefited from a well-integrated financial order, sometimes known as the "first age of globalisation".&lt;ref name = "GPE"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally also called the ''golden age of capitalism'' in older sources,  and also the ''first golden age of capitalism'' in later sources that recognise golden age that spanned approx 1951–73. A few economists such as [[Barry Eichengreen]] date the ''first age of globalisation'' as starting in the early 1860s with the laying of the first transatlantic cables between Great Britain and the USA.&lt;/ref&gt;
There were monetary unions which enabled member countries to accept each others' currencies as legal tender. Such unions included the [[Latin Monetary Union]] (Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, France) and the [[Scandinavian monetary union]] (Denmark, Norway and Sweden). In the absence of shared membership of a union, transactions were facilitated by widespread participation in the [[gold standard]], by both independent nations and their colonies. Great Britain was at the time the world's pre-eminent financial, imperial, and industrial power, ruling more of the world and exporting more capital as a percentage of her national income than any other creditor nation has since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

While capital controls comparable to the Bretton Woods system were not in place, damaging capital flows were far less common than they were to be in the post 1971 era. In fact Great Britain's capital exports helped to correct global imbalances as they tended to be counter-cyclical, rising when Britain's economy went into recession, thus compensating other states for income lost from export of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Accordingly, this era saw mostly steady growth and a relatively low level of financial crises. In contrast to the Bretton Woods system, the pre–World War I financial order was not created at a single high level conference; rather it evolved organically in a series of discrete steps. The [[Gilded Age]], a time of especially rapid development in North America, falls into this period.

===Between the World Wars: 1919–1939===
[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|left|This era saw periods of worldwide economic hardship. The image is [[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''[[Migrant Mother]]'' depiction of destitute [[pea-pickers]] in [[California]], taken in March 1936.]]
The years between the world wars have been described as a period of "de-globalisation", as both international trade and capital flows shrank compared to the period before World War I. During World War I, countries had abandoned the gold standard. Except for the United States, they later returned to it only briefly. By the early 1930s, the prevailing order was essentially a fragmented system of floating exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
In this era, the experience of Great Britain and others was that the gold standard ran counter to the need to retain domestic policy autonomy. To protect their reserves of gold, countries would sometimes need to raise interest rates and generally follow a deflationary policy. The greatest need for this could arise in a downturn, just when leaders would have preferred to lower rates to encourage growth. Economist Nicholas Davenport

had even argued that the wish to return Britain to the gold standard "sprang from a sadistic desire by the Bankers to inflict pain on the British working class."

By the end of World War I, Great Britain was heavily indebted to the United States, allowing the USA to largely displace it as the world's foremost financial power. The United States, however, was reluctant to assume Great Britain's leadership role, partly due to isolationist influences and a focus on domestic concerns. In contrast to Great Britain in the previous era, capital exports from the US were not countercyclical. They expanded rapidly with the United States' economic growth in the 1920s until 1928, but then almost completely halted as the US economy began slowing in that year. As the [[Great Depression]] intensified in 1930, financial institutions were hit hard along with trade; in 1930 alone, 1345 US banks collapsed.

During the 1930s, the United States raised trade barriers, refused to act as an international [[lender of last resort]], and refused calls to cancel war debts, all of which further aggravated economic hardship for other countries. According to economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], another factor contributing to the turbulent economic performance of this era was the insistence of French premier [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] that Germany pay [[World War I reparations|war reparations]] at too high a level, which Keynes described in his book [[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]].

===The Bretton Woods Era: 1944–1973===
{{Main|Bretton Woods system}}
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Harry Dexter White]] (left) and [[John Maynard Keynes]] (right) at [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]]]]

British and American policy makers began to plan the post-war international monetary system in the early 1940s. The objective was to create an order that combined the benefits of an integrated and relatively liberal international system with the freedom for governments to pursue domestic policies aimed at promoting full employment and social wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher =Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The principal architects of the new system, John Maynard Keynes and [[Harry Dexter White]], created a plan which was endorsed by the 42 countries attending the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods conference]], formally known as the [[United Nations]] Monetary and Financial Conference. The plan involved nations agreeing to a system of fixed but adjustable{{clarify|date=August 2018}} exchange rates so that the currencies were pegged against the dollar, with the dollar itself convertible into gold. So in effect this was a gold – dollar exchange standard. There were a number of improvements on the old gold standard. Two international institutions, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] were created. A key part of their function was to replace private finance as a more reliable source of lending for investment projects in developing states. At the time the soon to be defeated powers of Germany and Japan were envisaged as states soon to be in need of such development, and there was a desire from both the US and Britain not to see the defeated powers saddled with punitive sanctions that would inflict lasting pain on future generations. The new exchange rate system allowed countries facing economic hardship to devalue their currencies by up to 10% against the dollar (more if approved by the IMF) – thus they would not be forced to undergo deflation to stay in the gold standard. A system of capital controls was introduced to protect countries from the damaging effects of capital flight and to allow countries to pursue independent macro economic policies
&lt;ref&gt;According to Keynes: "In my view the whole management of the domestic economy depends on being free to have the appropriate rate of interest without reference to rates prevailing elsewhere in the world. Capital control is a corollary to this"
&lt;/ref&gt;
while still welcoming flows intended for productive investment. Keynes had argued against the dollar having such a central role in the monetary system, and suggested an international currency called [[bancor]] be used instead, but he was overruled by the Americans. Towards the end of the Bretton Woods era, the central role of the dollar became a problem as international demand eventually forced the US to run a persistent trade deficit, which undermined confidence in the dollar. This, together with the emergence of a parallel market for gold in which the price soared above the official US mandated price, led to speculators running down the US gold reserves. Even when convertibility was restricted to nations only, some, notably France,&lt;ref name = "Copeland"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued building up hoards of gold at the expense of the US. Eventually these pressures caused [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] to end all convertibility into gold on 15 August 1973. This event marked the effective end of the Bretton Woods system; attempts were made to find other mechanisms to preserve the fixed exchange rates over the next few years, but they were not successful, resulting in a system of floating exchange rates.&lt;ref name = "Copeland"/&gt;

===The post Bretton Woods system: 1973– present===
{{Main|Washington Consensus}}
[[File:NYC NYSE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The current era has seen huge and turbulent flows of capital between nations.]]

An alternative name for the post Bretton Woods system is the '''Washington Consensus'''. While the name was coined in 1989, the associated economic system came into effect years earlier: according to economic historian [[Robert Skidelsky|Lord Skidelsky]] the ''Washington Consensus'' is generally seen as spanning 1980–2009 (the latter half of the 1970s being a transitional period).&lt;ref name = "return"&gt;

The transition away from Bretton Woods was marked by a [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|switch]] from a state led to a market led system.&lt;ref name="GPE"/&gt; The  Bretton Wood system is considered by economic historians to have broken down in the 1970s:&lt;ref name = "return"/&gt; crucial events being [[Richard Nixon#Economy|Nixon suspending the dollar's convertibility into gold]] in 1973, the United States' abandonment of capital controls in 1974, and the UK's ending of capital controls in 1979 which was swiftly copied by most other major economies.

In some parts of the developing world, liberalisation brought significant benefits for large sections of the population – most prominently with [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Economic reforms in China|reforms in China]] since 1978 and the liberalisation of India after its [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 crisis]].

Generally the industrial nations experienced much slower growth and higher unemployment than in the previous era, and according to Professor Gordon Fletcher in retrospect the 1950s and 60s when the Bretton Woods system was operating came to be seen as a [[Golden Age of Capitalism|golden age]].

Financial crises have been more intense and have increased in frequency by about 300% – with the damaging effects prior to 2008 being chiefly felt in the emerging economies. On the positive side, at least until 2008 investors have frequently achieved very high rates of return, with salaries and bonuses in the financial sector reaching record levels.

From 2004, economists such as Michael P. Dooley, Peter M. Garber, and David Folkerts-Landau began writing papers describing the emergence of a new international system involving an interdependency between states with generally high savings in Asia lending and exporting to western states with generally high spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael P. |last=Dooley |first2=David |last2=Folkerts‐Landau |first3=Peter |last3=Garber |title=The Revived Bretton Woods System |journal=International Journal of Finance and Economics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=307–313 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/ijfe.250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the original ''Bretton Woods'', this included Asian currencies being pegged to the dollar, though this time by the unilateral intervention of Asian governments in the currency market to stop their currencies appreciating. The developing world as a whole stopped running current account deficits in 1999

– widely seen as a response to unsympathetic treatment following the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. The most striking example of east-west interdependency is the relationship between China and America, which [[Niall Ferguson]] calls [[Chimerica]]. From 2004, This supposed "New Bretton Woods",&lt;ref&gt;*[[Robert Brenner]], "What is Good for Goldman Sachs is Good for America The Origins of the Present Crisis" (October 2, 2009).

Dialynas and Marshall Auerback, PIMCO&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since at least 2007 those authors have also called for a new ''de jure'' system: for key international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to be revamped to meet the demands of the current age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/13197.html

|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and between 2008 and mid-2009 the term ''New Bretton Woods'' was increasingly used in the latter sense. By late 2009, with less emphases on structural reform to the international monetary system and more attention being paid to issues such as [[Balance of payments|re-balancing]] the world economy.

Since 2011, [[Sanjeev Sanyal]], a colleague of Dooley, Garber and Folkerts-Landau has taken the framework a step further to argue that periods of global economic expansions are almost always underpinned by symbiotic imbalances. Such imbalances cause distortions but are an inevitable part of expanding economic ecosystems. Thus, he argues that the next round of economic growth will again be underpinned by a return to global imbalances, probably with China supplying capital and the US again running deficits to absorb it. He names this relationship Bretton Woods III.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/global-economy-imbalances-by-sanjeev-sanyal-2014-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls for a "New Bretton Woods"==
[[File:Cumbre de Washington.jpg|thumb|250px|G-20 leaders at [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy]].]]
Leading financial journalist [[Martin Wolf]] has reported that all financial crises since 1971 have been preceded by large [[Capital account|capital inflows]] into affected regions. While ever since the seventies there have been numerous calls from the [[global justice movement]] for a revamped international system to tackle the problem of unfettered capital flows, it was not until late 2008 that this idea began to receive substantial support from leading politicians. On September 26, 2008, [[Nicolas Sarkozy|French President Nicolas Sarkozy]], then also the [[President of the European Union]], said, "We must rethink the financial system from scratch, as at Bretton Woods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

said world leaders must meet to agree to a new economic system: {{cquote| We must have a new Bretton Woods, building a new international financial architecture for the years ahead. }}
However, Brown's approach was quite different from the original [[Bretton Woods system]], emphasising the continuation of [[globalization]] and [[free trade]] as opposed to a return to fixed exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

March 2009 saw Gordon Brown continuing to advocate for reform and the granting of extended powers to international financial institutions like the IMF at the April G20 summit in London,

Also during March 2009, in a speech entitled ''Reform the International Monetary System'', [[Zhou Xiaochuan]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's [[bancor]]. Dr Zhou said that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies as a result of the [[Triffin dilemma]] – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their domestic monetary policy goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Dr Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2009 article published in [[Foreign Affairs]] magazine, economist [[C. Fred Bergsten]] argued that Dr Zhou's suggestion or a similar change to the international monetary system would be in  the United States' best interests as well as the rest of the world's.&lt;ref name = "Bersten"&gt;{{cite web

Leaders meeting in April at the [[2009 G-20 London summit]] agreed to allow $250 Billion of SDRs to be created by the IMF, to be distributed to all IMF members according to each countries voting rights.  In the aftermath of the  summit, Gordon Brown declared "the Washington Consensus is over".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Prime-Minister-Gordon-Brown-G20-Will-Pump-One-Trillion-Dollars-Into-World-Economy/Article/200904115254629| title=Prime Minister Gordon Brown: G20 Will Pump Trillion Dollars Into World Economy| date=2 April 2009| publisher=''[[Sky News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in a [[Keynes: The Return of the Master|book]] published during September 2009, Professor [[Robert Skidelsky]], an international expert on [[Keynesianism]], argued it was still too early to say whether a new international monetary system was emerging.&lt;ref name = "return"/&gt;

On Jan 27, in his opening address to the [[World Economic Forum|2010 World Economic Forum]] in Davos,  President Sarkozy repeated his call for a new Bretton Woods, and was met by wild applause by a sizeable proportion of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the [[Bank of England]] published a paper arguing for reform, saying that the current International monetary system has performed poorly compared to the ''Bretton Woods system''. 
&lt;ref name = "COEDec2011"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 in an ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' op-ed, Harvard University professor and director of the [[Committee on Capital Markets Regulation]] [[Hal S. Scott]] called for a global response to the [[European sovereign debt crisis|Euro-zone crisis]]. He wrote that two failures to address European problems around German power had led to world wars in the 20th century and that the current crisis was also beyond the capacity of Europe, with Germany again at the center, to solve on their own. Accepting that leadership transitions were underway in both China and America, Scott called on all concerned—with Japan included with China and America—to begin organizing a global restructuring through the [[International Monetary Fund]] with possibly a Bretton Woods II conference as part of the process.

  |accessdate=2012-08-16}}  
&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[MarketWatch]]'' commentator Darrell Delamaide endorsed Scott's idea but concluded "unfortunately it’s not likely to happen". He added first the example of the failure of Europe to address successfully the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] without outside assistance as a reason for his endorsement. But he found U.S. presidential and Treasury Department leadership and IMF leadership dramatically lacking in the capacity to mount an initiative such as Scott proposed.

{{Nihongo|'''Jiro Okabe'''|岡部 次郎|Okabe Jirō|September 30, 1864 – July 8, 1925}}&lt;ref&gt;『官報』第3864号、大正14年7月10日&lt;/ref&gt; was a member of the Japanese [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]]. He was a member of the [[Rikken Seiyūkai]], the [[Chūseikai]], and the [[Kenseikai]].

== Early life ==
Okabe was born in Kasuga-mura, Shinano Province (present-day [[Saku, Nagano]]) on September 30, 1864. He was the second son of Yamon Okabe.&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;『信濃人物略誌』p.53-54&lt;/ref&gt; After attending Ueda Middle School (now called [[Ueda High School]]), Okabe studied English at [[Dōjinsha]] in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="ge"&gt;『現代日本の政治家』p.22-23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 he followed [[Takahashi Korekiyo|Korekiyo Takahashi]] to America. While living in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] in 1889, he converted to [[Christianity]]. He then moved to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] with [[Harvey Saburo Hayashi]] in the same year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1018365873|title=Hawai no Nihongo shinbun zasshi jiten: 1892-2000|last=1950-|first=Suzuki, Kei,|last2=1950-|first2=鈴木啓,|isbn=9784783899600|edition=Shohan|location=Shizuoka-shi|oclc=1018365873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hawaii ==
In Hawaii, Okabe was ordained on July 20, 1890, and started the first Japanese church in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], the Church of the Holy Cross, on January 18, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1891|title=The Japanese Mission|url=|journal=28th Annual Report of the Board of the Hawaiian Evangelical Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to Honolulu in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://holycrosshilo.com/history/|title=History|date=2012-03-07|work=Church of the Holy Cross|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after transferring to Honolulu, he returned to Japan to recruit more Japanese missionaries, including [[Takie Okumura]] and [[Shiro Sokabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26853950|title=Japanese American history : an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present|date=1993|publisher=Facts on File|others=Niiya, Brian., Japanese American National Museum (Los Angeles, Calif.)|isbn=0816026807|location=New York|oclc=26853950}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also inherited the "Hawai Shinbun", a Japanese-language newspaper, from [[Jukichi Uchida]] in 1894, but quickly transferred it to [[Kenichiro Hoshida]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], Okabe was on the side of the anti-monarchists. He joined the Citizens' Guard and worked to quell riots, fearing that the bad reputation of [[Japanese in Hawaii|Japanese immigrants]] at the time would grow worse if they rioted. Once the riots were calmed, the royalists within the Japanese community didn't trust Okabe, and he left Hawaii in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956481890|title=Takie Okumura : a life lived in service to Japanese in Hawaii|last=Nakagawa|first=Fusa|publisher=Ozorasha|others=Reddington, Kenneth Paul (translator)|year=|isbn=9784283013148|edition= First|location=Tokyo|pages=|oclc=956481890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his time in Hawaii, he returned to the American mainland and attended the [[University of California]]. After graduation, he earned a doctorate at the [[University of Chicago]]. He also studied abroad at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Heidelberg University]], and the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref name="ge" /&gt;

== Japan ==
In 1899 Okabe returned to Japan and worked as a translator for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. After that he helped [[Itō Hirobumi|Hirobumi Ito]] and [[Watanabe Kunitake|Kunitake Watanabe]] form the [[Rikken Seiyūkai]].&lt;ref name="me"&gt;『新代議士名鑑』p.199&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the head writer of the [[Hokkai Times]]. When the [[Russo-Japanese War]] started Okabe worked as the director of foreign correspondents. After the war Okabe became the head of [[Yingkou|Yingkou's]] military government's diplomacy, resident affairs, and administrative divisions in quick succession.&lt;ref name="da"&gt;『代議士詳覧』p.327&lt;/ref&gt;

Okabe was elected to office during the [[Japanese general election, 1912|Japanese General Election, 1912]]. He was re-elected four times.&lt;ref name="da"&gt;『代議士詳覧』p.327&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on July 8, 1925. On the previous day he had been awarded the title [[List of Japanese court ranks, positions and hereditary titles|Jushi-i]].&lt;ref&gt;『官報』第3863号「叙任及辞令」1925年7月9日。&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served briefly as a member of the [[Japanese House of Councillors|House of Councillors]] in the [[Diet of Japan]]. His real name was Ōhashi Katsumi (大橋 克巳).&lt;ref&gt;[http://secondlife.yahoo.co.jp/life/master/profile/b101okyos.html profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205042553/http://secondlife.yahoo.co.jp/life/master/profile/b101okyos.html |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==
As a founder of Loretto Companies, Lamar Hunt Jr. has four distinct ventures, all dedicated to serving the Kansas City community in various ways. The Loretto Companies were named for the staircase at [[Loretto Chapel]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].

Like that visiting architect, the mission of the Loretto Companies is not recognition or recompense but to help others for the sake of helping them.

Lee was the amateur and beat the player Chrh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=38559&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, Lee made his debut as a pro gamer by winning three KPGA tours in three consecutive seasons all in a year's time. When the KPGA tour became the [[MBCGame StarCraft League]], the KPGA tours were deemed equal to MSL wins, resulting in Lee being granted the golden badge, an award for winning three MSLs. Lee topped his KPGA Tour wins with a victory in the Panasonic OnGameNet Starleague. Afterwards Lee went into a slump; though he continued to be a strong player and came in second or first place in various leagues and tournaments, Lee did not win an MSL or OSL until the IOPS Ongamenet Starleague in 2004 or 2005. However, not long afterwards, Lee would enter the darkest period in his career. On 18 July 2005, FiFo reported that Lee's father had been killed in an automobile accident when an intoxicated driver performed an illegal U-turn and collided with his father's vehicle.&lt;ref name="teamliquid.net"&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/blogs/viewblog.php?topic_id=65799&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lee eventually returned to pro-gaming he began his return to the top. In December 2007, Lee was once again the number one-ranked pro gamer in the KeSPA rankings. It had been a full two years and five months since he had stopped performing in July 2004. Lee's comeback culminated in his victory in the 2006 2nd ShinHan Bank OnGameNet StarLeague. In his winner's interview, Lee dedicated his victory to his father, saying "Yes, it is my first time winning the finals with my mother seated as the audience. But, for this very victory, I give it all to my father, though he didn't make it. From now on, I will do my best for my mother."&lt;ref name="teamliquid.net"/&gt; This victory not only marked a successful comeback performance, but also was Lee's third OSL win, him becoming the first player in history to earn the OSL's Golden Mouse trophy and was Lee's sixth major title win, making him the then most accomplished ''Brood War'' player in the game's history.

In 2007, Lee signed a three-year contract with [[WeMade FOX]] for approximately 690,000 [[United States dollars|USD]].&lt;ref name="fans"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Donald |title=Sex, Fame and PC Baangs: How the Orient plays host to PC gaming’s strangest culture |work=PC Gamer UK |date=2005-04-01 |url=http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284 |accessdate=2006-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202060802/http://rossignol.cream.org/?p=284 |archivedate= 2 February 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his contract with the organization expired in 2010, Lee announced his intentions to fully switch to ''StarCraft II''. Only after his retirement from ''Brood War'' was he equaled by [[Lee Young-Ho|Lee "Flash" Young-Ho]] for the most achievements in StarCraft: Broodwar. He joined the Korean team and gamer house of Old Generations and quickly became one of the strongest names in the ''StarCraft II'' scene, competing in the [[GOMTV Global StarCraft II League]] Season 2. There he advanced to the round of 8 before being defeated by [[Lim Yo-Hwan|Lim "BoxeR" Yo-Hwan]]. The following season Lee made it to round of 8 again, but was defeated by Lee "MarineKingPrime.WE" Jung-Hoon, losing 3 to 0.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=185712&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2010|10|31}} On July 15, 2011, [[SK Gaming]] announced a joint partnership with Old Generations, allowing for Lee and his teammate, [[Jang Min Chul|Jang "MC" Min Chul]], to be sponsored for international events on behalf of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/33952-SK_acquires_MC_and_NaDa_in_oGs_deal|title=SK acquires MC and NaDa in oGs deal|date=2011-07-15|last=Shields|first=Duncan|publisher=[[SK Gaming]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership between Old Generations and SK Gaming ended on January 13, 2012, with Lee remaining with the former, while Jang remained with the latter until his contract expired at the end of January. On the 16th of February, Lee signed with American gaming team compLexity Gaming, wanting to participate in more ''StarCraft II'' events outside of Korea before leaving gaming to fulfill his mandatory South Korean Military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=compLexity Welcomes NaDa|url=http://www.complexitygaming.com/news/3383/|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced that on November 20, 2011, Lee would be fulfilling his dream of becoming a [[CEO]] by opening up his own e-store, the NaDa Mall, which sells pro-gaming equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=286826 NaDa opens online store.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee became married on November 9, 2015 at the ''[[Legacy of the Void]]'' launch party held at [[World Trade Center Seoul|COEX]] in Seoul. Fans were invited to purchase a Collector's Edition of the expansion pack and following the wedding ceremony showmatches were held to showcase the new expansion. The video was also live-streamed on [[TwitchTV]] and [[Afreeca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Blizzard Held a StarCraft Wedding in South Korea|url = http://kotaku.com/blizzard-held-a-starcraft-wedding-in-south-korea-1741408137|first=Brian |last=Ashcraft|website=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=November 9, 2015|date=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leonardo Julio Farkas Klein''' (born March 20, 1967) is a [[Chile]]an [[businessman]] and [[philanthropist]].

== Early years ==
Farkas's parents were [[Hungarian Jews]] who emigrated from [[Transylvania]] to South America in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Barrionuevo, Alexei. "Mine Owner's Flair Rankles Chilean Elite". The New York Times. November 19, 2010.  Accessed on 02/17/11 at: https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/world/americas/20chile.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;src=ISMR_AP_LO_MST_FB.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas studied commercial engineering at the [[University of Santiago, Chile]]. In the 1980s, he emigrated to the [[United States]] and made a living working in show business as a piano player while traveling throughout the country. He also worked in several Caribbean cruising companies until the death of his father. Farkas then returned to [[Chile]] to manage the family business. He has stakes in several industries, the [[mining]] sector being the most important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/20/world/americas/20chile.html | work=The New York Times | first=Alexei | last=Barrionuevo | title=Farkas's Flair Rankles Chilean Elite - The Saturday Profile | date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consideration of presidential candidacy ==

In October 2008 Farkas announced that he was considering being an independent candidate for the [[Chilean presidential election, 2009|presidential election of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valparaisotimes.cl/content/view/452/25/ |title=The Valparaiso Times - Valparaiso and Viï¿½a del Mar News - Chile News - CHILE’S LONGSHOT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GREETED AS HERO |publisher=Valparaisotimes.cl |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he declined to comment on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208170746/http://www.santiagotimes.cl/santiagotimes/index.php/2008111015071/news/editorial-opinion/leonardo-farkas-chile-s-next-president.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=December 2016}} However, on December 5,  he announced he would not be running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=333957 |title=Leonardo Farkas: No seré candidato a la presidencia |publisher=Emol.com |language=Spanish |trans-title=Leonardo Farkas: I will not be a candidate for presidency |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Farkas is widely known in Chile by his appearances in the [[Teletón (Chile)|Teletón]] (Chilean telethon), a fundraising campaign for handicapped children. Farkas donated hundreds of millions of [[Chilean peso|pesos]], and in 2008, donated 1 billion [[Chilean peso|pesos]] (approx. US$2 million), becoming the first individual to donate such amount of money to this campaign (matched hours later by [[José Luis Nazar]] during the same event).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=333089 |title=Teletón finalmente cumple la meta en el Nacional (minuto a minuto) |language=Spanish |trans-title=Teletón finally accomplishes the goal in the National Stadium (minute to minute) |publisher=Emol.com |date=2008-11-29 |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas has been very critical of the Chilean [[upper class]], stating that “they’re usually very stingy and [[elitist]]” and don’t do enough to mitigate Chile’s social problems. He has also said that if elected president “all Chileans would have their own house”.&lt;ref name="elpais1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/fenomeno/Farkas/seduce/Chile/elpepuintlat/20081120elpepuint_6/Tes |title=El "fenómeno Farkas" seduce a Chile · ELPAÍS.com |language=Spanish |trans-title=The "phenomenon Farkas" seduces Chile · ELPAÍS.com |publisher=Elpais.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric of appealing to the masses of poor people has gained him substantial support among that social group and some harsh criticism from his business peers and local politicians, often labeling him as a “[[Populism|populist]]” in search of some spotlight.&lt;ref name="elpais1"/&gt;

During the rescue operation in Copiapó, Chile of the [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|trapped miners]], Farkas donated $10,000 to each of the 33 rescued men. Farkas reportedly gave checks in the miners' names to each of the families and set up a separate fund to collect donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39677491/ns/world_news-americas/ Showers of offers for Chile miners], MSNBC.com&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2011, Farkas was given an award by the [[Viña del Mar]] Mayor for  his contributions to the city.&lt;ref&gt;https://eventosdeportivos2011.wordpress.com/2011/06/07/visita-de-leonardo-farkas-a-vina-del-mar/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On February 7, 2018, Farkas offered a reward of 10 million Chilean pesos for anyone who found Emmelyn Catalina Cañales Vidal, an 11-year-old girl who was kidnapped in Licantén, Chile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t13.cl/noticia/nacional/leonardo-farkas-ofrece-recompensa-quien-encuentre-emmelyn&lt;/ref&gt;

Farkas is also known as a patron of many other charities, including the [[March of the Living]] an annual educational program which brings students from all over the world to Poland, to study the history of the Holocaust and examine the roots of prejudice, intolerance and hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motl.org/?p=2503 | title=March of the Living expresses its gratitude to Leonardo Farkas of Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study, coordinated by Magdalena Aninat, director of the ''Centro de Filantropía e Inversiones Sociales'' (Cefis) of the ''[[Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez|Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez (UAI)]]'', which investigated the philanthropy and social investments of Chilean companies, concluded that "Farkas is an actor that it is pushing others and acting as a 'role of conscience.' It has a very interesting role to make visible a more American model of the success of the business world, where that success closes with returning the hand to society. In Chile we are not used to making donations visible, but Farkas is constantly challenging the business world to be present and that is positive," said the UAI academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/Economia/2017/11/30/885409/Filantropia-en-Chile-Por-que-y-donde-aportan-dinero-las-grandes-empresas.html|title=Filantropía en Chile: ¿Por qué y dónde aportan dinero las grandes empresas? |language=Spanish |publisher=Emol.com |date=2017-11-30 |accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
In 2014,  with the support of Leonardo Farkas,  [[March of the Living]] marked the 70th anniversary of the destruction of Hungarian Jewry at the hands of the Nazis in 1944 during World War II. On [[Holocaust Remembrance Day]], at the close of the memorial ceremony on the actual grounds of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], a number of Holocaust survivors - many whose relatives perished in the infamous death camp -  joined Leonardo Farkas in the writing of the last letters of a [[Torah]]. The [[Torah]] was donated to the [[March of the Living]] by Mr. Farkas, whose philanthropy also enabled students and survivors to take part in the [[March of the Living]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=YouTube - Leonardo Farkas|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKXKWIIN6Ng|title=March of the Living Tribute to Leonardo Farkas=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Leonardo donated the seven newly written [[Sefer Torah]] sent to six different continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. Farkas has a great passion for dedicating "Happy Torahs", as he refers to them, which will be used in places with a great need. Over the years, he donated many [[Sefer Torah]]s to the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|hassidic]] [[Jewish]] organization and other institutions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/2518056/jewish/Seven-Torahs-to-Six-Continents-Thanks-to-One-Chilean-Businessman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marmont675.jpg|thumb|Marc Van Montagu.]]

'''Marc Van Montagu''' (born 10 November 1933 in [[Ghent]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]]. He was full professor and director of the Laboratory of Genetics at the faculty of Sciences at [[Ghent University]] ([[Belgium]]) and scientific director of the Genetics Department of the [[Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie|Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology]] (VIB). Together with [[Jozef Schell]] he founded the biotech company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] Inc. (Belgium) in 1982, of which he was Scientific Director and member of the board of Directors. Van Montagu was also involved in founding the biotech company [[CropDesign]], of which he was a Board member from 1998 to 2004. He is president of the Public Research and Regulation Initiative (PRRI).

Van Montagu and his colleagues were credited with the discovery of the [[Ti plasmid]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaenen I, Van Larebeke N, Teuchy H, Van Montagu M, Schell J. 1974. Supercoiled circular DNA in crown gall inducing Agrobacterium strains. J. Mol. Biol. 86:109-27&lt;/ref&gt; They described the gene transfer mechanism between ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter ''Agrobacterium'' into an efficient delivery system for gene engineering and to create [[transgenic plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-103906 |title=It is a Long Way to GM Agriculture |year=2011 |last1=Van Montagu |first1=Marc |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=62 |pages=1–23 |pmid=21314429}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed plant [[molecular genetics]], in particular molecular mechanisms for cell proliferation and differentiation and response to [[abiotic]] stresses (high light, [[ozone]], [[cold]], [[salt]] and [[drought]]) and constructed transgenic crops ([[tobacco]], [[Rapeseed|rape seed]], [[maize|corn]]) resistant to [[Pest (organism)|insect pest]] and tolerant to novel [[herbicide]]s. His work with [[Populus|poplar]] trees resulted in engineering of trees with improved [[pulping]] qualities.

After his retirement as director of the Laboratory of Genetics at Ghent University, Marc Van Montagu created IPBO - International Plant Biotechnology Outreach, VIB-Ghent University, with the mission to foster biotechnological solutions to global agriculture. In 2015 IPBO launched the “Marc and Nora Van Montagu (MNVM) Fund” with focus on sustainable agriculture and agro-industry to the African continent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

[[File:Mick Beddoes 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Mick Beddoes]]
'''Mick Malcolm Millis Beddoes''', widely known as '''Mick Beddoes''', is a Fijian politician and businessman from [[Nadi]], who led the [[United Peoples Party (Fiji)|United Peoples Party]] (formerly the '''United General Party''') from 2000 to 2013, and was the [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]] at the time of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006.  He was also the Chief Executive of the [[World Netball Company]], and was Chairman of the organising committee for the 2007 [[World Netball Championships]], but announced his resignation on 24 January 2006, citing a possible conflict of interest, as his company would be working as a ground operator during the championships.

== First term as Leader of the Opposition ==

Beddoes won the [[West Central (General Electors Communal Constituency, Fiji)|West Central]] [[General electors|General Electors]] [[Communal constituencies|Communal constituency]], one of three reserved for ethnic minorities, for the United General Party in the 2001 [[Fijian general election, 2001|parliamentary election]].  Despite being the sole [[House of Representatives of Fiji|parliamentary]] representative of his [[List of political parties in Fiji|party]], he served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2002 to 2004, because [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], leader of the [[Fiji Labour Party]] (the main opposition party) refused the position, demanding inclusion in the [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] instead.  Beddoes relinquished the role of Opposition Leader late in 2004, when Chaudhry finally gave up his quest for a Cabinet role and agreed to assume the leadership of the Opposition.

Beddoes's first stint as Opposition Leader gave him and his tiny party a national platform.  In mid-2003, Beddoes responded to rising interest among [[Fijians|indigenous]] and [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-]] Fijians by announcing that membership of his party, which had been confined to [[General electors|minority groups]] like Europeans, Chinese, and [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], would now be open to all races, and that the party would contest all 71 seats in the House of Representatives in the next [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]], scheduled for 2006.

Beddoes criticised the ethnic faultlines that characterise Fijian politics; communal voting was a factor in this, he said on 28 August 2005, but could be mitigated if only voters would judge a candidate according to his or her personal merits, rather than on the basis of whether the candidate's political party was [[Fijians|indigenous]]-led or [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]]-led.  He also called for changes to the electoral system, under which almost two-thirds of the House of Representatives are elected from [[communal constituencies]], whose electors are registered members of a particular ethnic group.

== Second term as Leader of the Opposition ==
Beddoes retained his constituency, with a slightly reduced majority, in the [[Fijian general election, 2006|parliamentary election]] held on 6–13 May 2006, and was appointed Leader of the Opposition for the second time on 3 June &lt;small&gt;([http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0606/S00088.htm source]).&lt;/small&gt; His second appointment came after weeks of disputes with his erstwhile ally, Mahendra Chaudhry, who had insisted that the position should be his, despite the decision of the Labour Party to enter a [[grand coalition]] with the [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] Party (SDL).  After obtaining legal advice, [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] appointed Beddoes.

As of 19 September, Beddoes was still performing his duties only on a part-time basis, [[Fiji Television]] reported.  To assume the position full-time, he would be [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutionally]] required to divest himself of his private business interests.

== Campaign against controversial bill ==
Throughout much of 2005, Beddoes was at the forefront of a public campaign against the government's controversial [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]], which provided for the establishment of a Commission empowered to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|coup d'état]] which deposed the [[People's Coalition (Fiji)|People's Coalition]] government in May 2000.  Beddoes travelled throughout Fiji, speaking against the bill, which was, he claimed, nothing other than a legal mechanism for releasing from prison persons convicted of involvement in the coup, who were supporters of or in some way linked to the present government. The bill was temporarily shelved during the election and its aftermath.  An amended version was pending, but the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006 put an end to it.

== 2006 coup d'état ==
{{Main|2006 Fijian coup d'état}}

Long considered an ally of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]] in their long-running dispute with the Qarase government, Beddoes began criticising the Military towards the end of 2006, as tensions escalated to unprecedented levels.  On 20 October, [[Fiji Television]] quoted him as calling for an end to the Military's attempts to intimidate the government. On the other hand, he called on the government on 28 November to placate the Military by dropping investigations into insubordination on the part of the Commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]]. ''"All it is doing is putting a red rag in front of a bull and the bull has 4,000 guns,"'' he told Australia's [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]]. On 1 December, as it became apparent that a coup was imminent, he branded the Military a bunch of bullies, and issued a strong warning to persons who might be considering accepting office in an interim government, saying that they would be taken to task when the storm had passed. On 4 December, Beddoes called on Fijians to rally in support of the rule of law.

Beddoes condemned the coup of 5 December, and spoke out strongly against what he saw as violations of constitutional and human rights.

Beddoes welcomed the decision of the Military to restore [[Ratu]] [[Josefa Iloilo]] to the [[President of Fiji|Presidency]] on 4 January 2007, but condemned the appointment of Bainimarama as interim [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] on 5 January and criticised the President's endorsement of the coup, the [[Fiji Times]] reported. He expressed disappointment when his deputy, [[Bernadette Ganilau|Bernadette Rounds-Ganilau]], accepted office in Bainimarama's interim government, and asked her to resign from the UPP. He was particularly disappointed, he said, that Ganilau's decision came less than twenty-four hours after he had been visited by soldiers conveying a message from [[Land Force Commander (Fiji)|Land Force Commander]] [[Pita Driti]] threatening him to stop speaking against the Military.  On 10 January, he accused the [[Fiji Labour Party]], some of whose leading figures, were included in the interim government, of having been privy to the coup plot.[http://www.fijivillage.com/artman/publish/article_34995.shtml]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

== Social views ==
On 27 August 2005, Beddoes spoke out against calls by some for the closure of loopholes in the [[Penal Code]] which had allowed the release of two men, one a Fijian citizen and the other a foreigner, who had been sentenced to a prison term on 5 April for homosexual acts.  This sentence was overturned on 26 August by Justice [[Gerald Winter (judge)|Gerald Winter]], who said that the Penal Code was not applicable to what adults did in private.

The same day, Beddoes condemned [[Senate of Fiji|Senator]] [[Mitieli Bulanauca]] for speaking against homosexuality and attacking Justice Winter in the Senate. ''"Senator Bulanauca is among a very small percentage of misfits and clowns who live off the lies they try to spin to try and intimidate others, while sheltering behind [[parliamentary privilege]],"'' Beddoes said. ''"These expressions of hate come from a man who claims he is a Christian and quotes endlessly from the Bible."''

== Retirement ==
On 20 January 2007, Beddoes announced that he would retire from the presidency of the UPP at the Annual General Meeting of his party, on 31 March.

After the winding up of the UPP in January 2013, Beddoes announced that he would join the new [[Social Democratic Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=73723 |title=Fiji's Beddoes to join budding SDL |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4799">An '''office lady''', often abbreviated '''OL''', is a female [[office worker]] in [[Japan]] who performs generally [[pink collar]] tasks such as serving [[tea]] and [[secretary|secretarial]] or [[clerk (position)|clerical]] work. Office ladies are usually [[full time|full-time]] permanent staff, although the jobs they perform usually have little opportunity for [[promotion (rank)|promotion]], and there is usually the [[wikt:tacit|tacit]] expectation that they leave their jobs once they get [[marriage|married]].

Due to some Japanese pop culture influence in [[China mainland]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]], the term is also in common usage there. However, the meaning of the word is slightly different.

==History==
The rise in OLs began after [[World War II]], as offices expanded. They were first known as "'''BGs'''" (for '''B'''usiness '''G'''irl'''s'''), but it was later found that [[English language|English]]-speakers used a similar [[acronym]], '''B-girls''', to refer to "[[bargirl]]s". ''Josei Jishin'', a women's [[magazine]], ran a competition to find a better name for the business girls. OL was chosen in 1963 from the entries.&lt;ref name="womansword"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cherry |first=Kittredge |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Womansword: What Japanese Words Say about Women |origdate= |year=1987 |origmonth= |url= |type=paperback |accessdate= |edition=First mass market edition, 1991 |series= |date= |month= |publisher=Kodansha International Ltd |location=Tokyo |isbn=4-7700-1655-7 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter=Office Flowers Bloom: Work Outside the Home |quote=|page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, being an OL was the most common job for Japanese women, and OLs made up approximately one-third of the female [[work force]].&lt;ref name="womansword"/&gt;

According to [[Miyako Inoue (linguistic anthropologist)|Miyako Inoue]], "[[Equal Employment Opportunity Law (Japan)|The Equal Employment Opportunity Law (EEOL)]] was enacted in 1986, and phased into implementation. Although the EEOL had virtually no effect in changing [[discrimination|discriminatory]] business practices, it was promoted nationally by the government."&lt;ref&gt;[[Miyako Inoue (linguistic anthropologist)|Miyako Inoue]]. ''Vicarious Language: Gender and Linguistic Modernity in Japan''. University of California Press, 2006, pg 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
OL [[stock character]]s are frequently found in [[josei manga]] and [[anime]], often portrayed as attractive, clever, and [[wikt:wistful|wistful]] individuals bored with their jobs, over-pressured by their families, and facing psychological issues.

*The ''[[Shomuni]]'' franchise includes manga, television series and films about office ladies.
*The manga and anime series ''[[Oruchuban Ebichu]]'', for example, features an office lady character appropriately named OL.
*The warrior characters Linna Yamazaki (''[[Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040]]'') and Arisa and Kyouko (''[[All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku]]'') have day jobs as office ladies.
*Most major characters in ''[[OL Shinkaron]]'' are office ladies.
* In ''[[Re: Cutie Honey]]'', the titular Honey uses her OL job as a way to disappear from work without being noticed.
* Office Lady and [[Salaryman]] are Trainer classes in the original Japanese version of ''[[Pokémon Black and White]]'', appearing in the commercial hub of Castelia City.  They were renamed Clerk ♀ and Clerk ♂ (respectively) for the English versions of the game.
*Kumiko, the protagonist in ''[[Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter]]'' is an office lady.
* Kaoru, the main female character in the [[slice of life]] ''[[I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying]]!'' is an OL.

==Desired organizational characteristics==
*DOC-1 Clarity of Direction
*DOC-2 Clarity of Structures
*DOC-3 Clarity of Measurement

'''Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki''' (March 13, 1909 in [[Magetan]], [[Dutch East Indies]] – 1998) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[field hockey]] player who competed in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. He had a professional career as agricultural engineer, was married to [[Lilie van Thiel]] (born 1913), and was the son of [[Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki, Sr.|Otto Ferdinand Muller von Czernicki]] and [[Anna Catharina Cramer]].

He was a squad member of the Dutch field hockey team, which won the silver medal in the 1928 Olympics. He was a reserve player and did not play a single match.

He played from 1926 to 1930 as back in the hockey teams of [[Bloemendaal]], [[H.H.C]] (1930), the [[Netherlands National Student Hockey Team]], and the [[Netherlands National Hockey Team]]. He also played lawn tennis and rowed at [[W.S.R. Argo]] in 1936.

After graduating in 1937 from [[Wageningen University]] with a degree in tropical agriculture, Muller von Czernicki eventually became the CEO of Rubber Cultuur Maatschappij "Amsterdam" (RCMA), now [[Acomo (Amsterdam Commodities)|''Amsterdam Commodities'' (Acomo)]], a company with thousands of employees that, until 1957 when [[Indonesia]] nationalized all plantations, primarily managed rubber and palm oil plantations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17961">'''Regis McKenna''' is a marketer who introduced many of the ideas that are now part of the mainstream in technology marketing. He and his firm were instrumental in the launch of some of the most innovative products of the [[computer age]], including the first [[microprocessor]] ([[Intel Corporation]]), Apple's first personal computer ([[Apple Computer]]), the first [[recombinant DNA]] genetically engineered product ([[Genentech, Inc.]]), and the first retail computer store ([[The Byte Shop]]).

Among the entrepreneurial start-ups with which he worked during their formative years are [[America Online]], Apple, [[Compaq]], [[Electronic Arts]], Genentech, Intel, [[Linear Technology]], [[Lotus Software|Lotus]], [[Microsoft]], [[National Semiconductor]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[3COM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Regis McKenna| work =McKenna Management, LLC| url =http://www.mckennas.com/Regis.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been described as the man who put [[Silicon Valley]] on the map.&lt;ref name=articles&gt;{{cite web| title =Articles| work =regis.com| url =http://www.regis.com/articles/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called “Silicon Valley's preeminent public relations man,” a “guru,” a “czar,” a “philosopher king,”&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web| last =Zonano| first =Victor| title =Regis McKenna: The P.R.

According to a 1985 article in the Los Angeles Times, McKenna is “best known for taking the story of Apple Computer's founding in a Los Altos garage by a couple of young entrepreneurs and weaving the tale into part of our national folklore.”&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; “McKenna's power comes from the fact that good public relations are crucial for hundreds of small technology-oriented start-up companies,” wrote the Times. Robert Henkel, editor in chief of Electronics magazine and former technology editor of Business Week, told the Times that McKenna was “the best p.r. man around in the high-technology business.”&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

==Education and early career==
Born and raised in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], McKenna attended [[Saint Vincent College]] and was a liberal arts graduate of [[Duquesne University]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; He later said that he “had a dispute with the university over credits” and that Duquesne “eventually sent me my degree,” although “I went to four different universities to get that degree.” He ended up receiving an honorary Ph.D. from Duquesne in 1990.&lt;ref name=adage&gt;{{cite web| last =Creamer| first =Mathew| title =Apple's First Marketing Guru On Why '1984' Is Overrated| work =Ad Age| date =Mar 1, 2012| url =http://adage.com/article/digital/apple-s-marketing-guru-1984-overrated/232933/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first went to Silicon Valley in 1962, where he worked in the marketing department of General Microelectronics, a spinoff of Fairchild that started developing [[Metal-oxide-semiconductor|MOS]] technology.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; He then went to work as manager of marketing services for [[National Semiconductor]] in 1967, a firm that grew very quickly. He spent “half of my time on the road... in [[Europe]] and other places around the world... helping set up operations in [[Scotland]].” It was there, he said, that he learned a great deal about marketing simply by doing it.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

McKenna wrote a 2001 article entitled “Silicon Valley Isn't a Place as Much as It Is an Attitude.” Describing the Valley as “this near mythical garden became the place where anyone could pursue and achieve his or her heart's delight,” he said that its early “inventors and entrepreneurs...didn't set out to achieve wealth or even happiness” but “sought the freedom to exercise their talents free of economic, cultural, or tenure constraints.” The result was the unplanned evolution of a “new, egalitarian culture.”&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =McKenna| first =Regis| title =State of Mind | work =Forbes| date =Dec 31, 2001| url =https://www.forbes.com/asap/2001/1203/mckenna.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regis McKenna, Inc.==
In late 1969, McKenna left National and began to seek work as a marketing freelancer, helping Silicon Valley startups “with everything from research to training.” He put together a “marketing plan” including a list of “the top ten companies” he wanted to work with, and ended up having them all as clients. The list included Intel, Spectra Physics, Teledyne, Systron, and Donner.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

McKenna founded Regis McKenna, Inc., in 1970. He went on to work for Intel and then Apple. He later recalled that “Apple wasn't happy with the name Apple after they got going and growing. They actually looked at [[IBM]] and said, 'We don't look like IBM. We're not, you know, dignified.'” McKenna made a two-hour presentation to Apple's employees in which he said: “That's exactly what you do want. You want to be different from IBM. You don't want to be the same. You don't want to emulate them. You want to do all of the things that distinguish you from them.”&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt;

He began working with Apple in 1976. In that year, [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] “approached [him] and asked for help in launching what was to be the world's first personal computer.” He agreed, because he “liked Apple's vision.”&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; A 2012 article explains that “When a young Steve Jobs needed a marketing expert, he called Intel to ask who made their sharp-looking ads and was told 'Regis McKenna.'”.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

In addition to marketing consultancy, McKenna also owned an advertising agency and a public relations company. “So not only did we write their first business plan, we also designed the Apple logo and put together their advertising campaigns.”&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

McKenna has said that the biggest mistake of his career was turning down an offer of 20% of Apple stock in lieu of payment for his services. “I was looking at my cash flow. And that's one of the reasons why I turned down Apple's offer.” His letter turning down the offer is on display at Apple's headquarters.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

McKenna sold his advertising business to Jay Chiat in 1981 and his PR business in 1995.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

McKenna came out of retirement to work on the iPhone 4 antenna crisis. “Steve called me from Hawaii and told me he had a big problem,” MCKenna later explained. “He asked if I would meet him at Apple the next day....I thought it was a media-cycle issue and that they should address it with the data they had and be confident about the outcome rather than be apologetic. That's what Steve did. The issue vanished within probably 10 days.” &lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

McKenna felt that Walter Isaacson's book about Jobs was “very negative....I never once had any of those confrontations that people talk about, and I knew him since he was 22 years old.”&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

Aside from Intel and Apple, among the startups that the firm assisted in their formative years included America Online, Electronic Arts, Genentech, National Semiconductor, Silicon Graphics, and 3Com Corporation. Over the years, the firm evolved from a high-tech outsource marketing business focusing on startups to a broad-based marketing strategy firm servicing international clients in many different industries. McKenna sold his interest in the firm in 2000.&lt;ref name=scu&gt;{{cite web| title =Regis McKenna | work =Santa Clara University | url =http://www.scu.edu/profiles/?p=2929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Regis McKenna| work =Opus Capital| url =http://www.opuscapitalventures.com/team/regis-mckenna/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Cunningham]], the firm's group account manager for Apple, told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1985 that “This agency knows more about Apple Computer than Barbara Krause (Apple's in-house public relations chief).”&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

McKenna later recalled that when he was advising Bill Gates, he “had so many clients coming to me looking” to see their faces on magazine covers “that I told Bill not to make that his goal. Instead, the goal should be to build a company.”&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

McKenna pioneered many of the theories and practices of technology marketing that have become integrated into the marketing mainstream. Some of these include:

*The process of diffusing technology across various classes of users ranging from innovators to early adopters to late adopters and laggards and the corresponding evolution of the “whole product.”
*The development of industry infrastructure modeling whereby a relatively small number of “influencers” establish and sustain standards. The focus on “intangibles” as the benefits of technology products.
*The development of “other” as a major, growing segment of market share with the result of “choice becoming a higher value than brand.”
*The development of the concept of "Real Time," whereby technology compresses time (from want or need to zero), creating "the never satisfied consumer".

McKenna wrote in 1990 that “Technology is transforming choice, and choice is transforming the marketplace. As a result, we are witnessing the emergence of a new marketing paradigm.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Marketing Is Everything| work =Harvard Business Review| date =Jan 1991| url =http://hbr.org/1991/01/marketing-is-everything/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 article, he declared that “branding (as currently practiced) is dead.”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

A 2012 article entitled “How Regis McKenna Defined Real-Time Marketing” explained that real-time marketing “is a way of thinking and philosophy that requires businesses to meet the demands of an always-on digital world” and that “includes the convergence of search, social, and real-time content production and distribution, with an expanded definition of publishing that makes social conversation and interaction as important as actual writing and digital media development.” McKenna, it was explained, “laid the groundwork for real-time marketing back in 1995” in a paper for the Harvard Business Review, and fleshed out the concept in the 1997 book Real Time. Among his influential observations:

*“Companies must keep the dialogue flowing and also maintain conversations with suppliers, distributors, and others in the marketplace.”
*“[Real-time marketing must replace] the broadcast mentality.”
*“[Real-time marketing must focus] on real-time customer satisfaction, providing the support, help, guidance, and information necessary to win customers’ loyalty.”
*“Real-time marketing requires...being willing to learn how information technology is changing both customer behavior in marketing and to think in new ways about marketing within the organization.”
*“The customer still does all the work, hunting and pecking for information. But a real-time marketer would bring the information to the customer.”&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

==Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers==
In 1986 McKenna became a partner of the [[venture capital]] firm [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

==Memberships==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">In [[computing]] and specifically [[peer-to-peer file sharing]], '''seeding''' is the uploading of already [[download]]ed content for others to download from. A [[peering|peer]], a [[computer]] that is connected to the [[computer network|network]], becomes a seed when having acquired the entire set of [[data]] it tries to download. This data consists out of small parts so that seeds can effectively share their content with other peers, handing out the missing pieces. A peer deliberately chooses to become a seed by leaving the upload task active when content is downloaded. This means that there should be motivation to seed. The opposite of a seed is a [[leech (computing)|leech]], a peer that downloads more than they upload.

[[File:Seeding (computing).gif|thumb|400x150px|This shows in a simplified way when one seeds.]]

== Background ==
Seeding is a practice within peer-to-peer file sharing, a [[content distribution model]] that connects computers with the use of a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) software program in order to share desired content. An example of such a peer-to-peer software program is [[BitTorrent]]. Peer-to-peer file sharing is different from the [[client-server model]], where content is directly distributed from its [[server (computing)|server]] to a [[client (computing)|client]]. To make peer-to-peer file sharing function effectively, content is divided into parts of 256 kilobyte (KB). This [[segmented downloading]] makes the parts that peers miss be allocated by seeds. It also makes downloads go faster, as content can be exchanged between peers. All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a [[segmented downloading|swarm]].&lt;ref name="bera"&gt;Bera, D., Esposito, F., Matta, I., Michiardi, P. (2011). ''On The Impact Of Seed Scheduling In Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' Computer Science Department, Boston University&lt;/ref&gt;

Data shared via peer-to-peer file sharing contains shared file content, computing cycles and disk storage, among other resources.&lt;ref name="ahmad"&gt;As-Sayid-Ahmad, L., Hawa, M., Khalif, L. (2012). ''On Enhancing Reputation Management Using Peer-To-Peer Interaction History.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In peer-to-peer file sharing, the strength of a swarm depends on user behaviour, as peers ideally upload more than they download. This is done by seeding, and there are different motivations to do this. There are two popular motivations to seed, of which one is the reputation-based incentive mechanism and the other is the [[tit for tat]] mechanism. As the name reveals, the former is based on the reputation of a peer, meaning that those peers who have a good reputation will get a better treatment from the uploader.&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; The tit for tat mechanism prevents peers from downloading content if they do not upload to the peers they download from. The latter forces a peer to upload.&lt;ref&gt;Hajek, B., Zhu, Ji. (2011). ''The Missing Piece Syndrome In Peer-To-Peer Communication.'' Department of Electrical And Computer Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Although seeding is only a social norm, some scholars see the practice of uploading parts of the data bulk to others as a duty, claiming that “downloaders are forced to reward uploads in order to compensate for their resource consumption and encourage further altruistic behaviour.”&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; Other scholars are milder and believe that a group of highly motivated seeders could already provide a notion of fairness by scheduling when to seed, uploading more effectively.&lt;ref name="bera" /&gt;

== Threats ==
Leechers, peers that download more than they upload, are a threat to peer-to-peer file sharing and the practice of seeding. Where the goal of seeding is to upload more than to download, thus contributing to the sharing of content, leechers stop uploading as soon as their download is finished. What this means is that seeders must upload more parts of the data bulk in order to guarantee a healthy download. Leeching is also referred to as free-riding, temporal downloading users that, by not seeding, do not support the distribution of content.

Although leeching is a threat to peer-to-peer sharing and an opposite of seeding, it is not regarded as an immediate problem. With downloads rising, upload is still guaranteed, though few contributors in the system account for most services.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, S., Jin, H., Liao, X., Yao, H., Huang, Q., Tu, X. (2009). ''Measuring Web Feature Impacts In Peer-To-Peer File Sharing Systems.'' Hushing University of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities ==
Research sees opportunities for seeding as a practice that caters contribution within peer-to-peer file sharing and the distribution of content in the digital world in general. A term for this is economic traffic management (ETM), which is concerned with traffic management solutions to involve all peers, both seeder and leecher. It is ETM’s goal to unite peers that have different objectives and to make the sharing of content with peer-to-peer file sharing more efficient. Locality awareness is raised as the most promising concepts by scholars. This entails stimulating peers to seed downloads in their neighbourhood, which speeds up the upload speed and saves [[inter-domain]] traffic over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Despotovic, Z., Hossfeld, T., Kellerer, W., Lehrieder, F., Oechsner, S., Michel, M. (2011). ''Mitigating Unfairness In Locality-Aware Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' International Journal of Network Management&lt;/ref&gt;
Other opportunities that have arisen out of research are to schedule seeding&lt;ref name="bera"/&gt; and use models that reduce the [[electric energy consumption|power consumption]] of seeding computers.&lt;ref&gt;Hlavacs, H., Wiedlich, R., Treutner, T. (2011). ''Energy efficient peer-to-peer file sharing.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Peer-to-peer file sharing and, with that, seeding, is known as a platform for illegal content. With the sharing being done between peers all over the world, there is no supervision. Control over illegal or manipulated content is therefore difficult. Seeding is a part of this and a peer can therefore be involved in helping other peers download illegal content.&lt;ref&gt;Halldorson, U., Hasslinger, G., Sigurdsson, M. (2007). ''Potentials And Challenges Of Peer-To-Peer Based Content Distribution.'' Telematics And Informatics 24&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there are also examples of mainstream applications that use peer-to-peer file sharing. [[Skype]] and other [[real-time communication]] systems are examples.

'''Social Fund for Development''' ([[Egypt]]) was established in 1991 by a Presidential decree # 189 and with support of the United Nations Development Programme.  SFD was created with a capital of 1.1 Billion Egyptian Pounds to alleviate the hardship created by the returning Egyptian workers from the Gulf area as a result of the [[First Gulf War]]. According to Magdy Moussa, Middle East Regional Director at Plant Finance, "SFD was regarded as a social safety net associated with the Government of Egypt's agreement to undertake its extensive Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program."&lt;ref&gt;Magdy Moussa (January 2007). ''Regulation and Supervision of Microfinance in Egypt''. Essays on Regulation and Supervision series, Microfinance Regulation and Supervision Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt; SFD focuses on [[sustainable development]] projects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Also according to Moussa, a prominent focal point for SFD is promoting self-employment through microcredit projects.

Major donors are: the [[World Bank]], the [[European Union]], [[Germany]], [[JICA]], [[Kuwaiti Development Fund]].

The '''WISTA Science and Technology Park''' in [[Berlin-Adlershof]] was founded in 1991 after the dissolution of the [[Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic]] at the same place. Today it covers an area of {{convert|4.2|km2|sqmi}} making it the largest [[science park]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel.'' Hamburg 2008,02 (7.1.), S. 38, {{ISSN|0038-7452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The existence of technology centers at Adlershof dates back well into the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the [[Berlin–Görlitz railway]] had reached the Berlin suburb of Adlershof in 1867 and the population increased from 743 in 1875 to 5591 in 1895 following the industrialization in the area. The decision to build the [[Teltow Canal]] (1900 - 1906) furthered the development of businesses in the area between the old town (in the north) and the canal (in the south). In 1909 the [[Johannisthal Air Field]] opened in the west of the area and a number of institutions settled in Adlershof, including the German Research Institute for Aviation (today [[German Aerospace Center]]). During the wars the area was used as a technology development center for aviation and radio telecommunications - for some time the large 36 meter [[radio telescope]] was an icon of the area.

After the total destruction of Berlin 1945 the new Eastern Government decided to move the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences]] to Adlershof. In 1950 to 1952 the media centers of the [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] television broadcaster were built in Adlershof. The aviation field was closed down (as air transport had been moved to [[Berlin-Schönefeld Airport]] a few miles away) and the guards regiment Feliks Dzierzynski (12,000 soldiers) occupied the military buildings.

After the [[German reunification]] almost all institutions at Adlershof were closed down during 1990/1991. The infrastructure was old and not up to date with the technology level of West Germany however the available area had the best premises to build a modern one. Berlin did found the Redevelopment Company Adlershof Ltd (Entwicklungsgesellschaft Adlershof mbH - EGA) in 1991 and it was renamed to WISTA Management Ltd (WISTA-Management GmbH) in 1994 as the plans for a new science and technology park took shape. Since then, it helps developing the cluster partly like a [[business incubator]], with network management, communication and marketing, acceleration of special fields of technology and acquisition of projects, investments and companies.

The name WISTA is not officially explained as an abbreviation although at the time the full name was "WISTA - Wissenschafts- und Wirtschaftsstandort Adlershof" (WISTA - Science and Business Location Adlershof) so that WI-ST-A points to a previous project name "WIssenschaftsSTandort Adlershof" (Science Location Adlershof) while much of the press refers to the area as "Wissenschaftsstadt Adlershof" (Science City Adlershof) leading to the same abbreviation. In fact WISTA was included in the [[Expo 2000]] fairs under the name of "Berlin Adlershof – Stadt für Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Medien" (Berlin Adlershof - City of Science, Business and Media) corroborating the correspondence.

At the end of 2007 the redevelopment legislation for Adlershof were lifted. In 2008 the area advanced to the north-west building the Hermann Dörner Avenue (Hermann-Dörner-Allee). In 2011 the tram line was extended to run right through the science and technology park. Today the [[BESSY]] synchrotron is something of an icon for the area. There is still room for extension of the science park using the industrial area along the earlier airfield in the west and the earlier shunting station in the north. Developments plans for a housing project west of the earlier airfield (today a grassland recreational area) have been scrapped with new homes being single and duplex houses.

== Numbers ==
The complete area of the WISTA development area encompasses {{convert|420|ha|acre}}. The Science City as the core area covered {{convert|88.7|ha|acre}}. The Media City stretches for {{convert|19|ha|acre}} as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adlershof.de/newsview/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=289&amp;cHash=ee2e6f0793|title=Adlershof in Zahlen|date=2001-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
