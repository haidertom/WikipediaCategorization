'''''An Autobiography''''' is the title of the recollections of [[crime writer]] [[Agatha Christie]] published posthumously by [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]] in the UK and by [[Dodd, Mead &amp; Company]] in the US in November 1977, almost two years after the writer's death in January 1976. The UK edition retailed at [[£]]7.95 and the US edition at $15.00. It is by some considerable margin the longest of her works, the UK first edition running to 544 pages. It was translated and published in Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

==Overview==
Christie provides a [[foreword]] and an [[epilogue]] to the book in which she very clearly states the beginning and end of the composition. The book was supposedly started on 2 April 1950 at the expedition house at [[Nimrud]] where she was working on the excavation of that ancient city with her second husband, the [[archaeologist]] [[Max Mallowan]]. The narrative was then completed on 11 October 1965 at one of the Mallowan's homes, Winterbrook House in [[Wallingford, Berkshire]] where Christie's death occurred eleven years later. Collins included a [[preface]] to the book in which they admitted that repetitions and inconsistencies had been “tidied up”&lt;ref&gt;Christie, Agatha. ''An Autobiography'' (Page 9). Collins, 1977. {{ISBN|0-00-216012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they continued to impress on readers that the text had been composed over a fifteen-year period and was then left untouched by Christie for the remainder of her life. Christie's official biography revealed that the truth was more complicated and while many notes and short diaries had been made between 1950 and 1965, Christie's intention had been for a more ad-hoc series of smaller books in the style of the 1946 publication ''[[Come Tell Me How You Live]]'' (which concentrated fully on her life on one of her husband's digs and the personalities and events involved). In the early 1960s Christie was being approached more and more often for permission to write biographies of her, all such requests being firmly turned down. In February 1962 she informed her literary agent, Edmund Cork of Hughes Massie, that she did not want any account of her life written, but exactly three years later she seemed to recognise the inevitability of such works being composed and, determined to undercut such efforts, started work in earnest to bring her notes into a more cohesive narrative, although she remained determined that publication would not occur during her lifetime. The writing was finished by the end of 1966 with the draft being sent to Cork for his suggestions and a request for a copy to be typed for Christie's daughter [[Rosalind Hicks]] in order that she could offer her opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Janet. ''Agatha Christie, A Biography''. (Pages 338–340) Collins, 1984 {{ISBN|0-00-216330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Christie's death in 1976, the text was edited by Philip Ziegler of Collins in conjunction with Rosalind and her husband, Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan. (Page 377)&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of Christie herself making any further alterations to the text in her lifetime. In the 1965 epilogue she stated that, “now that I have reached the age of seventy-five, it seems the right moment to stop…I live now on borrowed time, waiting in the ante-room for the summons that will inevitably come…I am ready now to accept death.”&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (Page 529)&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there is no mention of her later works, the award of the [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in 1971 or successes such as the 1974 film of ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]''. She also admitted that she didn’t follow a strict chronological and detailed order of the events of her life, instead wanting to "plunge my hand into a lucky dip and come up with a handful of assorted memories".&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (Page 12)&lt;/ref&gt; The published work does mostly follow a chronological order (although how much of that is due to the work carried out in 1976-7 is not known); however, the book is by no means comprehensive. Upon publication there was an expectation that an explanation would be offered of her famous 1926 disappearance but none is forthcoming. The publisher's preface anticipates any disappointment felt when they admit to this omission on the first page but state, “the references elsewhere to an earlier attack on amnesia give the clue to the true course of events.”&lt;ref name="Autobiography Page 9"&gt;''Autobiography'' (Page 9)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie was enamoured all her life with the happiness of her childhood&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Laura. ''Agatha Christie, An English Mystery''. (Page 1) Headline, 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7553-1487-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her loving relationship with her mother&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (Page 12)&lt;/ref&gt; and this is reflected in the text of ''An Autobiography''. Within the 544 pages, the first appearance of her first husband, [[Archie Christie]], does not take place until page 212 (as opposed to page 57 out of 394 in her official biography) and the death of Christie's mother in April 1926 (an event which triggered the events of that calamitous year in her life and which happened in her thirty-fifth year), does not occur until page 346. Christie deals sympathetically with her first husband, relating details of the initial happiness of their courtship and married life and devoting an entire chapter to the events of their round the world trip between 20 January to 1 December 1922. Christie tells of the events of 1926 with the death of her mother, her slow breakdown, her husband's adultery and the end of her marriage in just seven pages admitting when she begins the passage that, “The next year of my life is one I hate recalling”&lt;ref&gt;''Autobiography'' (Page 346)&lt;/ref&gt; and concluding, “So, after illness, came sorrow, despair, and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it. I stood out for a year, hoping he (Archie) would change. But he did not. So ended my first married life.”&lt;ref name="Autobiography Page 9"/&gt; In contrast, Christie's official biography devotes three entire chapters out of twenty-six to the events of that year.

Christie confines the events of 1945 to 1965 to just twenty-three pages. Most of her works are mentioned in passing but no great detail is given of any of them apart from the ones that are firm milestones in her career (e.g. ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'', ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). Her concentration is on her love of travel and the people in her life. By not writing at length about some of her works she caused some annoyance or disappointment, such as that described by [[Hubert Gregg]], the director of six of her plays who, in his 1980 memoir ''Agatha Christie and All That Mousetrap'', spoke with some disparagement of Christie, stating at one point, “She owed an enormous debt to [[Peter Saunders (impresario)|Peter Saunders]] yet in her autobiography she gives him scant mention. Speaking of ''[[The Unexpected Guest (play)|The Unexpected Guest]]'' (which Gregg directed) she says quite simply that she wrote it. I think perhaps she didn’t like to confess – to herself, even – that her theatrical accomplishments could not be achieved without help.”&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Hubert. ''Agatha Christie and all that Mousetrap'' (Page 161). William Kimber &amp; Co, Ltd, London, 1980. {{ISBN|0-7183-0427-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Janet Morgan]], Christie's official biographer, considered the ''Autobiography'' to be “an enchanting book, fluent, pungent, clear-eyed about the times and circumstances in which she lived, funny about herself and other people.”&lt;ref&gt;Morgan. (Page 378)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition contains four pages of colour plates of oil paintings of Christie and her family from the late 19th and early 20th century which do not appear in later editions.

[[File:Alfred Bricher - Time and Tide.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''Time and Tide'', 1873, [[Dallas Museum of Art]]]]
'''Alfred Thompson Bricher''' (April 10, 1837 – September 30, 1908) was a painter associated with [[White Mountain art]] and the [[Hudson River School]].

==Life and work==
Bricher was born in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].  He was educated in an academy at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. He began his career as a businessman in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. When not working, he studied at the [[Lowell Institute]]. He also studied with [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[William Morris Hunt]], and others. He attained noteworthy skill in making landscape studies from nature, and after 1858 devoted himself to the art as a profession. He opened a studio in Boston, and met with some success there. In 1868 he moved to [[New York City]], and at the [[National Academy of Design]] that year he exhibited “Mill-Stream at Newburyport.” Soon afterward he began to use [[watercolor]]s in preference to [[oil painting|oils]], and in 1873 was chosen a member of the [[American Watercolor Society]]. In the 1870s, he primarily did maritime themed paintings, with attention to watercolor paintings of landscape, marine, and coastwise scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitemountainart.com/Biographies/bio_atb.htm|title=Alfred Thompson Bricher Biography|work=whitemountainart.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Bricher, Alfred Thompson|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often spent summers in [[Grand Manan]], where he produced such notable works as ''[[Morning at Grand Manan]]'' (1878). In 1879, Bricher was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalacademy.org/academy/national-academicians/|title=National Academicians|work=National Academy Museum|accessdate=17 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314023614/http://www.nationalacademy.org/academy/national-academicians/|archive-date=14 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hudson River School==
[[File:Alfred Thompson Bricher - Castle Rock, Marblehead - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Castle Rock, Marblehead'' (1878), [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]]
Bricher was one of the last painters of the famed Hudson River School. By the end of his life, his style of painting that included [[landscapes]] and [[luminism (American art style)|luminism]] fell out of style, with [[Modern Art]] becoming the premier artistic movement. As his style of art faded, so did his fame.&lt;ref name="Staten Island"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&amp;d1=1391 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210133645/http://www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&amp;d1=1391 |archivedate=February 10, 2009| title= Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders |publisher=New York Public Library | accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
Over time Bricher's artwork gathered more attention and by the 1980s he began to be credited as one of the nineteenth century's greatest maritime painters.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} A self-taught luminist, he explored the effects of light and how it reflected, refracted, and absorbed on landscapes and seascapes.

==Later life==
[[File:Blue Point Long Island.jpeg|thumb|''Blue Point, Long Island'', 1888]]
As a lover of maritime life and the sea he purchased a home in the 1890s close to the sea in the [[New Dorp]] section of Staten Island where he had views of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Raritan Bay]]. He lived and painted at the shore in New Dorp until his death, in [[Staten Island, New York]], aged 71.&lt;ref name="Staten Island" /&gt;

'''''And the Sea Will Tell''''' is a [[true crime]] book by [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]]. The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on [[Palmyra Atoll]]; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane ("Buck") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and [[Leonard Weinglass]] defended. The book went to No. 1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook.

==The killings==
In 1974, a yachting couple from [[San Diego, California]],  Malcolm "Mac" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne "Muff" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot [[ketch]] to [[Palmyra Atoll]]&amp;nbsp;— 1,200 miles south of Honolulu&amp;nbsp;— hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed.

Also on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as "Jennifer Jenkins" in the book), who had sailed there together from [[Hawaii]] on Stearns' sailing vessel ''Iola'', a deteriorating, patched-together wooden [[sloop]] that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the ''Sea Wind'', was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a [[lathe]] and [[acetylene]] [[welding]] [[torch]].

Walker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on Palmyra to support himself.  The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely.  The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety ''Iola'', against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning ([[Tabuaeran]]), a nearby atoll in [[Kiribati]], to restock&amp;nbsp;— a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine.

According to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' [[Zodiac Nautic|Zodiac]] rigid inflatable [[dinghy]] upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the ''Iola'' and sailed for Hawaii on the ''Sea Wind''. Once in Hawaii, the couple had the ''Sea Wind'' repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive ''Sea Wind'' despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the ''Sea Wind'',&lt;ref name="San Diego Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Diane|title=1974 murder victim still awaits burial|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/people/sdut-murder-trial-bugliosi-graham-sailboat-palmyra-fbi-2014apr18-story.html|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the "400 row" of the [[Ala Wai Harbor]].  It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the [[The Ilikai|Ilikai Hotel]].

Early one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container.

==Trial and punishment==
Buck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Victorville]], in California.  Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the ''Sea Wind'' to Hawaii with the ''Iola'' in tow, but the ''Iola'' ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned.  During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large [[swordfish]] damaged the ''Sea Wind''{{'}}s hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming.

Stephanie Stearns was tried separately in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

==Aftermath==
The book was adapted into the 1991 [[television film]] ''And the Sea Will Tell'', directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]] which aired on [[CBS]] As a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.)

The trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0199342520|title=A Guide to Oral History and the Law|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a [[stroke]] on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="Willits News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Linda|title=Notorious atoll murderer dies after parole to Willits area|url=http://www.willitsnews.com/article/zz/20100609/NEWS/100607291|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=Willits News|date=9 June 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in [[Willits, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/Jun/02/ln/hawaii6020337.html | title = 'Buck' Walker infamous for high-profile Palmyra deaths | author = Mary Vorsino | publisher = HonoluluAdvertiser.com | date = June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker (writing as Wesley G. Walker), claimed in a book about that case that he had been seduced by Mrs. Graham and, in the midst of lovemaking, had been caught by Mr. Graham, who shot his wife and attempted to shoot Walker.

Malcolm Graham's body has never been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Rod|title=Isle murderer Buck Duane Walker up for parole|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/07/13/news/story04.html|work=Honolulu Star Bulletin|date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">The first known reference to an '''Art Strike''' appears in an [[Alain Jouffroy]] essay: "What's To Be Done About Art?" (included in "Art and Confrontation," New York Graphic Society 1968).

"It is essential that the minority advocate the necessity of going on an 'active art strike' using the machines of the culture industry to set it in total contradiction to itself. The intention is not to end the rule of production, but to change the most adventurous part of 'artistic' production into the production of revolutionary ideas, forms, and techniques."

==Art Workers Coalition (1969-70)==
The [[Art Workers Coalition]] (AWC) was a collection of artists, dealers, museum workers, and other workers in the art industry; including [[Carl Andre]] and [[Lucy Lippard]].

On October 15, 1969, the AWC organized a successful "[[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] of Art to End the [[War in Vietnam]]." The [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]], and a large number of commercial [[art gallery|art galleries]] closed for the day. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] and the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] did not comply. Under pressure from the AWC, the Metropolitan postponed the opening of its American painting and sculpture show scheduled for that day, and the Guggenheim got picketed.

The group also called upon all museums in New York to close on May 22, 1970, as part of the [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. While many did, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] failed to do so. This led to picketing by an offshoot, led by [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] and [[Poppy Johnson]], under the name ''Art Strike Against Racism, War, and Oppression''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Molesworth|first1=Helen Anne|last2=Alexander|first2=M. Darsie|last3=Bryan-Wilson|first3=Julia|title=Work Ethic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcAGVtDLBpMC|year=2003|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-02334-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group extended its antiwar protests and protests against the [[List of school shootings in the United States#1970s|illing of student protesters by the Police at Jackson, Augusta, and Kent]] by calling for a boycott of the American Pavilion at the 1970 [[Venice Biennale]]. The group organized a counter-biennial in New York. This was then criticized by the Women Students and Artists for Black Art Liberation (WSABAL) directed by [[Faith Ringgold]] and joined by [[Michele Wallace]], which led to it opening up to women and people of color. The WSABAL group also influenced the [[Ad Hoc Women Artists]], conducted by [[Lucy Lippard]]. These two groups both had a demand of 50 percent women artist representation. Their protests led to the inclusion of black women artists [[Barbara Chase Riboud]] and [[Bettye Saar]] in the next Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Michele|title=Invisibility Blues: From Pop to Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z_rdEwTpiUC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-519-5|pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Years without Art 1977-1980==
In 1974, [[Gustav Metzger]] issued a call for artists to withdraw their labor for a minimum of three years.&lt;ref name=ica1974&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Into Society - Society Into Art: Seven German Artists : Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, 30 October - 14 November 1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzfWSAAACAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Institute of Contemporary Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call criticizes doctrines such as "artists engagement with political struggle" and "the use of art for social change" as well as "art in the service of revolution" as reactionary. Instead, it states that "artists have attacked the prevailing methods of production, distribution, and consumption of art" and that "the refusal of labor is the chief weapon of workers fighting the system." Three years cite  as the "minimum period required to cripple the system."&lt;ref name=ica1974 /&gt;

Although the call does not use the words "Art Strike," Metzger has come to be associated with the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gustav Metzger|url=http://www.e-flux.com/program/gustav-metzger%E2%80%A8/|website=e-flux|accessdate=1 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008182246/http://www.e-flux.com/program/gustav-metzger%E2%80%A8/|archivedate=October 8, 2012|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Art Strike 1990-93==
The Art Strike was a campaign launched in 1986 by [[Stewart Home]] which called upon all artists to cease their artistic work between January 1, 1990, and January 1, 1993. Home, who was a [[Neoist]] artist at the time, used the same language as Metzger's 1974 call, only replacing the dates 1977-80 with 1990-93.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/postas.htm Assessing the Art Strike], ''Stewart Home''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the strike, various groups formed to propagate and co-ordinate the action, such as the Art Strike Action Committee in [[California]] and the Art Strike Action Committee in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/features/artstrik2.htm Art Strike Papers], Edited by James Mannox&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Strike Biennial(2009 - 2012)==
In 2008, an Art Strike conference held in [[Alytus]] with an international group of artists attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redas Dirzys /// Art Strike Ideas and Their Application Today: A Report on the Art Strike Conference – chtodelat.org|url=http://chtodelat.org/b8-newspapers/12-50/art-strike-ideas-and-their-application-today-a-report-on-the-art-strike-conference/|website=chtodelat.org|date=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this conference, [[Redas Diržys]], under the name the Second Temporary Art Strike Action Committee–Alytus Chapter (STASAC-Alytus), decided to retitle the annual Festival of Experimental Art as the [[Art Strike Biennial]]. This was done in response to [[Vilnius]] becoming the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"Alytus-Meno striko sostine," "Alytaus Naujienos," No.155, August 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart Home also took part in this event, calling himself the Transient Art Strike Biennial Supreme Council of One (London)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stewarthomesociety.org/art/shit.htm|title=ART STRIKE BIENNIAL|author=Stewart Home, Transient Art Strike Biennial Supreme Council of One (London)|publisher=Self-published|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to a series of art strikes including:

In 2011, the biennial began to organize as the [[DAta Miners Travailleurs Psychique|Data Miners Travailleurs Psychique]]. Redas and others formally refused the identification of artists and put forward the idea of [[psychic workers]] instead, calling for a [[General strike]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echogonewrong.com/author/redas-dirzys/|title=Redas Diržys - Echo Gone Wrong|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contemporary groups==
In both the [[United States|US]] and [[England]], there are other examples of artist unions working concurrently. Of these, two prominent groups are [[Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art strike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6415">'''Art of Myanmar''' refers to visual art created in [[Myanmar]] (Burma). From the 1400s CE, artists have been creating paintings and sculptures that reflect the Burmese culture.&lt;ref name="Raymond"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Catherine|title=Shan Buddhist Art on the Market: What, Where and Why?|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|date=1 May 2009|volume=10|issue=1|pages=141–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burmese artists have been subjected to government interference and censorship, hindering the development of art in Myanmar.&lt;ref name="Ching"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=Isabel|title=Art from Myanmar: Possibilities of Contemporaneity?|journal=Third Text|date=1 July 2011|volume=25|issue=4|pages=431–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burmese art reflects the central Buddhist elements including the [[mudra]], [[Jataka tales]], the [[pagoda]], and [[Bodhisattva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burmese-buddhas.com/burma/buddhism-in-burma/|title=Introduction and history of Buddhism &amp; Burmese Art in Burma|website=www.burmese-buddhas.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
From 1962 to 1988, during the [[Cold War]] era, postcolonial Myanmar was isolated from the rest of the world as a way to maintain independence.&lt;ref name=Ching /&gt; In 1989, Myanmar began to open international trade and state control was relaxed. This allowed Myanmar's artists more opportunities to engage with international artists.&lt;ref name=Ching /&gt; In 1997, access to the internet allowed a contemporary art community in Myanmar to grow.&lt;ref name=Ching /&gt;
However, government censorship, conflict, economic hardship and isolation have affected Myanmar artists and their art. For instance, the government restricted art to religious depictions and expressions of the natural beauty of the nation.&lt;ref name=Ching /&gt;

== Government censorship ==
The government of Myanmar banned or confiscated artwork on prohibited subjects censored art exhibitions. The prohibited subjects included political criticism, nudity and even the use of certain colours. In 1970, censors defaced unapproved artworks with stamps reading "not allowed to show" on the front and back.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Melissa|title=Painting as Cipher: Censorship of the Visual Arts in Post-1988 Myanmar|journal=SOJOURN|date=2016|volume=31|issue=1|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved paintings depicted the political leader [[Ne Win]] (1910 {{ndash}} 2002), [[socialism]] and its agrarian utopia, the purity of Burmese culture and Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Some artists became defiant of the censorship.

== Notable Burmese artists ==
* [[Win Pe Myint]] ({{lang-my|ဝင်းဖေ}}), a cartoonist, painter and director, worked for the Ludu Kyi-bwa-yay Press in [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; His work was censored by the government. Win Pe said, "The military wanted to be sure of themselves, their security… that there was no direct assault against them through art."&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; 
* Aung Khaing {{em dash}} Khaing was a semi-abstract painter.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; In 1984, at the Bogyoke Aung San Market, Khaing attempted his first solo exhibition of works influenced by those of [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] and Monet.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; During his exhibit, government censors visited him on three separate occasions. During the first few visits, the censors removed around thirty paintings they deemed inappropriate. On the final visit, all remaining artworks left on display were deemed unacceptable to be viewed.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; In protest, Khaing no longer displayed his paintings.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt; However, in October 2013 at the Bogyoke Aung San Market, he held a solo exhibit.
* Maung Theid Dhi {{em dash}} During a more severe period of art censorship in Burma, Maung was arrested for not complying with censors' orders to alter his artwork.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; In 1974, at the Wild Eye Art Exhibition in [[Yangon]], Maung exhibited a self-portrait on wood surrounded by a metal chain. Government censors interpreted this piece as a criticism of government restriction of Burmese life.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Almost immediately censors removed Maung’s work from the exhibit.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; The censors allowed Maung to retrieve the painting later. However, when it was returned, the work was missing its original adornments.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Maung later put the same piece in another exhibit, but this time, he wrapped it with leather and rope and placed it atop the skull of a deer.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Soon after displaying his “new” art piece, censors arrested him without explanation and Maung spent a week in jail.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; After his release, Maung continued to exhibit the same piece. As a result, censors and detectives arrived at his home accusing him of creating political artworks.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Several such visits caused Maung and his family great distress.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;  Maung was arrested again for his “suspicious” artworks.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; Such distress left Maung too afraid to create paintings based on his political sketches but he did create paintings depicting the censors.

== Art of the Shan Period ==
Art historians do not have an agreed-upon definition of Shan art. It is believed to have originated between 1550 and 1772 CE, which was around the time that the two kingdoms of Lanna and Lan Xang were both under the support of the Burmese.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Many pieces of Shan artwork depict a [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] in a seated position, with his right hand pointed towards the Earth; this position is commonly known as the Maravijaya Posture.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; In Buddhism, the Maravijaya pose represents Buddha calling the Earth Goddess to witness Gautama Shakyamuni’s victory over Mara.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Sculptures made in this art style were usually made of bronze and later would be sculpted with wood or in lacquer.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; Traditional Shan art typically had a Buddha with the characteristic monk's robes, or adorned with a crown and decorated with various other mediums like putty and glass.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

Shan sculptures are distinctive and easily recognizable when looking through the history of Burmese Buddhist art.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt; Shan sculptures are often identified with oval shaped faces, soft smiles, and closed relaxed eyes.&lt;ref name=Raymond /&gt;

The '''Austrian Association of Women Artists''' (German: Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs; VBKÖ)&lt;ref name="VBKO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbkoe.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/VBKOE_BESTANDSVERZEICHNIS.pdf|title=VBKO|publisher=VBKO|accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1910. The VBKÖ is located at Maysedergasse 2/4, [[Vienna]] 1010, its founding headquarters.  The association supports improvements to the economic and educational conditions of female artists, as well as promoting the artists themselves.

&lt;!-- ACTUALLY, THIS ENTIRE SECTION SEEMS TO BE A LATER ADDITION AND IS FULL OF MEANINGLESS JARGON, BEGINNING WITH THE HEADING ==Complexities and contradictions==
Organizations like this demonstrate the complexities and contradictions of contemporary [[feminist history|feminist]]-writing. It showcases the attachment of an artistic woman's movement and the history of collaboration with the Nazi regime.

(THIS PART SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN WITH HEAVY AFFECTION OR BIAS. PLEASE CHECK AND DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP IT. 
This is where the emancipatory history of an artistic women’s movement, dating back to the days of imperialism and which still has yet to be inscribed into official art history, meets the history of the collaboration with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime. Through knowledge of the gaps – resulting from historical and internal fractures in the association’s own history – history-writing and research, in regard to National Socialism and the association’s class-specific and colonial entanglements, are more easily forgotten.)

One challenge that the VBKÖ faces is to continue building structures and initiating processes for continual analysis of historical narratives anew, keeping processes of reflection active and making that knowledge public and discursive. Today, the VBKÖ exists as a space for fostering contemporary feminist artistic agendas, offering a space for experiments and promoting political and activist work, in order to establish a new and vital connection between historical debates and contemporary ['''queer(soft)'''], feminist art production. 
--&gt;

==Historical Beginnings==

Founded in 1910, VBKÖ's first president was Baronin Olga Brand-Krieghammer who oversaw the association's first six years. Broadly, the mission of VBKÖ was to make more female artists visible, though in order to achieve this, other economic, educational and health concerns required betterment as well. A program of exhibitions began from VBKÖ's inception, and these shows laid the foundations for future feminist discourse.

:“As far as mode as well as completeness are concerned, a similar [[exhibition]] to this one had so far not been organized on the continent. The fundamental idea of this exhibition is: to give the public an overview about what women have been and are able to create in the [[fine arts]], and to give new motivations to the artists”.
:&lt;small&gt;(Introduction to the first catalogue of the first exhibition of the VBKÖ: “The Art of the Woman”, held from November until December 1910, Print 1, Archive of the VBKÖ.). 
&lt;/small&gt;

[[Käthe Kollwitz]], [[Tina Blau]], [[Marie Egner]], [[Helene Funke]] and [[Olga Wisinger-Florian]] were all connected to the VBKÖ, some as active members, while others were invited to exhibit. VBKÖ rented its own studio and exhibition space, allowing artists to work outside of the established art world. The VBKÖ is one of many Euro-American organizations that support women [[artist]]s and other examples include the [[Society of Women Artists|Society of Female Artists]] London, founded in 1855; the Vereinigung der Berliner Künstlerinnen und Kunstfreunde, Berlin founded in 1867; the Société de l’Union des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs (Society of the Union of Women Painters and Sculptors), Paris, founded in 1881; and the [[National Association of Women Artists]], United States, founded in 1889.

The take! make! activate! VBKÖ-Archiv contains significant material, files, and collections from 1910 to 2005. The archive, developed by the women artists, has grown since its creation. The inventory list of the archive (compiled by Sabine Harik, Ph.D.) was released in 2006, expanded by the ''Findbuch zur Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs'' (Ed.: VBKÖ, Rudolfine Lackner) as well as the [http://www.vbkoe.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/VBKOE_BESTANDSVERZEICHNIS.pdf DOWNLOAD], for the purpose of independent preparatory research.

The '''Badeschiff''' (in English, "bathing ship") is a floating public [[swimming pool]] in [[Berlin]], the capital city of [[Germany]]. Situated in the East Harbour section of the [[Spree|River Spree]], the Badeschiff allows citizens to swim in a sanitary environment near the river. The Spree itself is far too polluted to permit safe swimming.&lt;ref name=dwbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1302942,00.html |title=A Pool with a View |first=Kyle |last=James |publisher=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=2010-05-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402000218/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C1302942%2C00.html |archivedate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Badeschiff opened in the summer of 2004 as an art project organized by the [[Stadtkunstprojekte]] (City Art Project Society) of Berlin. It was created by local artist, [[Susanne Lorenz]], with Spanish architects AMP and Gil Wilk,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komat.de/susanne-lorenz/?site=realized/09_badeschiff&amp;lang=en Susanne Lorenz's website]&lt;/ref&gt; to enliven city life along a long-neglected stretch of the Spree.&lt;ref name=dwbs/&gt;

The pool was converted from the hull of a vessel measuring eight by thirty-two metres. It is open to the public daily from 8am to midnight. Disc jockeys commonly spin records outside the pool entrance where there is also a bar.&lt;ref name=dwbs/&gt;

The '''Bubalus Period,''' also known as the '''Large Wild Fauna''' period, is the earliest known period of [[Saharan rock art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzx46VrEHE4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=Bubalus+Period&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6GPWrP1MJk&amp;sig=PM4UZCnk-0NdkZoJnDP17cigYas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HqMCS-vrDcflnAe5hPl2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bubalus%20Period&amp;f=false Methodology and African prehistory By Jacqueline Ki-Zerbo, Joseph Ki-Zerbo]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the engravings from this period have been dated between 10,000 BCE and 7,000 BCE.&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt; There are no images of pottery, cattle, or crops, which means that these carvings were mostly likely produced by a hunter-gatherer culture and not by a [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture, although the two may have existed simultaneously during a brief period of time. The majority of the rock engravings in the Large Wild Fauna style are located in what is known as the [[Maghreb]] region of the Sahara, encompassing a wide area spanning across Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia – specifically, the [[Fezzan]] region of southwestern Libya.&lt;ref name="monica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Visonà|first=Monica Blackmun|title=A History of Art in Africa - Second Edition|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 07458|isbn=0-13-612872-6|pages=22–24|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/History-of-Art-in-Africa-A/9780136128724.page}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a period of time when the desert was well-watered and fertile, this region was populated by nomadic groups known today as the [[Berber people|Berbers]] (from the Greek "barbarian," a term they used for all foreigners). Nomadic groups such as these had trade routes across the Saharan region, many of which are older than the desert itself. It is believed that the Berbers were responsible for much of the rock engravings in the area.&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt;

The names of this particular style of rock art – "Large Wild Fauna" and "Bubalus" – refer to the subject matter depicted in the majority of the engravings. Most Bubalus art consists of animals that would have been plentiful in the region when it was fertile: giraffes, elephants, and a now-extinct species of bovine known as ''[[Pelorovis|Bubalus antiquus]]''.&lt;ref name="science blogs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nalsh|first=David|title=The ‘Great bubalus’ in ancient African rock art|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2011/04/28/great-bubalus-rock-art/|publisher=Science Blogs|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The images are nearly life-sized and fairly [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] in style. The images have been carved in continuously flowing white lines that make it easy to forget that each image was painstakingly ground into the rock faces by hand. A distinct feature of this style is the outsized, rounded feet of the animals.

Other subjects depicted in the carvings include humans and animal-headed humans (a theme which is widespread in the [[Art of ancient Egypt]]). Men are shown armed with clubs, throwing sticks, axes and bows, but never spears.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hartford-hwp.com/image_archive/ta/tad.html&lt;/ref&gt; One image depicts a rhinoceros on its back, surrounded by jackal-headed humans armed with clubs. Interpretations of this image are up to debate, but some believe hunting scenes like these may refer to "[[Hunting magic]]," a ritualistic attempt to control the animals they hunted. Others think that the images are likely far more in-depth in religious meaning than that, but nothing has been determined with certainty in regard to an interpretation. We do know that the animal-headed humans depicted here definitely preceded those seen in Egypt.

After the [[Sahara]] became the desert we know today (ca., 1,000 BCE&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt;), most of its ancient inhabitants migrated to other parts of Africa, taking their culture with them. Many artistic styles throughout African history owe their origins to the early Saharan rock art.

[[File:Chapel of Amenhotep II cavetto.jpg|thumb|Cavetto cornice above torus on the "Chapel of [[Amenhotep II]]" at [[Karnak]], 15th century BC]]

A '''cavetto''' is a [[wikt:concave#Adjective|concave]] [[molding (decorative)|moulding]] with a regular curved profile that is part of a circle, widely used in [[architecture]] as well as [[furniture]], [[picture frame]]s, metalwork and other [[decorative arts]]. In describing vessels and similar shapes in [[pottery]], metalwork and related fields, "cavetto" may be used of a variety of concave curves running round objects.  The word comes from Italian, as a diminutive of ''cave'', from the Latin for "hollow" (it is the same root as [[cave]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Cavetto"&lt;/ref&gt;  A vernacular alternative is "cove", most often used where interior walls curve at the top to make a transition to the roof, or for "upside down" cavettos at the bases of elements.&lt;ref&gt;"coving" is also a word for all types of interior mouldings&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto moulding is the opposite of the [[wikt:convex#Adjective|convex]], bulging, [[ovolo]], which is equally common in the tradition of Western [[classical architecture]]. Both bring the surface forward, and are often combined with other elements of moulding.  Usually they include a curve through about a quarter-circle (90°).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  A concave moulding of about a full semi-circle is known as a "scotia".&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 132, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a minor element of decoration in [[classical architecture]], the prominent '''cavetto cornice''' is a common feature of the ancient architecture of Egypt and the [[Ancient Near East]].

==Architecture==
[[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] made especial use of large cavetto mouldings as a [[cornice]], with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a [[Molding_(decorative)#Types|torus]] moulding (convex semi-circle) below.  This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an "Egyptian cornice", "hollow and roll" or "gorge cornice", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out.&lt;ref&gt;Brier, Bob, Hobbs, A. Hoyt, ''Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians'', p. 200, 2008, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0313353069}}, 9780313353062, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1LsCh68d7kC&amp;pg=PA200 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]], with massive cavetto cornice and bell capitals]]

Many types of Egyptian capitals for columns are essentially cavettos running round the shaft, often with added decoration. These include the types known as "bell capitals" or "[[papyrus]] capitals".  These features are often reproduced in [[Egyptian Revival architecture]], as in the [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/virginia/richmond/egyptblding/medicalcollege.html Medical College of Richmond (now Egyptian Building, Medical College of Virginia)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt's neighbours and as well as appearing in early Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and [[ancient Iran]], for example at the [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC.  Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by [[Ardashir I]] (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the [[Sasanian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Collon, et al. "Iran, ancient, II, 3." Grove Art Online, [[Oxford Art Online]], Oxford University Press, accessed January 5, 2017, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T041472 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto took the place of the Greek [[cymatium]] in many [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] temples, often painted with vertical "tongue" patterns, and combined with the distinctive "Etruscan round moulding", often painted with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, 61–67; [[:File:Villa Giulia ricostruzione del tempio etrusco 01.JPG|Example in the reconstructed Etruscan temple]] at [[Villa Giulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Tachara, Persepolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC]]

This emphasis on the cavetto was very different from its role in mature [[Ancient Greek architecture]], where cavetto elements were relatively small and subordinated to essentially vertical elements, setting the style for the subsequent Western classical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Margaret M., ''A Companion to Greek Architecture'', 2016, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1444335995}}, 9781444335996, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lvAGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Often an essentially cavetto section is heavily decorated, in [[Gothic architecture]] often smothering the shape beneath.  

In general the Greeks made much more use of the cyma moulding, where a cavetto and ovolo were placed one above the other to produce a "S" shape; the [[cymatium]] using this was a standard part of the cornice in the classical [[Ionic order]], and often used elsewhere.  There are two forms, depending on which curve is uppermost: in the ''cyma recta'' the cavetto is on top, in the ''cyma reversa'' the ovolo. A cavetto alone was sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the [[Doric order]] of the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, one of the standard models for revived [[classical architecture]] from the Renaissance onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;   But small cavetto mouldings were normal at various places, including integrated ones, not distinguished as a distinct zone by lines or borders, at the bottom of the shaft of columns, beginning the transition to the wider base.  These are called an [[apophyge]], or "concave sweep".&lt;ref&gt;See labelled diagrams at Summerson, 124–126&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Claude Perrault]], the architect of [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Perrault's Colonnade|rebuilding]] of the [[Louvre Palace]], explained in his architectural textbook ''Ordonnance for the five kinds of columns after the method of the Ancients'' (1683) why he had replaced a cavetto with a cyma in his illustration of the Doric capital: "a cavetto is not as strong and is more readily broken than the other molding".&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavetto is demarcated by pairs of thin blue lines, and has [[running scroll]] decoration, different to that on either side of it in the flat middle and rim.]] 
In plates and other flattish shapes, ''cavetto'' is used for the curving area linking the base and the rim. This is the case whether the rim is a broad flat surface (typical 20th century Western plate), or merely the edge of the cavetto (typical modern cereal bowl).  Normally the term refers to the top surface of the vessel; if the underside is meant (where the curve is now convex), that may be described as "under the cavetto", "under-cavetto" and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;N. S. Brommelle, Perry Smith (eds), ''Urushi: Proceedings of the Urushi Study Group, June 10–27, 1985, Tokyo'', pp. 17–18, 1988, Getty Publications, {{ISBN|0892360968}}, 9780892360963, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uo5OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 fully online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto is very often left undecorated, but may have decoration of a different sort from the middle or a flat rim, and the term is typically used when it is necessary to describe this.  In complicated pottery shapes, where the normal vocabulary of mouldings is appropriate, cavetto may be used in that sense for any concave curving section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ec8ejUxhfVwC&amp;pg=PA44 Hellenistic Pottery and Terracottas''], By Homer A. Thompson et al., examples B42 and B43&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the terminology of [[archaeology]], especially relating to pottery (and generally not used of pottery after antiquity, or outside archaeology), a cavetto zone or cavetto is a "sharp concavity encircling the body of a vessel", and also a "deep but narrow neck", both used in relation to mainly upright vessels for storing or cooking food.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 120 (quoted); [https://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html Glossary, Tyne &amp; Wear Museums] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203201900/http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html |date=February 3, 2016 }}, with illustration; see the table of British Food Vessel types [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5192/1/Wilkin14PhD_Redacted.pdf at p. 124 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Celtic calendar''' is a compilation of pre-Christian Celtic systems of timekeeping, including the [[Coligny calendar|Gaulish Coligny calendar]], used by [[Celtic countries]] to define the beginning and length of the day, the week, the month, the seasons, quarter days, and festivals.&lt;ref name="Koch 330"&gt;Koch, John T. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia''. ABC-CLIO (2006). Page 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continental Celtic calendar==
The [[Gaulish]] [[Coligny calendar]] is possibly the oldest Celtic solar/lunar ritual calendar. It was discovered in [[Coligny, Ain|Coligny]], France, and is now on display in the Palais des Arts [[Gallo-Roman]] museum, Lyon. It dates from the end of the second century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Duval, P.M. and Pinault, G., Recueil des inscriptions gauloises, Tome 3: Les Calendriers (Coligny, Villards d'Heria), CNRS, Paris, 1986, pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Roman Empire imposed the use of the [[Julian Calendar]] in [[Roman Gaul]]. The calendar is made up of bronze fragments, in a single huge plate. It is inscribed in Gaulish with Latin characters and uses [[Roman numerals]].

The Coligny Calendar is an attempt to reconcile the cycles of the moon and sun, as is the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, the Coligny calendar considers the phases of the moon to be important, and each month always begins with the same moon phase. The calendar uses a mathematical arrangement to keep a normal 12-month calendar in sync with the moon and keeps the whole system in sync by adding an [[intercalary month]] every 2{{frac|1|2}} years. The Coligny calendar registers a five-year cycle of 62 [[lunar month]]s, divided into a "bright" and a "dark" fortnight (or half a moon cycle) each. The months were possibly taken to begin on the new moon, and a 13th [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month was added every two and a half years to align the lunations with the solar year.

The astronomical format of the calendar year that the Coligny calendar represents may well be far older, as [[calendar]]s are usually even more conservative than rites and [[cult (religion)|cult]]s. The date of its inception is unknown, but correspondences of [[Insular Celtic]] and [[Continental Celtic]] calendars suggest that some early form may date to [[Proto-Celtic]] times, roughly 800 BC. The Coligny calendar achieves a complex synchronisation of the solar and lunar months. Whether it does this for philosophical or practical reasons, it points to considerable degree of sophistication.

==Medieval Irish and Welsh calendars==
{{Further|Gaelic calendar|Welsh holidays}}
Among the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celts]], the year was divided into a light half and a dark half. As the day was seen as beginning at sunset, so the year was seen as beginning with the arrival of the darkness, at [[Calan Gaeaf]]/[[Samhain]] (1 November in the modern calendar). The light half of the year started at [[Calan Mai|Calan Haf]]/[[Bealtaine]] (1 May, modern calendar). This observance of festivals beginning the evening before the festival day is still seen in the celebrations and folkloric practices among the [[Gaels]], such as the traditions of ''[[Samhain|Oíche Shamhna]]'' (Samhain Eve) among the Irish and ''Oidhche Shamhna'' among the [[Scottish people|Scots]].&lt;ref name="Danaher"&gt;[[Kevin Danaher|Danaher, Kevin]] (1972) ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs'' Dublin: Mercier {{ISBN|1-85635-093-2}}; pp. 200–229&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;[[F. Marian McNeill|McNeill, F. Marian]] (1961) ''The Silver Bough'', Vol. 3. Glasgow: William MacLellan; p. 11-42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] said in his ''[[Gallic Wars]]'': "[the Gaulish Celts] keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night." Longer periods were reckoned in nights, as in the surviving English term fortnight meaning two weeks, and the obsolete se'nnight meaning one week.

The [[Laws of Hywel Dda]]  (in editions surviving from the 12th and 13th centuries)  make repeated references to periods of ''nine days'' (''nawfed dydd''), rather than the "eight nights" that make up the current word ''wythnos''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. ''[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/laws_hywel_dda.html Welsh Medieval Laws]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 31 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native Calendar terms in the Celtic languages==
Many calendrical and time-keeping terms used in the medieval and modern Celtic languages were borrowed from Latin and reflect the influence of Roman culture and Christianity on the Insular Celts. The words borrowed include the month names ''Januarius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Enáir}}'', Irish ''Eanáir'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Ionawr}}''), ''Februarius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Febra}}'', Irish ''Feabhra'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Chwefror}}''), ''Martius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Mart}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Mawrth}}''), ''Aprilius'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Apréil}}'', Irish ''Aibreán'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Ebrill}}''), ''Maius'' (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Mai}}''), ''Augustus'' (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|Auguist}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|Awst}}''); the names for the days of the week, ''Solis'', ''Lunae'', ''Martis'', ''Mercurii'', ''Jovis'', ''Veneris'', ''Saturni''; the terms ''septimana'' "week" (Breton ''{{lang|br|sizun}}'', Cornish ''{{lang|kw|seithun}}''), ''kalendae'' "first day of the month" (Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|callann}}'', Welsh ''{{lang|cy|calan}}'', Breton ''{{lang|br|kala}}''), ''tempore'' "time" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|tymor}}''), ''matutina'' "morning" (Cornish ''{{lang|kw|metin}}'', Irish ''maidin''), ''vespera'' "evening", ''nona'' "noon" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|nawn}}'', Irish ''nóin''), and ''ôra'' "hour" (Welsh ''{{lang|cy|awr}}'', Breton ''{{lang|cy|eur}}'', Irish ''uair'').&lt;ref&gt;Loth, Joseph.

==In Neopaganism==

In some [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religions, a "Celtic calendar" loosely based on that of [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|Medieval Ireland]] is observed for purposes of [[ritual]]. Adherents of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Reconstructionist]] traditions may celebrate the four [[Gaels|Gaelic]] festivals of [[Samhain]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]] and [[Lughnasadh]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, Kensington Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. pp.134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McColman"&gt;McColman, Carl (2003) ''Complete Idiot's Guide to Celtic Wisdom''. Alpha Press {{ISBN|0-02-864417-4}}. pp.12, 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Some eclectic Neopagans, such as [[Wicca]]ns, combine the Gaelic fire festivals with solstices and equinox celebrations derived from non-Celtic cultures to produce the modern, Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]].&lt;ref name="Hutton1"&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1991) ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and
Legacy''. Oxford, Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-18946-7}} p.337&lt;/ref&gt; Some eclectic Neopagans are also influenced by [[Robert Graves]]' "Celtic Tree Calendar", which has no foundation in historical calendars or actual ancient [[Early Irish astrology|Celtic Astrology]], instead being derived from Graves' vision of the Song of Amergin.&lt;ref name="Hutton2"&gt;Hutton (1991) pp.145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lily-M7292-As-shot-and-manual.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The left half shows the photo as it came from the digital camera. The right half shows the photo adjusted to make a gray surface neutral in the same light.]]

In [[photography]] and [[image processing]], '''color balance''' is the global adjustment of the intensities of the colors (typically red, green, and blue [[primary colors]]).  An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors – particularly neutral colors – correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called '''gray balance''', '''neutral balance''', or '''white balance'''.  Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for [[color correction]]. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than neutrals or to deliberately change them for effect.

Image data acquired by sensors – either [[photographic film|film]] or electronic [[image sensor]]s – must be transformed from the acquired values to new values that are appropriate for color reproduction or display.  Several aspects of the acquisition and display process make such color correction essential – including the fact that the acquisition sensors do not match the sensors in the human eye, that the properties of the display medium must be accounted for, and that the ambient viewing conditions of the acquisition differ from the display viewing conditions.

The color balance operations in popular [[image editing]] applications usually operate directly on the red, green, and blue channel [[pixel]] values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Gimp for Linux and Unix | author = Phyllis Davis | publisher = Peachpit Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-70253-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0sEnoWrMw-gC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Adobe Photoshop 6.0 | author = Adobe Creative Team | publisher = Adobe Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-71016-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MRtx2-0GZc4C&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; without respect to any color sensing or reproduction model.  In film photography, color balance is typically achieved by using [[color correction filter]]s over the lights or on the camera lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Cinematography: Theory and Practice : Imagemaking for Cinematographers, Directors, and Videographers | author = Blain Brown | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-240-80500-3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1JL2jFbNPNAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22 | page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalized color balance==
[[File:Color balancing girl.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of color balancing]]
Sometimes the adjustment to keep neutrals neutral is called ''white balance'', and the phrase ''color balance'' refers to the adjustment that in addition makes other colors in a displayed image appear to have the same general appearance as the colors in an original scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Introduction to Color Imaging Science | author = Hsien-Che Lee | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-84388-X | page=450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly important that neutral (gray, neutral, white) colors in a scene appear neutral in the reproduction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikondigital.org/articles/white_balance.htm White Balance]. ''Nikon Digital''. {{retrieved|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological color balance===
Humans relate to [[Human skin color|flesh tones]] more critically than other colors. Trees, grass and sky can all be off without concern, but if human flesh tones are 'off' then the human subject can look sick or dead. To address this critical color balance issue, the tri-color primaries themselves are formulated to ''not'' balance as a true neutral color. The purpose of this color primary imbalance is to more faithfully reproduce the flesh tones through the entire brightness range. 

US Patent 2,850,563 states "...effecting a non-distorted transfer of a flesh tone through the system over its entire brightness range, notwithstanding the inherent non-linear transfer characteristic of said system...".&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US2850563A/en?oq=2850563 US Patent 2,850,563] Edgar A. Gretener 1958 &lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing of the flesh altered primaries is available with a [https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIcons/ColorGuide100dpi.jpg /''Color Separation Guide''] or ''Color Control Patch'' (same thing). There are 18 color swatches on the guide; 9 at 100% density, and the same 9 at 50% density. The 3-color swatch at 50% density thereon shows the result of the flesh tone primaries, at a 1:1:1 ratio, directly.

Most digital cameras have means to select color correction based on the type of scene lighting, using either manual lighting selection, automatic white balance, or custom white balance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The algorithms for these processes perform generalized [[chromatic adaptation]].

Many methods exist for color balancing.  Setting a button on a camera is a way for the user to indicate to the processor the nature of the scene lighting. Another option on some cameras is a button which one may press when the camera is pointed at a [[gray card]] or other neutral colored object. This captures an image of the ambient light, which enables a digital camera to set the correct color balance for that light.

There is a large literature on how one might estimate the ambient lighting from the camera data and then use this information to transform the image data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed, and the quality of these has been debated. A few examples and examination of the references therein will lead the reader to many others. Examples are [[Retinex]], an [[artificial neural network]]&lt;ref name="Funt1996"&gt;Brian Funt, Vlad Cardei, and Kobus Barnard, "[http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/publications/ARIZONA/arizona_abs.html Learning color constancy]," in ''Proceedings of the Fourth IS&amp;T/SID Color Imaging Conference,'' pp. 58–60 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Bayesian method]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson2001&gt;{{Cite journal

==Chromatic colors==

Color balancing an image affects not only the neutrals, but other colors as well. An image that is not color balanced is said to have a color cast, as everything in the image appears to have been shifted towards one color.&lt;ref name="Yule1967"&gt;John A C Yule, ''Principles of Color Reproduction.'' New York: Wiley, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Color balancing may be thought in terms of removing this color cast.

Color balance is also related to [[color constancy]]. Algorithms and techniques used to attain color constancy are frequently used for color balancing, as well. Color constancy is, in turn, related to [[chromatic adaptation]]. Conceptually, color balancing consists of two steps: first, determining the [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] under which an image was captured; and second, scaling the components (e.g., R, G, and B) of the image or otherwise transforming the components so they conform to the viewing illuminant.

Viggiano found that white balancing in the camera's native [[RGB color model]] tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less distortion of the colors) than in monitor RGB for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt; This difference typically amounted to a factor of more than two in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the [[Raw image format|raw image data]] will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing in monitor RGB.

==Mathematics of color balance==
Color balancing is sometimes performed on a three-component image (e.g., [[RGB color model|RGB]]) using a 3x3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. This type of transformation is appropriate if the image was captured using the wrong white balance setting on a digital camera, or through a color filter.

===Scaling monitor R, G, and B===
In principle, one wants to scale all relative luminances in an image so that objects which are believed to be [[grey|neutral]] appear so. If, say, a surface with &lt;math&gt;R=240&lt;/math&gt; was believed to be a white object, and if 255 is the count which corresponds to white, one could multiply all [[red]] values by 255/240. Doing analogously for [[green]] and [[blue]] would result, at least in theory, in a color balanced image. In this type of transformation the 3x3 matrix is a [[diagonal matrix]].

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are the color balanced red, green, and blue components of a [[pixel]] in the image; &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of the image before color balancing, and &lt;math&gt;R'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of a pixel which is believed to be a white surface in the image before color balancing. This is a simple scaling of the red, green, and blue channels, and is why color balance tools in [[Photoshop]] and the [[GIMP]] have a white eyedropper tool.  It has been demonstrated that performing the white balancing in the phosphor set assumed by [[sRGB]] tends to produce large errors in chromatic colors, even though it can render the neutral surfaces perfectly neutral.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"&gt;J A Stephen Viggiano, "[http://www.acolyte-color.com/papers/EI_2004.pdf Comparison of the accuracy of different white balancing options as quantified by their color constancy]." ''Sensors and Camera Systems for Scientific, Industrial, and Digital Photography Applications V: Proceedings of the SPIE,'' volume 5301. Bellingham, WA: SPIE: the International Society for Optical Engineering, p 323-333 (2004), retrieved online 2008-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scaling X, Y, Z===
If the image may be transformed into [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ tristimulus values]], the color balancing may be performed there.  This has been termed a “wrong von Kries” transformation.&lt;ref name=Terstiege1972&gt;{{Cite journal

Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been demonstrated to offer usually poorer results than balancing in monitor RGB, it is mentioned here as a bridge to other things. Mathematically, one computes:

where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are the color-balanced tristimulus values; &lt;math&gt;X_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of the viewing illuminant (the white point to which the image is being transformed to conform to); &lt;math&gt;X'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z'&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image. If the tristimulus values of the monitor primaries are in a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L_B&lt;/math&gt; are the un-[[gamma correction|gamma corrected]] monitor RGB, one may use:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}X_w/X'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; Y_w/Y'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; Z_w/Z'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Von Kries's method===
[[Johannes von Kries]], whose theory of [[rod cell|rods]] and three color-sensitive [[cone cell|cone]] types in the [[retina]] has survived as the dominant explanation of color sensation for over 100 years, motivated the method of converting color to the [[LMS color space]], representing the effective stimuli for the Long-, Medium-, and Short-wavelength cone types that are modeled as adapting independently.  A 3x3 matrix converts RGB or XYZ to LMS, and then the three LMS primary values are scaled to balance the neutral; the color can then be converted back to the desired final [[color space]]:&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{Cite book| title = Digital Color Imaging Handbook | author =  Gaurav Sharma| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AkByHKRGTsQC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22von+Kries%22 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8493-0900-X | page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L \\ M \\ S \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1/L'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1/M'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1/S'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}L' \\ M' \\ S' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are the color-balanced LMS cone tristimulus values; &lt;math&gt;L'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image.

Matrices to convert to LMS space were not specified by von Kries, but can be derived from CIE color matching functions and LMS color matching functions when the latter are specified; matrices can also be found in reference books.&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;

===Scaling camera RGB===
By Viggiano's measure, and using his model of gaussian camera spectral sensitivities, most camera RGB spaces performed better than either monitor RGB or XYZ.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt;  If the camera's raw RGB values are known, one may use the 3x3 diagonal matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and then convert to a working RGB space such as [[sRGB]] or [[Adobe RGB]] after balancing.
&lt;!-- in progress!
However, if one has already converted to monitor RGB, one may still work in camera RGB if a 3x3 [[regular matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the camera's color mixing behavior reasonably well, so that:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]\approx\mathbf{A}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

(This matrix is included in the [[ICC profile]] for some cameras.&lt;ref name="ICC01_2006"&gt;International Color Consortium, ''Specification ICC.1:2004-10 (Profile version 4.2.0.0) Image technology colour management — Architecture, profile format, and data structure'', (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;) If this matrix is known, one computes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}A^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}R_w/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; G_w/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; B_w/B'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{A\cdotP}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the phosphor matrix mentioned in the previous section; &lt;math&gt;L_{Rw}&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;G_w&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;B_w&lt;/math are the
--&gt;

===Preferred chromatic adaptation spaces===
Comparisons of images balanced by diagonal transforms in a number of different RGB spaces have identified several such spaces that work better than others, and better than camera or monitor spaces, for chromatic adaptation, as measured by several [[color appearance model]]s; the systems that performed statistically as well as the best on the majority of the image test sets used were the "Sharp", "Bradford", "CMCCAT", and "ROMM" spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/getfile.py?recid=34049&amp;mode=best | title = Chromatic Adaptation Performance of Different RGB Sensors |author1=Sabine Süsstrunk |author2=Jack Holm |author3=Graham D. Finlayson | journal = IS&amp;T/SPIE Electronic Imaging | volume = 4300|date=January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General illuminant adaptation===
The best color matrix for adapting to a change in illuminant is not necessarily a diagonal matrix in a fixed color space.  It has long been known that if the space of illuminants can be described as a linear model with ''N'' basis terms, the proper color transformation will be the weighted sum of ''N'' fixed linear transformations, not necessarily consistently diagonalizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Laurence T.

[[File:IMA Conservation Technician 4.jpg|thumb|250px|A conservation technician examining an artwork under a microscope at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]]]
The '''conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of items of historical and personal value made primarily from [[paper]], [[parchment]], and [[leather]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] conservation activities are generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Paper-based items, such as [[books]], scrapbooks, [[manuscripts]], maps, deeds, [[newspapers]], drawings, water colors, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Even paper [[ephemera]] like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, "Preservation Measures for Newspapers", Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/newspap.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was [[Alfred Bonnardot]]'s ''Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres'', first published in Paris in 1846.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Jeremy |title=Alfred Bonnardot Issues the First Book on the Restoration of Rare Books and their Bindings (1846) |website=HistoryofInformation.com |url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrov"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrov |first1=Ferdinand |title=The art of painting and the art of restoration |date=2015 |publisher=Ferdinand Petrov |location=Vancouver, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Inherent vice ===
[[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|Inherent vice]] is "the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain".&lt;ref&gt;National Postal Museum, "Inherent Vice," ''Smithsonian'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stamp/5d_preserving3.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries.&lt;ref name="CCI418"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Paper Documents and Newspaper Clippings |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of [[lignin]] in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the [[cellulose]], which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time.&lt;ref&gt;Dava Tobey, "Preserving History," ''Minnesota Historical Society'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/nytimes_preserving.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;ref name=S30&gt;Shelley (1992), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books are inherently complex; they are often made of mixed materials ranging from parchment, leather, fabric, adhesives and thread. Some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. [[Iron gall ink]], most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions.&lt;ref name="CCI419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Books |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002|accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used to make books contain hundreds of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) that break down over time. They are released into the air, where they become detectable as "old-book smell". A book's smell can provide conservators with hints as to its condition. Decomposing [[cellulose]] emits [[furfural]], which has an almond-like scent. [[Lignin]] releases [[benzaldehyde]] and [[vanillin]] with a vanilla smell. [[Hexanal]] from cellulose and lignin gives off an earthy smell.  Researchers have attempted to profile the smell of old books and relate human perceptions of smell to their chemical sources. “Chocolate” and “coffee”  are the most frequently used descriptors from the Historic Paper Odour Wheel.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derieux"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lattuati-Derieux |first1=Agnès |last2=Bonnassies-Termes |first2=Sylvette |last3=Lavédrine |first3=Bertrand |title=Identification of volatile organic compounds emitted by a naturally aged book using solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |date=February 2004 |volume=1026 |issue=1-2 |pages=9–18 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2003.11.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephemera]], as the name implies, was never made to survive. Flyers, postcards, and programs are often printed on poor quality paper, carelessly handled, and likely to be haphazardly displayed or stored.&lt;ref name=L33&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pests ===
Insects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles.&lt;ref name=MCB&gt;Mary C. Baughman, “Approaches to Insect Problems in Paper and Books,” ''Harry Ransom Center'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/conservation/resources/insects/].&lt;/ref&gt; Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; To best discourage infestation, a clean and dust-free environment is desirable: food and drink should be kept away from storage areas. If pests are discovered, they should first be identified so that appropriate measures can be taken.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; Freezing the collection items is an option for pest mitigation: ideally (for dealing with most insects) the center of the item should be frozen within four hours at a temperature of -20&amp;nbsp;°C (about -4 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 72 hours, following which the materials may be thawed over a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and [[fumigation]] is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

=== Environmental conditions ===
Extremes of temperature or relative [[humidity]] are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high).&lt;ref name=S29&gt;Shelley (1992), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather book bindings to crack.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerates mold growth, [[foxing]], staining, blooming, disintegration, and "[[red rot]]" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat.&lt;ref&gt;Cameo, "Cockling", ''Museum of Fine Arts Boston'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Cockling].&lt;/ref&gt; Precise environmental levels for optimal preservation will depend on whether the collection is for use, storage, or a combination: in general, a cool environment (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and relatively dry air (between 30-50% relative humidity) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, "Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation", ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Air quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects.&lt;ref name=SLV&gt;State Library of Victoria, "Caring for Works on Paper", ''State Library of Victoria'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/explore/conservation-guides/caring-works-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

All kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.

===Handling===
[[File:RDZ des Historischen Archivs der Stadt Köln - Gefriertrocknungsanlage und Archivgut-2278.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A paper conservator handling a book.]]
Other than a poor environment, poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; Recommendations for good handling to minimize damage include:
* A clean work area and clean hands. Food and drink should be kept away from collection materials, and smoking avoided. Hands should be washed and dried immediately before handling collection items. Hand lotions, creams and wipes should never be used prior to handling items.&lt;ref name=HRC&gt;Harry Ransom Center, “Ransom Center Guidelines: Safe Handling of Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts,” ''The University of Texas at Austin'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/pubmnem/MEM_RR_Handling_8_10%20rev.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gloves should be worn only when absolutely necessary, as they may reduce dexterity and feeling.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; If worn, they should be clean white cotton gloves. 
* Loose clothing, jewelry, or buttons, may all cause damage, and should be kept under control. The user should ensure he or she is seated or standing in a stable position. Precautions should be taken if he or she is suffering from a cold.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
* The bookmarking of pages by use of paper clips, acidic inserts, or the folding of page corners should be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of rubber bands, self-adhesive tape, any kind of "leather dressing", or glue should all be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCSOB&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Books," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/books.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Adhesives can leave stains and a damaging residue.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; 
* A book should not be forced further than its natural opening. Instead, the covers may be propped on foam wedges to decrease the opening angle, and the pages held open using book snake weights.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The turning of pages by the top corner instead of the bottom may help prevent tears.&lt;ref name=L36&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The pages of a bound manuscript should be turned slowly, and the leaves flexed as little as possible, because decorations and inks may no longer be firmly attached to parchment leaves.&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt;
* Books should be removed from the shelf by gripping on both sides of the spine at the middle (having, if necessary, pushed in the neighboring book on both sides to get a good grip).&lt;ref name=LOCSOB /&gt; Both hands should be used when removing large or heavy books from a shelf. If the volume is horizontal in a stack of books, the books above it should be removed first.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Pencil, not ink, should be used to make any necessary marks or inscriptions. Inscriptions should only be made when the paper is on a clean hard surface to avoid embossing the inscription into the paper.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;
* A work in paper should not be lifted by its edges. Instead, a thin support such as a folder or foam board should be used.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;Dixie Nielson, "Object Handling," in ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'', eds. Rebecca Buck and Jean Allman Gilmore. (Washington, DC: AAM Press, 2010), 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parchment is not as flexible as paper, and is more resistant to unfolding. It should not be forced.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photocopying that forces books to lie flat should be avoided. This may damage the spine and weaken pages.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Items should not be piled on one another, and, for oversized items, a large clear space should be prepared. Maps and blueprints that have been rolled may be gently unfolded or unrolled if they are not brittle or weak. They can also be placed under light weight for a few weeks to relax.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage methods and materials ==
[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|thumb|250px|A paper conservator surveying a collection of materials in storage.]]
Good storage can extend the life of an item and is an important aspect of preventative conservation. Storage should be cool, dry, clean, and stable.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt; Items should be kept away from radiators or vents, which can cause environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;

Manuscripts and paper documents should be stored in protective archival-quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials.&lt;ref name=OSE&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, “Storage Enclosures for Books and Artifacts on Paper,” ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.4-storage-enclosures-for-books-and-artifacts-on-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Documents that might be handled often may be stored or encapsulated in a clear [[polyester]] (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials.&lt;ref name=OSE /&gt; Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube.&lt;ref name=L42&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the rolled item may also be covered with archival quality paper.&lt;ref name=L42 /&gt;

The best shelving for books is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt; If a book is removed from the shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt;

==Active conservation and repair techniques==
*'''Surface cleaning''': Paper and leather can be dusted with a soft brush, and dust can be removed from books with a vacuum cleaner that has a cheesecloth tied over the nozzle.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt; Nonchemical vulcanized rubber sponges or nonabrasive erasing materials such as vinyl erasers are also used. Care must be taken: an inappropriate cleaning technique could permanently ingrain dirt or remove media.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
*'''Mold and insect removal''': Insect accretions and mold residues are normally removed by scalpels, aspirators, or specialized vacuum cleaners. Deep freezing may be appropriate to kill insects.&lt;ref name=NUA&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Works of Art and Unbound Artifacts on Paper," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.5-conservation-treatment-for-works-of-art-and-unbound-artifacts-on-paper]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adhesive removal''': Some adhesive materials are acidic and harmful to paper, causing stains. Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue can be removed in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and pressure-sensitive (self-adhering) tapes usually have to be dissolved or softened with an organic solvent before they can be removed. Steam is sometimes helpful to remove adhesive.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Washing and alkalization''': Washing not only removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; it can also wash out acidic compounds and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an alkaline buffer to paper is sometimes recommended for de-acidification. Alkalization can be achieved by immersion or by spraying.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Mending and filling''': Severe tears that cannot be stabilized with polyester film can usually be mended on the reverse with narrow strips of torn [[Japanese tissue]]. The strips are adhered with a permanent, nonstaining adhesive such as starch paste or methyl cellulose. Holes or paper losses may be filled individually with Japanese paper, with paper pulp, or with a paper carefully chosen to match the original in weight, texture, and color.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Sewing and rebinding''': Books with broken sewing, loose or detached boards or leaves require special care.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Several techniques are used in conservation binding. The original sewing in a volume should be retained if this is possible; it can be reinforced using new linen thread and sewing supports.&lt;ref name=NBM&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Bound Materials of Value," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.6-conservation-treatment-for-bound-materials-of-value]&lt;/ref&gt; If the original binding is too deteriorated, the book may be rebound with new archival safe materials. An alternative to a leather-covered laced-in structure is a split-board structure, which can be covered in leather or cloth.&lt;ref name=NBM /&gt; 
*'''Backing''': Weak or brittle paper may be reinforced by backing them with another sheet of paper. Again, Japanese paper can be used as a backing, adhered with a starch paste.
*'''Flattening''': Flattening is always necessary following aqueous treatment. Flattening is also helpful for rolled or folded paper that cannot gently and safely be opened. It is usually done between blotters or felts under moderate pressure.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Emergencies and disasters''': Most natural or man-made disasters, such as floods or fire, involve water. Even a small amount of water from a leaky roof or pipe can do significant damage to a paper collection. Immediate response by a knowledgeable professional or agency within the first 48 hours is crucial to the successful salvage of materials and the prevention of mold growth. Wet paper or books may be frozen to stabilize them; they can be thawed and dried at a later time.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt;

== Reformatting options ==
Reformatting options include photocopying, [[Digitizing|digitization]], and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;

In spite of the [[digital revolution]], preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dalton. [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/6.-reformatting/6.1-microfilm-and-microfiche "Microfilm and Microfiche"]. ''Northeast Document Conservation Center''. Accessed 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional conservators ==
In general, the cleaning and repair of paper documents and books should ideally be assigned to a professional conservator.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CYT&gt;AIC, "Caring for Your Treasures," ''American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures#.U13JgK1dX4g].&lt;/ref&gt; Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) or the [[Guild of Bookworkers]] (both in the United States), or the [[Archives and Records Association]] (in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

'''Croatian Writers' Association''' ({{lang-hr|Društvo hrvatskih književnika}}; abbreviated '''DHK''') is the official association of [[Croatia]]n writers. It was founded in 1900 in [[Zagreb]] with the goal "to unite writers and help them support one another, and promote [[Croatian literature]] regardless of political objectives", "to protect the interests and increase the reputation of writers" and "supports its members and their orphans."&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=16330 |contribution=Društvo hrvatskih književnika (DHK) |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=January 25, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1897 the Croatian Writers' Club (''Klub hrvatskih književnika'') unofficially operated as part of the Association of Croatian Artists (''Društvo hrvatskih umjetnika ''), and was led by [[Milivoj Dežman]]. In 1898 the first informal agreement on the establishment of the Croatian Writers' Association was held, and a regulatory proposal was written. [[Matica hrvatska]] in 1899 approved the establishment of a separate Association, and on March 17, 1900 the government approvod its rules. Rules established four categories of members: real members (''pravi članovi''), association founders (''zakladnici''), founders (''utemeljitelji'') and associate members (''izvanredni članovi'').&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

At the inaugural meeting on April 2, 1900, held in the presence of 103 writers, [[Ivan Trnski]] was elected for the first president of the Association. In 1906 a monthly Contemporary (''Savremenik'') was launched. At the end of the 1908 the series Modern Croatian Writers (''Suvremeni hrvatski pisci'') was established, which was particularly prominent under the editorship of [[Julije Benešić]] (1909–1920). It was in that series that the famous anthology Croatian Young Lyric (''Hrvatska mlada lirika '') was published in 1914.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

The association's first years were marked by convergent efforts towards Matica Hrvatska – the association's publications of the Modern Croatian Writers series and the magazine ''Contemporary'' were supported by Matica hrvatska as possibly jointly published. At the same time the association advocated literary unity of [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]], and proposals were made to issue a common literary magazine. In 1914 the association was temporarily suspended by a government decision due to the [[World War I]]. The postwar efforts of the association were marked by a support to [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[orthography|orthographic]] unification of Croats and Serbs.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

Due to failed agreements with Matica hrvatska, financial deficit and a fierce competition of the newly established magazines, the ''Contemporary'' ceased to be published in 1922, and after being temporarily issued in 1923 it was resuspended in 1924–1926. The topic of the establishment of the Yugoslav Writers' Association was actively discussed, and after a proposal of the Association of Writers in Belgrade "for all writers of our country be united in one association", the Committee of the Croatian Writers' Association replied in 1927 that it such initiatives are still premature, and has proposed an alliance of autonomous associations instead.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

The death of [[Stjepan Radić]] all the more strengthened the Croatian national spirit of the association. The Association operated during the period of [[Independent State of Croatia]] as well. In 1945 the Association was renamed the Association of Writers of Croatia (''Društvo književnika Hrvatske''), new rules were approved and a new board was elected with [[Luka Perković]] as the president. A few dozen writers were punished by prohibiting their public work and a temporary suspension of having their works published.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In 1949 the Second Congress of the Writers' Union of Yugoslavia was held in Zagreb, in which the new administration was elected with [[Ivo Andrić]] as the President, and the board consisting of [[Miroslav Krleža]], [[Marin Franičević]], [[Josip Barković]], [[Petar Šegedin (writer)|Petar Šegedin]], [[Viktor Car Emin]] and [[Slavko Kolar]]. In 1964 the association's plenum unanimously adopted the [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language]], and during the [[Croatian Spring]] the association stood with Matica hrvatska in support the movement. In the 1980s, especially after the last congress of the Writers' Union of Yugoslavia in Novi Sad in 1985, the association was more actively involved in political life, usually by writing [[open letter]]s in defense of [[Croatian language]], or [[civil rights]] of individual writers. In 1990 the original name of the Association was restored.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In 2002 several former members, dissatisfied with the state of the association, founded the [[Croatian Writers' Society]] (''Hrvatsko društvo pisaca'').&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

==Association today==
The association has regional chapters in [[Pula]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Osijek]] and [[Čakovec]]. It issues several magazines: Bridge (''Most''), Republic (''Republika'') and ''Korabljica''. The series Contemporary Croatian Writers has been renewed under the name Library of the Croatian Writers' Association (''Knjižnica Društva hrvatskih književnika''). Several literary awards have been established.

'''''El Jaleo''''' is a large painting by [[John Singer Sargent]], depicting a Spanish Gypsy dancer performing to the accompaniment of musicians. Painted in 1882, it currently hangs in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston.

==Background==
The painting was inspired by a five-month trip Sargent made through Spain and North Africa in 1879, which also yielded a smaller oil painting, ''The Spanish Dance'' ([[Hispanic Society of America]]).&lt;ref name="Thornson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=THORSON|first1=ALICE|title=Mysterious, seductive and a little dangerous John Singer Sargent's superb 'El Jaleo' defies the curse of primitivism|publisher=The Kansas City Star|date=May 17, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hispanicsociety.emuseum.com/objects/3453/the-spanish-dance ''The Spanish Dance''], Hispanic Society of America&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically and thematically, the painting is related to a series of works Sargent painted during a subsequent stay in Venice; these, too, include dramatic light effects, exotic models, and restrained coloring.&lt;ref name="K2"&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by the costumes and theatrical manner of Gypsy dance, the artist returned to Paris and began work on a large canvas whose scale suggested a performing stage.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;Chong, et al, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''El Jaleo'' refers to both the broad meaning of ''jaleo'', a ruckus, as well as the specific dance known as ''jaleo de jerez''.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Prettejohn, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|thumb|left|''Spanish Dancer'', 1879-82. A preparatory oil study for the main figure in ''El Jaleo''.  Private collection. ]]

Sargent planned the composition of ''El Jaleo'' for at least a year.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt; The painting was preceded by a series of preliminary studies, focusing particularly on the dancer's stylized posture. The result of thorough preparation, ''El Jaleo'' is characterized by an assured and rapid handling, and may have been completed in no more than a few days.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sargent - Capri.jpg|thumb|Sargent's painting ''Capri'' (1878) depicts [[Rosina Ferrara]] dancing the [[tarantella]], and anticipates the [[flamenco]] of ''El Jaleo''.&lt;ref&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.]]
Almost {{convert|12|feet}} wide, ''El Jaleo'' is broadly painted in a nearly monochromatic palette, but for spots of red at the right and an orange at left, which is reminiscent of the lemons [[Édouard Manet]] inserted into several of his large paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; At odds with the academic practice of carefully modulated tones, Sargent dramatized the contrast between rich blacks and the shining white skirt of the dancer, caught in the strong footlights and painted briskly so as to suggest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn, p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; The lighting also creates long and eerie shadows on the rear wall that comprises nearly half the painting.

The female dancer, leaning asymmetrically, is placed to imply forward motion, from left to right across the canvas.&lt;ref name="P1" /&gt; She is wearing a large, embroidered shawl wrapped around her shoulders, illustrating common flamenco costuming.&lt;ref name="Heller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=Nancy|title=What's There, What's Not: A Performer's View of Sargent's 'El Jaleo'|journal=American Art|date=2000|volume=14|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dancer's pose, with the outstretched left arm, is a depiction of standard flamenco dance technique and style.&lt;ref name="Heller" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' is the most theatrical of Sargent's early major works.&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;Kilmurray, Ormond, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a barrier between the viewer and dancer helps create the illusion that we are present at the actual event; the manipulation of space and lighting communicates the energetic rhythms of the dance, its sound and movement.&lt;ref name="K1" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' is an example of Hispanism, the phenomenon of widespread fascination with Spanish culture throughout Europe and America in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Heller" /&gt;

The painting has been called both an example of John Singer Sargent's [[Impressionism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Ann|title="John Singer Sargent and the Dance" by Danceview, 1992 in Critical Gestures: Writings on Dance and Culture|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also his early affinity with the [[Realist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbrother, Trevor. John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist. 1st ed. p. 102.: Yale UP, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Sargent exhibited ''El Jaleo'' at the 1882 [[Paris Salon]], where the painting was purchased by a Boston patron, [[T. Jefferson Coolidge|Thomas Jefferson Coolidge]].&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt; It was the last subject picture that Sargent exhibited at the Salon, and his greatest success there.&lt;ref name="K2" /&gt;

In 1888 the painting was publicly exhibited in Boston, at which time museum patron [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], the heiress wife of a Coolidge cousin, expressed her interest in it.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt; In 1914 she borrowed ''El Jaleo'' to exhibit in her museum, and constructed the Spanish Cloister gallery especially for ''El Jaleo'', which is framed by a Moorish arch.&lt;ref&gt;Chong, et al, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardnermuseum.org/education/exploringarchpopup.html Gardner Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge then gave the painting to Gardner, and Sargent presented her with an album of pencil drawings he had made as preparatory sketches for the work.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;

''El Jaleo'' was on exhibition at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. for a short time in 1992, on loan from the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] for the first time since 1914. At that time, the painting had been recently cleaned and restored by Alain Goldrach.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney|first1=Louise|title=Sargent's 'El Jaleo' Dances Anew - National Gallery plays host to the famed portraitist's restored painting|journal=Christian Science Monitor|date=March 10, 1992|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception== 
After the initial exhibition of ''El Jaleo'' in 1882 at the French Salon, John Singer Sargent became, as one writer put it, "the most talked-about painter in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;"The Salon. From an Englishman's Point of View." Art Journal (London) 44. no. 7 (July 1882): 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson68"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 68: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics in 1882 said that the painting caused Sargent to join the ranks of the French Impressionists.&lt;ref name="Simpson51"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 51: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A critic for the ''Le Figaro'' called the painting "one of the most original and strongest works of the present Salon."&lt;ref name="Simpson53"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 53: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers hailed the painting as clever, while others dismissed it as a vagary of the artist.&lt;ref name="Simpson5859"&gt;Simpson, Marc. Uncanny Spectacle The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent. p. 58-59: YALE UP, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today ''El Jaleo'' is considered to be one of [[John Singer Sargent]]'s most memorable works.

[[File:Entropa-rectangular.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Entropa'' sculpture on display in the hall of the [[Justus Lipsius building]] in [[Brussels]].]]

'''''Entropa''''' is a [[sculpture]] by [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[David Černý]]. The project was commissioned by the Czech Republic to mark the occasion of its [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], and was originally designed as a collaboration for 27 artists and artist groups from all member countries of the [[European Union]]. However, as a [[hoax]], Černý and three of his assistants created a [[satire|satirical]] and controversial piece that depicted pointed stereotypes of the EU member nations. Fake artist profiles were also created by Černý and his accomplices, complete with invented descriptions of their supposed contributions.

The sculpture was unveiled informally on 12 January 2009, followed by its official media launch date three days later. The sculpture was originally on display in the [[Justus Lipsius building]] in [[Brussels]].  Between September 2010 and March 2012, the sculpture was on exhibit at the [[Techmania Science Center]] in [[Plzeň]]. A copy of the sculpture has also been planned for the Nová Scéna cafe in the [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="divad"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/41687-i-slovaci-kritizuji-entropu-presto-ozdobi-narodni-divadlo/ | title=I Slováci kritizují Entropu, přesto ozdobí Národní divadlo | work=ČT24.cz | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The [[Council of the European Union]] adheres to a rotational presidency system, whereby the governments of member countries exchange leadership every six months. It is customary for the presiding country to place an exhibit in the Justus Lipsius building, with past works avoiding [[controversy]]. For example, France, which had held the presidency before the Czech Republic, simply erected a large balloon in the [[Flag of France|French national colours]] in honor of the tradition.&lt;ref name="provo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/11/europe/brussels.php | title=Czech Republic chooses a bit of provocation to herald its EU presidency | work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=11 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Castle | first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme ==
''Entropa'' is an ironic jab at the issue of [[European integration]] and the stereotypes associated with each country within the [[European Union]]. It is subtitled '"Stereotypes are barriers to be demolished", along with the Czech European Union Presidency's motto of "Europe without barriers". According to David Černý, the sculpture's primary artist, ''Entropa'' "lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would-be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7827738.stm | title=Czech EU art stokes controversy | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Times Online]]'', Černý stated that the sculpture was influenced by the [[Monty Python]] brand of humour.&lt;ref name="monty"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5518579.ece | title=David Cerny says hoax EU sculpture inspired by Monty Python | work=[[The Times Online]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Charter}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the launch ceremony, he added [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and ''[[Les Guignols de l'info]]''{{'}}s portrayal of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as other influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vondra-odhalil-v-bruselu-kontroverzni-plastiku-omluvil-se-urazenym-1ji-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090115_115040_zahranicni_lpo | title=Vondra odhalil v Bruselu kontroverzní plastiku, omluvil se uraženým | work=[[iDnes.cz]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is made of [[glass-reinforced plastic]] and the joints of [[steel]].  It covers approximately {{convert|256|m2}}, measuring {{convert|16.4|m}} high and {{convert|16.5|m}} wide.  Three-quarters of the weight comes from the frame, making up a combined total of 8 tonnes.  It resembles the parts of a [[model kit]], containing pieces in the shapes of the 27 [[member states of the EU]]. Each piece has a distinctive theme that portrays stereotypes about the country, some of which are portrayed in a particularly provocative manner. Among the pieces which have attracted the most attention are those of Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Slovakia.

The sculpture was installed between 5 and 11 January 2009 in the presence of David Černý, three assistants, four climbers, two technicians, two cameramen and a representative of the Czech Permanent Representation to the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedex.cz/realizace/entropa.php?gclid=COfR2qTXpZgCFUoa3godxxX-lw |title=Entropa - Výroba rámu plastiky Davida Černého |publisher=[[VEDeX]] |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=24 January 2009 |language=cs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718190032/http://www.vedex.cz/realizace/entropa.php?gclid=COfR2qTXpZgCFUoa3godxxX-lw |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nations included in the sculpture ===
With no clear indication made by the artist nor by the official presentation, various interpretations of a single country can be drawn, and this list is by no means definite.  Some of the physical pieces differ slightly from the form presented in the official booklet:

* '''Austria''', a known opponent of atomic energy, is depicted as a green field dominated by nuclear power plant [[cooling tower]]s with vapour coming out of them at intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/index.php?article[gallery][detail_id]=492030&amp;article[gallery][from]=&amp;article[gallery][id]=338530&amp;article[id]=32782980&amp;p=012000_d#fg | work=Ihned.cz | title=Nastal těžký den v Bruselu.

* '''Belgium''' is presented as a box of half-eaten [[Praline]] chocolates with the pattern of Brussels waffles.
*'''[[Bulgaria]]''' is depicted by a series of connected "Turkish" [[squat toilet]]s with neon lights connecting and illuminating them. This piece of the sculpture was later hidden with fabric.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;&lt;ref name="german-wave-bulgaria-covered"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,3961199,00.html|title=Czechs Cloak Bulgaria "Toilet" Portrait from Hoax Artwork|author=DFW staff (dfm)|date=20 January 2009|accessdate=20 January 2009|quote=The Czech EU presidency on Tuesday cloaked a segment of a controversial art installation in Brussels that portrays Bulgaria as a psychedelic Turkish squat toilet.|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Cyprus]]''' is cut in half.
* The '''[[Czech Republic]]''''s own piece is an [[LED display]], which flashes controversial quotations by Czech President [[Václav Klaus]].
* '''Denmark''' is depicted as being built out of [[Lego]] bricks, and some claim to see in the depiction a face reminiscent of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoon controversy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/kultura/umeni/clanek.phtml?id=627065 | work=Centrum.cz | title=Černý v plastice složil Dánům z lega proroka Mohammeda | date=14 January 2009 | language=Czech | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Wohlmuth | first=Radek}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the resemblance has been denied by Černý.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7830498.stm | title=Czechs apologise for hoax EU art | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Finland''' is depicted as a [[Parquetry|wooden floor]] including a male with a rifle lying down, imagining an [[elephant]],  a [[hippo]] and a [[crocodile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/entropa-finland-with-elephant-hippo/13450994 | title=Entropa: Finland With Elephant, Hippo | work=[[mefeedia]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''France''' is draped in a "{{lang|fr|GRÈVE!}}" ("[[Strike action|STRIKE]]!") banner.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;

* '''Greece''' is depicted as a forest that has been entirely burned, possibly representing the [[2007 Greek forest fires]] or the [[2008 civil unrest in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Skai TV]], [http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=107392 Καμένη η Ελλάδα σε αμφιλεγόμενο έκθεμα] ''(English Machine translation: [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=el&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php%3Fid%3D107392 Greece burnt in controversial exhibit])''.

* '''Italy''' is depicted as a [[soccer|football]] pitch&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt; with several players who appear to be [[Masturbation|masturbating]], possibly indicating what some see as the country's "fetish for football".&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;
*'''[[Latvia]]''' is shown as covered with mountains, in contrast to its actual [[Geography of Latvia#Physical environment|flat landscape]].
*'''[[Lithuania]]''' includes a series of dressed ''[[Manneken Pis]]''-style figures urinating, with the streams of urine being illuminated by yellow glass fibres.

* The '''United Kingdom''', known for its [[Euroscepticism]] and relative isolation from Europe, is "included" as a missing piece (an empty space) at the top-left of the sculpture.&lt;ref name="inpictures"/&gt;

== Reaction ==
''Entropa'' has inspired debate in Europe since the day of its first unveiling. Various commentators have noted that this is probably the first such exhibition in the history of art displays on behalf of the rotary Presidency of the EU Council that has been controversial in nature, contrasted by the fact that such pieces usually go by unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brunowaterfield/8082531/Europe_needs_the_shocking_Czechs/ | first=Bruno | last=Waterfield | title=Europe needs the 'shocking' Czechs | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work drew what has been described by one reporter as "a never-before-seen crowd."&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;  It has been praised by some viewers for being "hilarious" and for inspiring discussion about art, but has angered and offended others.&lt;ref name="rnw"/&gt;

In June 2009, David Černý himself said that he expected completely different reactions than those described below. In his opinion, Bulgaria doesn't even make it to the top three of the most provocative countries caricatured by ''Entropa''. The most provocative country is Poland, with the reference to gays. It is followed by the UK (missing) and Slovakia that, according to Mr Černý, is a bubble restricted by Hungary.

=== Political controversy ===

[[File:Entropa-Bulgaria-covered.jpg|right|thumb|The sculpture of Bulgaria on 22 January 2009 covered by black fabric]]

On 13 January 2009, the day after the exhibit was informally unveiled, [[Bulgaria]]'s ambassador to the EU registered the country's protest with the [[European Commission]], and sent a formal protest note to the Czech government. Bulgaria's depiction in the sculpture, as a series of [[squat toilet]]s, is one of the most provocative, and after the informal unveiling of ''Entropa'', the Bulgarian government demanded that the sculpture be taken down before its official launching.&lt;ref name="the times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5517736.ece | accessdate=15 January 2009 | work=[[The Times]] | last=Hines | first=Nico |author2=David Charter | title=Hoax EU sculpture by David Cerny sparks diplomatic spat | date=14 January 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action was never taken, but after continuing complaints, the Bulgarian depiction was covered with black fabric on 20 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesko-vyhovelo-bulharum-z-bruselske-plastiky-zmizel-turecky-zachod-1ia-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090120_073855_zahranicni_jte | title=Česko vyhovělo Bulharům, z bruselské plastiky zmizel turecký záchod | language=Czech| accessdate=20 January 2009&lt;!--, 11:46 CET --&gt;| work=Idnes.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals outside the government, as well, expressed outrage about the portrayal:
{{quote|It is one thing portraying, say, France as a country on strike, but quite another to show my homeland as a toilet. That is downright wrong.|Georgi Gotev, Bulgarian journalist&lt;ref name="bulga"/&gt;}}
Bulgarian news portal News.bg commented that the country's deputy was "obviously interpreting [the exhibit's] idea as an insult attempt."&lt;ref name="bulga"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_1869166053 | title=Bulgaria is a "Turkish Toilet" in the Entropa Art Installation in Brussels | work=[[News.bg]] | date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Stoykova | first=Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of non-government organizations, including Polish Indeks 73, were opposed to covering part of the work and initiated online petitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeks73.pl/en_,aktualnosci,_,79,_,575.php |title=David Černý's Entropa censored.

Jan Vytopil, the man in charge of cultural events during the Czech EU Presidency, has defended the exhibit, arguing that the presence of a "squat toilet Bulgaria" in the presence of the other patently absurd depictions made it clear that the piece seeks to demolish stereotypes rather than cause controversy. Czech Deputy Prime Minister [[Alexandr Vondra]] also frequently stressed that the government committee which authorized the piece wanted to avoid [[censorship]]:
{{quote|What we approved was a blank map; we decided not to censor anything. When we saw the finished work, we thought it might be too much. That remains to be seen. At any rate, it is an expression of freedom, we decided not to censor it.|Alexandr Vondra in [[Lidové noviny]] on January 13, after doubt had been cast on the existence of Černý's supposed collaborators&lt;ref name="nepra"/&gt;}}

On 14 January 2009, the [[Slovak National Party]] called on Foreign Affairs Minister [[Ján Kubiš]] to demand the removal of the sculpture, calling it an offence to the Slovak nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovakia protests its "sausage map" in official EU artwork|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605104351/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1232046128.0/|archivedate=5 June 2011 |url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1232046128.0/|work=EU Business|date=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sme.sk/c/4262486/sns-ziada-kubisa-aby-protestoval-proti-salame-s-madarskou-trikolorou.html | title=SNS žiada Kubiša, aby protestoval proti saláme s maďarskou trikolórou | language=Slovak | accessdate=14 January 2009&lt;!--, 11:46 CET --&gt;| work=[[SME (newspaper)|SME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January 2009, Kubiš complied and lodged a formal protest, but did not demand the removal of the sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/index_view.php?id=355071|title= Po Bulharsku protestuje proti Entropě i Slovensko|accessdate=15 January 2009 |work= České noviny news portal |publisher= Neris |date= 15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the controversial nature of the portrayals of other countries, Czech diplomats expected protests from other countries as well. However, {{as of|2009|01|14}} these had yet to materialize. In fact, the public in Poland appeared to be largely in favour of Poland's portrayal, with 64% considering it "spot on" and only 13% thinking it "an insult to Polish people", according to an online poll by news portal [[TVN24]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvn24.pl/1001670,1,1,czy-uwazasz--ze-rzezba-dobrze-oddaje-stereotypy-dotyczace-polski,sondy.html | title=Czy uważasz, że rzeźba dobrze oddaje stereotypy dotyczące Polski? | language=Polish | accessdate=14 January 2009&lt;!--, 10:46 CET --&gt;| work=[[TVN 24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ole Molesby, the Danish Ambassador to the Czech Republic, stated that he did not expect the Mohammed caricature protests to begin anew, and that Denmark did not intend to complain. Černý denied that the similarity was intentional.&lt;ref name="danes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/zahranici/evropa/clanek.phtml?id=627106 | title=Dánové v Černého díle vidí Mohameda.

=== Authorship controversy ===
On 13 January 2009, the authorship of ''Entropa'' came into question. Officially, the artwork was to have been an international collaboration between David Černý and artists from the other 26 EU countries. However, on that day, Alexandr Vondra announced the work was probably created by a smaller group of people, explaining that Černý did not inform him about this until the evening before. The original news article in ''[[Lidové noviny]]'' pointed out that some of the artists' names did not seem to exist in their countries' citizen records and had no Internet footprint.&lt;ref name="nepra"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lidovky.cz/plastika-v-bruselu-muze-byt-cela-dilem-cerneho-f4r-/ln_eu.asp?c=A090113_125326_ln_eu_ter | title=Na Černého díle nepracovalo 27 lidí, řekl Vondra LN | work=lidovky.cz | accessdate=14 January 2009 | date=13 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Černý himself admitted on 13 January that the artists' names had been fabricated.&lt;ref name="the times"/&gt;

The official booklet provided summaries of past expositions for most of the alleged authors, some of which matched those of known artists. For example, Austria's "Sabrina Unterberger" had a résumé that apparently belonged to Ernst Logar.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Many of these "artists" had their own websites (designed by Tomáš Pospiszyl, [[Krištof Kintera]] and Libor Svoboda), but the contact information listed was false (other than the e-mail addresses, which were functional).{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''Lidové noviny'' originally listed Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and the UK as countries for which fictitious artists' identities were given. These specific claims were later retracted and replaced by general charges that some of the names in the booklet are non-existent, their résumés erroneous, or that the artists denied knowing David Černý or having cooperated with him.

On the evening of 13 January 2009, Černý officially admitted that the piece was actually created entirely by him and two friends, and that all the officially supplied artists' identities had been fabricated.&lt;ref name="the times"/&gt; In a prepared statement, Černý offered an apology to [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Mirek Topolánek]], Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, and the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] "and their offices" for deceiving them, stating he did not want them to be responsible for his fabulations.&lt;ref name="omluv"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/domov/index_view.php?id=354661 | title=David Černý se omluvil vládě za mystifikaci se svým dílem | work=ceskenoviny.cz | accessdate=14 January 2009 | date=13 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement went on to point out: "We knew the truth would come out. But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself."

The names of Černý's collaborators were given as Tomáš Pospiszyl and Krištof Kintera.&lt;ref name="spust"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/svet/index_view.php?id=354933 | title=V případě protestů proti Entropě Černý sporné makety odstraní | work=[[České noviny]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors maintained that a larger international team of people was involved in the project's execution. They explained that they originally wanted to contact artists from all 27 member countries of the EU, but failed due to limited time and financing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Alexandr Vondra responded with an official statement expressing his disappointment and stressed that Černý would bear responsibility for deceiving the government.&lt;ref name="vondra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/statement-by-alexandr-vondra-concerning-new-information-abou-5844/index.html/ |title=Statement by Alexandr Vondra concerning new information about Entropa |work=eu2009.cz |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the sculpture's potential for controversy, the point that each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to [[Lidové noviny]], Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression and that is how ''Entropa'' must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different than we had thought for a year and a half, I would not have authorized it."&lt;ref name="nepra"/&gt;  Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a piece of art&amp;mdash;nothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency.&lt;ref name="provo"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Fraud accusation ===
The sculpture reportedly cost 12 million [[Czech koruna|CZK]] to make, of which 10 million was contributed by [[New World Resources]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mining company which owns [[OKD]] in the Czech Republic, and 2 million CZK was paid by the Czech government, which has subsequently leased the work for an additional 1.2 million CZK until the end of June. After the fabrication came to light, Černý was accused of [[Fraud|misappropriating]] state funds. He responded that the money was not used at all, since the artists knew they would deviate from the stated project, and would be returned.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;

=== Response by authors ===
Černý originally stated that he meant for the sculpture to be amusing, saying, "Irony is about making fun. It is not meant to offend anybody",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/12/us-eu-mosaic-idUSTRE50B58320090112 | title=Czech EU mosaic pokes fun at national stereotypes | agency=Reuters| date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009 | last=Smith | first=Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later issuing an official statement saying, "We wanted to see if Europe is able to laugh at itself."&lt;ref name="omluv"/&gt; On 15 January, Černý reflected on the hostile reception of ''Entropa'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;I certainly don't feel like a winner. That's how I'd feel if there were a few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, shaking their heads, thinking about what those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a [[happening]], a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors defended their choice to use false names in creating the sculpture by stating the deception was part of the art:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Grotesque exaggeration and mystification is a hallmark of Czech culture, and creating false identities is one of the strategies of [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jRL-oFxUXrw4-RKvh3b8_2dm6aMg | title=Czech artist admits deception in EU art exhibit | agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] | date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Černý has also said that making this sculpture in this way was "more fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lidovky.cz/ln_zahranici.asp?c=A090114_203103_ln_eu_val | title=Černý pro LN: Vláda si dílo neobjednala | work=[[Lidové noviny]] | date=14 January 2009 | accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, the artists apologized for the deception, saying, "We apologize to Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and their offices for not informing them about the true state of things and thus deceiving them."&lt;ref name="omluv"/&gt;  Krištof Kintera, one of the true co-authors of the sculpture, said in an interview that the mystification was supposed to last longer, but that it was untenable—both ethically, as the artists didn't want to cause more trouble for Czech diplomacy, and practically, as they couldn't keep answering e-mails using the fabricated artists' identities.

Kintera also commented that the sculpture revealed a divide between [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]: "We didn't want to defame anyone; advanced European democracies are used to many things, but the East still strives to promote itself in a positive light, so it's not as well attuned to this."&lt;ref name="kintera"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c4-10065240-32799250-500000_d-entropa-je-pitoma-ale-take-krotka | title=Krištof Kintera: "Entropa je pitomá, ale také krotká" | work=[[Hospodářské noviny]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fate of the sculpture ==
After the true authorship of the sculpture came to light, Alexandr Vondra stated its continued display was under review because Černý had violated the government's specifications of the project, which, in line with Černý's original description, called for an international collaboration of artists. On 14 January 2009, the official ''Entropa'' presentation page was withdrawn from the Czech presidency's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eux.tv/2009/01/14/czech-eu-presidency-removes-entropa-brochure-from-its-website/ Czech EU Presidency removes ‘Entropa’ brochure from its website] at EUX.TV&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the sculpture was ceremonially launched on 15 January 2009. Alexandr Vondra again defended the piece, saying, "we consider ''Entropa'' to be art, nothing more and nothing else."&lt;ref name="spust2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/41768-alexandr-vondra-v-bruselu-entropa-je-umelecke-dilo-nic-vic-nic-min/ | title=Alexandr Vondra v Bruselu: Entropa je umělecké dílo, nic víc, nic míň | work=[[ČT24]] | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate=15 January 2009 | language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony, David Černý again apologized to the Czech government and expressed regret that the sculpture was considered offensive. He said the offending pieces would be removed if officials cannot be persuaded about the authors' intentions.&lt;ref name="spust"/&gt;

== Removal ==
On 23 April 2009, Černý's intention to remove the sculpture prematurely on 10 May was published, which he presented as a protest against the way in which [[Mirek Topolánek's Second Cabinet|Topolánek's government]] had been deposed and against the prepared [[Jan Fischer's Cabinet|Fischer's cabinet]], which was eventually installed on 8 May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/eu/ceske_predsednictvi/zpravy/cerny-chce-entropu-odstranit-z-bruselu-uz-10-kvetna/372755 Černý chce Entropu odstranit z Bruselu už 10. května], České noviny, 23. 4. 2009, ČTK {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cerny-odstrani-entropu-drive-nelibi-se-mu-fischerova-vlada-pax-/domaci.asp?c=A090423_094010_domaci_bar Černý odstraní Entropu dříve, nelíbí se mu Fischerova vláda], iDnes.cz, 23. 4. 2009, bar (Barbora Říhová) {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/brusel-si-na-entropu-zvykl-nechte-nam-ji-az-do-cervna-zadoni-p4o-/zahranicni.asp?c=A090423_155112_zahranicni_jw Brusel si na Entropu zvykl.

The removal of the sculpture began on 11 May. Černý himself was not present, although he had earlier suggested the contrary. A crew he sent there dismantled the sculpture and on Thursday, 14 May loaded its parts into three trucks, which had to come one by one because of limitations of the Justus Lipsius building. Afterwards, the pieces were transported by road to Prague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/v-bruselu-zacala-predcasna-demontaz-kontroverzni-plastiky-entropa-11c-/domaci.asp?c=A090507_163402_domaci_bar V Bruselu začala předčasná demontáž kontroverzní plastiky Entropa], iDnes.cz, 11. 5. 2009, bar (Barbora Říhová), lpo (Lenka Poláková)&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture was set up again in the Centre of Contemporary Art DOX in Prague-[[Holešovice]] and inaugurated on 11 June 2009, in presence of guests, including former Czech president [[Václav Havel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kontroverzni-entropa-je-v-praze-udelal-jsem-ji-ja-s-paroubkem-rekl-havel-1an-/domaci.aspx?c=A090611_202441_praha_jba Kontroverzní Entropa je v Praze.

''Entropa'' was on display in the [[Techmania Science Center]] in [[Plzeň]] as part of an [[European Union|EU]] exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lidovky.cz/provokativni-entropa-davida-cerneho-se-prestehovala-do-plzne-puv-/ln_kultura.asp?c=A100906_131024_ln_kultura_mev Lidovky.cz]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jasper Johns, Flag (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''Flag'' (1954-55). Museum of Modern Art, New York City. This image illustrates Johns' early technique of painting with thick, dripping encaustic over a collage made from found materials such as newspaper. This rough method of construction is rarely visible in photographic reproductions of his work.]]
'''''Flag''''' is an [[encaustic painting]] by the American artist [[Jasper Johns]]. Created when Johns was 24 (1954–55), two years after he was discharged from the [[US Army]], this painting was the first of many works that Johns has said were inspired by a dream of the [[U.S. flag]] in 1954. It is arguably the painting for which Johns is best known.

The US flag was in the news repeatedly in 1954. The [[McCarthy hearings]] came to a close on 17 June 1954, only three days after [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]]. On Flag Day, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed an amendment to the [[pledge of allegiance]] to add the words "under God." The ''New York Times'' ran article on facts and myths associated with the flag on the day before Flag Day, and then an article on the "discipline" of the flag on Flag Day itself, saying, with reference to a national air-raid drill "we are all soldiers now". [[Francis Scott Key]], composer of "[[The Star Spangled Banner]]", was born in 1779, 175 years before 1954. The [[Iwo Jima Marine Memorial]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], with its large US flag, was dedicated on 11 November 1954. Johns and his father were both named after Sergeant [[William Jasper]], who saved the fallen flag of the Americans at [[Fort Moultrie]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

The work measures {{convert|107.3|cm}} by {{convert|153.8|cm}}. It is made using encaustic, oil paint, and newsprint collage on three separate canvases, mounted on a plywood board. The painting reflects the three colors of the US flag: red, white and blue; the flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then-US states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), and with thirteen red and white stripes. Newsprint is visible under the stripes. Reading the texts, it is clear that the newsprint was not selected at random: Johns steered clear of headlines, or national or political news, and used inconsequential articles or adverts. The painting has a rough-textured surface, and the 48 stars are not identical. It is dated 1954 on its reverse.

Johns's selection of the US flag allows him to explore a familiar two-dimensional object, with its simple internal geometric structure and a complex symbolic meaning. Johns was attracted to painting "things the mind already knows", and claimed that using a familiar object like the flag freed himself from the need to create a new design and allowed him to focus on the execution of the painting. Critics were unsure whether it was a painted flag or a painting ''of'' a flag; Johns later said it was both. His work is often described as [[Neo-Dadaist]] and anticipates aspects of [[pop art]], [[minimal art]], and [[conceptual art]].

Johns made over 40 works based on the US flag, including a large and monochrome ''[[White Flag (Johns painting)|White Flag]]'' in 1955, and his 1958 work ''[[Three Flags]]'' with three superimposed flags showing a total of 84 stars.

In November 2014 the encaustic ''Flag'' (1983) was auctioned off for $36,000,000 at Sotheby's New York.

The painting was included in Johns's first solo exhibition at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in early 1958. [[Alfred Barr]], director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], wanted to buy the work, but was concerned that it might be considered unpatriotic. He persuaded a friend, [[Philip Johnson]], to buy it instead; Johnson bought it, and donated it to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] "in honor of [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]]" when he retired in 1968.

In [[Chinese art]], the '''Four Gentlemen''', also called the '''Four Noble Ones''', are four plants: the [[Prunus mume|plum blossom]], the [[orchid]], the [[bamboo]], and the [[chrysanthemum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardens.si.edu/come-learn/docs/Template_Orchids_The%20Four%20Gentlemen.pdf Orchids: The Four Gentlemen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brushmeistersofbrooklyn.net/articles/symbolisminbrushpainti.html Symbolism in Brush Painting]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term compares the four plants to [[Confucianist]] ''[[junzi]]'', or "gentlemen". They are most typically depicted in traditional [[ink and wash painting]] and they belong to the category of [[bird-and-flower painting]] in Chinese art.

The Four Gentlemen have been used in Chinese painting since the time of the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) because of their refined beauty, and were later adopted [[East Asian cultural sphere|elsewhere in East Asia]] by artists in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. As they represent the four different seasons (the plum blossom for winter, the orchid for spring, the bamboo for summer, and the chrysanthemum for autumn), the four are used to depict the unfolding of the seasons through the year.

'''Germigny-des-Prés''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Loiret]] [[Departments of France|department]] in north-central [[France]].

==The Oratory==
The oratory at Germigny-des-Prés (Loiret, Orléanais) was built by Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]] in 806 as part of his palace complex within the Gallo-Roman villa in Germaniacus. Theodulf, who was also abbot of the neighboring monastery of [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]], was a [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] and one of the most celebrated men of letters in the [[Carolingian Empire]] court of [[Charlemagne]]. The [[Carolingian architecture]] of his palace complex at Germigny-des-Prés was in a general sense modelled on Charlemagne's [[Palace of Aachen]]. All except the oratory was destroyed by the [[Viking]]s within a century of construction.

As reconstructed by [[Theodulf of Orléans|Theodulf]] in 806, the oratory took the form of a rough square with single apses in the middle of the north, south, and west sides, and three apses on the east side. Internally, the space took the form of a [[Greek cross]]: a high central tower filled the central bay, [[barrel vault]]s extended off in the north, south, east, and west bays, while in the corner bays there were low domes carried on [[squinch]]es. This plan type was later to become standard in [[Byzantine architecture]].

Horseshoe arches are used throughout the church, an unusual element in French architecture derived, in this case, from the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] practices of Theodulf's native [[Spain]]. The central [[apse]] of the east contains a rich and complex mosaic showing two cherubim above the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Below his mosaic, Theodulf placed an inscription that occupies two lines:
::As you gaze upon the holy propitiatorium and Cherubim, beholder,
::And see the shimmering of the Ark of God's covenant,
::Perceiving these things, and prepared to beset the Thunderer with prayers,
::Add, I beg you, Theodulf's name to your invocations.'

===History===
[[Odo of Metz]], an Armenian architect, built the Germigny des Prés in 806-811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Ching|title=A global history of architecture|year=2007|pages=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louis|first=Victor|title=The complete guide to the Soviet Union|year=1976|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josef Strzygowski]] and [[Alexander Sahinian]], the church was possibly influenced by the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], the mother church of Armenia.&lt;ref name="csufresno"&gt;{{cite web|title=Etchmiadzin |url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/iaa_architecture/etchmiadzin.htm |publisher=Armenian Studies Program [[California State University, Fresno]] |accessdate=3 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623214051/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/iaa_architecture/etchmiadzin.htm |archivedate=23 June 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was consecrated on 3 January 806, dedicated to SS.Geneviève and Germain. Damaged by fire before 854, it became part of a priory in 1067, and a parish church in the 13th century. The original circular plan was augmented with a [[nave]] in the 15-16th century, which involved the demolition of the Western abside. The nave was extended to the west in the 19th century, and a bell-tower erected. The church was classified as a ''monument historique'' in 1840 and restoration commenced in 1867.

The most ancient part of the existing church is the square building which surrounds the altar. Although often referred to as a 'Greek Cross' church, this building does not really fall into this category, as it has no projecting 'arms' or [[transept]]s, only a single [[apse]] on three sides, and a triple apse to the 'east' (the church is not aligned to the compass points). The triple apse would not appear to have been mirrored to the 'west' where the entrance was and is to be found, subsequent alteration has made it impossible to determine whether there was originally a [[narthex]].

The church is also architecturally quite distinct from the Palatine chapel in Aachen, and from S. Vitale in Ravenna – two buildings upon which it is often claimed that SS.Geneviève &amp; Germain is modelled – in that it is square rather than round, has exterior apses and is constructed differently.  This is rather a rare survival of a very early form of Western European church, pre-dating and perhaps contributing to the development of the Romanesque which forms the majority of ancient churches in France and, indeed, in Western Europe.

The great treasure of the church is the mosaic of the Ark of the Covenant, on the ceiling of the apse. This mosaic is the only surviving Byzantine mosaic in France, although traces of mosaics elsewhere on the roof indicate that it was part of a wider decorative scheme. The mosaic owes its preservation to being plastered over at the time of the French Revolution; it was rediscovered in the middle of the 19th century.
The mosaic is one of the few remaining artworks from the period of the [[Iconoclasm]] which convulsed the Eastern Church during the 8th &amp; 9th centuries, but which also impacted on Western Christendom. Traditionally, the place occupied by this mosaic was reserved for images of the Virgin Mary, enthroned as Queen Of Heaven, with the Christ child on her knee, and with an attendant angel on either side. These angels pointed out the divine status of the figures between them.

The artist working at Germigny (who was obviously au fait with Byzantine practice, if not actually Greek himself) has replaced the portrait of the Virgin, Mother of Christ, with an equivalent but symbolic representation. The Ark of the Covenant contains ‘manna’, the miraculous bread given from Heaven to the Israelites in the desert; this was interpreted as a prefiguration of the Virgin, who bears Christ, the Holy Bread.
The mosaicist, and Théodulf d'Orléans, seem to have held a middle course, balanced between extreme iconoclasm and the partisans of images such as [[John of Damascus]]. This moderate position is exactly that which the theologians appointed by Charlemagne in the Council of Frankfurt (794) decided upon.

'''Google Arts &amp; Culture''' (formerly '''Google Art Project''') is an online platform through which the public can access high-resolution images of artworks housed in the initiative’s partner museums. The project was launched on 1 February 2011 by [[Google]] through its [[Google Cultural Institute]], in cooperation with 17 international museums, including the [[Tate Gallery]], [[London]]; the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]; and the [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Florence|title=The best online culture archives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8296365/The-best-online-culture-archives.html|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital platform utilizes high-resolution image technology and enables users to virtually tour partner museums’ galleries, explore physical and contextual information about artworks, and compile their own virtual collection. The "walk-through" feature of the project uses Google's [[Google Street View|Street View]] technology,&lt;ref name="kennicott1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennicott |first=Philip |title=National Treasures: Google Art Project unlocks riches of world's galleries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/01/AR2011020106442.html |accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partner museums could select one artwork to be captured as a [[gigapixel image]] (with over 1 billion [[pixel]]s).

On April 3, 2012, Google announced a major expansion to the platform as it signed partnership agreements with 151 museums from 40 countries. The platform now features more than 32,000 artworks from 46 museums, and image acquisition is underway at the remaining partner museums. This expansion includes works from institutions like the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], the [[White House]], the Australian Rock Art Gallery at [[Griffith University]], the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]], and the [[Hong Kong Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ngak|first=Chenda|title=Google Art Project features White House, the Met, National Gallery|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57408829-501465/google-art-project-features-white-house-the-met-national-gallery/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google also  launched a second version of the website with new [[Google+]] features, enhanced search capabilities, and a series of educational tools.&lt;ref name="valvo1"&gt;{{cite press release|last=Valvo|first=Michael|title=Google Goes Global with Expanded Art Project|url=https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/art-project/press-release|publisher=Google Art Project|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform is now available in 18 languages, including English, Japanese, Indonesian, French, Italian, Polish, and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011" /&gt;

== Site components ==

=== Features of first-generation Google Arts &amp; Culture ===

==== Virtual Gallery Tour ====
: Through the Virtual Gallery Tour (aka Gallery View) Users can virtually ‘walk through’ the galleries of each partner museum, using the same controls as Google Street View or by clicking on the gallery’s floorplan.

==== Artwork View ====
: From the Gallery View (aka Microscope View), users can zoom in on a particular artwork to view the picture in greater detail. As of April 2012, over 32,000 high-quality images are available for view. Microscope view provides users a dynamic image of an artwork, and scholarly and contextual information to enhance their understanding of the work. When examining an artwork, users may also access information detailing the physical characteristics of the image (e.g. size, material(s), artist). Partner museums were offered the option to include Viewing Notes, History of the Artwork, and Artist Information, which users can easily access from the microscope view interface. Each museum was allowed to include as much material as they wanted to contribute, so the level of information varies by museum and by artwork.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pack|first=Thomas|title=The Google Art Project is a Sight to Behold|magazine=Information Today|date=May 2011|volume=28|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using services like [[Google Scholar]] and [[YouTube]], Google includes external links for users to explore additional information about an artwork or gallery.

==== Create an Artwork Collection ====
: Users can log in with their Google Account to create their own collection. Users can compile any number of images from any of the partner museums and save specific views of artworks to create a personalized virtual exhibition. Using Google’s link abbreviator (Goo.gl), users can easily share their artwork collection with others through social media and conventional online communications mechanisms. This feature was so successful upon the platform’s launch, that Google had to dedicate additional servers to support it.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Nancy|title=The Google Art Project: A new Generation of Museums on the Web?|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|date=April 2011|volume=52|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation platform seamlessly integrates Google's social media platform [[Google+]], so that site users can upload video and audio content to personalize their gallery, and share their collections through their social media networks.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanislawski|first=Piotr|title=Polska Sztuka w Google Art Project|url=http://kultura.gazeta.pl/kultura/1,114530,11473975,Polska_sztuka_w_Google_Art_Project.html|accessdate=8 April 2012|newspaper=Gazeta|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features of second-generation Google Arts &amp; Culture ===

==== Explore and Discover ====
: In the second launch of the platform, Google updated the platform's search capabilities, so that users could more easily and intuitively find artworks. Now, users can find art by filtering their search with several categories, including: artist, museum, type of work, date, and country. The search results are displayed in a slideshow format.&lt;ref name="valvo1" /&gt; This new functionality enables site users to search across numerous collections to find artworks that fit their parameters of interest.

==== Video and Audio Content ====
: Several partner museums have opted to include guided tour or welcome videos of their galleries. This provides users the option to virtually walk through a museum themselves and listen to an audio guide at certain artworks, or to follow a video tour as an expert guides them through a gallery. For example, [[Michelle Obama]] filmed a welcome video for the White House gallery page,&lt;ref name="Keyes-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keyes|first=Alexa|title=Google Art Project and White House Launch 360 Tour of 'People's House'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/google-and-white-house-lauch-360-tour-of-rooms-artworks/|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Israel's Holocaust Museum [[Yad Vashem]] launched a YouTube channel with 400 hours of original video footage from the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], which users can access through the museum's Arts &amp; Culture exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Aron|title=Israel Museum showcased in Google Art Project|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_GOOGLE_ART_PROJECT?SITE=GAGAI&amp;SECTION=WEATHER&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-04-03-14-17-30|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Gainesville Times/Associated Press|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
: Google Arts &amp; Culture includes several educational tools and resources for teachers and students. There are  educational videos, available through a YouTube channel and embedded on the Google Arts &amp; Culture web page. Next, two pages called "Look Like an Expert" and "DIY" provides several activities for site users, similar to those often found in art galleries. For example, one quiz asks site visitors to match a painting to a particular style; another asks visitors to find a symbol within a specified painting that represents a provided story. Finally, the "What's Next" page provides site visitors with a list of resources and links to various art history timelines, art toolkits, and comparative teaching resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/education/|work=Google Art Project|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Art Selfie ====
: Google Arts &amp; Culture includes the ability to find your fine art likeness just by snapping a selfie. You simply take a selfie in the app and it matches your face to old art museum portraits from their database. The feature went viral in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900392/art-selfie-facial-match-app-google-top-of-charts|work=Google’s art app is now top of iOS and Android download charts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was initially created by Cyril Diagne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/google-figures-out-how-to-make-people-care-about-art-selfies|work=Out How to Make People Care About Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/culture/2233391-20180307-selfie-uvre-art-savez-encore|work=Votre selfie est une œuvre d’art mais vous ne le savez pas encore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Google Street View camera in Bratislava.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Google Street View]] Camera captures 360 degree images as it moves through the location. Usually, the camera sits atop a car to capture Street View images, but the platform camera was installed on an indoor trolley.]]
[[File:Behind the Scenes- The Google Art Project at the White House.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:07|Video showing the technology and processes used to capture images of the [[White House]] for the Google Arts &amp; Culture]]

The platform emerged as a result of Google's "20-percent time" policy, by which employees are encouraged to spend 20% of their time working on an innovative project of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles|first=Jemillah|title=Google's Art Project grows larger with 151 museums online  across 140 countries|url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2012/04/03/googles-art-project-grows-larger-with-151-museums-online-across-40-countries/|work=TNW Google Blog|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small team of employees created the concept for the platform after a discussion on how to use the firm's technology to make museum’ artwork more accessible.&lt;ref name="Sood-2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Amit|title=Explore museums and great works of art in the Google Art Project|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/explore-museums-and-great-works-of-art.html|work=Google Official Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform concept fits the firm's mission "to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Google|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/|publisher=Google|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, in mid-2009, Google executives agreed to support the project, and they engaged online curators of numerous museums to commit to the initiative.&lt;ref name="Berwick-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Berwick|first=Carly|title=Up Close and Personal with Google Art Project|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2011|volume=99|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology used ===
The team leveraged existing technologies, including [[Google Street View]] and [[Picasa]], and built new tools specifically for the platform.

They created an indoor-version of the Google Street View 360-degree camera system to capture gallery images by pushing the camera 'trolley' through a museum. It also used professional panoramic heads Clauss Rodeon VR Head Hd And Clauss VR Head ST to take high resolution photos of the artworks within a gallery .This technology allowed th excellent attention to detail and the highest image resolution. Each partner museum selected one artwork to be captured at ultra-high resolution with approximately 1,000 times more detail than the average digital camera.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; The largest image, [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]]'s ''The Apparition of Christ to the People'', is over 12 gigapixels. To maximize image quality, the  team coordinated with partner museums’ lighting technicians and photography teams. For example, at the [[Tate Britain]], the they collaborated to capture a gigapixel image of ''[[No Woman No Cry (painting)|No Woman No Cry]]'' in both natural light and in the dark. The Tate suggested this method to capture the painting's hidden phosphorescent image, which glows in the dark. The Google camera team had to adapt their method, and keep the camera shutter open for 8 seconds in the dark to capture a distinct enough image. Now, unlike at the Tate, from the site one can view the painting in both light settings.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=James|title=Google Art Project: Behind the Scenes|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blog/google-art-project-behind-scenes-glowy-night-museum|work=Tate Blogs|publisher=Tate Britain|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the images were captured, the team used Google Street View software and GPS data to seamlessly stitch the images and connect them to museum floor plans. Each image was mapped according to longitude and latitude, so that users can seamlessly transition to it from Google Maps, looking inside the partner museums’ galleries. Street View was also integrated with Picasa, for seamless transition from gallery view to microscope view.&lt;ref name="Sood-2011" /&gt;

The user interface lets site visitors virtually ‘walk through’ galleries with Google Street View, and look at artworks with Picasa, which provides the microscope view to zoom in to images for greater detail than is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; Additionally, the microscope view of artworks incorporates other resources—including [[Google Scholar]], [[Google Docs]] and [[YouTube]]—so users can link to external content to learn more about the work.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Mediati|first=Nick|title=An extension of Google Street View enables interactive, Web-based virtual museum tours|magazine=PC World|date=April 2011|volume=29|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the platform incorporates Google’s URL shortener ([[Google URL Shortener|Goo.gl]]), so that users can save and easily share their personal collections.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011" /&gt;

The platform has been integrated with the social media platform Google+  to enable users to share their personal collections with their networks. This integration also lets site visitors use Google+ Hangouts for more interactive purposes. These situations might include: a professor giving an online lecture to students, engaging in video and shared-screen discussions about a collection, or an expert leading a virtual tour of a distant museum to remote attendees.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012" /&gt;

The resulting  platform is a Java-based Google App Engine Web application, which exists on Google’s infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011" /&gt;

=== Technology limitations ===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'']]

Luc Vincent, director of engineering at Google and head of the team responsible for Street View for the platform, stated concern over the quality of panorama cameras his team used to capture gallery and artwork images. In particular, he believes that improved aperture control would enable more consistent quality of gallery images.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt;

Some artworks were particularly difficult to capture and re-present accurately as virtual, two-dimensional images. For example, Google described the inclusion of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' as "tough". This was due to the [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] techniques distorting the image of a skull in the foreground of the painting. When looking at the original painting at the National Gallery in London, the depiction of the skull appears distorted until the viewer physically steps to the side of the painting. Once the viewer is looking at the shape from the intended vantage point, the lifelike depiction of the skull materializes. The effect is still apparent in the gigapixel version of the painting, but was less pronounced in the "walk-through" function.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;

As ''New York Times'' art reviewer [[Roberta Smith]] said: “[Google Arts &amp; Culture] is very much a work in progress, full of bugs and information gaps, and sometimes blurry, careering virtual tours.”&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; Though the second generation platform solved some technological issues, the firm plans to continue developing additional enhancements for the site. Future improvements currently under consideration include: upgrading panorama cameras, more detailed web metrics, and improved [[Search Engine Optimization|searchability]] through metatagging and user-generated metatagging.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt; The firm is also considering the addition of an experimental page to the platform, to highlight emerging technologies that artists are using to showcase their works.&lt;ref name="GAP-FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/faqs/|work=Google Art Project|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions and works ==
Seventeen partner museums were included in the launch of the project. The original 1,061 high-resolution images (by 486 different artists) are shown in 385 virtual gallery rooms, with 6,000 [[Street View]]–style panoramas.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Google and museums around the world unveil Art Project|url=https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/art-project/press-site-v1/press-release-v1 |publisher=Google Art Project|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2012, Google announced the expansion of the platform to include 151 museums. At the time of the announcement, 46 of those museums and their works are available on the website. Like the original 17 partners, each of the new partners has a gigapixel image of one of their works on the platform platform.&lt;ref name="valvo1" /&gt;

Google has been dedicated to making the platform a more global project, so it sought to expand its partnerships with local, regional and national museums from 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title=LACMA, Getty among 134 museums joining Google's art site|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/04/lacma-getty-sfmoma-among-134-museums-joining-googles-art-site.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the platform now also offers galleries the option to submit a form and apply for partnership with Google.

== Influences ==
As early as the late-1980s, art museum personnel began to consider how they could exploit the [[Internet]] to achieve their institutions' missions through online platforms. For example, in 1994 Elizabeth Broun, Director of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], spoke to the Smithsonian Commission on the future of art, stating: "We need to put our institutional energy behind the idea of getting the Smithsonian hooked up to the people and schools of America." She then outlined the museum's objective to conserve, protect, present, and interpret exhibits, explaining how electronic media could help achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="Broun-1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broun|first=Elizabeth|title=The Future of Art at the Smithsonian|journal=American Art|date=Summer 1994|volume=8|issue=3/4|pages=2–7|jstor=3109168|doi=10.1086/424219}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of internet programs and resources has shaped the development of the platform.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proctor|first=N|title=The Google Art Project: A New Generation of Museums on the Web?|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|year=2011|volume=54|pages=215–221|doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.2011.00083.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Google initiatives ===
[[File:Toledomuseumofart.JPG|thumb|The [[Toledo Museum of Art]] worked with Google to remove 21 artworks from their virtual exhibition because the artists (or their heirs) still hold the copyright to the images.]]

Another Google initiative—[[Google Books]]—affected the development of the platform from a non-technological perspective. Google recently faced a six-year-long court case relating to several [[Authors Guild v. Google|issues with copyright infringement]]. Google Books catalogued full digital copies of texts, including those still protected by copyright, though Google claimed it was permissible under the [[fair use]] clause. Google ended up paying $125 million to copyright-holders of the protected books, though the [[Google Books#Settlement agreement|settlement agreement]] was modified and debated several times before it was ultimately rejected by federal courts. In his decision, Judge Denny Chin stated the settlement agreement would "give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission," and could lead to antitrust issues. Judge Chin said in future open-access initiatives, Google should use an "opt-in" method, rather than providing copyright owners the option to "opt out" of an arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Efrati|first=Amir|title=Judge Rejects Google Books Settlement|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704461304576216923562033348|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this controversy, Google took a different approach on intellectual property rights for the Google Arts &amp; Culture. The platform's intellectual property policy is:
:''The high resolution imagery of artworks featured on the platform site are owned by the museums, and these images may be subject to copyright laws around the world. The Street View imagery is owned by Google. All of the imagery on this site is provided for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the platform site, in the manner permitted by Google’s Terms of Service . The normal Google Terms of Service apply to your use of the entire site.''&lt;ref name="GAP-FAQs" /&gt;

The Google team was sensitive to copyright issues of artworks, and partner museum staff were able to ask Google to blur out the images of certain works, which are still protected by copyrights. In a few cases, museums wanted to include artworks by modern and contemporary artists, many of whom still hold the copyright to their work. For example, the Tate Britain approached [[Chris Ofili]] to get his permission to capture and reproduce his works on the platform.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

However, since the project expanded in April 2012, Google has faced a few intellectual property issues. Some of the works added to the online exhibitions are still protected by [[copyright]], as the artist or his or her heirs holds the right to the image for 70 years. As a result, the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] asked Google to remove 21 artworks from the website, including works by [[Henri Matisse]] and other modern artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Art is Long; Copyrights Can Be Even Longer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/arts/design/artists-rights-society-vaga-and-intellectual-property.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Cultural Institute===
{{As of|2013|12|alt=By December 2013}}, the contents of the project were accessible from [[Google Cultural Institute]], a site that works similarly. It features digitized objects from archives, libraries and a wider array of museums not strictly devoted to art. This initiative is increasingly subsuming the Google Arts &amp; Culture within its wider ambit.

== Reception ==
The Google Arts &amp; Culture stirred up debate among scholars, museum personnel, art critics, and news writers. Since its initial launch, it has received fairly consistent positive feedback, and a variety of criticisms. With the second generation platform, Google appears to have responded to some earlier criticisms.

=== Praise ===
Positive feedback about the platform has centered on an increased audience gaining access to art, the marketing [[externality]] for museums, and the potential for future development of the initiative.
* '''Increases access to art.''' So long as one has internet access, anyone, anywhere, at any time can visit the Google Arts &amp; Culture, enabling audiences who otherwise would be unlikely to visit these museums to see their works. "Armchair tourists" are now able to tour some of the world's greatest art exhibits without leaving their seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ionescu|first=Daniel|title=Google's Art Project Extended Worldwide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104220826/http://www.pcworld.com/article/253092/googles_art_project_extended_worldwide.html|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/253092/googles_art_project_extended_worldwide.html|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-11-04|work=PC World Blogs|publisher=PC World|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors and students can go on virtual field trips without the usual associated costs, and have a remote conversation with an expert from a museum or other institution.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012" /&gt;
* '''Better visitor experience.''' Users of the site can avoid constraints of time, money and physical difficulty. They need not plan a restrictive one-time visit to a collection, or arrive find out a work is not on view. They are not bothered by other visitors.
* '''Triggers new visitors''' Many art historians and scholars have posited that online exhibitions would drive more people to the gallery, and the Google Arts &amp; Culture has supported this theory. Research established that there is a statistically significant relationship between those who visit the platform and those who are inspired to go on a real tour of a museum.&lt;ref name="Bararia-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bararia|first=Khushboo|title=Promotion of Virtual Tourism through Google Art Projects|url=http://repository.christuniversity.in/1741/|work=Masters Thesis|publisher=Christ University|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further support of this concept, within two weeks of the launch of the platform, MoMA saw its website's traffic increase by about 7%.&lt;ref name="Berwick-2011" /&gt; It is, however, unclear how many physical visitors came to MoMA as a result of the platform.
* '''Complements real visits to a gallery.''' While there has been some skepticism that the Google Arts &amp; Culture seeks to replace real-time visits to art galleries, many have suggested that the virtual tours actually complement real-time visits. Research shows that people are more likely to enjoy their real-time visit to a museum after participating in a virtual tour.&lt;ref name="Bararia-2012" /&gt; Several museum personnel have supported this concept anecdotally. Julian Raby, director of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] stated: “The gigapixel experience brings us very close to the essence of the artist through detail that simply can’t be seen in the gallery itself. Far from eliminating the necessity of seeing artworks in person, [Arts &amp; Culture] deepens our desire to go in search of the real thing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Amit|title=Amit Sood: Technologist|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/amit_sood.html|work=Speakers|publisher=TED|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by Brian Kennedy, director of the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], who believed that academics would still want to view artwork in three dimensions, even if the gigapixel images provided better clarity than viewing the artwork in the gallery. Similarly, Amit Sood—the Google project leader—said that "nothing beats the first-person experience".&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;
* '''Has future development potential.''' Some scholars and art critics believe the Google Arts &amp; Culture will change how museums use the web. For instance, Nancy Proctor—Head of Mobile Strategy &amp; Initiatives at the Smithsonian—suggested that museums may eventually utilize the platform to provide museum maps and gallery information instead of printed materials. It might become possible for museum visitors to hold up their smart phone in front of an artwork, and the platform could overlay information. the platform could also provide a seamless transition from a Google Map to an inside gallery map, avoiding the need for printed collateral.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt;
* '''Democratization of culture.''' With the rapid increase of information that is available online, we are in a period of [[democratization of knowledge]]. An elite group of professionals and experts are no longer the only people with the ability to distribute respected information. Rather, through web-based initiatives like Wikipedia, anyone with web access can contribute to and help shape public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanger|first=Larry|title=Who Says We Know: On the New Politics of Knowledge|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/sanger07/sanger07_index.html|work=Edge: The Third Culture|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Arts &amp; Culture is, according to some, a democratic initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inanoglu|first=Zeynep|title=Google Art Project: Democratizing Art|url=http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~umutal/publications/elpub2011.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to give more people access to art by removing barriers like cost and location. Some art or cultural exhibits have been limited to a small group of viewers (e.g. PhD students, academic researchers) due to deteriorating condition of a work, lack of available wall space in a museum, or other similar factors. Digitized reproductions, however, can be accessible to anyone from any location. This type of online resource can transform research and academia by opening access to previously exclusive art works, enabling multidisciplinary and multi-institutional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerlac|first=Suzanne|title=Humanities 2.0: E-Learning in the Digital World|journal=Representations|date=Fall 2011|volume=116|series=The Humanities and the Crisis of the Public University|issue=1|pages=102–127|doi=10.1525/rep.2011.116.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides people the opportunity to experience art individually, and a platform to become involved in conversation.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt; For example, the platform now lets users [[#Site components|contribute]] their own content, adding their insight to the public collection of knowledge.

Many scholars have argued that we are experiencing a breakdown of the canon of high art,&lt;ref name="Broun-1994" /&gt; and the Google Arts &amp; Culture is beginning to reflect this.  When it just included the Grand Masters of Western Art, the project faced strong [[#Criticism|criticism]]. As a result of this outburst, the website now includes some indigenous and graffiti artworks. This platform also provides a new context through which people encounter art, ultimately reflecting this shift away from the canon of high art.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
A few initial criticisms of the platform—including skewed representation of artworksˇhave lost some validity with the launch of the second generation platform.
* '''[[Eurocentrism]]:''' During its initial launch, many critics argued that the Google Arts &amp; Culture provided a Western-biased representation of art. Most museums included in the first phase of the Project were from Western Europe, Washington, DC, and New York, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Getting in close and impersonal|url=http://search.proquest.com./docview/849706905|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diana Skaar, head of partnerships for the platform, Google responded: “After the launch of round one, we got an overwhelming response from museums worldwide. So for round two, we really wanted to balance regional museums with those that are more nationally or globally recognized.”&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011" /&gt; Now, the platform's expanded repository includes graffiti works, dot paintings, rock art and indigenous artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Andrea|title=ARTS: Global artworks now a click away|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/963815632|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Australian Associated Press Pty Limited|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the firm may have responded to this issue, there are other neglected criticisms:
* '''Selection of content:''' Although the Google Arts &amp; Culture is now partners with 134 new museums, some critics believe it still may present a skewed representation of art and art history. Google and the partner museums are able to decide what information to include, and what artworks they will make available (and at what level of quality); some believe this is counter-intuitive to the website's seemingly democratic objective.&lt;ref name="Sooke-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sooke|first=Alistair|title=The Problem With Google's Art Project|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8296251/The-problem-with-Googles-Art-Project.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the White House virtual collection, one photo of a former First Lady does not include a key piece of information to understand the context of the image. Grace Coolidge often wore brightly colored clothes. In her White House portrait, she was dressed in a red sleeveless flapper dress, and stood next to a large white dog. There are two versions of this picture: one showing Coolidge on a white background with softer lines, and one showing her on the White House lawn. The Google Arts &amp; Culture description leaves out the reason for why there are two images. President Coolidge preferred his wife to a white dress. The artist, however, wanted the dress to contrast with the white dog. So, the President Coolidge then retorted, "Dye the dog!"&lt;ref name="Keyes-2012" /&gt; While perhaps not crucial to understanding the exhibit, this and other examples show that the Google Arts &amp; Culture and partner museums are in a position of power to curate the content and educational information of the virtual exhibition.&lt;ref name="Sooke-2011" /&gt;
* '''Audience:''' Some critics have expressed concern over the intended audience of the platform, as this should shape the type of content available through the platform. For example, Director of the Center for the Future of Museums, Elizabeth Merritt, described the project as an "interesting experiment" but was skeptical as to its intended audience.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;
* '''Possible security risks:''' Some critics have raised the question of how Arts &amp; Culture visitors might maliciously use the Street View images. For example, by providing highly detailed images of galleries, people could use this platform to map out museum security systems, and then be able to circumvent these protective measures during a break-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nonnenmacher|first=Peter|title=Virtuelle Tiefenschärfe|url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/kunst/29137_Virtuelle-Tiefenschaerfe.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Wiener Zeitung|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hasbro Comic Book Universe''' ('''HCBU''') is an [[American comic book]] franchise and [[shared universe]] created and published by [[IDW Publishing]], based on various properties of the [[toy]] company [[Hasbro]].

==Publication history==
Following the bankruptcy of [[Dreamwave Productions]] in 2005, IDW picked up the ''[[Transformers]]'' comic book license and hired veteran writer [[Simon Furman]] to craft a rebooted continuity based on the [[Transformers: Generation 1|Generation 1]] toy line, similar to what [[Marvel Comics]] did through [[Ultimate Marvel]].&lt;ref name="Transformers"/&gt;

In May 2008, IDW obtained the ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' comic book license from [[Devil's Due Publishing]].&lt;ref name="G.I. Joe"/&gt;

In 2016, IDW gained the rights of ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'', ''[[Micronauts]]'', ''[[Action Man]]'' and ''[[M.A.S.K.]]'' That same year, IDW announced the [[Hasbro Reconstruction]] campaign, in order to converge those brands in the same continuity, starting with the crossover event ''[[Revolution (IDW Publishing)|Revolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;

In 2017, IDW gained the rights of ''[[Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light|Visionaries]]'', with most of its characters debuting after the crossover event ''[[First Strike (IDW Publishing)|First Strike]]''.&lt;ref name="Visionaries"/&gt;

In April 2018, IDW announced the Hasbro Comic Book Universe would conclude with the limited series ''[[Transformers: Unicron]]'' in November 2018.&lt;ref name="2018 ending"/&gt; In August 2018, IDW President Greg Goldstein announced a new reboot for various Hasbro-based comics for an unspecified date in 2019.&lt;ref name="2019 reboot"/&gt;

==Setting==

===Continuity===
IDW has never established a shared continuity between its own ''Transformers'' and ''G.I. Joe'' comics, even during the crossover event ''[[Infestation (comics)|Infestation]]'', when they both exist in separate universes, with other licensed franchises. While ''The Transformers'' has only participated in ''Infestation'', the miniseries ''[[The Transformers: Hearts of Steel]]'', also set in its own alternate timeline, has participated in ''[[Infestation 2]]''. On the other side,{{Clarify|what other side|date=October 2018}} ''G.I. Joe'' participated in both events.

Other brands exist within the HCBU too, e.g. ''[[Jem (TV series)|Jem and the Holograms]]'', ''[[Cluedo|Clue]]'' and ''[[Army Ants (toy line)|Army Ants]]'', but they didn't crossover during ''Revolution'' and ''First Strike'' due to reasons of tone. IDW's versions of ''[[My Little Pony (IDW Publishing)|My Little Pony]]'', ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (IDW Publishing)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''[[Stretch Armstrong]]'' exist "outside" this universe entirely.

===Planets===
*'''[[Earth]]''': the planet where [[Humans|humans]] live, and various events happened.
*'''[[Cybertron]]''': the homeworld of the Transformers, whose habitants are considered as "Cybertronians". Various factions, including the [[Autobot|Autobots]] and the [[Decepticon|Decepticons]], have been in war for millions of years.
*'''Caminus''': a lost colony of the Transformer species. Its habitants are considered as "Camiens".
*'''Elonia''': the homeworld of [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and the capitol of the Solstar Order, where most of its people are recruited to become [[Spaceknights|Space Knights]].
*'''Prysmos''': the former homeworld of the Visionaries, whose factions include the Spectral Knights and the Darkling Lords.

===Dimensions===
*The '''Dead Universe''': a universe where the D-Void exists. 
*'''Microspace''': a subatomic dimension where the [[Micronauts]] live.
*The '''Afterspark''': an [[astral plane]] that the Transformers denominate as its "[[afterlife]]".

===Timelines===
*The '''''Hearts of Steel'' timeline''': a timeline where the Transformers fought on Earth during the [[Industrial Revolution]].
*The '''Funcionist Universe''': a timeline where [[Megatron]] never existed, and a fascist council defined a sole function for each Transformer.

The '''Hugo Awards''' are a set of [[literary award]]s given annually for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and were officially named the Science Fiction Achievement Awards until 1992. Organized and overseen by the [[Worldcon#World Science Fiction Society|World Science Fiction Society]], the awards are given each year at the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1953, at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention]], and have been awarded every year since 1955. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Hugo Awards are given in more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works of various types.

The Hugo Awards have been termed as "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing".&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Works that have won have been published in special collections, and the official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. The 2018 Hugos were presented at the [[76th World Science Fiction Convention|76th Worldcon]], "Worldcon 76", in [[San Jose, California]], on August 19, 2018. The 2019 awards will be presented at the [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|77th Worldcon]], "Dublin 2019: An Irish Worldcon", in [[Dublin]] on August 19, 2019.

For lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the [[#Categories|list of award categories]] below.

The World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' and who is considered one of the "fathers" of the science fiction genre.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; Works are eligible for an award if they were published in the prior calendar year, or translated into English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters, rather than to the organizing committee. Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with five nominees per category, except in the case of a tie.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; The awards are split over more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

For each category of Hugo, the voter may rank "No Award" as one of their choices. Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award, or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely. A vote for "No Award" other than as one's first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominees ranked higher than "No Award" are worthy of a Hugo in that category, while those ranked lower are not.&lt;ref name="thavoting"/&gt;

The six works on the ballot for each category are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. With the exception of 1956, the first years of the awards did not include any recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt; Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.&lt;ref name="thaabout"/&gt; Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works in each category.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt; Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcon"/&gt;

The idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the 1953 convention.&lt;ref name="HugoPropose"/&gt; The idea was based on the [[Academy Awards]],&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt; with the name "Hugo" being given by Robert A. Madle. The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and [[Benedict Jablonski|Ben Jason]] in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent trophy, with the exception of the 1958 trophy, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year.&lt;ref name="HugoTrophy"/&gt; There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo, other than the trophy.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Retro Hugos===
Retrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, were added to the ballot beginning in 1996. They are awards optionally given by a Worldcon for works that would have been eligible 50, 75, or 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

Prior to 2017, these could be awarded for the ten years that had a Worldcon where no Hugos were awarded: the conventions in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name='2015const'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/const-2015.pdf|date=August 23, 2015|publisher=The World Science Fiction Society|title=Constitution of the World Science Fiction Society, as of August 23, 2015|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retro Hugos under these rules were given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award Retro Hugos, and under these rules there would have been no more opportunities to award them until 2022 (for 1947).&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo" /&gt; 

A 2017 rule change expanded the criteria to be any year after 1939 in which no Hugos were awarded, whether or not there was a Worldcon that year, or fifteen years in total: 1939–52 and 1954.&lt;ref name="2017minutes"/&gt; [[Worldcon 76]] and [[77th World Science Fiction Convention|Dublin 2019]] then jointly announced that Retro Hugos would be awarded in 2018 for 1943 and in 2019 for 1944.&lt;ref name="LocusRetroHugoNews2017" /&gt;

==History==

===1950s===
The first Hugo Awards were presented at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention|11th Worldcon]] in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories.&lt;ref name="Hugo53"/&gt; The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them.&lt;ref name="PhilconBook"/&gt; At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.&lt;ref name="Hugo54"/&gt;

The 1954 Worldcon chose not to, but the awards were reinstated at the 1955 Worldcon, and thereafter became traditional. The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award, with "Hugo Award" being an unofficial, but better known name.&lt;ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/&gt; The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in 1958, and since the 1992 awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award.&lt;ref name="Nicholls595"/&gt;&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;

In 1959, though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards, several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional. These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot; defining eligibility to include works published in the prior calendar year, rather than the previous rule of the "preceding year"; and allowing voters to select "no award" as an option, which then won that year in two categories: [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Dramatic Presentation]] and [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|Best New Author]].&lt;ref name="Hugo59"/&gt; The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule, prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the 1958 awards, as the two time periods overlapped.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1960s===
In 1961, after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee, formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee. The rules restricted voting to members of the convention at which the awards would be given, while still allowing anyone to nominate works; nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year's convention in 1963.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded, which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board.&lt;ref name="63minutes"/&gt; These categories were for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]], [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Short Fiction]] (short stories, broadly defined), Dramatic Presentation, [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|Professional Magazine]], [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Professional Artist]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|Best Fanzine]] (fan magazine).&lt;ref name="Hugo61"/&gt; 1963 was also the second year in which "no award" won a category, again for Dramatic Presentation.&lt;ref name="Hugo63"/&gt;

In 1964 the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|additional awards]] were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required to be repeated by future conventions.&lt;ref name="63const"/&gt; This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;

In 1967 categories for [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette|Novelette]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|Fan Writer]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Fan Artist]] were added, and a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]] was added the following year; these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters.&lt;ref name="Hugo67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo68"/&gt; Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;

===1970s===
While traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees, in 1971 this was set down as a formal rule, barring ties.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt; In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]] award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize "the increasing importance of original anthologies".&lt;ref name="Hugo73"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholls596"/&gt;

After that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in 1977.&lt;ref name="Franson36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="74minutes"/&gt; 1971 and 1977 both saw "no award" win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time; "no award" did not win any categories afterwards until 2015.&lt;ref name="Hugo71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo77"/&gt;

===1980s and 90s===
In 1980 the category for Best Non-Fiction Book (later renamed [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work|Best Related Work]]) was added, followed by a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine|Best Semiprozine]] (semi-professional magazine) in 1984.&lt;ref name="Hugo80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo84"/&gt; In 1983, members of the [[Church of Scientology]] were encouraged by people such as [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] to nominate as a bloc ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', written by the organization's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], for the Best Novel award; it did not make the final ballot.&lt;ref name="BEscandal"/&gt; Another campaign followed in 1987 to nominate Hubbard's ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Black Genesis]]''; it made the final ballot but finished behind "no award".&lt;ref name="BGscandal"/&gt; 1989 saw a work—''The Guardsman'' by Todd Hamilton and P. J. Beese—withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names, all sent in on the same day, in order to get the work onto the ballot.&lt;ref name="OlderScandals"/&gt;

In 1990 the Best Original Art Work award was given as an extra Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not actually awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="91minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="90minutes"/&gt; It was then removed from this status in 1996, and has not been awarded since.&lt;ref name="96minutes"/&gt; The Retro Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.&lt;ref name="thafaq"/&gt;

===Since 2000===
In 2003, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories, Long Form and Short Form.&lt;ref name="Hugo03"/&gt; This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hugo07"/&gt; 2009 saw the addition of the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|Best Graphic Story]] category, while the most recent change to the Hugo Awards was in 2012, when an award for [[Hugo Award for Best Fancast|Best Fancast]] was added.&lt;ref name="Hugo09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hugo12"/&gt;

In 2015, two groups of science fiction writers, the "[[Sad Puppies]]" led by [[Brad R. Torgersen]] and [[Larry Correia]], and the "Rabid Puppies" led by [[Vox Day]], each put forward a similar [[voting bloc|slate of suggested nominations]] which came to dominate the ballot.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt; The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale, with limited success. The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to "niche, academic, overtly [leftist]" nominees and the Hugo becoming "an affirmative action award" that preferred female and non-white authors and characters.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 6 April 2015"/&gt; In response, five nominees declined their nomination before and, for the first time, two after the ballot was published.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FirstAfter"/&gt; Multiple-Hugo-winner [[Connie Willis]] declined to present the awards.&lt;ref name="WillisDecline"/&gt; The slates were characterized by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "right wing",&lt;ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /&gt; "orchestrated backlash"&lt;ref name="The Guardian 6 April 2015"/&gt; and by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as a "group of white guys",&lt;ref name="The A.V. Club 6 April 2015"/&gt; and were linked with the [[Gamergate controversy]].&lt;ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston Globe 7 April 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald 9 April 2015"/&gt; Multiple Hugo winner [[Samuel R. Delany]] characterized the campaigns as a response to "socio-economic" changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus "economic heft".&lt;ref name="DelanySP"/&gt; In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category, "no award" placed above all nominees that were on either slate, and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees.&lt;ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/&gt; The two campaigns were repeated in 2016 with some changes to the campaigns, and the "Rabid Puppy" slate again dominated the ballot in several categories, with all five nominees in Best Related Work, Best Graphic Story, Best Professional Artist, and Best Fancast.&lt;ref name="Puppy2016"/&gt;

In response to the campaigns, a set of new rules, called "E Pluribus Hugo", were passed in 2015 and ratified in 2016 to modify the nominations process. Intended to ensure that organized minority groups cannot dominate every finalist position in a category, the new rules define a [[voting system]] in which nominees are eliminated one by one, with each vote for an eliminated work then spread out over the uneliminated works they nominated, until only the final shortlist remains. These rules were ratified in 2016 to be used for the first time in 2017. A rule mandating that the final nominees must appear on at least five percent of ballots was also eliminated, to ensure that all categories could reach a full set of nominees even when the initial pool of works was very large.&lt;ref name="2016RuleChange"/&gt; Each nominator is limited to five works in each category, but the final ballot was changed to six in each; additionally, no more than two works by a given author or group, or in the same dramatic series, can be in one category on the final ballot.&lt;ref name="2017change"/&gt;

In 2018 the newest permanent category, [[Hugo Award for Best Series|Best Series]], was begun; it was run the year prior as a special Hugo Award prior to being ratified at the business meeting.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

The only discontinued awards which were instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, which are not voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did.&lt;ref name="thacat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franson7"/&gt; An additional award, the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]], is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award.&lt;ref name="thacamp"/&gt; Another such award, for Best Young Adult Book, was first awarded in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo18"/&gt;

==Recognition==
The Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has termed it "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing",&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; a claim echoed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', who said that it was "the premier award in the science fiction genre".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referred to the awards as "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards",&lt;ref name="BOTSSF"/&gt; and [[Jo Walton]], writing for ''[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]'', said it was "undoubtedly science fiction's premier award".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' similarly acknowledged it as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" as well as "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" science fiction awards "in existence".&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianHugo2"/&gt; [[James E. Gunn (writer)|James Gunn]], in ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (1988), echoed ''The Guardian''{{'}}s statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that "because of its broad electorate" the Hugos were the awards most representative of "reader popularity".&lt;ref name="TNESF"/&gt; Camille Bacon-Smith, in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a representative sample of the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' or ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final ballot, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes.&lt;ref name="2014noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2014voters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1964voters"/&gt; The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes.&lt;ref name="2015noms"&gt;{{cite web |last=Standlee |first=Kevin |title=2015 Hugo Award Finalists Announced |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/2015/04/2015-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |date=2015-04-04 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2015votes"&gt;{{cite web |last=Searle-Kovacevic |first=Marah |title=Sasquan Announces Record Participation in the 2015 Hugo Awards Voting |url=http://sasquan.org/2015/08/sasquan-announces-record-participation-in-the-2015-hugo-awards-voting/ |publisher=Worldcon 2015 |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 awards saw 4032 nominating ballots and 3130 votes.&lt;ref name="2016noms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2016votes"/&gt;

[[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit; he contrasted it with the panel-selected [[Nebula Award]], which provided "more literary judgment", though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.&lt;ref name="TYS"/&gt; Along with the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] terming it "science fiction's most prestigious award".&lt;ref name="SALONnebula"/&gt;

The official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool.&lt;ref name="HugoLogo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ScalziLogo"/&gt; [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover "demonstrably" increased sales for that novel,&lt;ref name="FWFA"/&gt; though [[Orson Scott Card]] said in his 1990 book ''How to Write Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy'' that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States.&lt;ref name="HWSFF"/&gt; [[Spider Robinson]], in 1992, claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award, more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award.&lt;ref name="SFC"/&gt; Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Hugo Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a "powerful inducement" to science fiction fans to buy a novel,&lt;ref name="MBW"/&gt; while Jo Walton claimed in 2011 that the Hugo is the only science fiction award "that actually affects sales of a book".&lt;ref name="TOR"/&gt;

There have been several anthologies of Hugo-winning short fiction. The series ''[[The Hugo Winners]]'', edited by [[Isaac Asimov]], was started in 1962 as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. ''[[The New Hugo Winners]]'', edited originally by Asimov, later by [[Connie Willis]] and finally by [[Gregory Benford]], has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos.&lt;ref name="AWCGSF"/&gt; The most recent anthology is ''The Hugo Award Showcase'' (2010), edited by [[Mary Robinette Kowal]]. It contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.&lt;ref name="THAS"/&gt;

'''Jordanian art''' has a very ancient history. Some of the earliest figurines, found at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, have been dated to the Neolithic period. A distinct Jordanian aesthetic in art and architecture emerged as part of a broader [[Islamic art]] tradition which flourished from the 7th-century. Traditional art and craft is vested in material culture including mosaics, ceramics, weaving, silver work, music, glass-blowing and calligraphy. The rise of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East, led to a dilution of traditional aesthetics. In the early 20th-century, following the creation of the independent nation of Jordan, a contemporary Jordanian art movement emerged and began to search for a distinctly Jordanian art aesthetic that combined both tradition and contemporary art forms. 

==Traditional art==
{{main article|Islamic art}}
Jordan, as an independent nation was founded in 1924. Prior to that, the area that is now Jordan had been subject to a number of different rules. It was part of the [[Nabatean Kingdom]], under Hellenistic rule following Alexander the Great's conquest of the area; under Roman rule in the 1st century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Beienkowski, P., ''The Art of Jordan,'' Stroud, Allan Sutton, 1991, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; and was once part of the [[Umayyad]] Kingdom in the 7th century (CE) and part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from the 15th-century until the end of World War I&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp 362-363; Taylor, J. ''Petra and the Lost Kingdom of the Nabataeans,'' I.B. Tauris, 2001, p. 11 and p. 47 &lt;/ref&gt; when it became a British protectorate until the time of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East, ''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; Its art is part a broader Islamic artistic tradition, with evidence of classical influences.&lt;ref&gt;''Mideast File,'' Vol. 4, Learned Information, 1985, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional art was often based on material culture including hand-crafts such as rug-making, basket weaving, silver smithing, mosaics, ceramics, and glass-blowing. The Bedouins were largely self-sufficient in the production of goods, and made their own rugs, wove baskets and prepared ceramics. Such works exhibited wide variation in styles, as tribes often used their own tribal motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Bienkowski, P. and van der Steen, E., "Tribes, Trade, and Towns: A New Framework for the Late Iron Age in Southern Jordan and the Negev," ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research,'' No. 323 (Aug., 2001), pp. 21-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordanian art historian, [[Wijdan Ali]] has argued that the traditional Islamic aesthetic evident in craft-based work was displaced by the arrival of colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Contemporary Art from the Islamic World,'' London, Scorpion Publishing, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the decolonised period of the 20th-century, a contemporary art form combining tradition and modern influences can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294; Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Asfour.

===Pre-Islamic art===

As early as the Neolithic period in Jordan, figurines and sculptures were being made. In some of the earliest examples, human skulls were built up with plaster, and inlays were used for the eye sockets.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, L.S., ''The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction,'' Routledge, 2018, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Two caches of figurines discovered at Aïn Ghazal, near Amman, include animal models and some three dozen monumental figurines (pictured below), which scholars believe were important to the ritual and social structure of the peoples living there,&lt;ref&gt;Mithen, S., ''After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000 - 5000 BC,'' UK, Hachette UK, 2011, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have formed part of a burial ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The [['Ain Ghazal Statues|'Ain Ghazal statues]] are very large, with some around three feet in height. Aïn Ghazal was occupied between 7,000 BCE and 5,000 BCE and the statues have been dated to around 6,500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Showing extensive use of plaster,&lt;ref&gt;Bourke, S., ''The Middle East: The Cradle of Civilization Revealed,'' Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; the Aïn Ghazal statues represent a clear departure from the tiny, faceless figures of the Paleolithic period and mark the dawn of a distinct Neolithic art.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F.S., ''Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Concise Western History,'' Cengage Learning, 2016, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nabateans]] incorporated numerous sculpted panels, figurines and decorative friezes into their buildings at [[Petra]] and made pottery. Examples include the architectural detail used on the temple of Qsr al-Bint at Petra&lt;ref&gt;Basile, J.J., "Recently Discovered Relief Sculptures from the Great Temple at Amman," ''Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, vol. 46, The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Amman, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and the prevalent stele representing the gods, as carved reliefs and either cut directly into the rock-face or carved as stand-alone units and placed inside carved niches.&lt;ref&gt;Patrich, J., ''The Formation of Nabataean Art: Prohibition of a Graven Image Among the Nabateans,'' Brill Archive, 1990, pp. 59-76&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Romans conquered Palestine and Syria in 64-63 BCE, and annexed Nabatea in 106 CE by which time the whole of Jordan fell under Roman rule. The Roman occupation corresponded with a flowering of the visual arts - painting, architecture. By the time of the Emperor Justinian (527-565 CE), churches dotted Jordan's landscape and these featured intricate mosaic floors, frescoes and porticos.&lt;ref&gt;"The Art of Ancient Jordan," in ''Minerva,'' Aurora Publications, 1991, pp. 20-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic art ===
{{main|Islamic art}}
The [[Umayyad]] period marks the starting point of Islamic art and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad Castles: The Shift From Late Antique  Military  Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25; Yalman, S., "The Art of the Umayyad Period (661–750)," ''The Met Museum,'' [https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/umay/hd_umay.htm Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealth and patronage of the [[Umayyad]] period stimulated the construction of religious, administrative and royal residences as well as prompting a distinctive style of ''bayt'' (domestic home). Jordan has some of the finest examples of early Islamic architecture including: [[caravanserai]]s, [[desert castles]] (in Arabic known as ''qusayr''), bath-houses, hunting lodges and palaces located in the fringe of the eastern desert.&lt;ref&gt;Genequand, D., "Umayyad  Castles; The Shift From Late Antique Military Architecture to Early Islamic Palatial Building," in: Kennedy, H (ed.), ''Muslim Military Architecture in Greater Syria: from the Coming of Islam to the Ottoman Period,'' [History of Warfare Series], vol. 35, no. 2, Boston Brill, Leiden, 2006, pp. 3-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of great mosques constructed during the rule of the Umayyad caliph [[Al-Walid I]] (705-714) include: the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]] (706 CE), the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] of Jerusalem (715 CE), and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina (709-715). Since the mid 19th-century, a number of the Umayyad sites have been excavated, revealing stunning frescoes, wall and ceiling paintings and statuary.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; One of these paintings, the ''[[Painting of the Six Kings]]'' has been the subject of considerable scholarship with respect to its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O., "The  Painting of the Six Kings at Quṣayr 'Amrah," ''Ars Orientalis,'' Vol. 1, 1954, pp. 185-187&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notable frescoes and relief carvings can be found the [[desert castles]] of Quasyr Al Hallabat; [[Qasr Al-Kharanah|Quasyr al-Kharanah]], [[Qasr Azraq|Quasyr el-Azraq]], [[Qasr Mshatta]] and the [[Qasr Amra|Quasyr 'Amra]] which features frescoes of hunting scenes, musicians, acrobats, entertainers, nude women, wrestlers and scenes of the Royal court.&lt;ref&gt;Fowden, G., ''Qusayr 'Amra: Art and the Umayyad Elite in Late Antique Syria,'' University of California Press, 2004, especially see pp 55-68 for descriptions of the frescoes at Qusayr 'Amra&lt;/ref&gt; Lesser desert castles include [[Qasr Tuba|Quasyr al-Tuba]]; [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi|Quasyr al-Hayr al-Gharbi]]; [[Qasr Burqu'|Quasyr Burqu']], Qasr el `Uweinid and Qasr el Feifeh. &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, D. and Riley, D., ''Rome's Desert Frontiers,'' Routledge, 2012, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry and calligraphy were elevated to high art. Under the [[Umayyad]], writing assumed a special place, often based on scripture and the life of the prophet, Mahommed, but often seen as the carrier of independent meaning and a subject worthy of ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen, R., Grabar, O. and Jenkins, K. (eds.), ''Islamic Art and Architecture, 650-1250 ''Yale University Press, 2001, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Master calligraphers were venerated. The art of calligraphy was passed from master to student in a formal, rigorous system of training that took place over many years, required for students to learn the strict rules and protocols that governed the art form. Both religious and secular writing flourished under the Umayyad dynasty. 

Poets, (known as ''sha'ir'' meaning wizard) were thought to be inspired by a spirit (''jinn''), and were expected to defend the honour of their tribe, and to perpetuate its deeds and accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Art, Literature, and Culture,'' Britannica Educational Publishing, 2009, pp. 58-60&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mu'allaqat]], a collection of seven poems by different poets, although pre-Islamic in origin, is thought to be the precursor to Arabic poetry.

==Early modern art==
The origins of modern art in Jordan have their roots in the 1920s and 1930s when a small number of artists settled in Amman. [[Omar Onsi]] (1901-1969) was a Lebanese artist who settled in Amman in around 1922,&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363; Zuhur, S. (ed.), ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,''American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;  and gave painting lessons to the children of Abdullah I.&lt;ref name="Naef1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naef|first=Silvia |title=À la recherche d'une modernité arabe: l'évolution des arts plastiques en Égypte, au Liban et en Irak|page=160|year=1996|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101376-5|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the Turkish artist, Ziauddin Suleiman (1880-1945) also settled in Amman  and held the first solo exhibition at the Philadelphia Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' pp. 362-363&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, [[George Aleef]] arrived in Jordan with a group of Palestinian refugees and set up an art studio where he taught local students.&lt;ref&gt; Zuhur, S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; These three artists introduced local students to easel painting and contributed to a broader appreciation of art. &lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J.M. and Blair, S. S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' p. 362 &lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the 1940s, Jordan had no art galleries and art exhibitions were virtually unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Mostyn, T., ''Jordan: A Meed Practical Guide,'' Middle East Economic Digest Limited, Jordan, 1983, p. 72; the author claims that the first art exhibition was held in 1938 but adds no detail. However, different sources claim that the first art exhibition was held in  1951, See: ''Jordan,'' Jordan Information Bureau, 1981, p. 53 and Jonathan Bloom and Sheila S. Blair (eds), ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture,'' Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; The few art exhibitions that were mounted, were held in public spaces such as schools and the halls of parliament.

==Jordanian modern art movement==
In the late 1950s, a group of young artists who had trained in Europe, returned to Jordan to lay the foundations of the ''Jordanian modern art movement.''&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; A number of these students, including [[Muhanna Al-Dura]], Rafiq Lahham, and Suha Katibah Noursi, received their earliest art education in Jordan from the Russian émigré, [[George Aleef]], who was the first Western painter to establish a studio in Amman and teach local students. According to Muhanna Dura's memoirs, Aleef taught his students the basics of watercolor, drawing and painting, and the European understanding of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, S., "Mohanna Durra," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohanna-Durra.aspx; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175; Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Dura along with these young artists helped to spark a local, Jordanian art movement. &lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S. and Schwartz, J.P., ''Archives, Museums and Collecting Practices in the Modern Arab World,'' Routledge, 2016, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhanna Dura ultimately taught painting and art history at the Teachers' Training College in Ammman and in 1964, established the Fine Arts Section at the Department of Culture and Art, Amman, and also established the Jordan Institute of Fine Arts in 1970. Thus, he inspired a generation of young artists. Among his notable students were the Princess [[Wijdan Ali]] who is best known for her attempts to revive the traditions of Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;Hashem Talham, G., ''Historical Dictionary of Women in the Middle East and North Africa,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and Nawal Abdallah, who is one of the leading lights of Jordan's contemporary arts scene and whose art often includes calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Teller, M., "A Hit List of Jordanian Artists" in ''Jordan,'' Rough Guides, 2002, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

A second group of artists, who trained in Europe and America in the 1960s, returned to Jordan and began to search for a distinctive Jordanian artistic expression and to assert their Arab identity. Notable artists in the Jordanian art movement include: Khalid Khreis (b. 1955); Nabil Shehadeh (b. 1949); Yasser Duwaik (b. 1940); [[Mahmoud Taha]] (b. 1942) and Aziz Amoura (b. 1944).&lt;ref&gt;Zuhur. S., ''Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East,'' American University in Cairo Press, 2001, pp. 377-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurufiyah art movement==
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall.JPG|thumb|Roof of [[Frere Hall]], Karachi, Pakistan, c. 1986. Pakmural by artist, [[Sadequain|Sadequain Naqqash]], integrates calligraphy into a contemporary artwork]]

{{main|Hurufiyya movement}}
The Hurufiyah Art Movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'' or the ''North African Letterist movement'') refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic form within an artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1955, artists working in North Africa and parts of Asia transformed Arabic calligraphy into a modern art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; The use of calligraphy in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyyah to emerge in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, artworks include both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Roof of Frere Hall (3).JPG|thumb|Detail of Roof of Frere Hall]]
Hurufiyah artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead searched for a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrate Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyah artists were concerned with their individual dialogue with nationalism and attempted to engage with the modern art movement, they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Islamic identity. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan's most notable exponents of hurufiyyah art are the ceramicist, [[Mahmoud Taha]] and the artist and art historian, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]] who through her writing has been able to bring the art movement to the attention of a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan, K.D., ''Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture,'' Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20127">This is a '''list of books in [[computational geometry]].'''
There are two major, largely nonoverlapping categories:
*Combinatorial computational geometry, which deals with collections of discrete objects or defined in discrete terms: points, lines, polygons, polytopes, etc., and algorithms of discrete/combinatorial character are used
*Numerical computational geometry, also known as [[geometric modeling]] and [[computer-aided geometric design]] (CAGD), which deals with modelling of shapes of real-life objects in terms of curves and surfaces with algebraic representation.

==Combinatorial computational geometry==

===General-purpose textbooks===
* {{cite book
|authors = [[Franco P. Preparata]] and [[Michael Ian Shamos]] | title = Computational Geometry - An Introduction | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| year = 1985 | id = 1st edition: {{ISBN|0-387-96131-3}}; 2nd printing, corrected and expanded, 1988: {{ISBN|3-540-96131-3}}; Russian translation, 1989: {{ISBN|5-03-001041-6}}}}
*:The book is the first comprehensive monograph on the level of a graduate textbook to systematically cover the fundamental aspects of the emerging discipline of computational geometry. It is written by founders of the field and the first edition covered all major developments in the preceding 10 years. In the aspect of comprehensiveness it was preceded only by the 1984 survey paper, Lee, D, T., Preparata, F. P. : "Computational geometry - a survey". ''[[IEEE Trans. on Computers]]''. Vol. 33, No. 12, pp.&amp;nbsp;1072–1101 (1984). It is focused on two-dimensional problems, but also has digressions into higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MR|0805539}}, {{MR|1004870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Zbl|0575.68037}}, {{Zbl|0575.68059}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*:The initial core of the book was M.I.Shamos' doctoral dissertation, which was suggested to turn into a book by a yet another pioneer in the field, [[Ronald Graham]].
*:The introduction covers the history of the field, basic data structures, and necessary notions from the [[theory of computation]] and geometry.
*:The subsequent sections cover [[geometric searching]] ([[point location]], [[range searching]]), [[convex hull]] computation, proximity-related problems ([[closest points]], computation and applications of the [[Voronoi diagram]], [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]], [[triangulation]]s, etc.), [[geometric intersection problems]], algorithms for sets of [[isothetic rectangle]]s
* {{cite book
|author = [[Herbert Edelsbrunner]] |year = 1987 | title = Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn = 0-89791-517-8}}
*:The monograph is a rather advanced exposition of problems and approaches in computational geometry focused on the role of [[hyperplane arrangement]]s, which are shown to constitute a basic underlying combinatorial-geometric structure in certain areas of the field. The primary target audience are active theoretical researchers in the field, rather than application developers. Unlike most of books in computational geometry focused on 2- and 3-dimensional problems (where most applications of computational geometry are), the book aims to treat its subject in the general multi-dimensional setting.&lt;ref&gt;A review of Edelsbrunner's book in {{Zbl|0634.52001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{cite book
|authors = [[Mark de Berg]], [[Otfried Cheong]], [[Marc van Kreveld]], and [[Mark Overmars]] | year = 2008 | title = Computational Geometry | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | edition = 3rd revised | isbn = 3-540-77973-6 | id= 1st edition (1997): {{ISBN|3-540-61270-X}}}}
*:The textbook provides an introduction to computation geometry from the point of view of practical applications. Starting with an introduction chapter, each of the 15 remaining ones formulates a real application problem, formulates an underlying geometrical problem, and discusses techniques of computational geometry useful for its solution, with algorithms provided in pseudocode. The book treats mostly 2- and 3-dimensional geometry. The goal of the book is to provide a comprehensive introduction into methods and approached, rather than the cutting edge of the research in the field: the presented algorithms provide transparent and reasonably efficient solutions based on fundamental "building blocks" of computational geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in {{Zbl|0877.68001}} (1st ed.), {{Zbl|0939.68134}} (2nd ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/ About the book by de Berg, van Kreveld, Overmars, and Schwarzkopf]&lt;/ref&gt;
*:The book consists of the following chapters (which provide both solutions for the topic of the title and its applications): "Computational Geometry (Introduction)" "Line Segment Intersection", "Polygon Triangulation", "Linear Programming", "Orthogonal Range Searching", "Point Location", "Voronoi Diagrams", "Arrangements and Duality", "Delaunay Triangulations", "More Geometric Data Structures", "Convex Hulls", "Binary Space Partitions", "Robot Motion Planning", "Quadtrees", "Visibility Graphs", "Simplex Range Searching".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7848">A [[memoir]] is an autobiographical writing normally dealing with a particular subject from the author's life. The following is a list of writers who have described their experiences of being [[political prisoner]]s.  Those included in the list are individuals who were imprisoned for activities ranging from peaceful dissent to violent revolutionary activity.  Some were citizens of the countries whose regimes imprisoned them and others were foreign nationals. What connects them is that they have written about their experience of having been imprisoned because of their political opposition or political identity.

Note, too, that the list omits many autobiographies which deal, only in part, with a period of political imprisonment; and includes some in which imprisonment forms a major part of the book.

==Early life==
Quant was born on 11 February 1934 in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of Welsh teachers.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Births, March quarter 1930, Woolwich, {{cite book|author=Kent, Jacqueline C.|title=Business Builders in Fashion|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5EgJ9BwO5Q0C&amp;pg=PA96|pages=96–99|publisher=The Oliver Press, Inc.|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=2003|isbn=1-881508-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Jack and Mildred Quant (John H Quant married Mildred G Jones, 1925),&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages, December quarter 1925, Woolwich, Vol 1d, page 2092&lt;/ref&gt; were both from mining families; however, they had been awarded scholarships to grammar school and had both attained first-class degrees at [[Cardiff University]] before they moved to London to work as school teachers.&lt;ref name="Designers"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Polan, Brenda|author2=Tredre, Roger|title=The Great Fashion Designer|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–04|publisher=Berg|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84788-228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She went to [[Blackheath High School]], then studied [[illustration]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]]. After gaining a Diploma in Art Education from Goldsmiths, Quant began an apprenticeship at Erik, a high-end [[Mayfair]] [[Hatmaking|milliner]] on [[Brook Street]] next door to [[Claridge's]] hotel.&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2011|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|year=2011|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914124204/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lisa&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Lisa|title=Mary Quant: 'You have to work at staying slim - but it's worth it'|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9087300/Mary-Quant-You-have-to-work-at-staying-slim-but-its-worth-it.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her younger brother John Antony 'Tony' Quant became a high ranking [[dental surgeon|Dental Officer]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette Supplement'', various editions including 27 August 1957 pg 5045 &amp; 14 January 1985 pg 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

She met her future husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene in 1953.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt; They were married from 1957 until his death in 1990, and had a son, Orlando (b. 1970).

==Fashion career==

===Early career===
In November 1955, Quant and Plunket Greene teamed up with a photographer and former [[solicitor]], Archie McNair, to open Quant's first shop on the corner of [[Markham Square]] and [[King's Road]] in Chelsea, London called ''Bazaar'', above "Alexander's", a basement restaurant run by Plunket Green.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy|last=DelaHaye|editor1-last=Steele|editor1-first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1847885632|pages=586–588|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0_3qzO6NTqcC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, they opened the second branch of ''Bazaar'', which was designed by [[Terence Conran]].&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

Successful designs from this early period included small white plastic collars to brighten up sweaters and dresses, bright stockings in colours matched to her knitwear, men's cardigans made long enough to be worn as dresses, and a pair of "mad" lounging [[pyjamas]] made by Quant herself which were featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and purchased by an American manufacturer to copy.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Following this, Quant decided to design and make more of the clothes she stocked, instead of buying-in stock.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Initially working solo, she was soon employing a handful of [[machinist]]s, and by 1966 she was working with eighteen manufacturers concurrently.

For a while in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Quant was one of only two London-based high-end designers consistently offering youthful clothes for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denza|first1=Vanessa|title=Interview with Vanessa Denza MBE|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/vanessa-denza-mbe/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|first1=Gavin|title=How fashion works: couture, ready-to-wear, and mass production|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9781118814994|page=130|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GX-uAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[Kiki Byrne]], who opened her boutique on the King's Road in direct competition with Quant.&lt;ref name=obyrne&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Byrne|first1=Robert|title=Style city: how London became a fashion capital|date=2009|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711228955|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quant and the miniskirt===
[[File:1960s Mary Quant minidress, green, purple and white jersey.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jersey minidress by Mary Quant, late 1960s]]
The miniskirt, described as one of the defining [[1960s in fashion|fashions of the 1960s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ros |last1=Horton |first2=Sally |last2=Simmons |date=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&amp;pg=PA170 |title=Women Who Changed the World |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant. While she is often cited as the inventor of the style, this claim has been challenged by others. [[Marit Allen]], a contemporary fashion journalist and editor of the influential "Young Ideas" pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], firmly stated that another British fashion designer, [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], rather than Quant or [[André Courrèges]], was the original creator of the miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garments worn by Marit Allen|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/garments-worn-by-marit-allen/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit Courrèges with the invention of the style.&lt;ref name=jess&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|title=Chelsea girl who instigated a new era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skirts had been getting shorter since the 1950s—a development Quant considered practical and liberating, allowing women the ability to run for a bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Miles |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=194 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Quant later said, "It was the girls on the [[King's Road]] [during the "[[Swinging London]]" scene] who invented the mini. I was making easy, youthful, simple clothes, in which you could move, in which you could run and jump and we would make them the length the customer wanted. I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'Shorter, shorter.'"&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt; She gave the miniskirt its name, after her favourite make of car, the [[Mini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=203 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and said of its wearers, "they are curiously feminine, but their femininity lies in their attitude rather than in their appearance ... She enjoys being noticed, but wittily. She is lively—positive—opinionated."&lt;ref name="seebohm19710719"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=English Girls in New York: They Don't Go Home Again|work=New York|date=19 July 1971|accessdate=6 January 2015|author=Seebohm, Caroline|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned [[tights]] that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] who offered [[harlequin]]-patterned tights in 1962&lt;ref name=jess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Ernestine|title=The changing world of fashion: 1900 to the present|year=1977|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773498|pages=213|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PNn-T8q3GMXV0QXltIC7Bw&amp;id=AkdEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Balenciaga+stockings+patterned&amp;q=Balenciaga+harlequin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to John Bates.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;Lester, Richard, ''John Bates: Fashion Designer'', London, 2008.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In the late 1960s, Quant popularised [[hot pants]] and became a British fashion icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Quant was responsible for hot pants, the Lolita look, the slip dress, PVC raincoats, smoky eyes and sleek bob haircuts, but it was make-up that eventually made her company the most money.|accessdate=9 January 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=November 2008|work=[[BBC]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hillary Alexander|title=Fashion designer Mary Quant to have design included on Royal Mail stamps|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Apart from the mini, Quant is credited with popularising white "go-go" boots, patterned tights, {{Sic|hide=y|brightly|-}}coloured "Paintbox" make-up, the micro-mini skirt, plastic raincoats, the "wet look", and hot-pants, which she designed in 1966, the year she received an OBE from the Queen for her services to the fashion industry.|accessdate=9 January 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, UK|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines, including the [[duvet]] which she claims to have invented.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;

In 1988, Quant designed the interior of the [[Mini]] (1000) Designer (originally dubbed the Mini Quant, the name was changed when popularity charts were set against having Quant's name on the car). It featured black and white striped seats with red trimming. The seatbelts were red, and the driving and passenger seats had Quant's signature on the upper left quadrant. The steering wheel had Quant's signature daisy and the bonnet badge had "Mary Quant" written over the signature name. The headlight housings, wheel arches, door handles and bumpers were all nimbus grey, rather than the more common chrome or black finishes. Two thousand were released in the U.K. on 15 June 1988, and a number were also released on to foreign markets; however, the numbers for these are hard to come by. The special edition Mini came in two body colours, jet black and diamond white. She is a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], and winner of the ''Minerva Medal'', the Society's highest award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These were the days that shook the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/20/review.features7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she resigned as director of ''Mary Quant Ltd.'', her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out.&lt;ref name=gillan&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|title=Mary Quant quits fashion empire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan.&lt;ref name="gillan" /&gt;

===Recognition===
In 1963 Quant was the first winner of the [[Dress of the Year]] award.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9413">'''Media economics''' embodies [[economics|economic]] theoretical and practical economic questions specific to [[Mass media|media]] of all types. Of particular concern to media economics are the economic policies and practices of media companies and disciplines including [[journalism]] and the [[news industry]], [[film]] production, [[entertainment]] programs, [[Printing|print]], [[Broadcasting|broadcast]], mobile communications, [[Internet]], [[advertising]] and [[public relations]]. [[Deregulation]] of media, media ownership and concentration, market share, [[intellectual property rights]], competitive economic strategies, company economics, "[[media tax]]" and other issues are considered parts of the field. Media economics has [[social]], cultural, and economic implications.Regular study of media economic issues began in the 1970s but flourished in the 1980s with the addition of classes on the subject at U.S. and European universities. ''[[The Journal of Media Economics]]'' began publishing in 1988, edited by [[Robert G. Picard]], one of the founding fathers of the discipline. Since that time the field of inquiry has flourished and there are now hundreds of universities offering courses and programs in media economics. Other significant figures in the field have included [[Steven S. Wildman]], Alan Albarran, [[Bruce M. Owen]], Ben Compaine, [[Ghislain Deslandes]], Stuart McFadyen, Gillian Doyle, Karl Erik Gustafsson, Lucy Küng, Gregory Ferrell Lowe, Nadine Toussaint Desmoulins, [[Achour Fenni]], [[Amanda D. Lotz]], and Stephen Lacy.

Within academia, the location of media economics research varies depending upon the tradition and history of the institution. In some universities it is located in schools of business or economics, whereas in others it is located in communication, media or journalism schools (or departments).

The term "[[cultural economics]]" is sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for media economics but they are not substitutable. Cultural economics includes a wide variety of activities that do not necessarily involve mediated dissemination such as museums, symphonies, operas, and festivals. At times these may cross over into media economic issues, such as when audio or video recordings are made of performances or museum holdings are put on [[CD]]s.

== Worldwide media ==
There is no definitive list of every radio and television station in the world. The [[National Association of Broadcasters]] cites the estimate from the U.S. [[C.I.A.]] World Fact Book, which reports that "as of January 2000, there are over 21,500 television stations and over 44,000 radio stations." (CIA World Fact Book references – [https://web.archive.org/web/20070613004233/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2013.html Radio],  [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2015.html TV])

== Advertising revenues ==
In the United States, a report from the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB) states that in 2002, radio's revenue reached $19.4 billion, an increase of 5.7% from the $17.7 billion earned in 2001. For additional details see [https://web.archive.org/web/20050513032002/http://www.rab.com/station/marketing_guide/RMGFB2004.pdf RAB's Radio Fact Book]. Total broadcast revenues for 2001 were $54.4 billion, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20030222120906/http://www.tvb.org/rcentral/MediaTrendsTrack/tvbasics/19_Total_and_TV_Ad_Volume.asp reported by The Television Advertising Bureau (TVB)].

=== Advertiser spending ===
:Quote – "Annually advertisers spend approximately $150 billion to sponsor TV and radio programs, in the hopes of making two-to-three times as much in return from media consumers who buy their products and services (Fox, 2002). From the 1970s to the 1990s, the daily number of ads targeted at the average American jumped from 560 to 3,000 (Fox, 2002). In that same time frame, the number of ads to which children were exposed increased from 20,000 per year (Adler et al., 1977) to more than 40,000 per year (Kunkel &amp; Gantz, 1992; also see Strasburger, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lrc.edu/psy/dillk/The%20economics%20of%20media%20violence.htm |author1=Bartholow, Bruce D. |author2=Dill, Karen E. |author3=Anderson, Kathryn B. |author4=Lindsay, James J. |title=The Economics of Media Violence|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030728162039/http://www.lrc.edu/psy/dillk/The%20economics%20of%20media%20violence.htm |archivedate=2003-07-28|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">[[File:Mottledskin.JPG|thumb|This [[Appaloosa horse]] shows mottling around its mouth and nostrils. In this particular case, it is a normal hereditary trait linked to a spotted [[equine coat color|coat color pattern]] and not a sign of disease]]

'''Mottle''' is a pattern of irregular marks, spots, streaks, [[blotch]]es or patches of different [[shade (color)|shade]]s or [[colour]]s.  It is commonly used to describe the surface of [[plant]]s or the [[skin]] of [[animal]]s.  In plants, mottling usually consists of yellowish spots on [[plant]]s, and is usually a sign of disease or malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;ICTVdB Management (2006). 00.057.0.01.068. Tobacco vein mottling virus. In: ICTVdB - The Universal Virus Database, version 4. Büchen-Osmond, C. (Ed), Columbia University, New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;  Many plant viruses cause mottling, some examples being:
* [[Tobacco vein mottling virus]]
* [[Bean pod mottle virus]]

Mottling is sometimes used to describe uneven discolored patches on the skin of humans as a result of [[Ischemia#Variations|cutaneous ischemia]] (lowered blood flow to the surfaces of the skin) or [[Herpes zoster]] infections.&lt;ref&gt;Def. of Anesthesia and IC - www.aic.cuhk.edu.hk/web8/Skin%20mottling.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The medical term for mottled skin is [[dyschromia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Pathophysiology; Concepts of Altered Health States|last = Porth|first = C.|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is not always the case, mottling can occur in the dying patient and commonly indicates that the end of life is near. Mottling usually occurs in the extremities (lower first) and progresses up as cardiac function declines and circulation throughout the body is poor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In animals, mottling may be a sign of disease, but may also be a hereditary trait, such as seen with the [[champagne gene|champagne]] and [[leopard complex]] genes in [[horse]]s.

Mottles can also refer to discoloration in processed food, such as butter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(20)94253-4 | last= Hunziker | first=O F | authorlink = Otto Frederick Hunziker |author2=D.

In [[geology]], mottled refers to a patchy/blotch texture of alteration or interbedding, commonly found in [[limestone]] and commonly caused by [[bioturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/sgmc-unit.php?unit=CTOse%3B0 |title=Units e and d [of Stockbridge Marble&amp;#93; (CTOse;0) |publisher=Tin.er.usgs.gov |date=2003-09-18 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mottling can also refer to an undesirable defect which can occur with effect coatings, most obvious on light metallic finishes. The total color impression shows irregular areas of lightness variations. These "patches" are usually visually evaluated, described as a mottling effect. Some also feel that it reminds them of clouds. This effect is especially noticeable on large body panels. It can be caused by the coating formulation, as well as variations in the application process. For example, disorientation of the metallic flakes or film thickness variations of the basecoat can lead to various mottle sizes resulting in a non-uniform appearance. The visual perception of mottling is dependent on the viewing distance: Large mottles can be seen in far distance evaluation, while small mottles are more noticeable in close up evaluation. The visual evaluation of mottling is very subjective, as it depends
on the illumination conditions, the observing distance and the viewing angle.

In graphics printing mottling refers to an uneven coloration resulting from letterpressed printing of textured papers, mainly in larger colored surfaces. Due to the uneven surface, not all fibers of the paper are evenly saturated with color unlike offset printing.

== Measurement ==

The irregular lightness variations caused by mottling can be objectively measured with specially made instruments. These instruments simulate visual evaluation under different observing angles and characterize clouds / mottles by their size and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Koleske, Paint and Coating Testing Manual, p. 370, {{ISBN|0-8031-2060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small to large mottles are measured under three observing angles, in which the scan length can usually be varied from 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm. The measurement results are independent of color and curvature of the surface and thus can be considered objective.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altana.com/fileadmin/BYK/downloads/instruments/Cat-Pages10-11_E/02_Appearance/Mottling/cloud-runner.pdf |title=cloud-runner |publisher= |accessdate=2012-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific measurement process for one such instrument is as follows.
It first optically scans the surface and measures the lightness variations. The specimen is illuminated with a white light LeD at a 15° angle and the lightness is detected under three
viewing angles to simulate visual evaluation under different observing conditions: 15°, 45° and 60° measured from the specular reflection. The mottling meter is rolled across the surface for a defined distance of 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;cm and measures the lightness variations point by point. The measurement signal is divided via mathematical filter functions into 6 different size ranges and a rating value is calculated for each angle and mottle size. The higher the value is, the
more visible the mottling effect. The measured values are displayed in a graph showing the mottle size on the X-axis and the rating value on the Y-axis. Thus, target values for small and large mottle sizes can be established for paint batch approval as well as process control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.altana.com/fileadmin/BYK/downloads/instruments/Cat-Pages10-11_E/02_Appearance/Mottling/Intro_Mottling.pdf |title=Mottling |publisher= |accessdate=2012-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its past presidents, [[Don DeFore]], was instrumental in arranging for the [[Emmy Award]]s to be broadcast on national TV for the first time on March 7, 1955. Other past presidents include John Cannon, Peter Price and [[Frank Radice]].

In June 2002, the Board of Trustees of the [[National Television Academy]] (NTA) unanimously approved the formation of the Lone Star Chapter in [[Texas]], and in four years, the chapter has grown to become one of the largest in the country.&lt;ref name="urlLone Star Chapter of NATAS - About Us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lonestaremmy.org/_about_us/overview.php |title=Lone Star Chapter of NATAS - About Us |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}Academy Formation and Boundary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

NATAS distributes several groups of Emmy Awards, including the [[Daytime Emmy Award]]s, the [[Sports Emmy Award]]s, the [[News &amp; Documentary Emmy Award|News and Documentary Emmy Awards]], the [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award|Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards]], and "Public Service".

NATAS also supervised the primetime Emmy Awards until a split between the East and West memberships in the 1970s led to the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] leaving NATAS. ATAS supervises the primetime and Los Angeles area Emmys, while NATAS is in charge of the other Emmy honors. In 2007, the organization spawned a peer organization dedicated to new media, called the National Academy of Media Arts &amp; Sciences (NAMAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmyonline.org/namas/|title=NATAS|publisher=Emmy Online|accessdate=May 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922021711/http://www.emmyonline.org/namas/|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATAS publishes a [[magazine]], '''''Television Quarterly''''', which started in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/tvq.html |title=Television Quarterly |work=Emmy Online |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030420155530/http://www.emmyonline.org/emmy/tvq.html |archivedate=April 20, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal List June 2015|url=http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/publications/Journal%20List.htm|work=FIAF|accessdate=October 25, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019054727/http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/publications/Journal%20List.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local NATAS chapters organize award ceremonies of their own, handing out Emmy statues similar to those given out at the national ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |title=The Emmy Awards - National Academy Chapters |publisher=Emmyonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922040419/http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html |archivedate=2009-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lone Star Emmy Awards are a division of the NATAS. The division was founded in 2002 and in addition to granting the Lone Star Emmy Awards, it recognizes awards scholarships, honors industry veterans at the Silver Circle Celebration, conducts National Student Television Awards of Excellence, has a free research and a nationwide job bank. The chapter also participates in judging Emmy entries at the regional and national levels.&lt;ref name="urlLone Star EMMY Educational Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lonestaremmy.org/awards/ |title=Lone Star EMMY Educational Foundation |author=[[NATAS]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}Educational Information&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Orun Mooru''''' (English: '''''Heaven is Hot''''') is a 1982 Nigerian [[comedy film]] directed by [[Ola Balogun]] and produced by [[Moses Olaiya]] (Baba Sala). The film narrates the story of a once successful businessman who was tricked by a herbalist into a failed [[get-rich-quick scheme]], and then decides to commit suicide.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W."&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=kRR2fBv2NhUC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=orun+mooru&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYpKWdv-3eAhUSqxoKHerPA8gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=orun%2520mooru&amp;f=true |title=African Cinema: Postcolonial and Feminist Readings |last=Harrow |first=Kenneth W. |date=1999 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780865436978 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Orun Mooru'' narrates the story of Karounwi (Moses Olaiya), a basketmaker who lives in a fishing village. Flashback shows that he used to be a thriving businessman, until he was tricked by a Babalawo (herbalist) into believing that he could fill oil drums with money.

Karounwi receives a loan of ₦500 from a friend. He loses all the money; half to a pickpocket, and the other half when his wife exchanged the drums he saved the money for new plates. This turn of events led him into committing suicide and he finds himself in the underworld.

Iku (means: ''[[Death (personification)|Death]]'') tells him that he isn't ready for his coming, Karounwi then ascends to meet the Ayo (means: ''Joy''), who then sends him off with two magical eggs and two of her disciples, to escort him back to earth.

Upon reaching earth in a lavish mansion, Karounwi has sex with the two disciples from the underworld, then breaks one of the eggs, which transforms into a huge pile of money. He goes ahead to break the second egg, despite the standing instruction not to do so. Upon doing so, Death appears. 

Karounwi is seen coming into his shack in the fishing village. A flashback shows that he has been fished out of the water from under the bridge he had thrown himself to commit suicide.

==Cast==
*[[Moses Olaiya]] as Lamidi
*[[King Sunny Ade]] as himself (cameo)

==Production==
The film was originally shot on [[35 mm film]], but was reduced to [[16 mm film]] for distribution and exhibition.&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nigeriafilms.com/celebrity-gossips/102-sightings/7783-i-was-the-first-actor-to-be-dealt-with-by-pirates-baba-sala |title=I Was The First Actor To Be Dealt With By Pirates -Baba Sala |website=www.nigeriafilms.com |language=en-gb |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underworld scenes of the film were shot at the [[Osun Grove]], Osogbo.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;

==Reception==
''Orun Mooru'' went on to be a very successful film, but its success was cut short, when it was pirated and bootlegged before it concluded its theatre run.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;

===Critical reception===
Kenneth W. Harrow states: "The themes of over-reaching greed and wild swings from the village life from the lavish property and back again, are close to the heart Nigerian national experience during the oil boom years [...] Propelled by his moral wills, Baba Sala bounces among four sharply opposing realms".&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;

==Piracy==
Not long after the theatrical release of ''Orun Mooru'', it got pirated and bootlegged following the theft of the film's master celluloid tape.&lt;ref name="Kenneth W." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt; The piracy happened before the end of the theatrical run of the film; several cinemas in different cities across the country screened the film without being licensed to do so and remuneration never reached the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://punchng.com/baba-sala-forgave-those-who-pirated-orun-mooru-before-he-died-emmanuel-son/ |title=Baba Sala forgave those who pirated Orun Mooru before he died –Emmanuel, son |last=Makinde |first=Femi |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss incurred as a result of this piracy significantly affected the career of Moses Olaiya in the film industry, as well as his personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=NsQwAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=orun+mooru&amp;dq=orun+mooru&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV38XHv-3eAhVlxYUKHT-LCgk4ChDoAQhJMAg |title=Glendora Review |date=2001 |publisher=Glendora International (Nigeria) Limited |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/movies/7-movies-produced-by-baba-sala-and-which-he-played-lead-roles-id8951145.html |title=7 movies produced by Baba Sala and which he played lead roles |last=Bada |first=Gbenga |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.newtelegraphng.com/2017/05/bala-sala-never-recovered-orun-mooru-travails/ |title=Bala Sala: I never recovered from my Orun Mooru travails |last=Adeyemo |first=Adeolu |date=2017-05-27 |website=www.newtelegraphng.com |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.informationng.com/2017/03/things-didnt-know-moses-olaiya-aka-baba-sala.html |title=Things you didn't know about Moses Olaiya aka ( Baba Sala ) - INFORMATION NIGERIA |date=2017-03-14 |website=INFORMATION NIGERIA |language=en-US |access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piracy of ''Orun Mooru'' has been reported as a first major incidence of piracy in the Nigerian film industry.&lt;ref name="Nigeriafilms" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tns.ng/moses-olaiya-baba-sala-comedy-legend/ |title=Moses Olaiya Adejumo (Baba Sala): The Comedy Legend Who Was Brutally Attacked By Pirates |last=Odejimi |first=Segun |date=2018-10-08 |website=TNS |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201811140097.html |title=Nigeria: Beyond Laughter, a Purvey of Baba Sala's Role in Nigeria's Economic Development |last=Adejumo-Ayibiowu |first=Oyindamola |date=2018-11-14 |website=The Guardian (Lagos) |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Patrons of Northwest Civic, Cultural and Charitable Organizations''' ('''PONCHO''') is a [[non-profit corporation]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], [[United States]], whose annual fund-raising auction has long played a significant role in funding the [[arts in Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones 1972|p=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the years, the gala auction slowly ceased to be profitable and will not occur after 2008, being replaced by smaller art and wine auctions.&lt;ref name=Trapnell&gt;{{cite web|last=Trapnell|first=Susan|title=As PONCHO regroups, Seattle arts struggle|date= July 24, 2008|publisher=''[[Crosscut.com]]''|url=http://crosscut.com/2008/07/24/arts/16191/As-PONCHO-regroups%2C-Seattle-arts-struggle/ |accessdate=August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet True, president of the PONCHO board, has indicated that the gala auction will probably be replaced by something parallel to [[New York City]]'s [[Tony Awards]].&lt;ref name=Kiley-1&gt;Brendan Kiley, [http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/07/executive_of_poncho_canned Executive Director of PONCHO Fired], Slog, ''The Stranger's'' blog, July 18, 2008. Accessed online 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 1963 to hold an auction to retire the US$35,000 debt accumulated by the [[Seattle Symphony]]'s critically successful performance of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] ''[[Aida]]'' at the 1962 Seattle [[World's Fair]], the [[Century 21 Exposition]]. They exceeded their goal, raising enough additional money to give $50,000 to the Symphony to help establish the [[Seattle Opera]], as well as $15,000 to the Council on Aging and $1,000 to the Seattle Chorale. In the subsequent 45 years, PONCHO has raised over $33 million for more than 200 Seattle-area arts organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poncho.org/aboutponcho.shtml About PONCHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914160227/http://www.poncho.org/aboutponcho.shtml |date=2008-09-14 }}, PONCHO official site.

Brendan Kiley of Seattle [[alternative weekly]] ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'', writing on the occasion of PONCHO executive director Gordon Hamilton's forced departure in July 2008, sees PONCHO as gradually shifting from being a "deep donor" to large arts institutions into a "broad donor" whose beneficiaries have come to include smaller groups.&lt;ref name=Kiley-1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3559">The '''Prague Biennale''' is an international art exhibition in [[Prague]], Czech Republic, held in alternate (odd-numbered) years. It was founded in 2003 by [[Helena Kontova]] and [[Giancarlo Politi]].&lt;ref name=bf /&gt; It is supported by the Czech [[Ministry of Culture (Czech Republic)|Minister of Culture]] and the City of [[Prague]]. The ''[[New York Times]]'' said of it in 2009: "Now in its fourth iteration, the biennial has a reputation for working on the cheap (the lighting is minimal to nonexistent, meaning viewings have to end by sundown) and for offering the first appearance of emerging artists from Central and Eastern Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/travel/19cultured.html?pagewanted=3|title=In Prague, Art is Everywhere but Not Always Easy...|date=19 July 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 January 2013 | first=Evan | last=Rail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-tiling tile set''', or ''setiset'', of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes or pieces, usually planar, each of which can be tiled with smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes. That is, the ''n'' shapes can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to create larger copies of themselves, where the increase in scale is the same in each case. Figure 1 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 using distinctly shaped [[decominoes]]. The concept can be extended to include pieces of higher dimension. The name setisets was coined by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2012,&lt;ref name=mathmag&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]] |date=December 2012 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=323–333 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.85.5.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://alejandroerickson.com/home/blog/blog.php?entry=15 Alejandro Erickson on Self-tiling tile sets]&lt;/ref&gt; but the problem of finding such sets for ''n'' = 4 was asked decades previously by C. Dudley Langford, and examples for [[polyabolo]]es (discovered by [[Martin Gardner]], Wade E. Philpott and others) and [[polyomino]]es (discovered by Maurice J. Povah) were previously published by Gardner.&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;''Polyhexes and Polyaboloes'' in ''Mathematical Magic Show'', by Martin Gardner, Knopf, 1977, pp 146-159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and definitions==
[[File:A setiset with duplicated piece.png|thumb|300px|Figure 2:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset with duplicated piece.]]
From the above definition it follows that a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces is the same thing as a 'self-replicating tile' or [[rep-tile]], of which setisets are therefore a generalization.&lt;ref name=mathmag2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sallows |first1=Lee |title=More On Self-Tiling Tile Sets |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=April 2014 |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=100–112 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.87.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setisets using ''n'' distinct shapes, such as Figure 1, are called ''perfect''. Figure 2 shows an example for ''n'' = 4 which is ''imperfect'' because two of the component shapes are the same.
{{clear}}

The shapes employed in a setiset need not be ''connected'' regions. Disjoint pieces composed of two or more separated islands are also permitted. Such pieces are described as ''disconnected'', or ''weakly-connected'' (when islands join only at a point), as seen in the setiset shown in Figure 3.

The fewest number of pieces in a setiset is two. Figure 4 encapsulates an infinite family of order 2 setisets each composed of two triangles, ''P'' and ''Q''. As shown, the latter can be hinged together to produce a compound triangle that has the same shape as ''P'' or ''Q'', depending upon whether the hinge is fully open or fully closed. This unusual specimen thus provides an example of a [[hinged dissection]].

==Inflation and Deflation==
[[File:A setiset of order 4 showing two stages of inflation.png|thumb|left|300px|Figure 5:  {{pad|.2em}}  A setiset of order 4 using octominoes. Two stages of inflation are shown.]]

The properties of setisets mean that their pieces form [[substitution tiling]]s, or [[tessellations]] in which the [[prototile]]s can be dissected or combined so as to yield smaller or larger duplicates of themselves. Clearly, the twin actions of forming still larger and larger copies (known as inflation), or still smaller and smaller dissections (deflation), can be repeated indefinitely. In this way, setisets can produce non-periodic tilings. However, none of the non-periodic tilings thus far discovered qualify as [[Aperiodic tiling|aperiodic]], because the prototiles can always be rearranged so as to yield a periodic tiling. Figure 5 shows the first two stages of inflation of an order 4 set leading to a non-periodic tiling.

==Loops==
[[File:A loop of length 2 using decominoes.png|thumb|300px|Figure 6:  {{pad|.2em}}  A loop of length 2 using decominoes.]]
Besides self-tiling tile sets, which can be interpreted as loops of length 1, there exist longer loops, or closed chains of sets, in which every set tiles its successor.&lt;ref name=delahaye&gt;[http://www.scilogs.fr/complexites/pepites-geometriques-cachees/ ''Geometric Hidden Gems'' by Jean-Paul Delahaye in Scilogs], April 07, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 6 shows a pair of mutually tiling sets of [[decominoes]], in other words, a loop of length 2. Sallows and Schotel did an exhaustive search of order 4 sets that are composed of [[octominoes]]. In addition to seven ordinary setisets (i.e., loops of length 1) they found a bewildering variety of loops of every length up to a maximum of 14. The total number of loops identified was nearly one and a half million. More research in this area remains to be done, but it seems safe to suppose that other shapes may also entail loops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leesallows.com/index.php?page_menu=Self-Tiling%20Tile%20Sets Self-Tiling Tile Sets website]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

==Methods of construction==
To date, two methods have been used for producing setisets. In the case of sets composed of shapes such as [[polyomino]]es, which entail integral piece sizes, a brute force search by computer is possible, so long as ''n'', the number of pieces involved, is not prohibitive. It is easily shown that ''n'' must then be a [[Square number|perfect square]].&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt; Figures 1,2,3,5 and 6 are all examples found by this method.

Alternatively, there exists a method whereby multiple copies of a rep-tile can be dissected in certain ways so as to yield shapes that create setisets. Figures 7 and 8 show setisets produced by this means, in which each piece is the union of 2 and 3 rep-tiles, respectively. In Figure 8 can be seen how the 9 pieces above together tile the 3 rep-tile shapes below, while each of the 9 pieces is itself formed by the union of 3 such rep-tile shapes. Hence each shape can be tiled with smaller duplicates of the entire set of 9.&lt;ref name=mathmag2/&gt;

A '''strophe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|r|oʊ|f|iː}}) is a poetic term originally referring to the first part of the [[ode]] in [[Ancient Greek tragedy]], followed by the [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]]. The term has been extended to also mean a structural division of a poem containing [[stanza]]s of varying line length. Strophic poetry is to be contrasted with poems composed line-by-line non-stanzaically, such as Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poems]] or English [[blank verse]], to which the term ''[[stichic]]'' applies.

In its original Greek setting, "strophe, antistrophe and epode were a kind of [[stanza]] framed only for the music," as [[John Milton]] wrote in the preface to ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', with the strophe chanted by a [[Greek chorus]] as it moved from right to left across the scene.

==Etymology==
Strophe (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:στροφή|στροφή]], "turn, bend, twist") is a concept in [[poetry|versification]] which properly means a turn, as from one [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] to another, or from one side of a chorus to the other.

==Poetic structure==
In a more general sense, the strophe is a pair of [[stanza]]s of alternating form on which the structure of a given poem is based, with the strophe usually being identical with the stanza in modern poetry and its arrangement and recurrence of rhymes giving it its character. But the Greeks called a combination of verse-periods a system, giving the name "strophe" to such a system only when it was repeated once or more in unmodified form.

A simple form of Greek strophe is the Sapphic strophe. Like all Greek verse, it is composed of alternating long and short syllables (symbolized by '''—''' for long, '''u''' for short and '''x''' for either long or short) in this case arranged in the following manner:&lt;ref&gt;William S. Annis. Introduction to Greek Meter. Aoidoi.org January 2006. [http://www.aoidoi.org/articles/meter/intro.pdf. Page 11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — —'''

'''— u — x — u u — u — x — u u — —'''

Far more complex forms are found in the odes of [[Pindar]] and the choral sections of [[Greek drama]].

In choral poetry, it is common to find the strophe followed by a metrically identical [[antistrophe]], which may – in Pindar and other [[epinician]] poets – be followed in turn by a metrically dissimilar [[epode]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwin D. Floyd. "Some more or less technical observations on Greek rhythm." class material for University of Pittsburgh: Classics 1130. http://www.pitt.edu/~edfloyd/Class1130/strophe.html accessed January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; creating an ''AAB'' form.

==Origins and development==
It is said that [[Archilochus of Paros|Archilochus]] first created the strophe by binding together systems of two or three lines. But it was the [[Greece|Greek]] ode-writers who introduced the practice of strophe-writing on a large scale, and the art was attributed to [[Stesichorus]], although it is likely that earlier poets were acquainted with it. The arrangement of an [[ode]] in a splendid and consistent artifice of strophe, [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] was carried to its height by [[Pindar]].

==Variant forms==
With the development of Greek [[Meter (poetry)|prosody]], various peculiar strophe-forms came into general acceptance, and were made celebrated by the frequency with which leading poets employed them. Among these were the ''Sapphic,'' the ''Elegiac,'' the ''Alcaic,'' and the ''Asclepiadean'' strophe, all of them prominent in Greek and Latin verse. The briefest and the most ancient strophe is the ''dactylic distych,'' which consists of two verses of the same class of rhythm, the second producing a melodic counterpart to the first.

==Reproductions==
The forms in modern English verse which reproduce most exactly the impression aimed at by the ancient odestrophe are the elaborate rhymed stanzas of such poems as [[John Keats|Keats]]' ''[[wikisource:Ode to a Nightingale|Ode to a Nightingale]]'' or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[wikisource:The Scholar-Gipsy|The Scholar-Gipsy]]''.

A strophic form of poetry called [[Muwashshah]] developed in [[Andalucia]] as early as the 9th century C.E, which then spread to North Africa and the Middle East. Muwashshah was typically in classical Arabic, with the refrain sometimes in the local dialect.

==Contemporary usage==
The term strophe is used in modern and post-modern criticism, to indicate "long non-isomorphic units".&lt;ref&gt;Page 1360, Entry 'STROPHE', The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics: Fourth Edition, edited by Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, Paul Rouzer&lt;/ref&gt; The term "stanza [is used] for more regular ones" (ibid). This appropriation of the ancient term is useful, as contemporary poetry is a frequent turns (the original meaning of Strophe), and it avoids relying upon the invention of new terminology such as 'word clumps'.

[[File:Sydney parkinson.jpg|thumb|Sydney Parkinson - self-portrait]]
'''Sydney Parkinson''' (c. 1745 – 26 January 1771) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[botanical illustrator]] and [[natural history]] artist.  He was the first European artist to visit Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barker, "Wide-eyes on a painted ocean", ''The Guardian'', republished in ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 July 1999, Spectrum, p. 13s&lt;/ref&gt;

Parkinson was employed by [[Joseph Banks]] to travel with him on [[James Cook]]'s first voyage to the [[Pacific]] in 1768,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Parkinson, botanical draughtsman|url=http://otago.ourheritage.ac.nz/items/show/7583|website=Enlarging the prospects of happiness: European travel writing through the ages. Online exhibition|publisher=University of Otago|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[HMS Endeavour]]. Parkinson made nearly a thousand drawings of plants and animals collected by Banks and [[Daniel Solander]] on the voyage. He had to work in difficult conditions, living and working in a small cabin surrounded by hundreds of specimens. In [[Tahiti]] he was plagued by swarms of flies which ate the paint as he worked. He died at sea on the way to [[Cape Town]] of [[dysentery]] contracted at Princes' Island off the western end of [[Java]]. Banks paid his outstanding salary to his brother.

Parkinson is commemorated in the common and scientific name of the [[Parkinson's petrel]] ''Procellaria parkinsoni''. The great [[Banks' Florilegium|Florilegium]] of his work was finally published in 1988 by Alecto Historical Editions in 35 volumes and has since been digitized by the Natural History Museum in London.

In 1986 he was honoured on a [[postage stamp]] depicting his portrait issued by [[Australia Post]] [http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0015740.jpg]

The following are some examples of Parkinson's artistic work:

'''''Taking the Count''''' is an 1898 painting by American artist [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is part of the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;http://artgallery.yale.edu/collections/objects/5463&lt;/ref&gt;

This depiction of a [[prizefight]] marks Eakins' return to anatomical studies of the male figure, this time in a more urban setting. ''Taking the Count'' was his second largest canvas, but not his most successful composition.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Lloyd, ''Thomas Eakins'', Vol. II (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1982), p. 147.  {{ISBN|0-674-88490-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may be said of his ''[[Wrestlers (Eakins)|Wrestlers]]'' (1899). More successful was ''[[Between Rounds]]'' (1899), for which boxer Billy Smith posed seated in his corner at [[Philadelphia]]'s Arena; in fact, all of principal figures in this composition were posed by models re-enacting what had been an actual [[boxing]] match.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, Vol. II, ''op. cit.,'' p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamil cinema''' refers to [[Tamil language|Tamil-language]] [[Film|motion pictures]], which are primarily made in [[India]]. Based in the city of [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiro|first=Dilip |title=After Empire: The Birth of a Multipolar World|year=2010|isbn=978-1-56858-427-0|page=248|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zlivv_pQWnAC&amp;pg=PA248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the hub of the Tamil film industry is in the [[Kodambakkam]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]].

==History==

===Early exhibitors===

In 1897, M. Edwards first screened a selection of silent short films at the [[Victoria Public Hall]] in [[Chennai|Madras]]. The films all featured non-fictional subjects; they were mostly photographed records of day-to-day events. The film scholar Stephen Hughes points out that within a few years there were regular ticketed shows in a hall in Pophams Broadway, started by one Mrs. Klug, but this lasted only for a few months. Once it was demonstrated as a commercial proposition, a Western entrepreneur, Warwick Major, built the first cinema theatre, the Electric Theatre, which still stands. It was a favourite haunt of the British community in Madras. The theatre was shut down after a few years. This building is now part of a post office complex on [[Anna Salai]] ([[Mount Road]]). The ''Lyric Theatre'' was also built in the Mount Road area. This venue boasted a variety of events, including plays in English, [[Western culture|Western]] classical music concerts, and [[ballroom]] dances. Silent films were also screened as an additional attraction.&lt;ref name="folklore"&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore, public sphere, and civil society|page=116
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xsrgg1Mel8UC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Victoria+Public+Hall+Tamil+cinema&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=lCj2TbnkGo6G-waE8pjjBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Victoria%20Public%20Hall&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swamikannu Vincent]], a railway draftsman from Tiruchirapalli, became a travelling exhibitor in 1905. He showed short movies in a tent in Esplanade, near the present Parry's Corner, using carbide jet-burners for projection. He bought the [[film projector]] and silent films from the Frenchman [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont|Du Pont]] and set up a business as [[film exhibitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiaheritage.org/perform/cinema/history/vincent.htm |title=Pioneers in Indian Cinema - Swamikannu Vincent |publisher=Indiaheritage.org |accessdate=22 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509052024/http://www.indiaheritage.org/perform/cinema/history/vincent.htm |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, he tied up with Path, a well-known pioneering film-producing company, and imported projectors. This helped new cinema houses to sprout across the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rajmohan|first=Joshi|title=Encyclopaedia of Journalism and Mass Communication: Media and mass communication|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aoH81IN8SsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Swamikannu+Vincent&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=ly72TZ3ZBsWg-wa0lNHiBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Swamikannu%20Vincent&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he produced [[talkies]] and also built a cinema in [[Coimbatore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tamil Cinema|url=http://o3.indiatimes.com/brahmanyan/archive/2007/09/21/4783241.aspx|accessdate=29 June 2016|publisher=India Times|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630202911/http://o3.indiatimes.com/brahmanyan/archive/2007/09/21/4783241.aspx|archivedate=30 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate the event of [[George V|King George V]]'s visit in 1909, a grand [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] was organized in [[Chennai|Madras]]. Its major attraction was the screening of short films accompanied by sound. A British company imported a Crone [[megaphone]], made up of a film projector to which a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] with a disc containing prerecorded sound was linked, and both were run in unison, producing picture and sound simultaneously. However, there was no synched [[dialogue]]. Raghupathy Venkiah Naidu, a successful photographer, took over the equipment after the exhibition and set up a tent cinema near the [[Madras High Court]].&lt;ref name="folklore"/&gt; With this equipment, he screened the short films ''Pearl Fish'' and ''Raja's Casket'' in the Victoria Public Hall. When this proved successful, he screened the films in a tent set up in Esplanade. These tent events were the true precursors of the cinema shows. Venkiah traveled with this unit to Burma (now Myanmar) and Sri Lanka, and when he had gathered enough money, he put up a permanent cinema house in Madras—Gaiety, in 1914, the first cinema house in Madras to be built by an Indian. He soon added two more, Crown Theatre in Mint and Globe (later called Roxy) in Purasawalkam.

Swamikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of [[South India]] in [[Coimbatore]], introduced the concept of "Tent Cinema" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first of its kind was established in [[Chennai|Madras]], called "Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone". This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2010/04/30/stories/2010043051340400.htm|title=He brought cinema to South|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=26 September 2011|location=Chennai, India|date=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the films screened then were shorts made in the United States and Britain. In 1909, an Englishman, T. H. Huffton, founded Peninsular Film Services in Madras and produced some short films for local audiences. But soon, hour-long films, which narrated dramatic stories, then known as "drama films", were imported. From 1912 onwards, feature films made in Bombay (now Mumbai) were also screened in Madras. The era of short films had ended. The arrival of drama films firmly established cinema as a popular entertainment form. More cinema houses came up in the city.

Fascinated by this new entertainment form, an automobile dealer in the Thousand Lights area of Madras, R. Nataraja Mudaliyar, decided to venture into film production. After a few days’ training in Pune with the cinematographer Stewart Smith, the official cinematographer of Lord Curzon’s 1903 Durbar, he started a film production concern in 1916.

The man who truly laid the foundations of south Indian cinema was A. Narayanan. After a few years in film distribution, he set up a production company in Madras, the General Pictures Corporation, popularly known as GPC. Beginning with ''The Faithful Wife''/''Dharmapathini'' (1929), GPC made about 24 feature films. GPC functioned as a film school and its alumni included names such as Sundara Rao Nadkarni and Jiten Banerji. The studio of GPC was housed in the Chellapalli bungalow on Thiruvottiyur High Road in Madras. This company, which produced the most number of Tamil silent films, had branches in Colombo, Rangoon and Singapore.

''The Ways of Vishnu''/''Vishnu Leela'', which R. Prakasa made in 1932, was the last silent film produced in Madras. Unfortunately, the silent era of south Indian cinema has not been documented well. When the talkies appeared, film producers had to travel to Bombay or Calcutta to make films. Most films of this early period were celluloid versions of well-known stage plays. Company dramas were popular among the Madras audience. The legendary Otraivadai drama theatre had been built in 1872 itself in Mint. Many drama halls had come up in the city where short silent films were screened in the afternoon and plays were enacted in the night.

The scene changed in 1934 when Madras got its first sound studio. By this time, all the cinema houses in Madras had been wired for sound. Narayanan, who had been active during the silent era, founded Srinivasa Cinetone in which his wife worked as the sound recordist. ''Srinivasa Kalyanam'' (1934), directed by Narayanan, was the first sound film (talkie) produced in Madras. The second sound studio to come up in Madras was Vel Pictures, started by M. D. Rajan on Eldams Road in the Dunmore bungalow, which belonged to the Raja of Pithapuram. Before long, more sound studios came up. Thirty-six talkies were made in Madras in 1935.

===Influences===
The main impacts of the early cinema were the cultural influences of the country. The [[Tamil language]] was the medium in which many plays and stories were written since the ages as early as the [[Cholas]]. They were highly stylised and nature of the spectacle was one which could attract the people. Along with this, music and dance were one of the main entertainment sources.&lt;ref name="IndiaGlitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/64835.html |title=Abhinay Deo – "All stories can be found in Mahabharata and Ramayana" – Bollywood Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, [[fairy tale]]s and so on through song and dance. Whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day-to-day lives in complex ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theviewspaper.net/indian-films-vs-hollywood-2/ |title=Indian Films vs Hollywood |publisher=Theviewspaper.net|date=4 July 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1930s, the State of Madras legislature passed the ''Entertainment Tax Act 1939''.

===Studios===
In the year 1916 a studio, the first in south India, was set up in Madras at 10 Millers Road, Kilpauk. He called it the India Film Company. Rangavadivelu, an actor from Suguna Vilasa Sabha, a theatre company then, was hired to train the actors. Thirty-five days later, the first feature film made in south India, The Extermination of Keechakan/Keechakavatham, based on an episode from the Mahabharata, was released produced and directed by R. Nataraja, who established the ''India Film Company Limited'' (''The Destruction of Keechaka'').&lt;ref name=tcp&gt;{{cite book | title= Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65Aqrna4o5oC&amp;dq=Tamil+cinema| last=Velayutham|first=Selvaraj|chapter='India' in Tamil silent era cinema| year=2008| page=156| publisher=Routledge|location=| isbn=978-0-415-39680-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a century of increasing box office takings, Tamil cinema remains informal and dominated by shell companies, or one-film wonders, born and dead in a matter of months. Nevertheless, there are few exceptions like Modern Theatres, Gemini Studios, AVM and Sri Thenandal Films that survived beyond 100 productions.

Annual admissions in Chennai multiplexes and single screens averaged 11 million tickets with a standard deviation of ±1 million tickets during 2011-16. The Chennai film industry produced the first nationally distributed film across India in 1948 with ''[[Chandralekha (1948 film)|Chandralekha]]''.&lt;ref name="rivals"&gt;{{cite book | title= India| url=|last=Singh|first=Sarina|chapter=Film Studios| year=2003| page=964| publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=| quote=Chennai's film industry now rivals that of Bollywood (Mumbai) for output|isbn=978-1-74059-421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one of the widest overseas distribution, with large audience turnout from the [[Tamil diaspora]] alongside [[Hindi language|Hindi]] films. They are distributed to various parts of Asia, Africa, Western Europe, North America and Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/bline/2007/07/15/stories/2007071551360500.htm|title=Film industry isn’t high risk one: Kamal Haasan|publisher=[[Business Line]]|accessdate=27 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521203624/http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/bline/2007/07/15/stories/2007071551360500.htm|archive-date=21 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many successful Tamil films have been remade by other film industries. It is estimated by the ''Manorama Yearbook 2000'' (a popular almanac) that over 5,000 Tamil films were produced in the 20th century. Tamil films have also been dubbed into other languages, thus reaching a much wider audience. There has been a growing presence of English in dialogue and songs in Chennai films. It is not uncommon to see movies that feature dialogue studded with English words and phrases, or even whole sentences. Some movies are also simultaneously made in two or three languages (either using subtitles or several soundtracks). [[Chennai film music|Chennai's film composers]] have popularised their highly unique, syncretic style of film music across the world. Quite often, Tamil movies feature [[Madras Tamil]], a colloquial version of Tamil spoken in [[Chennai]].

Tamil films have enjoyed consistent popularity among populations in [[South East Asia]]. Since ''[[Chandralekha (1948 film)|Chandralekha]]'', ''[[Muthu (1995 film)|Muthu]]'' was the second Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese (as ''Mutu: Odoru Maharaja''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10502/1140/1/SES71_011.pdf |title=Mutu: Odoru Maharaja |format=PDF |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722073202/http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10502/1140/1/SES71_011.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and grossed a record $1.6 million in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/01/06/stories/2002010601320900.htm | title= Rajnikanth casts spell on Japanese viewers | author= Gautaman Bhaskaran | work= [[The Hindu]] | date= 6 January 2002 | accessdate= 10 May 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070520060231/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/01/06/stories/2002010601320900.htm | archive-date= 20 May 2007 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[Enthiran]]'' grossed a record $4 million in North America.

Many Tamil-language films have premiered or have been selected as special presentations at various film festivals across the globe, such as [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Kannathil Muthamittal]]'', [[Vasanthabalan]]'s ''[[Veyil|Veyyil]]'' and [[Ameer Sultan]]'s'' [[Paruthiveeran]]''. ''[[Kanchivaram]]'' (2009) was selected to be premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

==Economics==
Average annual film output in Tamil film industry peaked in 1985. The Tamil film market accounts for approximately 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2007/12/28/stories/2007122850050100.htm |title=Superstars dominate |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=28 December 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809044201/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2007/12/28/stories/2007122850050100.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of entertainment taxes, returns have to be filed by the exhibitors weekly (usually each Tuesday).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnsalestax.com/briefent.htm |publisher=www.tnsalestax.com |title=tnsalestax|accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717064417/http://www.tnsalestax.com/briefent.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] made provisions for an entertainment tax exemption for Tamil films having titles in words from the [[Tamil language]] only.&lt;ref name="tax exemption"/&gt; This is in accordance with Government Order 72 passed on 22 July 2006. The first film to be released after the new Order was ''[[Unakkum Enakkum]]''. The original title had been ''Something Something Unakkum Ennakkum'', a half-English and a half-Tamil title.&lt;ref name="tax exemption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-08/va-quarter-cutting-10-11-10.html |title=Va: Cutting of the Quarter! Why? - Tamil Movie Articles - Va-Quarter Cutting &amp;#124; Kallarai Manithan |publisher=Behindwoods.com |accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, strict norms on entertainment tax were passed which stated that films which were given a 'U' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification alone were eligible for tax exemption and those with an 'A' certificate could not fit into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/69083.html |title=Strict norms on entertainment tax - Tamil Movie News |publisher=Indiaglitz.com |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 3 major roles in the Tamil film value chain ''viz'' producer, distributor and exhibitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/dp/pyra.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Draft RHP PSTL 31.07.06.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721170237/http://www.sebi.gov.in/dp/pyra.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributor purchases theatrical distribution rights from the producer for exhibiting the film in a defined territory. The distributor performs enhanced functions such as:
# part-financing of film (in case of minimum guarantee / advance based purchase of film rights)
# localised marketing of film
# selection of exhibition halls
# managing the logistics of physical print distribution

There are three popular approaches to transfer of distribution rights via distribution contracts:

# ''Minimum Guarantee + Royalty'' – Here, the producer sells the distribution rights for a defined territory for a minimum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Any surplus is shared between the producer and distributor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:2) after deducting tax, show rentals, commission, print costs and publicity costs. Effectively, the distributor becomes a ''financier'' in the eyes of the market. This is the most common channel available to high budget producers.
# ''Commission'' – Here, the distributor pays the producer the entire box office collection after deducting commission. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the producer. This is the most common channel available to low budget producers. By the first decade of 21st century, about 90 per cent of the films were released on commission basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/how-film-distribution-has-changed-with-times-in-kollywood/article8289535.ece Commission basis is the dominant business model by 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Outright Sale'' – Here, the producer sells all distribution and theatrical exhibition rights for a defined territory exclusively to a distributor. Effectively, the distributor becomes a ''producer'' in the eyes of the market. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the distributor.

There are four popular approaches to transfer of exhibition rights via exhibition contracts:
# ''Theatre Hire'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor the entire box office collection after deducting tax and show rentals. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the distributor. This is the most common channel for low-budget films, casting rank newcomers, with unproven track record. In Chennai, a moderate theater with AC and DTS can fetch around {{INR}}1 lakh as weekly rent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-column/screening-a-movie---an-eye-opener.html Weekly rent is at least 1 lakh in Chennai cinemas]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Fixed Hire'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a maximum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Rental is not chargeable per show. Any surplus after deducting tax is retained by the exhibitor. Effectively, the exhibitor becomes a ''distributor'' in the eyes of the market. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film remains with the exhibitor.
# ''Minimum Guarantee + Royalty'' – Here, the exhibitor pays the distributor a minimum lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Rental is not chargeable per show. Any surplus after deducting tax and show rental is shared in a pre-set ratio (1:2) between the distributor and exhibitor typically.
# ''Revenue Share'' – Here, the distributor shares with the exhibitor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:1), the entire box office collection of the film after deducting tax. Rental is not chargeable per show. So, the entire risk of box office performance of the film is shared between the exhibitor and distributor. This is the most common channel preferred by multiplex screens.

==Legislation==
Film studios in Chennai are bound by legislation, such as the Cinematography Film Rules of 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peso.gov.in/cinematographic.aspx|title=Cinematograph film rules, 1948|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Cinematography Act of 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbfcindia.gov.in/html/uniquepage.aspx?unique_page_id=4|title=Posters|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Central Board of Film certification (CBFC)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123134645/http://cbfcindia.gov.in/html/uniquepage.aspx?unique_page_id=4|archivedate=23 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Copyright Act of 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/CopyrightRules1957.pdf|title=INDIAN COPYRIGHT ACT, 1957|accessdate=26 September 2011|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tamil Nadu]], cinema ticket prices are regulated by the government. Single screen theatres may charge a maximum of {{INR}}50, while theatres with more than three screens may charge a maximum of {{INR}}120 per ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashok Kumar|first=S.R.|title=Cinema ticket rate revision reflects a balancing act|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/02/stories/2007010215570200.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=18 January 2013|location=Chennai, India|date=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Temptation of St. Anthony''''' is a painting of disputed authorship, attributed to either [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or a follower. It is currently housed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in Madrid.

==History==
The work was in the [[El Escorial|Escorial]] monastery, although it was not mentioned in inventories; later it was moved to the Prado. It is likely that the work was one of the ''Temptations'' sent to the monastery by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1574. This painting has a more serene atmosphere than the [[triptych]] with the same theme now in the [[National Museum of Ancient Art|Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] of [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="Varallo"&gt;{{cite book |first=Franca |last=Varallo |title=Bosch |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all Bosch's works, it cannot be dated with precision, although it is likely from his late production (1500–1516).&lt;ref name="Varallo"/&gt;

In 2016, the Bosch Research and Conservation project, after five years of researching all known Bosch paintings, announced that they had significant doubts about the attribution of the work to Bosch, instead attributing it to a follower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/arts/design/prado-museum-rescinds-loan-of-downgraded-hieronymus-bosch-works.html|title = Prado Museum Rescinds Loan of Downgraded Hieronymus Bosch Works|last = Siegal|first = Nina|date = 2016-02-16|newspaper = The New York Times|issn = 0362-4331|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:J. Bosch Prado Temptation of St Anthony (detail).jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail]]
[[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] is portrayed in meditation, in a sunny landscape near the trunk of a dry tree. St. Anthony is a recurrent figure in Bosch's work, with up to 15 paintings of this subject, all inspired by legends told in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and in his ''Life'' by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]]. He is represented in a setting of solitude and temptation that the saint experienced over twenty years. Although this picture is significantly different from other works by Bosch of St. Anthony, such as the triptych painting of the same name, customary features of the abbot include his dark brown habit with the Greek letter "[[tau]]" and a pig by his side.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Temptation of Saint Anthony |accessdate=2015-06-14 |publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado |location=Madrid, Spain |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-temptation-of-saint-anthony/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kren |first1=Emil |last2=Marx |first2=Daniel |url=http://www.wga.hu/html/b/bosch/5panels/07anthon.html |title=The Temptation of St Anthony |website=The Web Gallery of Art |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the earlier paintings with St. Anthony, this version of the temptation of St. Anthony finds the abbot calmer from his meditative spirit. His surroundings are peaceful and evoke a sense of calm. The pig lies next to him like a pet. Once demons, the creatures of temptation are now more like goblins and do not disturb the peaceful feeling of the painting.

This painting, originally framed with a semi-circular arch, was one of Bosch's later works, from sometime after 1490. [[Philip II of Spain]] sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial near Madrid. From there the painting came to the Museo del Prado as part of the Royal Collection.&lt;ref name="Museodelprado" /&gt;

'''Townleyhall passage grave''' is a [[chamber tomb]] located around 2&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Dowth]] tomb. It is part of the [[megalith]]ic complex of ''[[Brú na Bóinne]]'' in [[County Louth]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

It is located outside the [[World Heritage Site]] core area but (just) inside the buffer zone.

[[File:Passage tomb, Townleyhall, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1078235.jpg|thumb|left|Side view]]

The site was originally a [[Neolithic]] settlement but was abandoned by its occupants, perhaps because it was a temporary site serving the construction project or due to the death of a senior member, and turned into a [[passage grave]]. Unlike its more famous neighbours in the [[River Boyne|Boyne valley]], the tomb consists of a single chamber that merges with the entrance passage making it an [[undifferentiated passage grave]].

Townleyhall was excavated by [[George Eogan]] in 1962, work which found [[Carrowkeel ware]] pottery providing the first indication that Ireland's passage graves were of Neolithic date. Following this many of the other sites in the area were dug, although the methods used at the time would be considered crude by today's standards .

A '''vernacular painting in China''' is a realistic, folk depiction of scenes from everyday domestic life.

The term is often applied to paintings that were frequently displayed in [[Qing dynasty|High Qing China]] during the New Year and birthdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Michael G.|date=2010|title=Pictures for Use and Pleasure: Vernacular Painting in High Qing China (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/479044|journal=China Review International|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=299–303|doi=10.1353/cri.2010.0072|issn=1527-9367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2010 book ''Pictures for Use and Pleasure'', art historian [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]] defines the term as "a great body of painting, created over the centuries by studio artists working in the cities, artists who produced pictures as required for diverse everyday domestic and other uses."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pictures for use and pleasure : vernacular painting in high Qing China|last=Cahill|first=James|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520258570|location=Berkeley|oclc=449860109}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} These paintings were often created on silk,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA274|title=The Qing Dynasty and Traditional Chinese Culture|last=Smith|first=Richard J.|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442221949|location=|pages=274|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pieces created for women were known for depicting "a range of topics not dealt with in literati painting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Chinese Art|last=Murck|first=Alfreda|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9781118885215|editor-last=Powers|editor-first=rtin J.|pages=455–473|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118885215.ch22|editor-last2=Tsiang|editor-first2=Katherine R.|chapter = Words in Chinese Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings revealed Chinese life and the workings of Chinese society, Vernacular paintings were frequently created by master artists with only small prestige in city studios. They also differed from other paintings made during the era in that they were seen as functional and frequently lacked inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWu-CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT872|title=A Companion to Chinese Art|last=Powers|first=Martin J.|last2=Tsiang|first2=Katherine R.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118885208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the culture of the time "professed to despise functionalism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|3-4}} As Chinese connoiseurs preferred paintings where the artist's brushwork skill, as well as their feelings and temperament, showed in the art, these paintings were seen as lesser in value and considered to be irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some of the elements in Vernacular Paintings, such as the use of paintings for celebrations and life events such as weddings and birthdays, would later be co-opted by some of the more elite art styles such as Shanghai painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pESTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|title=Art Worlds: Artists, Images, and Audiences in Late Nineteenth-Century Shanghai|last=Wue|first=Roberta|date=2014|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=9789888208463|location=|pages=54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the class of words|Profanity}}
'''Vulgarity''' is the quality of being common, coarse, or unrefined.  This judgement may refer to [[language]], [[visual art]], [[social class]]es, or [[social climber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bayley claims it can never be [[self-referential]] because, to be aware of vulgarity is to display a degree of [[sophistication]] which thereby elevates the subject above the [[:wikt:vulgar|vulgar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/4/4/298 |title=Vulgarity |author=John Bayley |journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1964 |volume=4 |pages=298–304 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/4.4.298 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, "vulgar" simply described the common language or vernacular of a country.  From the mid-seventeenth century onward, it began to take on a pejorative aspect: "having a common and offensively mean character, coarsely commonplace; lacking in refinement or good taste; uncultured; ill bred".  In the Victorian age, vulgarity broadly described many sorts of activity, such as wearing ostentatious clothing, and other similarly subtle aspects of behavior.  In a [[George Eliot]] novel, one character could be vulgar for talking about money, a second because he criticizes the first for doing so, and a third for being fooled by the excessive refinement of the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|pages=1–10|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In language, the effort to avoid vulgarity could leave characters at a loss for words.  In [[George Meredith]]'s ''[[Beauchamp's Career]]'', an heiress does not wish to make the commonplace statement that she is "engaged", nor "betrothed", "affianced", or "plighted".  Though such words are not vulgarity in the vulgar sense, they nonetheless could stigmatize the user as a member of a socially inferior class. Even favored euphemisms such as ''[[toilet]]'' eventually become stigmatized like the words they replace, and currently favored words serve as a sort of "[[cultural capital]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU68f9ScRpEC|title=Victorian vulgarity: taste in verbal and visual culture|author=Susan David Bernstein, Elsie Browning Michie|publisher=Ashgate publishing|year=2009|page=17|isbn=978-0-7546-6405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
Vulgarity, or vulgar speech or language, can refer to language which is offensive or [[Obscenity|obscene]], [[synonym]]ous with the 'general' meaning of [[profanity]].

The word most associated with the verbal form of vulgarity is "cursing." However, there are many subsections of vulgar words. In the book, "Cursing in America" by Timothy Jay, Jay makes a classification of the "dirty words" because it "allows people interested in language to define the different types of reference or meaning that dirty words employ. One can see that what is considered  taboo or obscene revolves around a few dimensions of human experience that there is a logic behind dirty word usage."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most commonly used vulgar terms in the English language is ''fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Robert F. "The F-Word: A Jurisprudential Taxonomy of American Morals (In a Nutshell)." Santa Clara L. Rev. 40 (1999): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cursing ===
Curse words, or cursing, have been recognized by religious organizations as being able to cause actual mental and physical harm. More recently such words have separated themselves from their religious meanings, and it is doubtful that those who use curse words imagine the words will bring actual mental or physical harm. Both parties are aware that the cursing is simply an expression, and the ones receiving the curse words or phrase are aware they are being targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
Religious curses may include "Damn you", "God damn you", "To hell with you". Cursing also includes non-religious expressions, like "Fuck you" or "Eat shit and die".

=== Profanity ===
Profanity are words that are considered hateful or contemptuous, especially in regard to religion. 

For a word or phrase to be profane it must not be religious or function outside the duties of religious belief. To be profane means for the word or phrase to be ignorant or hateful towards the rules of religions. Examples of profanity are words or a phrase not meant to belittle Gods, their religions, but situated on the ignorance and indifference to such points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cursing in America|last=Jay|first=Timothy|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9781556194528|location=|pages=3|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
