'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montenegro]], access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act.&lt;ref name=MANS&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |title=Freedom of information in Montenegro. Analysis of the Legal Framework, Practice and Implementation of ECHR Case Law and other International Standards with Recommendations for Improvement |url=http://www.mans.co.me/en/wp-content/uploads/fai/FreedomOfInformation-Internship.pdf |publisher=MANS. Network for Affirmation of NGO Sector  |issue= |access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/montenegro-ngo-doubts-govt-s-plan-to-open-public-records-04-01-2016 |title=Montenegro Plan to Open Public Records Doubted |last= |first= |date=1 April 2016 |website=Balkaninsight.com |publisher= BalkanInsight |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the [[European Union]] to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Legal framework==
The Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Furthermore, the '''2013 Law on Free Access to Information''' establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

The new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt; Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.&lt;ref name=MANS/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==
According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; According to the newspaper [[Vijesti]], the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. &lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Montenegro/Montenegro-i-silenzi-della-pubblica-amministrazione-177586 |title=Montenegro: i silenzi della pubblica amministrazione |last=Čađenović |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucasto Transeuropa / Vijesti |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Montenegro 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_montenegro.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |access-date=9 February  2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

In 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned [[administrative silence]]: in these cases the request remained unanswered.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

The majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

Another issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt; Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.&lt;ref name="MANS" /&gt;

Another reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

According to the [[Balkan Insight|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. &lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |title=Montenegro 2015 Human Rights Report. Executive Summary |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253093.pdf |publisher=US State Department|access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

'''Adhyavasāya''' ([[Sanskrit]]: अध्यवसाय ) generally means – 'apprehension', 'clinging to', 'mental effort' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url=http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=adhyavasAya&amp;link=m }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also 'perseverance', 'having decided'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of Adhyavasaya|url=http://sanskritdictionary.org/adhyavasaya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic interpretation==
Nārāyana Tīrtha, in his ''Sāmkhya-Candrikā'', explains ''adhyavasāya'' as " a modified condition of the intellect (''[[buddhi]]'') the determination in such a form as – ''such an act is to be done by me'' ". [[Gaudapada|Gaudapāda]] explains it as " intellectual determination of the object of perception as belonging to a definite class ". Vācaspatimiśra explains it as " ascertainment or determinate knowledge consequent upon the manifestation of the essence (''[[sattva]]'') of the intellect, when the inertia of the intellect is overcome by the operation of the sense-organs in apprehending their objects, as the intention which follows self-appropriated knowledge or volition of the agent to react to the object of perception in a definite way ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Psychology|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Psychology Press|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3rEpe3OmqMMC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mkLQKzEZT7&amp;sig=t489FGH2M-gQP_rbDTz8E5rPCZA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o3SrVIyOIoGzuAS2y4DACA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ascertainment also means definite awareness which according to the [[Samkhya|Samkhya school]] is associated in ''[[buddhi]]'' (अध्यवसायो बुद्धिः), in perception which is definite ascertainment involving the senses with respect to specific kinds of empirical objects, and which is an activity of ''buddhi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perceptual Error|author=Srinivasa Rao|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=38|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-_ugDu5XSMAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B59Qr6Xaga&amp;sig=6thVH8p89T6bfc2bHmaQieEFu70&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o3SrVIyOIoGzuAS2y4DACA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies determination of objects (''avidhāranā'') which by itself is decisive knowledge (''niścaya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=33|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sage of the [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad|Maitri Upanishad]] (VI.30) explains:-

: स हि सर्वकाममयः पुरुषोऽध्यवसायसङ्कल्पाभिमानलिङ्गो बद्धः | अतस्तद्विपरीतो मुक्तः ||

: " The purusha full of kama or desire is bound having adhyavasaya, sankalpa and abhimana as his lingas (characteristics) ; he who is 
the opposite of this is liberated. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=335|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dhRKCh70ouMC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vindhyāvasin holds the view that ''[[Sankalpa (Hindu thought)|sankalpa]]'', ''abhimāna'' and ''adhyavasāya'' are not different functions but the modifications of the mind or intellect. Samkhyas hold the view that perception is the reflective discerning (''adhyavasāya''), a kind of awareness, an operation of the intellect in its ''sattva'' modality;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Vol.4|pages=144, 303|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bqr_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be aware of perception as perception is to define and distinguish it from others which definition (''adhyavasāya'') can come only through conception (''vikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Indian Thought|author=T.R.V.Murti|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=277|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=d7ryQuk_inUC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadyojyoti defines discernment as the ascertaining cognitive activity (''adhyavasāya'') which is understanding (''[[Janana|jñāna]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhoga Karika of Sadyojyoti|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=48|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HUZqbkYBshUC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yoga interpretation==

According to the [[Yoga]] school and [[Ayurveda]], ''adhyavasāya'' i.e. apprehension of clear and clean knowledge of the knowable, is one of the sixteen qualities of the empirical soul (''[[Jiva|jīvātmān]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.3|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=143|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-lUxeauYnxAC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KYCrVM7FE4ORuATTt4LwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lakshmi Tantra]] (XVI.4) explains that the intellect (''buddhi'') is the incentive to mental effort (''adhyavasāya''); ''[[prana]]'' is the incentive to endeavour (''prayatna'') and time (''[[Kāla (time)|kāla]]'') is the incentive to transform in the form of impulse and effective development; whereas ego (''[[ahamkara]]'') results from a modification of ''mahat'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=83|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which cognition is indeterminate cognition (''nirvikalpa adhyavasāya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=324|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7YWrVPz5LMm1uQSJsIDwCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Jaina and Buddhist interpretation==

The followers of [[Jainism]] consider ''adhyavasāya'' referring to good or bad sentiments, and of the nature of ''Bhava-Yoga'' which is made up of 'inauspicious combined meditation' and 'meditation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essentials of Bhagavan Mahavira’s Philosophy|author=Acarya Vijay Bhuvanbhanusuri|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=129|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=cdgpDf1iEbQC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Utpala (astronomer)|Utpala]] in his following statement:-

:मायाशक्त्या विभोः सैव भिन्नसंवेद्यगोचरा |
:कथिका ज्ञानसंकल्पाध्यवसायादिनामभिः ||

terms - ''adhyavasāya'' as mental apprehension as he  proceeds to explain ''māyā-shakti'' to be the differentiating power of [[Brahman]] that affects consciousness resulting in the false perception of duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Isvara Pratyabhijna Karika|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=66|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=m-ps9z8UQpoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=532rVI6qJMO0uQTyuIEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Ratnakīrti]] holds the view that non-momentary existence is a figment of imaginative intuition projected as real by the process of intellection called ''adhyavasāya'' which is impulsive movement of the mind generated by the force of immediately preceding cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist Philosophy of Universal Flux|author=Satkari Mookerjee|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=34|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=q6A3OOxx3-wC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhist]] view is that the judgment of the object of cognition ('spatio-temporal objects') owing to special synthesis of moments gains sensible qualities etc., to become universal (''sāmānaya lakshana'', ''ekatva adhyavasāya'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Knowledge and Reality|author=Kaisa Puhakka|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=82|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=He0dRyesf-QC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=adhyavasaya+buddhist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiwZoZdOXL&amp;sig=LXSL2zZi8SwKe1deuB0UBiTX8iE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TtKrVOzyLc-fugTA_IHYCQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya%20buddhist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jñanasrimitra]] holds the view that only deluded persons interpret an image by conceptual thinking. (''adhyavasāya'', ''vikalpa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahayana Buddhist Meditations|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=126|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=s9KGFPr_zrQC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=adhyavasaya+buddhist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dbhR-zsqxo&amp;sig=4AqwVeOR90V5ZXJUF46YS5sKIZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TtKrVOzyLc-fugTA_IHYCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya%20buddhist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adhyavasāya in Sanskrit literature==

Common characteristics (''sādhāranadharma'') in poetry can either be in the form of existence (''bhāva'') or negation (''abhāva''), and can involve supersession (''adhyavasāya''). In ''apahnuti'' (concealment of truth, denial), when a thing is concealed and something else is described in its place, the ''āropa'' (raising, elevating, superimposition) that is based on negation amounts to ''adhyavasāya'', which view is refuted by Jayaratha who agrees with Ruyyaka that ''adhyavasāya'' is the phenomenon where the ''visayah'' is concealed and its ''[[Non-difference (Abheda)|non-difference (abheda)]] '' with the ''vishayin'' is known, and that doubt (''bhrānti'') is always based on ''adhyavasāya'' and not on ''āropa''. In [[Sanskrit literature]], ''Alankāraśāstra'' deals with the beauty which poetry (''[[kāvya]]'') alone can display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alankararatnakara of Sobhakaramitra|author=G.Parthasarthy Rao|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=22, 23, 76, 89|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EhKBKjS56loC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adhyavasāya'' is considered as ''[[siddha]]'' (accomplished) when the object is not expressed in words but is lost in comparison, it is considered as ''sādhya'' (perfect) when the object in the process of being represented is identical with the object of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mallinatha|author=P.G.lalye|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=72|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y0FfADSV6o4C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It distinguishes ''utprekśa'' ('alliteration') and ''atiśayokti'' ('hyperbole') from ''rūpaka'' ('dramatic representation', 'form') and ''āropa'' ('superimposition').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=More than Real|author=David Shulman|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=57|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7SACAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=adhyavasaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5HyrVOrpFYeXuASS1YH4CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=adhyavasaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akvo is a [[not-for-profit]]  internet and software developer, headquartered in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. The foundation specializes primarily in building and operating data collection and visualization systems to be used in [[international development]] and [[aid]] activity. Akvo also operates the sustainable development wiki Akvopedia, which as of 2017 has 1956 content pages about water, sanitation and agriculture. Akvo was initially started as a project under the Netherlands Water Partnership in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dutchwatersector.com |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akvo operates from 11 offices worldwide. Akvo has hub offices based in a number of different locations, including [[Stockholm]], [[London]], [[Washington DC]], [[Nairobi]] and [[New Delhi]]. As of 2017, Akvo operates in 93 countries and works with more than 1800 organizations around the world from [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] to national governments and multilateral aid organizations who use Akvo’s tools to report, publish, monitor and evaluate their work.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"&gt;[http://ethiopia.nlembassy.org/binaries/content/assets/postenweb/e/ethiopie/netherlands-embassy-in-addis-ababa/services/general-information/ekn-water-directory.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the foundation's work is concentrated within the water and sanitation sector. However, since 2010 it has widened its focus to areas such as health, education, technology, agriculture and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/about-us/akvo-faq/#whywatsan |title=Akvo Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation's mission is "to build a highly effective, open, online platform and a trusted partner network."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akvo.org/uploads/2012/12/Akvo_staff-handbook_20151.pdf |format=PDF |title=AKVO Handbook |website=Akvo.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson and Jeroen van der Sommen met at Stockholm [[World Water Week]] in 2006. At this time it was becoming clear that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] on water was going to be difficult to achieve and as a result there was the need to develop new ideas. Shortly thereafter, the idea of using open source software and open data for the development sector was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/20871-stockholm-world-water-week-2016-akvo-celebrates-ten-years-online-monitoring-water-aid-projects.html |title=Because big challenges need joint solutions |publisher=Dutch Water Sector |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 2008 the Akvo Foundation was formed by the [[Netherlands Water Partnership]] and several other co founders, including Bjelkeman-Pettersson and van der Sommen as well as Mark Nitzberg, Mark Charmer, Gabriel von Heijne and Peter van der Linde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vn.nl/thomas-bjelkeman-pettersson/ |title=Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson - Vrij Nederland |website=Vn.nl |date=2007-10-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Early timeline'''

September 2006 - Seed funding is provided by Netherlands Water Partnership (NWP). The partner organisations that participate in brainstorming about what Akvo should become are [[UNESCO]]-IHE, IRC International Resource Centre for Water and Sanitation (IRC) and the Movement Design Bureau.

April 2007 – Partners for Water and NWP provide the first batch of funding.

August 2007 – Akvopedia is shown for the first time at World Water Week.

In 2015, Akvo was named as the winner of the [[Water and Sanitation Award]]. The award was in recognition of Akvo’s innovation within the water and sanitation sector in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iadb.org/es/noticias/comunicados-de-prensa/2015-11-17/ganadores-premio-bid-femsa,11324.html?WT.mc_id=NewsEmail_Short_11324&amp;wtSrc=Email&amp;wtType=Short&amp;wtArticleID=11324&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in November 2015, Akvo was awarded the [[Dutch Water Innovation Prize]]. Akvo won the award for the development of a smart irrigation inlet sensor that measures the salinity of surface water.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uvw.nl/waterinnovatieprijs-2015-uitgereikt/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Akvo designs and builds Software as a Service software as well as offering services that complement them, such as training and consulting. All Akvo's software is released as open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://github.com/akvo | title=Akvo Foundation on GitHub| date= |accessdate=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvo's tools are designed to work together at each stage of the monitoring cycle and therefore have three main purposes: first, capture and collect data;  second, understand this data and turn it into decisions; and third, share this data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://afrialliance.org/news/smart-solutions-for-water-and-climate/ |title=» Smart Solutions for Water and Climate |website=Afrialliance.org |date=2017-03-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations that use Akvo services include [[UNDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id.undp.org/content/indonesia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2015/08/26/training-the-trainers-with-our-diy-survey-app-what-happens-next-.html |title=Training the trainers with our DIY survey app. What happens next? &amp;#124; UNDP in Indonesia |website=Id.undp.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/pacificislands/1852_23490.html |title=UNICEF Pacific Island Countries - Latest stories - UNICEF Pacific works with Ministry of Health &amp; Medical Services, towards increasing capacity for monitoring of WASH activities |website=Unicef.org |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other NGOs and governments.

'''Akvo Flow''' (Field Level Operation Watch) allows field surveys to be managed and carried out using mobile phones. It can be used to collect, manage, analyse and display geographically-referenced monitoring and evaluation data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snv.org/update/akvo-flow-smart-technology-smart-development |title=Akvo FLOW: SMART technology for SMART Development &amp;#124; SNV World |website=Snv.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flow was originally developed by Water for People.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banks |first=Ken |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2012/01/24/the-cellphone-that-keeps-the-water-and-data-flowing/ |title=The Cellphone that Keeps the Water, and Data, Flowing – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Water for People partnered with Akvo to allow for wider use of the system and Akvo took over the development of Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/blog/akvo-and-water-for-people-sign-flow-agreement/ |title=Akvo and Water For People sign FLOW agreement |website=Akvo.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Flow was used primarily in water and sanitation projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Matthew |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/22/health/water-sanitation-mobile/index.html?hpt=hp_c3 |title=Going with the 'FLOW' towards better sanitation - CNN.com |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2012-03-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has more recently been used in a variety of fields, including fisheries management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2016/mar/01/social-impacts-of-marine-protection-in-indonesia-in-pictures?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco |title=Living in Indonesia's marine protected areas - in pictures &amp;#124; Environment |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; school management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://unicefpacific.blogspot.se/2015/09/champions-for-healthy-schools.html |title=Pacific Island Countries: Champions for healthy schools |website=Unicefpacific.blogspot.se |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disaster relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02q5dqz |title=BBC World Service - Click, Rebuilding Vanuatu with Smartphones |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, 3.990.763 data points have been captured with Flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/seeithappen/ |title=See it happen |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo RSR''' (Really Simple Reporting) was launched in September 2008 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/38f27bf8-4a54-11de-8e7e-00144feabdc0 |title=Donor programmes: Sponsors can now view benefits online |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first product Akvo developed; it is a content management and reporting system for international development projects. It was described by Giulio Quaggiotto of the World Bank as "Real-time, paper-free, straight from the trenches reporting. If RSR takes off, it could be the killer application of Development 2.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/forget-rss-is-real-simple-reporting-the-killer-development-20-application |title=Forget RSS: is Real Simple Reporting the killer Development 2.0 application? &amp;#124; Private Sector Development |website=Blogs.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now over 4000 projects on the platform, with a combined value of over €150 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidtransparency.net/news/akvo-rsr-supporting-use-of-open-data |title=Akvo RSR: Supporting use of Open Data &amp;#124; International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) |website=Aidtransparency.net |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvopedia''' was created in 2007 and was the first project that Akvo worked on. It is a Web-based, free content, water and sanitation knowledge resource. Akvopedia is written collaboratively by volunteers and specialists, mainly from the water and sanitation sector but anyone can edit and contribute. It is organised within five portals – Water, Sanitation, Finance, Sustainability and Decision &amp; assessment tools. Recently some of this content has been transferred to Wikiversity in the Rainwater Harvesting portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting |title=Rainwater harvesting - Wikiversity |publisher=En.wikiversity.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Sites''' is a [[Wordpress]] based system for easy creation and maintenance of websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Akvo Foundation |url=http://akvo.org/products/akvo-sites/ |title=Akvo Sites |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Caddisfly''' is a [[water quality]] and [[soil quality]] testing system based on [[smartphones]]. Akvo Caddisfly was originally invented by Ternup Research Labs to detect the precedes of [[fluoride]] in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553 |title=Monitoring of fluoride in water samples using a smartphone |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.156 |volume=551-552 |journal=Science of the Total Environment |pages=101–107 | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saurabh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ternup joined forces with Akvo in early 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caddisfly.ternup.com/partnering-with-akvo/ |title=Partnering with Akvo &amp;#124; Caddisfly |website=Caddisfly.ternup.com |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caddisfly system has been extended to work with strip tests and phone-connected sensors as well as the original colorimetric tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://akvo.org/akvo-caddisfly/ |title=Akvo Caddisfly |website=Akvo.org |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Akvo Lumen''' is a data visualisation platform and is Akvo's latest product. It is developed in the [[Clojure]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/clojure-in-akvo.html |title=JUXT Blog: Clojure in Europe: Akvo |website=Juxt.pro |date=2016-05-23 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovative communication ==
Akvo has gained notoriety for its unique external communication. Bruce Sterling said "It's an open-source sanitation project, and if that isn’t weird enough, they’ve got a Bollywood-parody promotional angle." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/06/akvos-bollywood/ |title=Akvo’s Bollywood Angle |publisher=WIRED |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Geographic Society]] reported from [[World Water Week in Stockholm]] about the WaterCube, the brainchild of Mark Charmer at Akvo: "Man-on-the-street journalism meets wonky water week. Frenetic water cube workers ushered a steady stream of conference attendees into their fishbowl lounge for quick Flip camera interviews. The close-ups may not be flattering, but it is interesting to hear the stream of consciousness that pours from the mouths of the unprepared and unedited. From high-profile corporate and academic leadership to those implementing projects on the ground around the world, the resulting online mosaic of more than 200 interviews collected over the last two years seems to present a near-complete view of the issues covered over six days of workshops, plenary sessions, and panels." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maxwell |first=David |url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2010/09/09/world-water-week-best-design/ |title=World Water Week: Best in Design – National Geographic Society (blogs) |website=Voices.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-09-09 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent notable projects and partnerships ==
'''Akvopedia expands into Wikiversity:''' In 2015, Akvopedia begun loading content into [[Wikiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.susana.org/component/kunena/196-capacity-development/15007-akvopedia-expands-into-wikiversity-which-offers-free-learning-materials-starting-with-rainwater-harvesting-section |title=SuSanA Forum |website=Forum.susana.org |date= |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akvopedia has served as source content for the Wikiversity portal and the [[Rainwater harvesting portal]].

'''Monitoring water points during drought in Ethiopia:''' In 2016, Akvo worked with UNICEF to collect data during the worst drought in over 50 years in Ethiopia. Akvo recorded over 80,000 survey responses which were used to help direct emergency resources to the most relevant areas.&lt;ref name="nlembassy1"/&gt;

'''Supporting Government disaster planning and response systems:''' Since 2014, Akvo has worked in Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to introduce locally run mobile-based data and asset management tools to improve the quality and availability of data for disaster-related decision-making.  For this work Akvo won the innovationXchange award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org/winners/#VanuatuDRPlatform |title=Innovators - InnovationXchange |website=Pacifichumanitarianchallenge.org |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Akvo Flow was used in Fiji to collect data on the extent of the damage caused by [[Cyclone Winston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/appeals/files/UNICEF_Pacific_Cyclone_Winston_External_SitRep_26Feb2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cyclone Winston : Fiji : UNICEF Report |website=Unicef.org |accessdate=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] defines '''''arhat''''' ([[Sanskrit]]; [[Pali]]: '''''arahant''''') as one who has gained insight into the true nature of existence and has achieved ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=67}} Other Buddhist traditions have used the term for people far advanced along the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|path of Enlightenment]], but who may not have reached full [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries, and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions. A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]]. The [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Kāśyapīya]], [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Ekavyāvahārika]], [[Lokottaravāda]], [[Bahuśrutīya]], [[Prajñaptivāda]], and [[Caitika]] schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"&gt;Sree Padma.

[[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist teachings]] urge followers to take up the path of a [[bodhisattva]], and to not fall back to the level of arhats and [[śrāvaka]]s.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; The arhats, or at least the senior arhats, came to be widely regarded{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as "moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way".{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102}}

Mahayana Buddhism regarded a group of [[Eighteen Arhats]] (with names and personalities) as awaiting the return of the Buddha as [[Maitreya]], and other groupings of 6, 8, [[Sixteen Arhats|16]], 100, and 500 also appear in tradition and [[Buddhist art]], especially in East Asia.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}} They can be seen as the Buddhist equivalents of the Christian saints, [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] or early disciples and [[leader]]s of the faith.{{sfn|Rhie|Thurman|1991|p=102-119}}

==Etymology and translations==
[[File:Gohyaku rakan.jpg|thumb|''Gohyaku rakan'' - five hundred statues depicting arhats, at the Chōkei temple in Toyama]]

===Etymology===
Pāḷi ''arahant'' is a present participle coming from the verbal root √arh "to deserve",&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, D. W. ''Roots, Verb-forms and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language''&lt;/ref&gt; cf. ''arha'' "meriting, deserving"; ''arhaṇa'' "having a claim, being entitled"; ''arhita'' (past participle) "honoured, worshipped".&lt;ref&gt;''Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The word is used in the ''Ṛgveda'' with this sense of "deserving".&lt;ref&gt;RV 1.4.47, 2.5.51&lt;/ref&gt;

A common folk etymology derives the word from ''ari'' (enemy) and ''hanta'' from the root √'''''han''''' (cf: Hunter) "to strike, to kill"; hence the translation "foe-destroyer". Professor Richard Gombrich has argued that the present participle is "jarring" and seems out of place when there is an adjective from the same root (''arha''). Since Jains used two Prakrit forms of the word ''arahanta'' and ''arihanta'', the folk etymology may well be the correct etymology. Gombrich argues that this stems from the same metaphor as the Jain title ''jina'' "conqueror", whence ''jaina'' "related to the conqueror", i.e. Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gombrich, 2009, ''What the Buddha Thought'', Equinox: London, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translations===
The term ''arhat'' is often rendered in English as ''arahat''.

The term ''arhat'' was transliterated into some East Asian languages phonetically, for example, the Chinese ''āluóhàn'' (Ch. 阿羅漢), often shortened to simply ''luóhàn'' (Ch. 羅漢).  This may appear in English as ''luohan'' or ''lohan''.  In Japanese the pronunciation of the same Chinese characters is ''rakan'' (Ja. 羅漢) or ''arakan'' (Ja. 阿羅漢).

The [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] term for ''arhat'' was translated by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, ''dgra bcom pa'', means "one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions".&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel. ''Unique Tenets of the Middle Way Consequence School''. Snow Lion Publications. 1998. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Tibetan translators also understood the meaning of ''arhat'' to be ''ari-hanta''.

==Attainments==
A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the [[early Buddhist schools]].  The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as being imperfect in their attainments compared to [[buddhahood|buddhas]].&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect believed that "the Buddha and those of the [[Yana (Buddhism)|Two Vehicles]], although they have one and the same liberation, have followed different noble paths."&lt;ref&gt;《異部宗輪論述記》：謂佛雖在僧中所攝，然別施佛果大，非僧（果大）。於窣堵波興供養業獲廣大果。佛與二乘解脫雖一，而聖道異。無諸外道能得五通。阿羅漢身皆是無漏。餘義多同大眾部執。&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mahīśāsaka]] and the [[Theravada]] regarded arhats and buddhas as being similar to one another. The 5th century Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] regarded arhats as having completed the path to enlightenment.{{refn|group=note|Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Prebish and [[Damien Keown]] (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', pp 36&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the [[Pāli Canon]] portrays the Buddha declaring himself to be an arahant.&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas''&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Buddha is the first of the arahants, while those who reach the goal by following his path also become arahants. In the verse of homage to the Buddha, it is said: "Iti pi so Bhagavā Arahaṃ... — The Blessed One is an arahant..." Shortly after his enlightenment, while walking to Benares to meet the five monks, a wanderer stopped the Buddha and asked who he was. The Buddha replied: "I am the arahant in the world, I am the supreme teacher" (MN 26/I 171). So the Buddha first of all declares himself to be an arahant."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''nirvāṇa'' is "the ultimate goal", and one who has attained nirvana has attained arahantship:{{refn|group=note|"From the perspective of the Nikāyas, the ultimate goal – the goal in strict doctrinal terms – is nirvāṇa, and the goal in human terms is arahantship, the state of a person who has attained nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;}} Bhikkhu Bodhi writes, "The defining mark of an arahant is the attainment of nirvāṇa in this present life."&lt;ref name="BB" /&gt;

The Mahayana discerned a hierarchy of attainments, with ''samyaksambuddha''s at the top, [[mahāsattva]]s below that, [[pratyekabuddha]]s below that and arhats further below.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; "But what was it that distinguished the ''bodhisattva'' from the ''sravaka'', and ultimately the ''buddha'' from the ''arhat''? The difference lay, more than anywhere else, in the altruistic orientation of the ''bodhisattva''."{{sfn|prebish|Keown|2004|page=88}}

==Meaning of Arhat==
===In the early Buddhist schools===
In pre-Buddhist India, the term arhat, denoting a saintly person in general, was closely associated with miraculous power and asceticism. The Buddhists drew a sharp distinction between their Arhat and Indian holy men in general, in Buddhism these miraculous powers were no longer central to arhat identity or to his mission.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Kieckhefer, George D. Bond. "Sainthood: Its Manifestations in World Religions" 1988. pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of views on the relative perfection of arhats existed amongst the early Buddhist schools. In general, Mahāsāṃghikas such as the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins,&lt;ref name="Baruah, Bibhuti 2008. p. 446"/&gt; Bahuśrutīyins,&lt;ref&gt;Walser, Joseph. ''Nāgārjuna in Context: Mahāyāna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture''. 2005. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Prajñaptivādins, and Caitikas&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt; schools, advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and the fallibility of arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. 2008. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The Caitikas, for example, advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva (''bodhisattvayāna'') over that of the arhat (''[[śrāvakayāna]]''), and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance.&lt;ref name="Sree Padma 2008. p. 44"/&gt;

According to [[A.K. Warder]], the Sarvāstivādins held the same position as the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarding arhats, considering them to be imperfect and fallible.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; In the Sarvāstivādin ''Nāgadatta Sūtra'', the demon [[Mara (demon)|Māra]] takes the form of Nāgadatta's father, and tries to convince Nāgadatta, who was a [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī,]] to work toward the lower stage of arhatship rather than striving to become a fully enlightened buddha (samyaksaṃbuddha).
{{quote|Māra therefore took the disguise of Nāgadatta's father and said thus to Nāgadatta: "Your thought is too serious. [[Buddhahood]] is too difficult to attain. It takes a hundred thousand nayutas of [[crore|koṭi]]s of [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]s to become a Buddha. Since few people attain Buddhahood in this world, why don't you attain Arhatship? For the experience of Arhatship is the same as that of [[nirvana|nirvāṇa]]; moreover, it is easy to attain Arhatship.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"&gt;Kalupahana, David. ''Buddhist Thought and Ritual''. 2001. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In her reply, Nāgadatta rejects arhatship as a lower path, saying, "A Buddha's wisdom is like empty space of the ten-quarters, which can enlighten innumerable people. But an Arhat's wisdom is inferior."&lt;ref name="Kalupahana, David 2001. p. 109"/&gt;

The Kāśyapīya school also held the doctrine that arhats were fallible and imperfect, similar to the view of the Sarvāstivādins and the various Mahāsāṃghika sects.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt; The Kāśyapīyins believed that arhats have not fully eliminated desires, that their "perfection" is incomplete, and that it is possible for them to relapse.&lt;ref name="Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 277"/&gt;

===In Theravāda Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, an arahant is a person who has eliminated all the unwholesome roots which underlie [[Samyojana|the fetters]] – who upon their death will not be reborn in any world, since the bonds (fetters) that bind a person to the [[samsara]] have been finally dissolved. In the [[Pali Canon]], the word ''[[tathagata]]'' is sometimes used as a synonym for arahant, though the former usually refers to the Buddha alone.{{refn|group=note|Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind''. Curzon Press 1995, p. 227: {{quote|Before focusing on key passages on the tathagata, it is first necessary to clarify which persons the word refers to. The Buddha often used it when talking of himself as an enlightened being, rather than as the individual Gotama. In general, "tathagata" is used specifically of the Buddha, the one who discovers and proclaims the path to nibbana (A.II.8–9, S.III.65-6), with the "tathagata, Arahat, perfectly and completely enlighteneed one" being contrasted with a "disciple of the tathagata" (D.II.142). Nevertheless, "tathagata" is sometimes used of any Arahat. S.V.327, for example, discusses the "dwelling of a learner" and that of a tathagata, and explains the second by describing the qualities of an Arahat. At M.I.139–140 and 486-7, moreover, there is a switching between talk of a "tathagata" and of "a monk whose mind is freed thus", as if they were simple equivalents. Tathagata literally means "thus-gone" or "thus-come", probably meaning one who is "attained-to-truth" or "whose-nature-is-from-truth".}}}}

After attainment of Nibbana, the [[five aggregates]] (physical forms, feelings/sensations, perception, mental formations and consciousness) will continue to function, sustained by physical bodily vitality. This attainment is termed ''the nibbana element with a residue remaining''.  But once the Arahant pass-away and with the disintegration of the physical body, the five aggregates will cease to function, hence ending all traces of existence in the phenomenal world and thus total release from the misery of samsara. It would then be termed ''the nibbana element without residue remaining''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html|title=Transcendental Dependent Arising|accessdate=16 March 2009|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090330082958/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html| archivedate= 30 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parinibbana occurs at the death of an Arahant.

In Theravada Buddhism the Buddha himself is first identified as an arahant, as are his enlightened followers, because they are free from all defilements, without greed, [[hatred]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]], [[Avidya (Buddhism)|ignorance]] and [[tanha|craving]]. Lacking "assets" which will lead to future birth, the arahant knows and sees the real here and now. This virtue shows stainless purity, true worth, and the accomplishment of the end, [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike/message/17|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Buddhawaslike|title=Yahoo! Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the roles of arahants, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, Nathan Katz writes that, there is a tendency in the Theravāda school to exclude laypeople from the possibility of achieving arahantship.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Natha. ''Buddhist Images of Human Perfection''. 1982. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While in the ''Sutta Piṭaka'', ''arhattā'' was open to all, both in principle and in fact, there was a growing tendency among later Theravāda ''saṅghikas'' to restrict ''arhattā'' to those wearing the robe. Earlier we indicated a ''Milindapañha'' verse which held that while ''arhattā'' might be attainable by a layperson, within one day of its attainment he would have to either enter the ''saṅgha'' or die.}}

In the Pali canon, [[Ananda|Ānanda]] states that he knows [[bhikkhu|monastics]] to achieve nibbana in one of four ways:{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Ānanda's teaching on achieving arhantship can be found in [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.170.  Translations for this sutta can be found in Bodhi (2005) pp. 268–9, 439, and Thanissaro (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bodhi (2005), p. 268, translates this fourth way as: "a monk's mind is seized by agitation about the teaching."  Thanissaro (1998) gives a seemingly contrary interpretation of: "a monk's mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma [Comm: the corruptions of insight] well under control."  Thus, it appears possible to interpret the excitation (Pali: ''uddhacca'', see [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3582.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25]) as either something that the future arahant uses to ''impel'' their pursuit of the path or something that the future arahant ''controls'' in order to pursue the path.}}

* one develops [[Vipassana|insight]] preceded by [[Samatha|serenity]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|samatha-pubbaṇgamaṃ vipassanaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity preceded by insight (''{{IAST|vipassanā-pubbaṇgamaṃ samathaṃ}}''),
* one develops serenity and insight in a stepwise fashion (''{{IAST|samatha-vipassanaṃ yuganaddhaṃ}}''),
* one's mind becomes seized by excitation about the [[dhamma]] and, as a consequence, develops serenity and abandons the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''{{IAST|dhamma-uddhacca-viggahitaṃ mānasaṃ hoti}}'').

For those that have destroyed greed and hatred (in the sensory context) with some residue of delusion, are called ''[[anagami]]'' (non-returner). Anagamis will not be reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Pure Abodes]], where only anagamis live. There, they will attain full enlightenment.

The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of the path to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Keown and Prebish (2007), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', p. 36: "When the great ''Theravada'' commentator, [[Buddhaghosa]], wrote the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' delineating the nature of the gradual path to enlightenment, he placed the ''arahant'' at the completion of that path. The ''arahant'' stands as a transcendent figure in ''Theravada'', one who has followed to its end the way of ''Dharma'' set out by the Buddha."}}

===In Mahāyāna Buddhism===
[[File:Luóhàn at British Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Seated Luohan from Yixian]], around 1000, one of a famous [[Yixian glazed pottery luohans|Group of glazed pottery luohans from Yixian]]]]

Mahayana Buddhists see Gautama Buddha himself as the ideal towards which one should aim in one's spiritual aspirations. A hierarchy of general attainments is envisioned with the attainments of arhats and pratyekabuddhas being clearly separate and below that of samyaksambuddha or [[tathāgata]]s such as Gautama Buddha.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the goal of becoming a fully enlightened buddha, the path of a śrāvaka in being motivated by seeking personal liberation from saṃsāra is often portrayed as selfish and undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism''. Sarup &amp; Son. 2008. p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; There are even some Mahāyāna texts that regard the aspiration to arhatship and personal liberation as an outside path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of aspiring for arhatship, Mahayanins are urged to instead take up the path of the bodhisattva and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 119"/&gt; Therefore, it is taught that an arhat must go on to become a bodhisattva eventually. If they fail to do so in the lifetime in which they reach the attainment, they will fall into a deep [[samadhi|samādhi]] of emptiness, thence to be roused and taught the bodhisattva path, presumably when ready. According to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', any true arhat will eventually accept the Mahāyāna path.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng Yen. ''Orthodox Chinese Buddhism''. North Atlantic Books. 2007. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahāyāna teachings often consider the śrāvaka path to be motivated by fear of saṃsāra, which renders them incapable of aspiring to buddhahood, and that they therefore lack the courage and wisdom of a bodhisattva.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Novice bodhisattvas are compared to śrāvakas and arhats at times. In the ''{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}'', there is an account of sixty novice bodhisattvas who attain arhatship despite themselves and their efforts at the bodhisattva path because they lacked the abilities of [[prajnaparamita]] and [[skillful means]] to progress as bodhisattvas toward complete enlightenment (Skt. ''{{IAST|Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi}}''). This is because they are still viewed as having innate attachment and fear of saṃsāra. The ''[[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81 Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|{{IAST|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra}}]]'' compares these people to a giant bird without wings that cannot help but plummet to the earth from the top of [[Sumeru]].&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt;

Mahayan Buddhism has viewed the śrāvaka path culminating in arhatship as a lesser accomplishment than complete enlightenment, but still accords due respect to arhats for their respective achievements. Therefore, buddha-realms are depicted as populated by both śrāvakas and bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 2004. p. 120"/&gt; Far from being completely disregarded, the accomplishments of arhats are viewed as impressive, essentially because they have transcended the mundane world.&lt;ref&gt;Powers, John. ''A Concise Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism''. Snow Lion Publications. 2008. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese Buddhism]] and other East Asian traditions have historically accepted this perspective, and specific groups of arhats are venerated as well, such as the [[Sixteen Arhats]], the [[Eighteen Arhats]], and the Five Hundred Arhats.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise. ''The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History and Meaning''. Shambhala. 2009. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The first famous portraits of these arhats were painted by the Chinese monk [[Guanxiu]] ({{zh|c=貫休|p=''Guànxiū''}}) in 891 CE. He donated these portraits to Shengyin Temple in Qiantang (modern [[Hangzhou]]), where they are preserved with great care and ceremonious respect.&lt;ref name="Early Text Painting"&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Texts on Painting|author=Susan Bush and Ilsio-yen Shih|publisher=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|year=1985|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some respects, the path to arhatship and the path to complete enlightenment are seen as having common grounds. However, a distinctive difference is seen in the Mahāyāna doctrine pushing emotional and cognitive non-attachment to their logical consequences. Of this, Paul Williams writes that in Mahāyāna Buddhism, "Nirvāṇa must be sought without being sought (for oneself), and practice must be done without being practiced. The discursive mode of thinking cannot serve the basic purpose of attainment without attainment."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3: The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism''. Routledge. 2004. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

She is an anthropologist and educator teaching about class, ethnicity and gender and the biases surrounding these issues. She is the current director of the Uruguyan Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres (INMUJERES) (National Institute of Woman) and served as vice-chair on the Inter-American Commission of Women from 2013-2015.

==Biography==
Angelica Beatriz Ramírez Abella was born on 18 September 1956 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. She completed both grammar and secondary school in the public school system.&lt;ref name="bio, GOB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beatriz Ramírez Abella|url=http://www.inmujeres.gub.uy/innovaportal/file/6903/1/cvbramirez.pdf|website=Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres|publisher=Gobierno de Uruguay|accessdate=14 September 2015|location=Montevideo, Uruguay|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1972, she started joining black youth groups&lt;ref name="Hunter College bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelica Beatriz Ramirez Abella|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/galci/pdfs/events/03.22.06bios.pdf|publisher=Hunter College|accessdate=14 September 2015|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973, founded the Grupos  de  Jóvenes  de  Asociación Cultural y Social Negro (ACSUN) (Black Cultural and Social Association Youth Group). She was also a co-founder of the Organización Mundo Afro (African World Organization).&lt;ref name="bio, GOB" /&gt;

In 1988, she attended the School of Social Service and the following year enrolled in gender studies at Grupo de Estudios sobre la Condicion de la Mujer en Uruguay (GRECMU) (Study Group on the Status of Women in Uruguay). In 1994 completed further studies on ethnicity and gender at Geledés Instituto da Mulher Negra (Geledés Institute of Black Women) in Brazil. She is a member of the Faculty of Humanities and teaches anthropology at the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of Uruguay]]. She has taught courses on ethnicity and gender at the Instituto Centro Latinoamericano de Economía Humana (CLAEH) (Central Latin American Institute for Human Economy); at the Black Association for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights in Peru in 1993; and at the Global Afro-Latin and Caribbean Initiative in New York and Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="bio, GOB" /&gt; Since 2000 she has been part of the teaching network of the Instituto Superior de Formacion Afro (Afro-Training Institute of Higher Education).&lt;ref name="Hunter College bio" /&gt;

Throughout her career, Ramírez Abella has worked to improve access for people of African descent living in Latin America. She co-founded Proyecto Social Capitanes de la Arena, (CIPFE) (Social Captains of the Sand) in 1988 and served as its coordinator to assist street children and homeless persons. In 1992, she co-founded of the Network of Afro-Latin and Afro-Caribbean Women to better address issues which effect double minorities. She has also participated in conferences, such as the Third World Conference against Racism, and Xenophobia Related Intolerance held in Santiago, Chile in 2000; regional meetings of black parliamentarians held in Brasilia and Costa Rica; and as a member of the Delegation of Peace Mission to Colombia in 2002, among many others. She researches bias and has published numerous articles in newspapers and magazines such as ''Fem Press'' and ''Revista de Cotidiano Mujer''.&lt;ref name="bio, GOB" /&gt;

A '''Club Championship''' system is a sports competition where more than one team is fielded by clubs in the competition. An example of its use is in club [[rugby football|rugby]] and cricket competitions in [[Australia]] where clubs may have several grades.

A club championship is useful because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength against another, rather than merely looking at, for example, first grade results. Because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength, club championships are often used where there is a promotion/relegation system in place.

This means that a club which is strong throughout the grades will be in a better position than one which has only one or two strong teams. In a club championship system each grade's results are weighted, with the higher grades receiving more points, preventing clubs from flooding their lower grades with top players at the end of a season and shoring up their club championship results.

'''Color vision''' is the ability of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequency|frequencies]]) of the [[light]] they [[reflected light|reflect]], [[Light emission|emit]], or [[Transmittance|transmit]]. [[Color]]s can be measured and quantified in various ways; indeed, a person's perception of colors is a subjective process whereby the [[brain]] responds to the stimuli that are produced when incoming light reacts with the several types of [[cone cell]]s in the [[eye]]. In essence, different people see the same illuminated object or light source in different ways.

==Wavelength and hue detection==
[[Isaac Newton]] discovered that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]], after being split into its component colours when passed through a [[dispersive prism]], could be recombined to make white light by passing them through a different prism. 

The characteristic colours are, from long to short wavelengths (and, correspondingly, from low to high frequency), red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Sufficient differences in wavelength cause a difference in the perceived [[hue]]; the [[just-noticeable difference]] in wavelength varies from about 1&amp;nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] in the [[blue-green]] and [[yellow]] wavelengths, to 10&amp;nbsp;nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure [[spectral color]]s are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable [[chromaticity|chromaticities]] can be quite high.{{Ambiguous|date=October 2013}}

In very low light levels, vision is [[scotopic]]: light is detected by [[rod cell]]s of the [[retina]]. Rods are maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 500&amp;nbsp;nm, and play little, if any, role in colour vision. In brighter light, such as daylight, vision is [[photopic]]: light is detected by [[cone cell]]s which are responsible for colour vision. Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, but are most sensitive to wavelengths near 555&amp;nbsp;nm. Between these regions, [[mesopic vision]] comes into play and both rods and cones provide signals to the [[retinal ganglion cell]]s. The shift in colour perception from dim light to daylight gives rise  to differences known as the [[Purkinje effect]]

The perception of "white" is formed by the entire spectrum of visible light, or by mixing colours of just a few wavelengths in animals with few types of colour receptors. In humans, white light can be perceived by combining wavelengths such as red, green, and blue, or just a pair of [[complementary colour]]s such as blue and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;"Eye, human." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology of color perception==

[[File:Modern Color Vision Model.svg|thumb|The modern model of human color perception as it occurs in the retina, pertaining to both the [[trichromatic]] and [[opponent process]] theories introduced in the 19th century.]]

[[File:Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg|thumb|Normalized response spectra of human cones, to monochromatic spectral stimuli, with wavelength given in nanometers.]]

[[File:Spectrum locus 12.png|thumb|The same figures as above represented here as a single curve in three (normalized cone response) dimensions]]

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|[[Photopic]] relative brightness sensitivity of the human visual system as a function of wavelength ([[luminosity function]])]]

Perception of color begins with specialized retinal cells containing pigments with different [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]], known as [[cone cell]]s. In humans, there are three types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]].

Each individual cone contains pigments composed of [[opsin]] apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Molecular Genetics of Human Color Vision: The Genes Encoding Blue, Green, and Red Pigments |first1=Jeremy |last1=Nathans |first2=Darcy |last2=Thomas |first3=David S. |last3=Hogness |journal=Science|date= April 11, 1986 |jstor=169687 |bibcode=1986Sci...232..193N |volume=232 |pages=193–202 |doi=10.1126/science.2937147 |pmid=2937147 |issue=4747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cones are conventionally labeled according to the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their [[spectral sensitivity|spectral sensitivities]]: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as we know them. Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina and it will be finalized in the [[visual cortex]] and associative areas of the brain.

For example, while the L cones have been referred to simply as [[red]] receptors, [[microspectrophotometry]] has shown that their peak sensitivity is in the greenish-yellow region of the spectrum. Similarly, the S- and M-cones do not directly correspond to [[blue]] and [[green]], although they are often described as such. The [[RGB color model]], therefore, is a convenient means for representing color, but is not directly based on the types of cones in the human eye.

The peak response of human cone cells varies, even among individuals with so-called normal color vision;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Neitz J, Jacobs GH |title=Polymorphism of the long-wavelength cone in normal human color vision |journal=Nature |volume=323 |issue=6089 |pages=623–5 |year=1986 |pmid=3773989 |doi=10.1038/323623a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |bibcode=1986Natur.323..623N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305161805/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6089/abs/323623a0.html |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
in some non-human species this polymorphic variation is even greater, and it may well be adaptive.{{technical_statement |date=May 2018 | Cited source doesn't mention adaptive color responses or sensitivity in the publically–available summary.  I can guess what “adaptive” describes in this context, but I could be incorrect, and therefore cannot clarify:  it could be photoreceptors which shift their sensitivity, or it could be visual processing which sees some colors more or less strongly. }}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacobs GH |title=Primate photopigments and primate color vision |journal=Proc.

===Theories===
Two complementary theories of color vision are the [[trichromatic theory]] and the [[opponent process]] theory. The trichromatic theory, or [[Young–Helmholtz theory]], proposed in the 19th century by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. [[Ewald Hering]] proposed the opponent process theory in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Zur Lehre vom Lichtsinne |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch–Naturwissenschaftliche Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften |issue=III Abtheilung |volume=LXVI.

Hof- und Staatsdruckerei in Commission bei C. Gerold's Sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white.  Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the adjacent diagram.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985p168&gt;Ali, M.A. &amp; Klyne, M.A. (1985), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Green&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Magenta and Blue&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;←→&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In the same way that there cannot exist a "slightly negative" positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green.

A range of wavelengths of light stimulates each of these receptor types to varying degrees. Yellowish-green light, for example, stimulates both L and M cones equally strongly, but only stimulates S-cones weakly.  Red light, on the other hand, stimulates L cones much more than M cones, and S cones hardly at all; blue-green light stimulates M cones more than L cones, and S cones a bit more strongly, and is also the peak stimulant for rod cells; and [[blue]] light stimulates S cones more strongly than red or green light, but L and M cones more weakly. The brain combines the information from each type of receptor to give rise to different perceptions of different wavelengths of light.

The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X [[chromosome]]; defective encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of [[color blindness]]. The [[OPN1LW]] gene, which codes for the opsin present in the L cones, is highly [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants in a sample of 236 men).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Verrelli BC, Tishkoff SA |title=Signatures of Selection and Gene Conversion Associated with Human Color Vision Variation |journal=Am. J. Hum.

[[X chromosome inactivation]] means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of [[tetrachromat]]ic color vision.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Mark (2006). [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm "Some women may see 100 million colors, thanks to their genes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108171635/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06256/721190-114.stm |date=2006-11-08 }} ''Post-Gazette.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in [[OPN1MW]], which codes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on [[spectral sensitivity]].

=== Color in the human brain ===
[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|left|Visual pathways in the human brain.  The [[ventral stream]] (purple) is important in color recognition.  The [[dorsal stream]] (green) is also shown.  They originate from a common source in the [[visual cortex]].]]

Color processing begins at a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz's trichromatic theory, and Hering's opponent process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises at the level of the receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of [[retinal ganglion cells]] and beyond.  In Hering's theory opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light–dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency, but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.

Visual information is then sent to the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the [[optic nerve]] to the [[optic chiasma]]: a point where the two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses to the other side of the brain. After the optic chiasma the visual tracts are referred to as the [[optic tract]]s, which enter the [[thalamus]] to synapse at the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).

The lateral geniculate nucleus is divided into laminae (zones), of which there are three types: the M-laminae, consisting primarily of M-cells, the P-laminae, consisting primarily of P-cells, and the koniocellular laminae.  M- and P-cells receive relatively balanced input from both L- and M-cones throughout most of the retina, although this seems to not be the case at the fovea, with midget cells synapsing in the P-laminae.  The koniocellular laminae receive axons from the small bistratified ganglion cells.&lt;ref name = "The First Steps in Seeing"&gt;R.W. Rodieck, "The First Steps in Seeing". Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Massachusetts, USA, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "The Koniocellular Pathway in Primate Vision"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.127?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov |title=SH Hendry, RC Reid, "The Koniocellular Pathway in Primate Vision".

C. |last2=Reid |first2=R. Clay }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Synapse|synapsing]] at the LGN, the visual tract continues on back to the primary [[visual cortex]] (V1) located at the back of the brain within the [[occipital lobe]]. Within V1 there is a distinct band (striation). This is also referred to as "striate cortex", with other cortical visual regions referred to collectively as "extrastriate cortex". It is at this stage that color processing becomes much more complicated.

In V1 the simple three-color segregation begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to some parts of the spectrum better than others, but this "color tuning" is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized "color cells" often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such "double-opponent" cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.158.3803.942 | title = Goldfish Retina: Organization for Simultaneous Color Contrast | author = Nigel W.

The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the "thin stripes" that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form).  Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only  V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO.&lt;ref name="Conway07"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway BR, Moeller S, Tsao DY | year = 2007 | title = Specialized color modules in macaque extrastriate cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 560–73 | pmid = 17988638 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2007.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conway"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway BR, Tsao DY | year = 2009 | title = Color-tuned neurons are spatially clustered according to color preference within alert macaque posterior inferior temporal cortex | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 106 | issue = 42| pages = 18035–18039 | pmid = 19805195 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0810943106 | pmc = 2764907 |bibcode = 2009PNAS..10618034C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Area V4 was initially suggested by [[Semir Zeki]] to be exclusively dedicated to color, but this is now thought to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=John Allman |author2=Steven W.

Anatomical studies have shown that neurons in extended V4 provide input to the inferior [[temporal lobe]] . "IT" cortex is thought to integrate color information with shape and form, although it has been difficult to define the appropriate criteria for this claim. Despite this murkiness, it has been useful to characterize this pathway (V1 &gt; V2 &gt; V4 &gt; IT) as the [[ventral stream]] or the "what pathway", distinguished from the [[dorsal stream]] ("where pathway") that is thought to analyze motion, among many other features.

=== Subjectivity of color perception ===
{{see also|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}
Nothing categorically distinguishes the visible spectrum of electromagnetic radiation from invisible portions of the broader spectrum.  In this sense, color is not a property of electromagnetic radiation, but a feature of visual perception by an observer.  Furthermore, there is an arbitrary mapping between wavelengths of light in the visual spectrum and human experiences of color.  Although most people are assumed to have the same mapping, the philosopher [[John Locke]] recognized that alternatives are possible, and described one such hypothetical case with the "[[inverted spectrum]]" thought experiment.  For example, someone with an inverted spectrum might experience green while seeing 'red' (700&amp;nbsp;nm) light, and experience red while seeing 'green' (530&amp;nbsp;nm) light.  [[Synesthesia]] (or [[ideasthesia]]) provides some atypical but illuminating examples of subjective color experience triggered by input that is not even light, such as sounds or shapes.  The possibility of a clean dissociation between color experience from properties of the world reveals that color is a subjective psychological phenomenon.

The [[Himba people]] have been found to categorize colors differently from most Euro-Americans and are able to easily distinguish close shades of green, barely discernible for most people.&lt;ref&gt;Roberson, Davidoff, Davies &amp; Shapiro. referred by Debi Roberson, University of Essex 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Himba have created a very different color scheme which divides the spectrum to dark shades (''zuzu'' in Himba), very light (''vapa''),  vivid blue and green (''buru'') and dry colors as an adaptation to their specific way of life.

Perception of color depends heavily on the context in which the perceived object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as [[color constancy]].

=== In other animal species ===

Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet "colors" and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

The basis for this variation is the number of cone types that differ between species. Mammals in general have color vision of a limited type, and usually have [[red-green color blindness]], with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.

In most [[Catarrhini]] (Old World monkeys and apes—primates closely related to humans) there are three types of [[color receptors]] (known as [[cone cell]]s), resulting in [[trichromatic color vision]]. These primates, like humans, are known as [[Trichromacy|trichromats]]. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are [[dichromat]]s, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may have little or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.&lt;ref name=Ali&amp;Klyne1985&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ali|first=Mohamed Ather|last2=Klyne|first2=M.A.|title=Vision in Vertebrates|place=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1985|pages=174–175|isbn=0-306-42065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = G.

Many [[invertebrate]]s have color vision. [[Honeybee]]s and [[bumblebee]]s have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet.

In the evolution of mammals, segments of color vision were lost, then for a few species of primates, regained by [[gene duplication]]. [[Eutherian]] mammals other than primates (for example, dogs, mammalian farm animals) generally have less-effective two-receptor ([[dichromat]]ic) color perception systems, which distinguish blue, green, and yellow—but cannot distinguish oranges and reds. There is some evidence that a few mammals, such as cats, have redeveloped the ability to distinguish longer wavelength colors, in at least a limited way, via one-amino-acid mutations in opsin genes.&lt;ref&gt;Shozo Yokoyamaa and F. Bernhard Radlwimmera, "The Molecular Genetics of Red and Green Color Vision in Mammals", Genetics, Vol. 153, 919–932, October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptation to see reds is particularly important for primate mammals, since it leads to identification of fruits, and also newly sprouting reddish leaves, which are particularly nutritious.

However, even among primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, including monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. [[New World monkeys]] may or may not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the [[owl monkey]]s are cone [[monochromacy|monochromats]], and both sexes of [[howler monkey]]s are trichromats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jacobs G.

== Evolution ==
{{Main|Evolution of color vision}}
Color perception mechanisms are highly dependent on evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent is thought to be satisfactory recognition of food sources. In [[herbivorous]] primates, color perception is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In [[hummingbird]]s, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, [[nocturnal]] mammals have less-developed color vision, since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that [[ultraviolet]] light plays a part in color perception in many branches of the [[animal|animal kingdom]], especially [[insect]]s.  In general, the optical spectrum encompasses the most common [[Molecular electronic transition|electronic transitions]] in matter and is therefore the most useful for collecting information about the environment.

The [[Evolution of color vision in primates|evolution of trichromatic color vision in primates]] occurred as the ancestors of modern monkeys, apes, and humans switched to [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] (daytime) activity and began consuming fruits and leaves from flowering plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] |title=[[How the Mind Works]] |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=191 |isbn=0-393-04535-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color vision, with UV discrimination, is also present in a number of arthropods—the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to possess this trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=M. |last2=Nagata |first2=T. |last3=Katoh |first3=K. |last4=Yamashita |first4=S. |last5=Tokunaga |first5=F. |year=2008 |title=Molecular Evolution of Arthropod Color Vision Deduced from Multiple Opsin Genes of Jumping Spiders  |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9065-9 |pmid=18217181|bibcode=2008JMolE..66..130K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics of color perception ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016 }}
A "physical color" is a combination of pure [[spectral color]]s (in the visible range).  Since there are, in principle, infinitely many distinct spectral colors, the set of all physical colors may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional [[vector space]], in fact a [[Hilbert space]].  We call this space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;. More technically, the space of physical colors may be considered to be the (mathematical) [[cone (topology)|cone]] over the [[simplex]] whose vertices are the spectral colors, with white at the [[centroid]] of the simplex, black at the apex of the cone, and the monochromatic color associated with any given vertex somewhere along the line from that vertex to the apex depending on its brightness.

An element ''C'' of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; is a function from the range of visible wavelengths—considered as an interval of real numbers [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;]—to the real numbers, assigning to each wavelength ''w'' in [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;] its intensity ''C''(''w'').

A humanly perceived color may be modeled as three numbers: the extents to which each of the 3 types of cones is stimulated. Thus a humanly perceived color may be thought of as a point in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. We call this space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since each wavelength ''w'' stimulates each of the 3 types of cone cells to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions ''s''(''w''), ''m''(''w''), ''l''(''w'') corresponding to the response of the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' cone cells, respectively.

Finally, since a beam of light can be composed of many different wavelengths, to determine the extent to which a physical color ''C'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to ''w''), over the interval [''W''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;,''W''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;], of ''C''(''w'')·''s''(''w''), of ''C''(''w'')·''m''(''w''), and of ''C''(''w'')·''l''(''w''). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color ''C'' (which is an element in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the "physical" space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; can all result in the same single perceived color in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.

Thus human color perception is determined by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt; to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.

Technically, the image of the (mathematical) cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, by this linear mapping, is also a (mathematical) cone in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;color&lt;/sub&gt;.  Moving directly away from the vertex of this cone represents maintaining the same [[chromaticity]] while increasing its intensity. Taking a cross-section of this cone yields a 2D chromaticity space.  Both the 3D cone and its projection or cross-section are convex sets; that is, any mixture of spectral colors is also a color.

[[File:Cie Chart with sRGB gamut by spigget.png|thumb|The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity diagram with a triangle showing the [[gamut]] of the [[sRGB]] color space. The Planckian locus is shown with color temperatures labeled in [[kelvin]]s. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers (blue). Note that the colors in this file are being specified using '''sRGB'''. Areas outside the triangle cannot be accurately rendered because they are out of the gamut of sRGB, therefore they have been interpreted. Note that the colors depicted depend on the color space of the device you use to view the image (number of colors on your monitor, etc.), and may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position.]]

In practice, it would be quite difficult to physiologically measure an individual's three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them ''S'', ''M'', and ''L''. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ''S'', ''M'', and ''L'' lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' would have to be added with some intensity to the ''physical test color'', and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.

By considering all the resulting combinations of intensities (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;) as a subset of 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' had to be added to the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the ''S'', ''M'', ''L'' lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of "chromaticities" (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross section, corresponding to constant ''X''+''Y''+''Z'' of the [[CIE 1931 color space]], gives the CIE chromaticity diagram.

This system implies that for any hue or non-spectral color not on the boundary of the chromaticity diagram, there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general there is no such thing as ''the'' combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the "line of purples" can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.

The CIE chromaticity diagram is horseshoe-shaped, with its curved edge corresponding to all spectral colors (the ''spectral [[locus (mathematics)|locus]]''), and the remaining straight edge corresponding to the most saturated [[purple]]s, mixtures of [[red]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]].

== Chromatic adaptation ==
{{Main|Chromatic adaptation}}

In color science, '''chromatic adaptation''' is the estimation of the representation of an object under a different light source from the one in which it was recorded. A common application is to find a ''chromatic adaptation transform'' (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral ([[color balance]]), while keeping other colors also looking realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Süsstrunk, Sabine. [http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818184220/http://ivrgwww.epfl.ch/research/past_topics/chromatic_adaptation.html |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between [[ICC profile]]s with different [[white point]]s. [[Adobe Photoshop]], for example, uses the Bradford CAT.&lt;ref&gt;Lindbloom, Bruce. [http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html Chromatic Adaptation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926223613/http://www.brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html |date=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In color vision, chromatic adaptation refers to [[color constancy]]; the ability of the visual system to preserve the appearance of an object under a wide range of light sources.&lt;ref name=CAM&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|first=Mark D.|last=Fairchild|chapter=8.

The '''crumbling skull rule''' is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] used in some [[tort law]] systems.  It holds that where a plaintiff had a condition or injury that predates the tort and would have naturally deteriorated or worsened over time (e.g. a crumbling skull), the defendant is not responsible to the degree that the condition or injury would have naturally worsened over time.  A defendant is only liable for the degree the injury was worsened or the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by the tort.  The crumbling skull rule should not be confused with the related [[Eggshell skull|thin skull rule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Athey v. Leonati'', [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 34-36, online at: http://canlii.ca/t/1fr63&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is sometimes applied without specific reference to the crumbling skull rule, instead being expressed as a non-absolute application of the thin skull rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Kavanagh v Akhtar Matter No Ca 40492/97'', [1998] NSWSC 779, online at: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth v WL McLean: Developments Inconsistent with the Traditional Nature of the Egg Shell Scull Principle |first=Tanya |last=Jones |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2001/6.pdf |journal=James Cook University Law Review |date= 2001 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism''''', by [[Chögyam Trungpa]] is a book addressing many common pitfalls of self-deception in seeking spirituality, which the author coins as ''[[Spiritual materialism]]''. It is the transcript of two series of lectures given by Trungpa [[Rinpoche]] in 1970–71.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php Book Corner - Shambhala&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210031919/http://shambhala.org/meditation/books2.php |date=2011-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Psychology Today]]'' Michael J. Formica writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as we cast something into a role, as soon as we put a label on it, as soon as we name it and give it life by virtue of our investment (read: ego), we take away all its power and it is nothing more than an event – it is no longer a spiritual revelation, but simply a material experience. That is spiritual materialism at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/enlightened-living/200812/cutting-through-spiritual-materialism Cutting through Spiritual Materialism | Psychology Today&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12985">The '''Edict of Toleration''' took place during the process referred to as the [[Eastern Question]] in relations between European powers, Britain in particular, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] in its development at a time referred to as [[Tanzimat]] internally which included other initiatives like ending the [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman slave trade]] a few years later but overall as part of the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] – a process that continued into the 1920s. It was largely a result of pressure from the British government on the [[Sublime Porte]], [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottomans, urging to stop the persecutions of the Christians, and eventually had an effect on the persecutions of Jews,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} continuing effects such as the earlier [[Damascus affair]]. It is one of the [[Edict of toleration|edicts of toleration]] of history.

Tanzimat was an Ottoman reform process that sought equal protections under the law in Ottoman lands for all people; however, it did not address matters of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| first =Selim | last = Deringil | editor-last =Michael| editor-first =Michalis N. | editor2-last =Anastassiades | editor2-first =Tassos | editor-last3 = Verdeil| editor-first3 =Chantal | title =Re-configuring Ottoman citizenship in the Tanzimat state: conversion, religion and identity politics in the late Ottoman Empire(abstract | booktitle =Religious community and modern statehood: The passage from the Ottoman Empire to modern state | page =  5 | publisher = University of Cyprus, Department of Turkish and Middle Eastern Studies | date =October 2010 | location = Nicosia, Cyrpus | url =http://www.ucy.ac.cy/tms/documents/tms/sinedria/Conf.29.10.10_Programme.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular incident in 1843 with an Armenian Ottoman subject sparked an incident in August which gained international entanglements and then a Greek national in November, both of whom were put to death - the process of which became the Edict in March 1844.&lt;ref name="Subsi"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Subsi | first = Turgut | title =The apostasy question in the context of Anglo-Ottoman relations, 1843-44. | journal =Middle Eastern Studies | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Frank Cass &amp; Company Ltd.  | date =April 1, 2002 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-112247877.html | accessdate = December 11, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] referred to these developments in 1844 when he summarized diplomatic notes&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Bickersteth|authorlink=Edward Bickersteth (priest)|title=A practical guide to the Prophecies, with reference to their interpretation and fulfilment, and to personal edification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wFOAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA223|year=1844|publisher=Seeley, Burnside, and Seeley|pages=221–23, 387–394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The original notes of the diplomatic letter noting this edict can be obtained from the Public Record Office in London. A translation of the edict, an acknowledgment from [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe]] to the Sublime Porte, and an accompanying letter from Canning, dated 23 March 1844, is in Foreign Office, Turkey, FO78/555/No.49. There are several other letters from Canning in the same volume on the question of the religious intolerance of the Turks. The draft of a letter from the Foreign Office, dated 16 January 1844, which made plain the attitude of the British government and which provided the direct impetus for the negotiations leading eventually to the issue of the edict, is in FO78/552/No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; presented to the British Parliament noting "The correspondence occupied a considerable part of the year—from Aug. 27, 1843, to April 19, 1844."&lt;ref name="Sours"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Sours | title = The 1844 Ottoman 'Edict of Toleration' in Baha'i Secondary Literature |volume = 8 | issue = 3 | year = 1998 | journal = Journal of Baha'i Studies | pages = 53–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Edict==
In February 1844 there is a question on the status of Jew apostates from Islam (who, it was claimed, must pass through being Christian on the way to Islam in the first place)&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite book|author=August Jochmus (freiherr von Cotignola.)|title=The Syrian war and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1840-1848: in reports, documents, and correspondences, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dXfDamiuHEkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA106|year=1883|publisher=A. Cohn|pages=102, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 21, 1844 appears (in translation):

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the special and constant intention of His Highness the Sultan that his cordial relations with the High Powers be preserved, and that a perfect reciprocal friendship be maintained and increased.&lt;br&gt;
 The Sublime Porte engage to take effectual measures to prevent henceforward the execution and putting to death of the Christian who is an apostate.&lt;ref name="quote"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Muslim Islamic scholar [[Cyril Glassé]], death for [[Apostasy in Islam]] was "not in practice enforced" in later times in the Muslim world, and was "completely abolished" by "a decree of the Ottoman government in 1260AH/1844AD."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cyril |last=Glassé |year=2001 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=AltaMira |page=54|location=[[Walnut Creek, California]] |isbn=978-0-7591-0189-0|oclc=48553252}}&lt;/ref&gt; This short edict was advanced in the wider [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856]].

==Prophetic interpretations==
The Edict was seen by some especially among the religious as a specific sign leading towards the fulfillment of prophecy.

The Edict was first publicly commented upon by Reverend [[Edward Bickersteth (priest)|Edward Bickersteth]] in his publication, ''Practical Guide to the Prophecies'' in the 1844 edition.&lt;ref name="Bickersteth"/&gt; Adventist [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], and those that disagreed with him, though unaware of the Edict and the diplomacy around it, still looked to the fortunes of the Ottoman Empire even in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper| last = Nichol | first =Francis D. | authorlink =Francis D.

The 2300 days are understood to represent 2300 years stretching from 457 BC, the calculated starting date of the [[70 weeks prophecy#Seventh-day Adventists|70 weeks prophecy]] based on the 3rd decree found in Ezra, thus leading to 1843/4. Bickersteth acknowledged the same interpretation and added a second - {{bible verse||Ezekiel|4:5|KJV}} - as a parallel to start the clock for understanding {{bible verse||Revelation|9:15|KJV}}; taking 390 years as a period for persecution of Christians in the [[End time]]. Bickersteth takes this persecution from the [[Fall of Constantinople|triumph of Ottoman]] rule of Constantinople in 1453, thus 1453+390 is 1843/4, directly before these events. Thus, independently of Miller, a number of Christian authors followed the significance of this declaration from Bickersteth including [[Alfred Edersheim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Edersheim|authorlink = Alfred Edersheim |title=Israel's watchman (and prophetic expositor) &amp;#91;afterw.&amp;#93; The prophetic news and Israel's watchman, ed. by A.

{{confuse|Ethnos (disambiguation){{!}}Ethnos}}
[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and the statue Ethos.jpg|thumb|A sculpture representing Ethos outside the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] in Canberra, Australia]]
'''Ethos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ɒ|s}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|iː|θ|oʊ|s}}) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning "character" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Piero and Taruskin, Richard, "Music in the Western World: A History in Documents" (1984) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek stories of [[Orpheus]] exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in [[rhetoric]] is closely based on the Greek terminology used by [[Aristotle]] in his concept of the three artistic proofs or [[modes of persuasion]].

==Etymology and origin==
''Ethos'' ({{lang|grc|ἦθος}}, {{lang|grc|ἔθος}}; ''plurals:'' ''ethe'', {{lang|grc|ἤθη}}; ''ethea'', {{lang|grc|ἤθεα}}) is a Greek word originally meaning "accustomed place" (as in {{lang|grc|ἤθεα ἵππων}} "the habitats of horses", ''[[Iliad]]'' 6.511, 15.268),&lt;ref&gt;Proscurcin Jr., ''Der Begriff Ethos bei Homer.'' (2014) pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; "custom, habit", equivalent to Latin ''[[mores]]''.

''Ethos'' forms the root of ''ethikos'' ({{lang|grc|ἠθικός}}), meaning "moral, showing moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Book 2 (1103a17)&lt;/ref&gt; As an adjective in the neuter plural form ''ta ethika'' ({{lang|grc|τὰ ἠθικά}}), used for the study of morals, it is the origin of the modern English word ''[[ethics]]''.

==Current usage==
In modern usage, ethos denotes the disposition, character, or fundamental values particular to a specific person, people, corporation, culture, or movement. For example, the poet and critic [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote in 1940 that "the general ethos of the people they have to govern  determines the behaviour of politicians".&lt;ref&gt;T. S. Eliot, ''The idea of a Christian society'' (1940) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the historian [[Orlando Figes]] wrote in 1996 that in Soviet Russia of the 1920s "the ethos of the  [[Communist]] party dominated every aspect of public life".&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Figes, ''A people's tragedy: the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 1891–1924'' (1996) p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This statement requires further elaboration to be intelligible: When used in the rhetorical tradition, in addition to what motivates the individual, ethos establishes credibility for the individual among the audience, which is essential in a successful attempt at persuasion.--&gt;
Ethos may change in response to new ideas or forces. For example, according to the Jewish historian Afrie Krampf, ideas of economic modernization which were imported into [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1930s brought about "the abandonment of the agrarian ethos and the reception of...the ethos of rapid development".&lt;ref&gt;Afrie Krampf, "Reception of the Developmental Approach in the Jewish Economic Discourse of Mandatory Palestine, 1934–1938," ''Israel Studies,'' Summer 2010, Vol. 15#2, pp. 80–103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}
In [[rhetoric]], ethos is one of the three artistic proofs (''pistis'', πίστις) or [[modes of persuasion]] (other principles being ''[[logos#Aristotle.27s rhetorical logos|logos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]'') discussed by [[Aristotle]] in '[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]' as a component of argument. Speakers must establish ethos from the start.  This can involve "moral competence" only; Aristotle however broadens the concept to include [[expertise]] and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Ethos Dwells Pervasively'' In: ''The Ethos of Rhetoric.'' (2004) pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woerther, ''L'èthos aristotélicien.'' (2007) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethos is limited, in his view, by what the speaker says. Others however contend that a speaker's ethos extends to and is shaped by the overall moral character and history of the speaker—that is, what people think of his or her character before the speech has even begun (cf [[Isocrates]]).

According to [[Aristotle]], there are three categories of ethos:

* ''[[phronesis]]''&amp;nbsp;– useful skills &amp; wisdom
* ''[[Arete (excellence)|arete]]''&amp;nbsp;– virtue, goodwill
* ''[[eunoia]]''&amp;nbsp;– goodwill towards the audience

In a sense, ethos does not belong to the speaker but to the audience. Thus, it is the audience that determines whether a speaker is a high- or a low-ethos speaker. Violations of ethos include:

* The speaker has a direct interest in the outcome of the debate (e.g. a person pleading innocence of a crime);
* The speaker has a vested interest or ulterior motive in the outcome of the debate;
* The speaker has no expertise (e.g. a lawyer giving a speech on space flight is less convincing than an astronaut giving the same speech).

Completely dismissing an argument based on any of the above violations of ethos is an informal fallacy ([[Appeal to motive]]). The argument may indeed be suspect; but is not, in itself, invalid.

===Modern interpretations===
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

For Aristotle, a speaker's ethos was a rhetorical strategy employed by an orator whose purpose was to "inspire trust in his audience" (''Rhetorica'' 1380). ''Ethos'' was therefore achieved through the orator's "good sense, good moral character, and goodwill", and central to Aristotelian virtue ethics was the notion that this "good moral character" was increased in virtuous degree by habit (''Rhetorica'' 1380). Aristotle links virtue, habituation, and ''ethos'' most succinctly in Book II of ''Nichomachean Ethics'': "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual virtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching [...] while moral virtue comes about as a result of habit, whence also its name ''ethike'' is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word ''ethos'' (habit)" (952). Discussing women and rhetoric, scholar Karlyn Kohrs Campbell notes that entering the public sphere was considered an act of moral transgression for females of the nineteenth century: "Women who formed moral reform and abolitionist societies, and who made speeches, held conventions, and published newspapers, entered the public sphere and thereby lost their claims to purity and piety" (13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Man Cannot Speak for Her: Volume I; A Critical Study of Early Feminist Rhetoric|last = Campbell|first = Karlyn Kohrs|publisher = Praeger|year = 1989|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crafting an ethos within such restrictive moral codes, therefore, meant adhering to membership of what Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner have theorized as counterpublics. While Warner contends that members of counterpublics are afforded little opportunity to join the dominant public and therefore exert true agency, Nancy Fraser has problematized Habermas's conception of the public sphere as a dominant "social totality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Publics and Counterpublics|last = Warner|first = Michael|date = 2002|journal = Public Culture|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; by theorizing "subaltern counterpublics", which function as alternative publics that represent "parallel discursive arenas where members of subordinated social groups invent and circulate counterdiscourses, which in turn permit them to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities, interests, and needs" (67).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of the Actually Existing Democracy|last = Fraser|first = Nancy|date = 1990|journal = Social Text|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though feminist rhetorical theorists have begun to offer more nuanced ways to conceive of ethos, they remain cognizant of how these classical associations have shaped and still do shape women's use of the rhetorical tool. Johanna Schmertz draws on Aristotelian ethos to reinterpret the term alongside feminist theories of subjectivity, writing that, "Instead of following a tradition that, it seems to me, reads ethos somewhat in the manner of an Aristotelian quality proper to the speaker's identity, a quality capable of being deployed as needed to fit a rhetorical situation, I will ask how ethos may be dislodged from identity and read in such a way as to multiply the positions from which women may speak" (83).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Essences: Ethos and the Postmodern Subject of Feminism|last = Schmertz|first = Johanna|date = 1999|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar and professor Kate Ronald's claim that "ethos is the appeal residing in the tension between the speaker's private and public self", (39)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Reexamination of Personal and Public Discourse in Classical Rhetoric|last = Ronald|first = Kate|date = 1990|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also presents a more postmodern view of ethos that links [[credibility]] and identity. Similarly, Nedra Reynolds and Susan Jarratt echo this view of ethos as a fluid and dynamic set of identifications, arguing that "these split selves are guises, but they are not distortions or lies in the philosopher's sense. Rather they are 'deceptions' in the sophistic sense: recognitions of the ways one is positioned multiply differently" (56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ethos: New Essays in Rhetorical and Critical Theory|last = Susan|first = Jarratt|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1994|isbn = |location = Dallas|pages = 37–69|last2 = Reynolds|first2 = Nedra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhetorical scholar Michael Halloran has argued that the classical understanding of ethos "emphasizes the conventional rather than the idiosyncratic, the public rather than the private" (60). Commenting further on the classical etymology and understanding of ''ethos'', Halloran illuminates the interdependence between ''ethos'' and cultural context by arguing that "To have ethos is to manifest the virtues most valued by the culture to and for which one speaks" (60).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Aristotle's Concept of Ethos, or if not His, Someone Else's|last = Halloran|first = Michael|date = 1982|journal = Rhetoric Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars do not all agree on the dominant sphere in which ethos may be crafted, some agree that ethos is formed through the negotiation between private experience and the public, rhetorical act of self-expression. Karen Burke LeFevre's argument in ''Invention as Social Act'' situates this negotiation between the private and the public, writing that ethos "appears in that socially created space, in the 'between', the point of intersection between speaker or writer and listener or reader" (45-46).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invention as a Social Act|last = LeFevre|first = K. B.|publisher = Southern Illinois University Press|year = 1987|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nedra Reynolds, "ethos, like postmodern subjectivity, shifts and changes over time, across texts, and around competing spaces" (336). However, Reynolds additionally discusses how one might clarify the meaning of ethos within rhetoric as expressing inherently communal roots. This stands in direct opposition to what she describes as the claim "that ethos can be faked or 'manipulated'" because individuals would be formed by the values of their culture and not the other way around (336). Rhetorical scholar John Oddo also suggests that ethos is negotiated across a community, and not simply a manifestation of the self (47). In the era of mass-mediated communication, Oddo contends, one's ethos is often created by journalists and dispersed over multiple news texts. With this in mind, Oddo coins the term intertextual ethos, the notion that a public figure's "ethos is constituted within and across a range of mass media voices" (48).

In "Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos", scholar Coretta Pittman notes that race has been generally absent from theories of ethos construction, and that this concept is troubling for black women. Pittman writes, "Unfortunately, in the history of race relations in America, black Americans' ethos ranks low among other racial and ethnic groups in the United States. More often than not, their moral characters have been associated with a criminalized and sexualized ethos in visual and print culture" (43).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Black Women Writers and the Trouble with Ethos: Harriet Jacobs, Billie Holiday, and Sister Souljah|last = Pittman|first = Corretta|date = 2007|journal = Rhetoric Society Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character in Greek tragedy==
The ways in which characters were constructed is important when considering ethos, or character, in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, ''Aristotle's Poetics.'' (1998) pp. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus Taber Murray explains that the depiction of a character was limited by the circumstances under which Greek tragedies were presented. These include the single unchanging scene, necessary use of the chorus, small number of characters limiting interaction, large outdoor theatres, and the use of masks, which all influenced characters to be more formal and simple.&lt;ref name=M534&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray also declares that the inherent characteristics of Greek tragedies are important in the makeup of the characters. One of these is the fact that tragedy characters were nearly always mythical characters. This limited the character, as well as the plot, to the already well-known myth from which the material of the play was taken. The other characteristic is the relatively short length of most Greek plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Ancient Theater and Performance Culture'' In: ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Theater.'' (2007) pp. 36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This limited the scope of the play and characterization, so that the characters were defined by one overriding motivation toward a certain objective from the beginning of the play.&lt;ref name=M546&gt;Murray (1916), pp. 54–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Murray clarifies that strict constancy is not always the rule in Greek tragedy characters. To support this, he points out the example of Antigone who, even though she strongly defies Creon in the beginning of the play, begins to doubt her cause and plead for mercy as she is led to her execution.&lt;ref name=M59&gt;Murray (1916), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other aspects of the character element in ancient Greek tragedy are worth noting.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, ''Aristoteles über das Wesen und die Wirkung der Tragödie (Kap. 6)'' In: ''Aristoteles. Poetik.'' (2009) pp. 87 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these, which C. Garton discusses, is the fact that either because of contradictory action or incomplete description, the character cannot be viewed as an individual, or the reader is left confused about the character.&lt;ref name=G247&gt;Garton (1957), p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; One method of reconciling this would be to consider these characters to be flat, or type-caste, instead of round. This would mean that most of the information about the character centers around one main quality or viewpoint.&lt;ref name=G2478&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the flat character option, the reader could also view the character as a symbol. Examples of this might be the Eumenides as vengeance, or Clytemnestra as symbolizing ancestral curse.&lt;ref name=G248&gt;Garton (1957), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another means of looking at character, according to Tycho von Wilamowitz and Howald, is the idea that characterisation is not important. This idea is maintained by the theory that the play is meant to affect the viewer or reader scene by scene, with attention being only focused on the section at hand. This point of view also holds that the different figures in a play are only characterised by the situation surrounding them, and only enough so that their actions can be understood.&lt;ref name=G2489&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garet makes three more observations about character in Greek tragedy. The first is an abundant variety of types of characters in Greek tragedy. His second observation is that the reader or viewer's need for characters to display a unified identity that is similar to human nature is usually fulfilled. Thirdly, characters in tragedies include incongruities and idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=G250&gt;Garton (1957), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect stated by Garet is that tragedy plays are composed of language, character, and action, and the interactions of these three components; these are fused together throughout the play. He explains that action normally determines the major means of characterisation. Another principle he states is the importance of these three components' effect on each other; the important repercussion of this being character's impact on action.&lt;ref name=G2501&gt;Garton (1957), pp. 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus Taber Murray also examines the importance and degree of interaction between plot and character. He does this by discussing Aristotle's statements about plot and character in his Poetics: that plot can exist without character, but character cannot exist without plot, and so character is secondary to plot. Murray maintains that Aristotle did not mean that complicated plot should hold the highest place in a tragedy play. This is because the plot was, more often than not, simple and therefore not a major point of tragic interest. Murray conjectures that people today do not accept Aristotle's statement about character and plot because to modern people, the most memorable things about tragedy plays are often the characters.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Murray (1916), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murray does concede that Aristotle is correct in that "[t]here can be no portrayal of character [...] without at least a skeleton outline of plot".&lt;ref name=M53&gt;Murray (1916), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character, or ethos, in pictorial narrative==
{{Cleanup reorganize|section|date=June 2018}}

Ethos, or character, also appears in the visual art of famous or mythological ancient Greek events in murals, on pottery, and sculpture, referred to generally as pictorial narrative. Aristotle even praised the ancient Greek painter Polygnotos because his paintings included characterization. The way in which the subject and his actions are portrayed in visual art can convey the subject's ethical character and through this the work's overall theme, just as effectively as poetry or drama can.&lt;ref name=C11&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation portrayed men as they ought to be, which is the same as Aristotle's idea of what ethos or character should be in tragedy. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 178) Professor Mark D. Stansbury-O'Donnell states that pictorial narratives often had ethos as its focus, and was therefore concerned with showing the character's moral choices. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 175) David Castriota, agreeing with Stansbury-O'Donnell's statement, says that the main way Aristotle considered poetry and visual arts to be on equal levels was in character representation and its effect on action.&lt;ref name=C10&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Castriota also maintains about Aristotle's opinion that "his interest has to do with the influence that such ethical representation may exert upon the public". Castriota also explains that according to Aristotle, "[t]he activity of these artists is to be judged worthy and useful above all because exposure of their work is beneficial to the [[polis]]".&lt;ref name=C10 /&gt; Accordingly, this was the reason for the representation of character, or ethos, in public paintings and sculptures. In order to portray the character's choice, the pictorial narrative often shows an earlier scene than when the action was committed. Stansbury-O'Donnell gives an example of this in the form of a picture by the ancient Greek artist Exekia which shows the Greek hero Ajax planting his sword in the ground in preparation to commit suicide, instead of the actual suicide scene. (Stansbury-O'Donnell, p. 177.) Additionally, Castriota explains that ancient Greek art expresses the idea that character was the major factor influencing the outcome of the Greeks' conflicts against their enemies. Because of this, "ethos was the essential variable in the equation or analogy between myth and actuality".&lt;ref name=C12&gt;Castriota (1992), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Week for Waste Reduction (EWWR)'''&lt;ref name="EWWR"&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/EWWR ACR+ - EWWR presentation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; was launched as a 3-year project supported by the LIFE+ Programme of the [[European Commission]] until July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1588&amp;format=PDF&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en European Commission - Environment Policy &amp; Governance, LIFE + Projects 2007], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This source doesn't seem to reference the European Week for Waste Reduction anywhere|date=March 2013}} It continues taking place in the following years. The 2012 edition of the EWWR took place from the 17 to 25 November 2012 under the patronage of Mr Janez Potočnik, European Commissioner for the Environment. 
It aims to organize multiple actions during a single week, across Europe, that will raise awareness about [[waste reduction]]. Each year, the most outstanding actions are rewarded during an awards ceremony in Brussels at the heart of the European institutions. Since the beginning of the project, more than 20.000 awareness raising actions on waste prevention have been implemented in the framework of the EWWR.

The 2017 date is from November 18-27.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewwr.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The five partners of this project are:
* '''ADEME''' (the French Environment and Energy Management Agency – project coordinator)
* '''ACR+''' (the Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and sustainable Resource management – project technical secretariat)
* '''ARC''' (the Catalan Waste Agency)
* '''IBGE''' (Brussels Environment, public administration for the environment and energy)   and
* '''LIPOR''' (the Intermunicipal Waste Management Service of [[Greater Porto]]).

==Purpose==
* To raise awareness about waste reduction strategies and about the policies of the European Union and its Member States on this subject
* To promote sustainable waste reduction actions across Europe
* To highlight the work accomplished by various actors, through concrete examples of waste reduction
* To encourage changes in the behaviour of Europeans (consumption, production) in everyday life

==Target audience==
* '''Public authorities across Europe''' that have competence in the field of waste prevention that responded to a Call for Interest launched by the official partners of the project. These EWWR Organisers act as coordinators of the Week in the area covered by their authority, thereby ensuring the registration and validation of actions proposed by various Project Developers.
* '''Project developers''' interested in carrying out awareness raising actions on the subject of waste prevention during the Week, with the aim of informing the greatest possible number of citizens. These Project Developers register their proposals for EWWR actions through the national, regional or local Organiser covering their area.
:'''5 categories of Project Developer:'''
** Administration/public authority
** Association/NGO
** Business/industry
** Educational establishment
** Other (for example : hospital, retirement home, cultural centre etc.).
* '''European citizens''' who participate in actions set up by Project Developers during the Week and learn about the kind of waste reduction habits that they can take up in everyday life.

==Five themes of the EWWR==
* Too much waste
* Better production
* Better consumption
* A longer life for products
* Less waste thrown away

{{Sociology}}
{{Feminism sidebar|Theory}}
'''Feminist sociology''' is a [[conflict theory]] and theoretical perspective which observes [[gender]] in its relation to power, both at the level of [[face-to-face interaction]] and [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] within a [[social structure]] at large. Focuses include [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social stratification|economic status]], and [[nationality]].

At the core of feminist sociology is the idea of the systemic [[oppression]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A phenomenon derived from prehistoric-human social- behavioral patterns, specifically regarding the (Fe)Male relationship; as well as significant gender differentiation in terms of physical and mental attributes. This Idea of origin is Key to the progression of 'equalist' ideals, which have grown to engulf a number of socially important injustices, yet is often not realized in the Psyche of the individual and thus not beheld, conceptually by public; possibly due to the absence of a cross-conceptual, analytical thinking pattern.{{Original research inline|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of women and the historical dominance of men within most societies: '[[patriarchy]]'. [[Feminist]] thought has a rich history, however, which may be categorized into three 'waves'. The current, '[[third wave feminism|third wave]]', emphasizes the concepts of [[globalization]], [[postcolonialism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]]. Contemporary feminist thought has frequently tended to do-away with all generalizations regarding sex and gender, closely linked with [[antihumanism]], [[posthumanism]], [[queer theory]] and the work of [[Michel Foucault]].

'''[[Feminist theory]]-''' [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]](1860-1935) was a women ahead of her time who work and research would help formalize "feminist theory during the 1960s. Growing up she went against traditional holds that were placed on her by society by focusing on reading and learning concepts different than women who were taught to be a housewife. Her main focus was on gender inequality between men and women along with gender roles placed on my society. Where men go to work secure proper income for the family while women stay at home and tend to the family along with house hold chores.  She "emphasized how differential socialization leads to gender inequality". Yet, she did agree that biologically there is different between those born with female and male parts. 

Parts of her research involves a theoretical orientation of a multidimensional approach to gender and discusses more in depth in her book ''Women and Economics''. Due to gender roles she believes that women pretend to live a certain life to avoid achieving their full potential living the role of a housewife. This is an example of falling under [[False consciousness|false consciousness]] instead of "true" consciousness. Leading the belief that women are viewed as property towards their husbands because despite their own work they may do; economically women were still dependent on husbands to provide financial support to themselves and their family. She also stated that the traditional division of labor was not biologically driven , but instead pushed upon based structure of how society was established since before the 19th century. 

In the end Gilman describes it as ''sociobiological'' tragedy because women are disregarded as being part of the ideology of "survival of the fittest". Instead females are thought to be soft and weak individuals that are only good for productive reasons. Females are depicted as emotional and frail human beings who are born to serve their husbands, children, and family without living for herself. Gilman's research was conducted during a time where women being a sociologist were unheard of; she lived during a time that women couldn't even vote. Her research helps create a ripple effect along with other female sociologists that help paved wave for feminism, feminist, and concepts to correlate with feminist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociological Theory in the Classical Era|last=Edles|first=Laura|last2=Appelrouth|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-7564-3|location=|pages=9,222-255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism

[[Heterosexism]] is a system of attitudes, bias, and [[discrimination]] in favour of male-female [[sexuality]] and relationships.
Heterosexism describes a set of [[paradigms]] and institutionalized beliefs that systematically disadvantage anyone other than heterosexual, which can stem from personal beliefs, societal institutions and or a country's government. For example, heterosexual [[marriage]] has been or is the only lawful union between two people that was or is fully recognized and subsequently given full benefits in many countries. This has acted to greatly disadvantage people in same-sex relationships within society as compared with those in different-sex relationships.

==Feminism and race==
Women who suffer from oppression due to race may find themselves in a [[double bind]]. The relationship between feminism and race was largely overlooked until the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminists]] produced greater literature on the topic of '[[black feminism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mahony, Pat, and Christine Zmroczek. Class matters: 'working-class' women's perspectives on social class. London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Julia Cooper]] and [[Ida Bell Wells-Barnett]] are African American women who were instrumental in conducting much research and making valuable contributions in the field of black feminism.  "Cooper and Wells-Barnett both consciously drew on their lived experiences as African American women to develop a "systematic consciousness of society and social relations."  As such, these women foreshadow the development of a feminist sociological theory based in the interests of women of colour."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer George and Goodman Douglas (2004) Classical Sociological Theory, Fourth Ed.  p.294&lt;/ref&gt;

An instrumental contribution to the field was [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]]'s seminal 1989 paper, "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex:A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics" (Crenshaw 1989)&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K. 1989. "Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics". University of Chicago Legal Forum: Vol. 1989: Iss. 1, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt;. In it she outlines the manner in which black women have been erased from feminist pedagogy. Black women must be understood as having multiple identities that intersect and reinforce one another, the two key experiences of being black and of being women. Furthermore, black women suffer on both racist and sexist fronts, marginalized not only by larger systems of oppression but by existing feminist discourse that disregards their [[intersectionality]]. Crenshaw's work is integral to understanding feminist sociology, as it advocated for black feminist thought and set the building blocks for future feminist sociologists such as [[Patricia Hill Collins]]. 

==Feminism and queer theory==
Modern queer theory attempts to unmake the social and contextual elements reinforcing [[heteronormativity]] by challenging oppressive institutions on traditional binary distinctions between male and female, among its many other criticisms. In this regard, feminism and queer theory address the same ways social structures violently categorize and erase women and LGBTQIA+ from the social narrative. However, sociological feminism often reinforces the gender binary through the research process "as the gendered subject is made the object of the study" (McCann 2016, 229). In her recent work "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology"&lt;ref&gt;McCann, H. 2016. "Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology". WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly, Volume 44, Numbers 3 &amp; 4, Fall/Winter 2016, pp. 224-243.&lt;/ref&gt;, McCann confronts the theoretical perspective and methodology of feminist sociology:"[the subject] rarely reflects the fluid, unstable, and dynamic realities of bodies and experiences. To “settle” on a subject category, then, is to reinscribe a fixity that excludes some, often in violent ways (for example, those who are literally erased because their bodies do not conform to a discrete binary)" (McCann 2016, 231-232). There can be a refashioning of the field, where extending boundaries to include queer theory would "develop new and innovative theoretical approaches to research...[and] address inequality within society" (McCann 2016, 237). 

==Feminist critiques of multiculturalism==
Debates within [[ethnic relations]], particularly regarding the opposing perspectives of [[assimilationism]] and [[multiculturalism]], have led to the accusation that feminism is incompatible with multiculturalist policy. The remit of multiculturalism is to allow distinct cultures to reside in Western societies, or separate societies in general, and one possible consequence is that certain religious or traditional practices may negate Western feminist ideals. Central debates include the topics of [[arranged marriage]] and [[female genital mutilation]]. Others have argued that these debates stem from Western [[orientalism]] and general political reluctance to accept foreign migrants.

The '''Four Dharmadhatu''' (Chinese: 四法界), is a philosophical concept propagated by Master [[Dushun|Tu-shun]] (Chinese: 杜順; 557-640 CE),&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu". Source: [http://218.189.203.50/glossary/word_eng.php?word_id=168] (accessed: January 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[Huayan school|Hua-yan]] (Chinese: 華嚴) school. It builds upon and is a variant of the [[Dharmadhatu]] doctrine.   

==The Four Dharmadhatu==
The Four Dharmadhatu were outlined in Tu-shun's treatise which has been rendered into English as 'On the Meditation of Dharmadhātu'. The Four Dharmadhatu are:

*The Dharmadhātu of 'Shih' (Chinese: 事法界; "shi fajie"). 'Shih' is a rendering of the character 事 which holds the [[semantic field]]: "matter", "phenomenon", "event". It may be understood as the  'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) of all matters and phenomena. 
*The Dharmadhātu of 'Li'(Chinese: 理法界; "li fajie"). 'Li' is a rendering of the character 理 which holds the semantic field:  "principle", "law", "[[noumenon]]". This 'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) may be understood as that of principles. It has been referred to as "the realm of the one principle". The "one principle" being qualified as [[śūnyatā]] (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu". Source: [http://218.189.203.50/glossary/word_eng.php?word_id=885] (accessed: January 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Dharmadhātu of Non-obstruction of 'Li' against 'Shih' (Chinese: 理事無礙法界; "lishi wuai fajie"). This 'realm' (Sanskrit: dhātu) has been rendered into English as "the realm of non-obstruction between principle and phenomena".&lt;ref&gt;Samanta Buddhist Glossary (2006). "Four Dharmadhātu". Source: [http://218.189.203.50/glossary/word_eng.php?word_id=885] (accessed: January 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Dharmadhātu of the Non-obstruction of 'Shih' and 'Shih' (Chinese: 事事無礙法界; "shishi wuai fajie").

In mathematics, a '''fractal''' is a detailed, recursive, and infinitely self-similar mathematical set whose [[Hausdorff dimension]] strictly exceeds its [[topological dimension]]. Fractals are encountered ubiquitously in nature due to their tendency to appear nearly the same at different levels, as is illustrated here in the successively small magnifications of the [[Mandelbrot set]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patterns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek"/&gt; Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly small scales,&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''expanding symmetry''' or '''unfolding symmetry'''; If this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the [[Menger sponge]],&lt;ref name="Gouyet" /&gt; it is called a [[self-similar]] pattern.

One way that fractals are different from finite [[geometric figures]] is the way in which they [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. Doubling the edge lengths of a [[polygon]] multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its [[volume]] scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an [[integer]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît B. |title=The fractal geometry of nature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC |year=1983 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-7167-1186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's [[topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"&gt;{{cite book | last=Mandelbrot | first=Benoît B. | title=Fractals and Chaos| publisher=Springer | location=Berlin | year=2004 |isbn=978-0-387-20158-0 | quote=A fractal set is one for which the fractal (Hausdorff-Besicovitch) dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mathematical equations, fractals are usually nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line - although it is still [[topological dimension|1-dimensional]] its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;

The mathematical [[#history|roots]] of fractals have been traced throughout the years as a formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of [[recursion]], then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment of the concept to the study of [[Continuous function|continuous]] but not [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=S. L.|title=Riemann's example of a continuous 'nondifferentiable' function continued|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|date=June 1978|volume=1|issue=2|pages=81–82|doi=10.1007/BF03023065}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on to the coining of the word ''[[wikt:fractal|fractal]]'' in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin ''[[wikt:fractus#Latin|frāctus]]'' meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional [[fractal dimension|dimensions]] to geometric [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematical people : profiles and interviews|last1=Albers|first1=Donald J.|last2=Alexanderson|first2=Gerald L.|publisher=AK Peters|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56881-340-0|location=Wellesley, MA|page=214|chapter=Benoît Mandelbrot: In his own words|author2-link=Gerald L. Alexanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandelbrot|first=Benoit|title=24/7 Lecture on Fractals|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7HB5Oze4g#t=70|work=2006 Ig Nobel Awards|publisher=Improbable Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot stated that "A fractal is by definition a set for which the [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension]] strictly exceeds the [[topological dimension]]."&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot, B.B.: The Fractal Geometry of Nature. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1982); p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jens Feder|title=Fractals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgvyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4899-2124-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language: "...to use ''fractal'' without a pedantic definition, to use ''[[fractal dimension]]'' as a generic term applicable to ''all'' the variants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald Edgar|title=Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk2vruTv0_gC&amp;pg=PR7|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-74749-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Simple Fractals.png|thumb|right| A simple fractal tree created through javascript]]
The word "fractal" often has different connotations for laymen as opposed to mathematicians, where the layman is more likely to be familiar with [[fractal art]] than the mathematical concept. The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.

The feature of "self-similarity", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|166; 18}}&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt;

This idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].

This also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are "nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] pondered [[recursion|recursive]] [[self-similarity]] (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the [[straight line]] was self-similar in this sense).&lt;ref name="Pickover"&gt;{{cite book |page=310 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=fractal+koch+curve+book#v=onepage&amp;q=fractal%20koch%20curve%20book&amp;f=false |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover

One of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincaré and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch snowflake]].&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wacław Sierpiński]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]]. By 1918, two French mathematicians, [[Pierre Fatou]] and [[Gaston Julia]], though working independently, arrived essentially simultaneously at results describing what are now seen as fractal behaviour associated with mapping [[complex numbers]] and iterative functions and leading to further ideas about [[strange attractors|attractors and repellors]] (i.e., points that attract or repel other points), which have become very important in the study of fractals.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref name="classics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; Very shortly after that work was submitted, by March 1918, [[Felix Hausdorff]] expanded the definition of "dimension", significantly for the evolution of the definition of fractals, to allow for sets to have noninteger dimensions.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; The idea of self-similar curves was taken further by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]], who, in his 1938 paper ''Plane or Space Curves and Surfaces Consisting of Parts Similar to the Whole'' described a new fractal curve, the [[Lévy C curve]].&lt;ref group="notes" name="levy note" /&gt;

Different researchers have postulated that without the aid of modern computer graphics, early investigators were limited to what they could depict in manual drawings, so lacked the means to visualize the beauty and appreciate some of the implications of many of the patterns they had discovered (the Julia set, for instance, could only be visualized through a few iterations as very simple drawings).&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|179}}&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gordon

== Characteristics ==
One often cited description that Mandelbrot published to describe geometric fractals is "a rough or fragmented [[Shape|geometric shape]] that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole";&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt; this is generally helpful but limited. Authors disagree on the exact definition of ''fractal'', but most usually elaborate on the basic ideas of self-similarity and an unusual relationship with the space a fractal is embedded in.&lt;ref name="Gouyet"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gouyet | first=Jean-François | title=Physics and fractal structures | publisher=Masson Springer | location=Paris/New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-387-94153-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Falconer"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Falconer | first=Kenneth | title=Fractal Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2003 | pages=xxv | isbn= 978-0-470-84862-3 | nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Edgar | first=Gerald | title=Measure, topology, and fractal geometry | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-74748-4 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s, but whereas these numbers quantify [[complexity]] (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karperien |first=Audrey |title=Defining microglial morphology: Form, Function, and Fractal Dimension |publisher=Charles Sturt University |year= 2004 |doi=10.13140/2.1.2815.9048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal", he did so to denote an object whose [[Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension]] is greater than its [[Lebesgue covering dimension|topological dimension]].&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote" /&gt; It has been noted that this dimensional requirement is not met by fractal [[space-filling curve]]s such as the [[Hilbert curve]].&lt;ref group=notes name="space filling note" /&gt;

According to Falconer, rather than being strictly defined, fractals should, in addition to being nowhere differentiable and able to have a [[fractal dimension]], be generally characterized by a [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] of the following features;&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;

* Self-similarity, which may be manifested as:
:* Exact self-similarity: identical at all scales; e.g. [[#koch|Koch snowflake]]
:* Quasi self-similarity: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the [[Mandelbrot set]]'s satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
:* Statistical self-similarity: repeats a pattern [[stochastic]]ally so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., [[#random|randomly generated fractals]]; the well-known example of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|coastline of Britain]], for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines, for example, the Koch snowflake&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;
:* Qualitative self-similarity: as in a time series&lt;ref name="time series"&gt;{{cite book | last=Peters | first=Edgar | title=Chaos and order in the capital markets : a new view of cycles, prices, and market volatility | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-471-13938-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Multifractal]] scaling: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule
* Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have [[emergent properties]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John |last1=Spencer |first2=Michael S. C. |last2=Thomas |first3=James L. |last3=McClelland |title=Toward a unified theory of development : connectionism and dynamic systems theory re-considered |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford/New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-530059-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (related to the next criterion in this list).
* Irregularity locally and globally that is not easily described in traditional [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] language. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as "smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls".&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos" /&gt;
* Simple and "perhaps [[recursion|recursive]]" definitions ''see [[#algorithms|Common techniques for generating fractals]]''

As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, is easily described in Euclidean language, has the same [[Hausdorff dimension]] as [[topological dimension]], and is fully defined without a need for recursion.&lt;ref name ="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt;

== Simulated fractals ==
[[File:Apophysis-100303-104.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fractal flame]]]]
Fractal patterns have been modeled extensively, albeit within a range of scales rather than infinitely, owing to the practical limits of physical time and space. Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being "fractals" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties. Also, these may include calculation or display [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] which are not characteristics of true fractals.

Modeled fractals may be sounds,&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; digital images, electrochemical patterns, [[circadian rhythm]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fathallah-Shaykh | first1=Hassan M. | title=Fractal Dimension of the Drosophila Circadian Clock | doi=10.1142/S0218348X11005476 | journal=Fractals | volume=19 | issue=4 | pages=423–430 | year=2011 | pmid= | pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Similarly, random fractals have been used to describe/create many highly irregular real-world objects. A limitation of modeling fractals is that resemblance of a fractal model to a natural phenomenon does not prove that the phenomenon being modeled is formed by a process similar to the modeling algorithms.

[[Decalcomania]], a technique used by artists such as [[Max Ernst]], can produce fractal-like patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Frame, Michael; and Mandelbrot, Benoît B.; [http://classes.yale.edu/Fractals/Panorama/ ''A Panorama of Fractals and Their Uses'']&lt;/ref&gt; It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.

Cyberneticist [[Ron Eglash]] has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in [[African art]], games, [[divination]], trade, and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.&lt;ref name="African art"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpi.edu/~eglash/eglash.dir/afractal/afractal.htm |first=Ron |last=Eglash |title=African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design |location=New Brunswick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1999 |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Bryn; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/02/23/MN36684.DTL ''Sophisticated Mathematics Behind African Village Designs Fractal patterns use repetition on large, small scale''], San Francisco Chronicle, Wednesday, February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hokky Situngkir]] also suggested the similar properties in Indonesian traditional art, [[batik]], and [[ornament (art)|ornaments]] found in traditional houses.&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, Hokky; Dahlan, Rolan (2009).

In a 1996 interview with [[Michael Silverblatt]], [[David Foster Wallace]] admitted that the structure of the first draft of ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the [[Sierpinski triangle]] (a.k.a. Sierpinski gasket), but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw/bw960411david_foster_wallace |first=David Foster |last=Wallace |title=Bookworm on KCRW |publisher=Kcrw.com |accessdate=2010-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a circle boundary is drawn around the two-dimensional view of a fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, this is due to the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fractal.org/Bewustzijns-Besturings-Model/Fractals-Useful-Beauty.htm|title=Introduction to Fractal Geometry|website=www.fractal.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of [[ion propulsion]], when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs21grc.html|title=NASA – Ion Propulsion|last=DeFelice|first=David|date=August 18, 2015|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''functional flow block diagram''' ('''FFBD''') is a multi-tier, time-sequenced, step-by-step flow diagram of a [[system]]’s functional flow.&lt;ref&gt;The first version of this article is completely based on the [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "functional" in this context is different from its use in [[functional programming]] or in mathematics, where pairing "functional" with "flow" would be ambiguous. Here, "functional flow" pertains to the sequencing of operations, with "flow" arrows expressing  dependence on the success of prior operations. FFBDs may also express input and output data dependencies between functional blocks, as shown in figures below, but FFBDs primarily focus on sequencing.

The FFBD notation was developed in the 1950s, and is widely used in classical [[systems engineering]]. FFBDs are one of the classic [[business process modeling]] methodologies, along with [[flow chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, [[control flow diagram]]s, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT]] diagrams, and [[IDEF]].&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt;Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=December 20, 2006 }}. INFS 770 Methods for Information Systems Engineering:  Knowledge Management and E-Business. Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

FFBDs are also referred to as ''Functional Flow Diagrams'', ''functional block diagrams'', and ''functional flows''.&lt;ref name="FAA08"/&gt;

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the [[flow process chart]], was introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.&lt;ref name="BBG02"&gt;Ben B. Graham (2004). [http://www.detail-process-charting.com/chapter1.htm "Detail Process Charting: Speaking the Language of Process".] p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula.

In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began training business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  Another 1944 graduate, [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set as the ASME Standard for Operation and Flow Process Charts, derived from Gilbreth's original work.&lt;ref name="BBG02"/&gt;

The modern Functional Flow Block Diagram was developed by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Incorporated, a defense-related business, in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weilkiens (2008). ''Systems Engineering with SysML/UML: Modeling, Analysis, Design''. Page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was exploited by [[NASA]] to visualize the time sequence of events in space systems and flight missions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Chestnut]] (1967). ''Systems Engineering Methods''. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; FFBDs became widely used in classical [[systems engineering]] to show the order of execution of system functions.&lt;ref name="TD03"/&gt;

== Development of functional flow block diagrams ==
[[Image:Development of Functional Flow Block Diagrams.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Figure 2: Development of Functional Flow Block Diagrams&lt;ref name="NASA07"&gt;NASA (2007). ''[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf NASA Systems Engineering Handbook]'' December 2007. p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
FFBDs can be developed in a series of levels. FFBDs show the same tasks identified through functional decomposition and display them in their logical, sequential relationship. For example, the entire [[flight mission]] of a [[spacecraft]] can be defined in a top level FFBD, as shown in Figure 2. Each block in the first level diagram can then be expanded to a series of functions, as shown in the second level diagram for "perform mission operations." Note that the diagram shows both input (transfer to operational orbit) and output (transfer to space transportation system orbit), thus initiating the interface identification and control process. Each block in the second level diagram can be progressively developed into a series of functions, as shown in the third level diagram on Figure 2.&lt;ref name="NASA07"/&gt;

These diagrams are used both to develop requirements and to identify profitable trade studies. For example, does the spacecraft antenna acquire the tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) only when the payload data are to be transmitted, or does it track TDRS continually to allow for the reception of emergency commands or transmission of emergency data? The FFBD also incorporates alternate and contingency operations, which improve the probability of mission success. The flow diagram provides an understanding of total operation of the system, serves as a basis for development of operational and contingency procedures, and pinpoints areas where changes in operational procedures could simplify the overall system operation.  In certain cases, alternate FFBDs may be used to represent various means of satisfying a particular function until data are acquired, which permits selection among the alternatives.&lt;ref name="NASA07"/&gt;

== Building blocks ==

=== Key attributes ===
An overview of the key FFBD attributes:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt; 
[[Image:Function block.jpg|thumb|320px|Graphical explanation of a "function block" used in these diagrams.  Flow is from left to right.&lt;ref name="FAA08"&gt;[http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/Usability/u17_tools2.htm Task Analysis Tools Used Throughout Development]. FAA 2008. Retrieved 25 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
* ''Function block'': Each function on an FFBD should be separate and be represented by single box (solid line). Each function needs to stand for definite, finite, discrete action to be accomplished by system elements.
* ''Function numbering'': Each level should have a consistent number scheme and provide information concerning function origin. These numbers establish identification and relationships that will carry through all Functional Analysis and Allocation activities and facilitate traceability from lower to top levels.
* ''Functional reference'': Each diagram should contain a reference to other functional diagrams by using a functional reference (box in brackets).
* ''Flow connection'': Lines connecting functions should only indicate function flow and not a lapse in time or intermediate activity. 
* ''Flow direction'': Diagrams should be laid out so that the flow direction is generally from left to right. Arrows are often used to indicate functional flows. 
* ''Summing gates'': A circle is used to denote a summing gate and is used when AND/OR is present. AND is used to indicate parallel functions and all conditions must be satisfied to proceed. OR is used to indicate that alternative paths can be satisfied to proceed.
* ''GO and NO-GO paths'': “G” and “bar G” are used to denote “go” and “no-go” conditions. These symbols are placed adjacent to lines leaving a particular function to indicate alternative paths.

=== Function symbolism ===
A function shall be represented by a rectangle containing the title of the function (an action verb followed by a noun phrase) and its unique decimal delimited number. A horizontal line shall separate this number and the title, as shown in see Figure 3 above. The figure also depicts how to represent a reference function, which provides context within a specific FFBD. See Figure 9 for an example regarding use of a reference function.&lt;ref name="FAA06"&gt;FAA (2006). [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

=== Directed lines ===
A line with a single arrowhead shall depict functional flow from left to right, see Figure 4.&lt;ref name="FAA06"/&gt;

=== Logic symbols ===
The following basic logic symbols shall be used.&lt;ref name="FAA06"/&gt;

* AND: A condition in which all preceding or succeeding paths are required. The symbol may contain a single input with multiple outputs or multiple inputs with a single output, but not multiple inputs and outputs combined (Figure 5). Read the figure as follows: F2 AND F3 may begin in parallel after completion of F1. Likewise, F4 may begin after completion of F2 AND F3.

{| class="vatop" style="width:100%;"
|[[Image:5 AND Symbol.jpg|thumb|center|360px|Figure 5. "AND" Symbol]] 
|[[Image:6 Exclusive OR Symbol.jpg|thumb|center|360px|Figure 6. "Exclusive OR" Symbol]] 
|}

* Exclusive OR: A condition in which one of multiple preceding or succeeding paths is required, but not all. The symbol may contain a single input with multiple outputs or multiple inputs with single output, but not multiple inputs and outputs combined (Figure 6). Read the figure as follows: F2 OR F3 may begin after completion of F1. Likewise, F4 may begin after completion of either F2 OR F3.
* Inclusive OR: A condition in which one, some, or all of the multiple preceding or succeeding paths are required. Figure 7 depicts Inclusive OR logic using a combination of the AND symbol (Figure 5) and the Exclusive OR symbol (Figure 6). Read Figure 7 as follows: F2 OR F3 (exclusively) may begin after completion of F1, OR (again exclusive) F2 AND F3 may begin after completion of F1. Likewise, F4 may begin after completion of either F2 OR F3 (exclusively), OR (again exclusive) F4 may begin after completion of both F2 AND F3

[[Image:7 Inclusive OR Logic.png|thumb|center|360px|Figure 7. “Inclusive OR” Logic]]

=== Contextual and administrative data ===
Each FFBD shall contain the following contextual and administrative data:&lt;ref name="FAA06"/&gt;
* Date the diagram was created
* Name of the engineer, organization, or working group that created the diagram
* Unique decimal delimited number of the function being diagrammed
* Unique function name of the function being diagrammed.
Figure 8 and Figure 9 present the data in an FFBD. Figure 9 is a decomposition of the function F2 contained in Figure 8 and illustrates the context between functions at different levels of the model.

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''geothermal heat pump''' or '''ground source heat pump''' (GSHP) is a [[central heating]] and/or cooling system that transfers heat to or from the ground.

It uses the earth all the time, without any [[intermittent energy source|intermittency]], as a heat source (in the winter) or a [[heat sink]] (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, and may be combined with [[solar heating]] to form a [[geosolar]] system with even greater efficiency. They are also known by other names, including '''geoexchange, earth-coupled, earth energy''' systems. The engineering and scientific communities prefer the terms "''geoexchange''" or "''ground source heat pumps''" to avoid confusion with traditional [[geothermal power]], which uses a high temperature heat source to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt; Ground source heat pumps harvest heat absorbed at the Earth's surface from solar energy. The temperature in the ground below {{convert|6|m}} is roughly equal to the mean annual air temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/Mean_Annual_Air_Temperature.html|title=Mean Annual Air Temperature – MATT – Ground temperature – Renewable Energy – Interseasonal Heat Transfer – Solar Thermal Collectors – Ground Source Heat Pumps – Renewable Cooling|author=|date=|website=www.icax.co.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that latitude at the surface.

Depending on latitude, the temperature beneath the upper {{convert|6|m}} of Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 10 and 16&amp;nbsp;°C (50 and 60&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Geothermal Basics |publisher=US Department of Energy |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004020606/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/geothermal_basics.html |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; if the temperature is undisturbed by the presence of a heat pump. Like a refrigerator or air conditioner, these systems use a [[heat pump]] to force the transfer of heat from the ground. Heat pumps can transfer heat from a cool space to a warm space, against the natural direction of flow, or they can enhance the natural flow of heat from a warm area to a cool one. The core of the heat pump is a loop of refrigerant pumped through a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle that moves heat. [[Air-source heat pumps]] are typically more efficient at heating than pure electric heaters, even when extracting heat from cold winter air, although efficiencies begin dropping significantly as outside air temperatures drop below 5&amp;nbsp;°C (41&amp;nbsp;°F). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} A ground source heat pump exchanges heat with the ground. This is much more energy-efficient because underground temperatures are more stable than air temperatures through the year.

==Differing terms and definitions==
[[File:Geothermal Systems.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ground source heating and cooling]]
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Some confusion exists with regard to the terminology of heat pumps and the use of the term "''geothermal''". "''Geothermal''" derives from the Greek and means "''Earth heat''" – which geologists and many laymen understand as describing hot rocks, volcanic activity or heat derived from deep within the earth. Though some confusion arises when the term "''geothermal''" is also used to apply to temperatures within the first 100 metres of the surface, this is "''Earth heat''" all the same, though it is largely influenced by stored energy from the sun.

==History==
The heat pump was described by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1853 and developed by [[Peter Ritter von Rittinger]] in 1855. After experimenting with a freezer, Robert C. Webber built the first direct exchange ground-source heat pump in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/about/about_us.htm|title=History |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=About Us |publisher=International Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful commercial project was installed in the [[Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon)]] in 1948, and has been designated a [[National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by [[ASME]].&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; The technology became popular in Sweden in the 1970s, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. Open loop systems dominated the market until the development of [[polybutylene]] pipe in 1979 made closed loop systems economically viable.&lt;ref name="bloomquist" /&gt; As of 2004, there are over a million units installed worldwide providing 12&amp;nbsp;GW of thermal capacity.&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 =Lund | first1 =J. | last2 =Sanner | first2 =B. | last3 =Rybach | first3 =L. | last4 =Curtis | first4 =R. | last5 =Hellström | first5 =G. |date = September 2004| title =Geothermal (Ground Source) Heat Pumps, A World Overview | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =25 | issue =3 | pages =1–10 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull25-3/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}

==Ground heat exchanger==
{{see also|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}
[[Image:Pond Loop Close Up.jpg|thumb|right|Loop field for a 12-ton system (unusually large for most residential applications)]]

Heat pumps provide winter heating by extracting heat from a source and transferring it into a building. Heat can be extracted from any source, no matter how cold, but a warmer source allows higher efficiency. A ground source heat pump uses the top layer of the earth's crust as a source of heat, thus taking advantage of its seasonally moderated temperature.

In the summer, the process can be reversed so the heat pump extracts heat from the building and transfers it to the ground. Transferring heat to a cooler space takes less energy, so the cooling efficiency of the heat pump gains benefits from the lower ground temperature.

Ground source heat pumps employ a [[heat exchanger]] in contact with the ground or groundwater to extract or dissipate heat. This component accounts for anywhere from a fifth to half of the total system cost, and would be the most cumbersome part to repair or replace. Correctly sizing this component is necessary to assure long-term performance: the energy efficiency of the system improves with roughly 4% for every degree Celsius that is won through correct sizing, and the underground temperature balance must be maintained through proper design of the whole system. Incorrect design can result in the system freezing after a number of years or very inefficient system performance; thus accurate system design is critical to a successful system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonzeroco.com/ground-source-heat-pumps/ground-source-heating-cooling/|title=GSHC Viability and Design – Carbon Zero Consulting|author=|date=|website=carbonzeroco.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shallow {{Convert|3-8|foot|m|adj = on}} horizontal heat exchangers experience seasonal temperature cycles due to solar gains and transmission losses to ambient air at ground level. These temperature cycles lag behind the seasons because of thermal inertia, so the heat exchanger will harvest heat deposited by the sun several months earlier, while being weighed down in late winter and spring, due to accumulated winter cold. Deep vertical systems {{Convert|100-500|feet|m}} deep rely on migration of heat from surrounding geology, unless they are recharged annually by solar recharge of the ground or exhaust heat from air conditioning systems.

Several major design options are available for these, which are classified by fluid and layout. Direct exchange systems circulate refrigerant underground, closed loop systems use a mixture of anti-freeze and water, and open loop systems use natural groundwater.

===Direct exchange (DX)===
{{Main article|Direct exchange geothermal heat pump}}
The [[direct exchange geothermal heat pump]] (DX) is the oldest type of geothermal heat pump technology. The ground-coupling is achieved through a single loop, circulating refrigerant, in direct thermal contact with the ground (as opposed to a combination of a refrigerant loop and a water loop). The [[refrigerant]] leaves the heat pump cabinet, circulates through a loop of copper tube buried underground, and exchanges heat with the ground before returning to the pump. The name "direct exchange" refers to heat transfer between the refrigerant loop and the ground without the use of an intermediate fluid. There is no direct interaction between the fluid and the earth; only heat transfer through the pipe wall. Direct exchange heat pumps are not to be confused with "water-source heat pumps" or "water loop heat pumps" since there is no water in the ground loop. [http://www.ashrae.org/standards-research--technology/ ASHRAE] defines the term ground-coupled heat pump to encompass closed loop and direct exchange systems, while excluding open loops.
[[File:DX system in a house.jpg|thumb|Direct exchange geothermal system]]
Direct exchange systems are more efficient and have potentially lower installation costs than closed loop water systems. Copper's high [[thermal conductivity]] contributes to the higher efficiency of the system, but heat flow is predominantly limited by the thermal conductivity of the ground, not the pipe. The main reasons for the higher efficiency are the elimination of the water pump (which uses electricity), the elimination of the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (which is a source of heat losses), and most importantly, the latent heat phase change of the refrigerant in the ground itself.

However, in case of leakage there is virtually no risk of contaminating the ground or the ground water. Contrary to water-source geothermal systems, direct exchange systems do not contain antifreeze. So, in case of a refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant currently used in most systems – R-410A – would immediately vaporize and seek the atmosphere. This is due to the low boiling point of R-410A: {{convert|-51|C|F}}.  R-410A refrigerant replaces larger volumes of antifreeze mixtures used in water-source geothermal systems and presents no threat to aquifers or to the ground itself.

While they require more refrigerant and their tubing is more expensive per foot, a direct exchange earth loop is shorter than a closed water loop for a given capacity. A direct exchange system requires only 15 to 40% of the length of tubing and half the diameter of drilled holes, and the drilling or excavation costs are therefore lower. Refrigerant loops are less tolerant of leaks than water loops because gas can leak out through smaller imperfections. This dictates the use of brazed copper tubing, even though the pressures are similar to water loops. The copper loop must be protected from corrosion in acidic soil through the use of a [[sacrificial anode]] or other [[cathodic protection]].

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted field monitoring of a direct geoexchange heat pump water heating system in a commercial application. The EPA reported that the system saved 75% of the electrical energy that would have been required by an electrical resistance water heating unit. According to the EPA, if the system is operated to capacity, it can avoid the emission of up to 7,100 pounds of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 15 pounds of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; each year per ton of compressor capacity (or 42,600&amp;nbsp;lbs. of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   and 90&amp;nbsp;lbs. of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; for a typical 6 ton system).&lt;ref name="EPAdoc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |title=Environmental Technology Verification Report |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080227091649/http://www.epa.gov/etv/pubs/600etv06063.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern climates, although the earth temperature is cooler, so is the incoming water temperature, which enables the high efficiency systems to replace more energy than would otherwise be required of electric or fossil fuel fired systems. Any temperature above {{convert|-40|C|F}} is sufficient to evaporate the refrigerant, and the direct exchange system can harvest energy through ice.

In extremely hot climates with dry soil, the addition of an auxiliary cooling module as a second condenser in line between the compressor and the earth loops increases efficiency and can further reduce the amount of earth loop to be installed.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Closed loop===
Most installed systems have two loops on the ground side: the primary refrigerant loop is contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary water loop that is buried underground. The secondary loop is typically made of [[high-density polyethylene]] pipe and contains a mixture of water and anti-freeze ([[propylene glycol]], [[denatured alcohol]] or [[methanol]]). Monopropylene glycol has the least damaging potential when it might leak into the ground, and is therefore the only allowed anti-freeze in ground sources in an increasing number of European countries. After leaving the internal heat exchanger, the water flows through the secondary loop outside the building to exchange heat with the ground before returning. The secondary loop is placed below the [[frost line]] where the temperature is more stable, or preferably submerged in a body of water if available. Systems in wet ground or in water are generally more efficient than drier ground loops since water conducts and stores heat better than solids in sand or soil. If the ground is naturally dry, soaker hoses may be buried with the ground loop to keep it wet.

[[Image:Pump Pack.jpg|thumb|right|An installed liquid pump pack]]
Closed loop systems need a heat exchanger between the refrigerant loop and the water loop, and pumps in both loops. Some manufacturers have a separate ground loop fluid pump pack, while some integrate the pumping and valving within the heat pump. Expansion tanks and pressure relief valves may be installed on the heated fluid side. Closed loop systems have lower efficiency than direct exchange systems, so they require longer and larger pipe to be placed in the ground, increasing excavation costs.

Closed loop tubing can be installed horizontally as a loop field in trenches or vertically as a series of long U-shapes in wells (see below). The size of the loop field depends on the soil type and moisture content, the average ground temperature and the heat loss and or gain characteristics of the building being conditioned. A rough approximation of the initial soil temperature is the average daily temperature for the region.

====Vertical====
[[File:Geothermal drilling for residential heating.jpg|thumb|Drilling of a borehole for residential heating]]
A vertical closed loop field is composed of pipes that run vertically in the ground. A hole is bored in the ground, typically {{convert|50|to(-)|400|ft}} deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector at the bottom of the hole. The [[borehole]] is commonly filled with a [[bentonite]] [[grout]] surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the [[heat transfer]]. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents [[artesian wells]] from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. Bore holes are spaced at least 5–6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three boreholes {{convert|80|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers" /&gt; (A ton of heat is 12,000 [[British thermal unit]]s per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 [[kilowatt]]s.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed through sample bore holes as well as other tests.

====Horizontal====
[[Image:3-ton Slinky Loop.jpg|thumb|right|A three-ton slinky loop prior to being covered with soil. The three slinky loops are running out horizontally with three straight lines returning the end of the slinky coil to the heat pump.]]
A horizontal closed loop field is composed of pipes that run horizontally in the ground. A long horizontal [[trench]], deeper than the [[frost line]], is dug and U-shaped or slinky coils are placed horizontally inside the same trench. Excavation for shallow horizontal loop fields is about half the cost of vertical drilling, so this is the most common layout used wherever there is adequate land available. For illustration, a detached house needing 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 [[ton#Refrigeration|ton]]) of heating capacity might need three loops {{convert|120|to|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} long of [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] 3/4 (DN&amp;nbsp;20) or NPS&amp;nbsp;1.25 (DN&amp;nbsp;32) polyethylene tubing at a depth of {{convert|1|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Chiasson1999&gt;{{Cite journal | title =  Advances in modeling of ground source heat pump systems | url = http://www.solis.pl/index.php/content/download/375/1291/file/GROUND%20SOURCE%20HEAT.pdf | year = 1999 | author = Chiasson, A.D. | publisher = Oklahoma State University

The depth at which the loops are placed significantly influences the energy consumption of the heat pump in two opposite ways: shallow loops tend to indirectly absorb more heat from the sun, which is helpful, especially when the ground is still cold after a long winter. On the other hand, shallow loops are also cooled down much more readily by weather changes, especially during long cold winters, when heating demand peaks. Often, the second effect is much greater than the first one, leading to higher costs of operation for the more shallow ground loops. This problem can be reduced by increasing both the depth and the length of piping, thereby significantly increasing costs of installation. However, such expenses might be deemed feasible, as they may result in lower operating costs. Recent studies show that utilization of a non-homogeneous soil profile with a layer of low conductive material above the ground pipes can help mitigate the adverse effects of shallow pipe burial depth. The intermediate blanket with lower conductivity than the surrounding soil profile demonstrated the potential to increase the energy extraction rates from the ground to as high as 17% for a cold climate and about 5–6% for a relatively moderate climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rezaei | first1 = B. | last2 = Amir | first2 = Kolahdouz | last3 = Dargush | first3 = G.

A slinky (also called coiled) closed loop field is a type of horizontal closed loop where the pipes overlay each other (not a recommended method). The easiest way of picturing a slinky field is to imagine holding a [[slinky]] on the top and bottom with your hands and then moving your hands in opposite directions. A slinky loop field is used if there is not adequate room for a true horizontal system, but it still allows for an easy installation. Rather than using straight pipe, slinky coils use overlapped loops of piping laid out horizontally along the bottom of a wide trench. Depending on soil, climate and the heat pump's run fraction, slinky coil trenches can be up to two thirds shorter than traditional horizontal loop trenches. Slinky coil ground loops are essentially a more economical and space efficient version of a horizontal ground loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informedbuilding.com/Geothermal/Main16/Types-of-Geothermal-Ground-Loops/ |title=Geothermal Ground Loops |publisher=Informed Building |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radial or directional drilling====
As an alternative to trenching, loops may be laid by mini [[horizontal directional drilling]] (mini-HDD). This technique can lay piping under yards, driveways, gardens or other structures without disturbing them, with a cost between those of trenching and vertical drilling. This system also differs from horizontal &amp; vertical drilling as the loops are installed from one central chamber, further reducing the ground space needed. Radial drilling is often installed retroactively (after the property has been built) due to the small nature of the equipment used and the ability to bore beneath existing constructions.

====Pond====
[[Image:Pond Loop Being Sunk.jpg|thumb|right|12-ton pond loop system being sunk to the bottom of a pond]]
A closed pond loop is not common because it depends on proximity to a body of water, where an open loop system is usually preferable. A pond loop may be advantageous where poor water quality precludes an open loop, or where the system heat load is small. A pond loop consists of coils of pipe similar to a slinky loop attached to a frame and located at the bottom of an appropriately sized pond or water source.

===Open loop===
In an open loop system (also called a groundwater heat pump), the secondary loop pumps natural water from a well or body of water into a heat exchanger inside the heat pump. [[ASHRAE]] calls open loop systems ''groundwater heat pumps'' or ''surface water heat pumps'', depending on the source. Heat is either extracted or added by the primary refrigerant loop, and the water is returned to a separate [[injection well]], [[irrigation trench]], tile field or body of water. The supply and return lines must be placed far enough apart to ensure thermal recharge of the source. Since the water chemistry is not controlled, the appliance may need to be protected from corrosion by using different metals in the heat exchanger and pump. [[Limescale]] may [[fouling|foul]] the system over time and require periodic acid cleaning. This is much more of a problem with cooling systems than heating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hard water#Indices]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as fouling decreases the flow of natural water, it becomes difficult for the heat pump to exchange building heat with the groundwater. If the water contains high levels of salt, minerals, iron bacteria or hydrogen sulfide, a closed loop system is usually preferable.

[[Deep lake water cooling]] uses a similar process with an open loop for air conditioning and cooling. Open loop systems using ground water are usually more efficient than closed systems because they are better coupled with ground temperatures. Closed loop systems, in comparison, have to transfer heat across extra layers of pipe wall and dirt.

A growing number of jurisdictions have outlawed open-loop systems that drain to the surface because these may drain aquifers or contaminate wells. This forces the use of more environmentally sound injection wells or a closed loop system.

====Standing column well====
A standing column well system is a specialized type of open loop system. Water is drawn from the bottom of a deep rock well, passed through a heat pump, and returned to the top of the well, where traveling downwards it exchanges heat with the surrounding bedrock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Orio |first1=Carl D. |last2=Johnson |first2=Carl N. |last3=Rees |first3=Simon J. |last4=Chiasson |first4=A. |last5=Deng |first5=Zheng |last6=Spitler |first6=Jeffrey D. |year=2004 |title=A Survey of Standing Column Well Installations in North America |periodical=ASHRAE Transactions |publisher=ASHRAE |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=637–655 |url=http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |accessdate=2009-03-25 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626095818/http://www.hvac.okstate.edu/research/Documents/Orio_Johnson_Rees_Chiasson_Deng_Spitler_05.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of a standing column well system is often dictated where there is near-surface bedrock and limited surface area is available. A standing column is typically not suitable in locations where the geology is mostly clay, silt, or sand. If bedrock is deeper than {{convert|200|ft}} from the surface, the cost of casing to seal off the overburden may become prohibitive.

A multiple standing column well system can support a large structure in an urban or rural application. The standing column well method is also popular in residential and small commercial applications. There are many successful applications of varying sizes and well quantities in the many boroughs of New York City, and is also the most common application in the New England states. This type of ground source system has some heat storage benefits, where heat is rejected from the building and the temperature of the well is raised, within reason, during the summer cooling months which can then be harvested for heating in the winter months, thereby increasing the efficiency of the heat pump system. As with closed loop systems, sizing of the standing column system is critical in reference to the heat loss and gain of the existing building. As the heat exchange is actually with the bedrock, using water as the transfer medium, a large amount of production capacity (water flow from the well) is not required for a standing column system to work. However, if there is adequate water production, then the thermal capacity of the well system can be enhanced by discharging a small percentage of system flow during the peak Summer and Winter months.

Since this is essentially a water pumping system, standing column well design requires critical considerations to obtain peak operating efficiency. Should a standing column well design be misapplied, leaving out critical shut-off valves for example, the result could be an extreme loss in efficiency and thereby cause operational cost to be higher than anticipated.

==Building distribution==
[[Image:Water to Air Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|left|Liquid-to-air heat pump]]
The heat pump is the central unit that becomes the heating and cooling plant for the building. Some models may cover space heating, space cooling, (space heating via conditioned air, [[hydronic]] systems and / or [[radiant heating]] systems), domestic or pool water preheat (via the [[wikt:desuperheater|desuperheater]] function), demand hot water, and driveway ice melting all within one appliance with a variety of options with respect to controls, staging and zone control. The heat may be carried to its end use by circulating water or forced air. Almost all types of heat pumps are produced for commercial and residential applications.

''Liquid-to-air'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-air'') output forced air, and are most commonly used to replace legacy forced air furnaces and central air conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems. Heat pumps cannot achieve as high a fluid temperature as a conventional furnace, so they require a higher volume flow rate of air to compensate. When retrofitting a residence, the existing duct work may have to be enlarged to reduce the noise from the higher air flow.

[[Image:Water to Water Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid-to-water heat pump]]
''Liquid-to-water'' heat pumps (also called ''water-to-water'') are [[hydronic]] systems that use water to carry heating or cooling through the building. Systems such as radiant [[underfloor heating]], [[baseboard radiator]]s, [[wall radiator|conventional cast iron radiator]]s would use a liquid-to-water heat pump. These heat pumps are preferred for pool heating or domestic hot water pre-heat. Heat pumps can only heat water to about {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} efficiently, whereas a boiler normally reaches {{convert|65|–|95|C|F}}. Legacy radiators designed for these higher temperatures may have to be doubled in numbers when retrofitting a home. A hot water tank will still be needed to raise water temperatures above the heat pump's maximum, but pre-heating will save 25–50% of hot water costs.

Ground source heat pumps are especially well matched to underfloor heating and baseboard radiator systems which only require warm temperatures 40&amp;nbsp;°C (104&amp;nbsp;°F) to work well. Thus they are ideal for open plan offices. Using large surfaces such as floors, as opposed to radiators, distributes the heat more uniformly and allows for a lower water temperature. Wood or carpet floor coverings dampen this effect because the thermal transfer efficiency of these materials is lower than that of masonry floors (tile, concrete). Underfloor piping, ceiling or wall radiators can also be used for cooling in dry climates, although the temperature of the circulating water must be above the [[dew point]] to ensure that atmospheric humidity does not condense on the radiator.

Combination heat pumps are available that can produce forced air and circulating water simultaneously and individually. These systems are largely being used for houses that have a combination of air and liquid conditioning needs, for example central air conditioning and pool heating.

==Seasonal thermal storage==
[[Image:HeatAndColdStorageWithHeatPump.svg|thumb|right|A heat pump in combination with heat and cold storage]]
{{Main article|Seasonal thermal energy storage}}
The efficiency of ground source heat pumps can be greatly improved by using [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] and interseasonal heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/interseasonal_heat_transfer.html |title=Interseasonal Heat Transfer |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat captured and stored in thermal banks in the summer can be retrieved efficiently in the winter. Heat storage efficiency increases with scale, so this advantage is most significant in commercial or [[district heating]] systems.

[[Geosolar combisystem]]s have been used to heat and cool a greenhouse using an [[aquifer]] for thermal storage.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Passel|first1=Willy|last2=Sourbron|first2=Maarten|last3=Verplaetsen|first3=Filip |last4=Leroy|first4=Luc |last5=Somers|first5=Yvan |last6=Verheyden|first6=Johan |last7=Coupé|first7=Koen|editor=Organisatie voor Duurzame Energie Vlaanderen|title=Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming|url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-23|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer, the greenhouse is cooled with cold ground water. This heats the water in the aquifer which can become a warm source for heating in winter.&lt;ref name=vlaanderen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonneterp.nl/english/index_uk.html |title=Schematic of similar system of aquifers with fans-regulation |publisher=Zonneterp.nl |date=2005-11-11 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of cold and heat storage with heat pumps can be combined with water/humidity regulation. These principles are used to provide [[renewable heat]] and renewable cooling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icax.co.uk/renewable_cooling.html |title=Capture, storage and release of Renewable Cooling |publisher=Icax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to all kinds of buildings.

Also the efficiency of existing small heat pump installations can be improved by adding large, cheap, water filled solar collectors. These may be integrated into a to-be-overhauled parking lot, or in walls or roof constructions by installing one-inch [[Polyethylene|PE]] pipes into the outer layer.

==Thermal efficiency==
{{Main article|Thermal efficiency}}
The net [[thermal efficiency]] of a heat pump should take into account the efficiency of electricity generation and transmission, typically about 30%.&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;  Since a heat pump moves three to five times more heat energy than the electric energy it consumes, the total energy output is much greater than the electrical input. This results in net thermal efficiencies greater than 300% as compared to radiant electric heat being 100% efficient. Traditional combustion furnaces and [[electric heater]]s can never exceed 100% efficiency.

Geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption— and corresponding air pollution emissions—up to 44% compared to air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared to electric resistance heating with standard air-conditioning equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy98/24782.pdf Geothermal Heat Pumps]. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dependence of net thermal efficiency on the electricity infrastructure tends to be an unnecessary complication for consumers and is not applicable to hydroelectric power, so performance of heat pumps is usually expressed as the ratio of heating output or heat removal to electricity input. Cooling performance is typically expressed in units of BTU/hr/watt as the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio|energy efficiency ratio]] (EER), while heating performance is typically reduced to dimensionless units as the [[Coefficient of Performance|coefficient of performance]] (COP). The conversion factor is 3.41 BTU/hr/watt. Performance is influenced by all components of the installed system, including the soil conditions, the ground-coupled heat exchanger, the heat pump appliance, and the building distribution, but is largely determined by the "lift" between the input temperature and the output temperature.

For the sake of comparing heat pump appliances to each other, independently from other system components, a few standard test conditions have been established by the [[American Refrigerant Institute]] (ARI) and more recently by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]. Standard ARI 330 ratings were intended for closed loop ground-source heat pumps, and assume secondary loop water temperatures of {{convert|25|C|F}} for air conditioning and {{convert|0|C|F}} for heating. These temperatures are typical of installations in the northern US. Standard ARI 325 ratings were intended for open loop ground-source heat pumps, and include two sets of ratings for groundwater temperatures of {{convert|10|C|F}} and {{convert|21|C|F}}. ARI 325 budgets more electricity for water pumping than ARI 330. Neither of these standards attempt to account for seasonal variations. Standard ARI 870 ratings are intended for direct exchange ground-source heat pumps. [[ASHRAE]] transitioned to ISO 13256-1 in 2001, which replaces ARI 320, 325 and 330. The new ISO standard produces slightly higher ratings because it no longer budgets any electricity for water pumps.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;

Efficient compressors, variable speed compressors and larger heat exchangers all contribute to heat pump efficiency. Residential ground source heat pumps on the market today have standard COPs ranging from 2.4 to 5.0 and EERs ranging from 10.6 to 30.&lt;ref name="survival" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahridirectory.org/ahriDirectory/pages/wbahp/defaultSearch.aspx |title=AHRI Directory of water-to-air geothermal heat pumps}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for an [[Energy Star]] label, heat pumps must meet certain minimum COP and EER ratings which depend on the ground heat exchanger type. For closed loop systems, the ISO 13256-1 heating COP must be 3.3 or greater and the cooling EER must be 14.1 or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/eligibility/geo_heat_pump_elig.pdf |title=Energy Star Program Requirements for Geothermal Heat PUmps |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Partner Commitments |publisher=Energy Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual installation conditions may produce better or worse efficiency than the standard test conditions. COP improves with a lower temperature difference between the input and output of the heat pump, so the stability of ground temperatures is important. If the loop field or water pump is undersized, the addition or removal of heat may push the ground temperature beyond standard test conditions, and performance will be degraded. Similarly, an undersized blower may allow the plenum coil to overheat and degrade performance.

Soil without artificial heat addition or subtraction and at depths of several metres or more remains at a relatively constant temperature year round. This temperature equates roughly to the average annual air-temperature of the chosen location, usually {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} at a depth of {{convert|6|m}} in the northern US. Because this temperature remains more constant than the air temperature throughout the seasons, geothermal heat pumps perform with far greater efficiency during extreme air temperatures than air conditioners and air-source heat pumps.

Standards ARI 210 and 240 define [[Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (SEER) and [[Heating Seasonal Performance Factor]]s (HSPF) to account for the impact of seasonal variations on air source heat pumps. These numbers are normally not applicable and should not be compared to ground source heat pump ratings. However, [[Natural Resources Canada]] has adapted this approach to calculate typical seasonally adjusted HSPFs for ground-source heat pumps in Canada.&lt;ref name="NRCnumbers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |title=Ground Source Heat Pumps (Earth Energy Systems) |accessdate=2009-03-24 |work=Heating and Cooling with a Heat Pump |publisher=Natural Resources Canada, Office of Energy Efficiency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403212025/http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/infosource/pub/home/heating-heat-pump/gsheatpumps.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-03 |df= }} Note: contrary to air-source conventions, the NRC's HSPF numbers are in units of BTU/hr/watt. Divide these numbers by 3.41 BTU/hr/watt to arrive at non-dimensional units comparable to ground-source COPs and air-source HSPF.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC HSPFs ranged from 8.7 to 12.8 BTU/hr/watt (2.6 to 3.8 in nondimensional factors, or 255% to 375% seasonal average electricity utilization efficiency) for the most populated regions of Canada. When combined with the thermal efficiency of electricity, this corresponds to net average thermal efficiencies of 100% to 150%.

==Environmental impact==
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Environmental Protection Agency|title= Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier – Report 430-R-93-004|publisher= EPA|year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential, particularly where they are used for both heating and cooling and where the electricity is produced from renewable resources.

GSHPs have unsurpassed thermal efficiencies and produce zero emissions locally, but their electricity supply includes components with high greenhouse gas emissions, unless the owner has opted for a 100% [[renewable energy]] supply. Their environmental impact therefore depends on the characteristics of the electricity supply and the available alternatives.

The GHG emissions savings from a heat pump over a conventional furnace can be calculated based on the following formula:&lt;ref name="strategic"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Hanova | first1 = J | last2 = Dowlatabadi | first2 = H | date =9 November 2007 | title =Strategic GHG reduction through the use of ground source heat pump technology | periodical =Environmental Research Letters | place =UK | publisher =IOP Publishing | volume =2 | pages = 044001 8pp | url =http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1748-9326/2/4/044001/erl7_4_044001.pdf?request-id=dd247af1-1eb0-4c8d-a20b-426d37d8ee5f | issn =1748-9326 | doi =10.1088/1748-9326/2/4/044001 | accessdate =2009-03-22 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode =2007ERL.....2d4001H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;GHG\ Savings=HL \left( \frac{FI}{AFUE \times 1000\frac{kg}{ton}}-\frac{EI}{COP \times 3600\frac{sec}{hr}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
*HL = seasonal heat load ≈ 80 GJ/yr for a modern detached house in the northern US
*FI = emissions intensity of fuel = 50&amp;nbsp;kg(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GJ for natural gas, 73 for heating oil, 0 for 100% [[renewable energy]] such as wind, hydro, photovoltaic or solar thermal
*[[AFUE]] = furnace efficiency ≈ 95% for a modern [[condensing furnace]]
*COP = heat pump coefficient of performance ≈ 3.2 seasonally adjusted for northern US heat pump
*EI = emissions intensity of electricity ≈ 200–800 ton(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/GWh, depending on region

Ground-source heat pumps always produce fewer greenhouse gases than air conditioners, oil furnaces, and electric heating, but natural gas furnaces may be competitive depending on the greenhouse gas intensity of the local electricity supply. In countries like Canada and Russia with low emitting electricity infrastructure, a residential heat pump may save 5 tons of carbon dioxide per year relative to an oil furnace, or about as much as taking an average passenger car off the road. But in cities like Beijing or Pittsburgh that are highly reliant on coal for electricity production, a heat pump may result in 1 or 2 tons more carbon dioxide emissions than a natural gas furnace.  For areas not served by utility natural gas infrastructure, however, no better alternative exists.

The fluids used in closed loops may be designed to be biodegradable and non-toxic, but the refrigerant used in the heat pump cabinet and in direct exchange loops was, until recently, [[chlorodifluoromethane]], which is an ozone depleting substance.&lt;ref name="survival"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rafferty | first = Kevin |date = April 1997| title =An Information Survival Kit for the Prospective Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Owner | periodical =Geo-Heat Centre Quarterly Bulletin | publication-place =Klmath Falls, Oregon | publisher =Oregon Institute of Technology | volume =18 | issue =2 | pages = 1–11 | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull18-2/art1.pdf | issn =0276-1084 | accessdate =2009-03-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} The author issued an [http://geoheat.oit.edu/ghp/survival.pdf updated version] of this article in February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Although harmless while contained, leaks and improper end-of-life disposal contribute to enlarging the [[ozone hole]].  For new construction, this refrigerant is being phased out in favor of the ozone-friendly but potent greenhouse gas [[R410A]]. The [[EcoCute]] water heater is an air-source heat pump that uses [[Carbon Dioxide|carbon dioxide]] as its working fluid instead of [[chlorofluorocarbons]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Open loop systems (i.e. those that draw ground water as opposed to closed loop systems using a borehole heat exchanger) need to be balanced by reinjecting the spent water. This prevents [[aquifer]] depletion and the contamination of soil or surface water with brine or other compounds from underground.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Before drilling, the underground geology needs to be understood, and drillers need to be prepared to seal the borehole, including preventing penetration of water between strata. The unfortunate example is a geothermal heating project in [[Staufen im Breisgau]], Germany which seems the cause of considerable damage to historical buildings there. In 2008, the city centre was reported to have risen 12&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/0,1518,589944,00.html Spiegel.de report on recent geological changes] (in German, partial [http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2008/11/town-rips-up.html translation])&lt;/ref&gt; after initially sinking a few millimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583323/Geothermal-probe-sinks-German-city.html|title=Geothermal probe sinks German city|first=Bojan|last=Pancevski|date=30 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The boring tapped a naturally pressurized aquifer, and via the borehole this water entered a layer of anhydrite, which expands when wet as it forms gypsum.

Ground-source heat pump technology, like building orientation, is a [[natural building]] technique ([[bioclimatic building]]).

==Economics==
Ground source heat pumps are characterized by high capital costs and low operational costs compared to other [[HVAC]] systems. Their overall economic benefit depends primarily on the relative costs of electricity and fuels, which are highly variable over time and across the world. Based on recent prices, ground-source heat pumps currently have lower operational costs than any other conventional heating source almost everywhere in the world. Natural gas is the only fuel with competitive operational costs, and only in a handful of countries where it is exceptionally cheap, or where electricity is exceptionally expensive.&lt;ref name="strategic" /&gt; In general, a homeowner may save anywhere from 20% to 60% annually on utilities by switching from an ordinary system to a ground-source system.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium, Inc. |url=http://geoexchange.us/ |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economics"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Lienau | first1 =Paul J.  | last2 =Boyd | first2 =Tonya L.  | last3 =Rogers | first3 =Robert L.  |date = April 1995| title =Ground-Source Heat Pump Case Studies and Utility Programs | place =Klamath Falls, OR | publisher =Geo-Heat Center, Oregon Institute of Technology | url =http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/hp1.pdf | accessdate=2009-03-26 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital costs and system lifespan have received much less study until recently, and the [[return on investment]] is highly variable. The most recent data from an analysis of 2011–2012 incentive payments in the state of Maryland showed an average cost of residential systems of $1.90 per watt, or about $26,700 for a typical (4 ton) home system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenThermal.org analysis of geothermal incentive payments in the state of Maryland|url=http://openthermal.net/md/|publisher=OpenThermal.org|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An older study found the total installed cost for a system with 10&amp;nbsp;kW (3 ton) thermal capacity for a detached rural residence in the US averaged $8000–$9000 in 1995 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kavanaugh|first1=Steve|last2=Gilbreath|first2=Christopher|editor=Joseph Kilpatrick|title=Cost Containment for Ground-Source Heat Pumps|url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/pdf/tp72.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|edition=final report|date=December 1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies found an average cost of $14,000 in 2008 US dollars for the same size system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=Paul|title=Indiana Residential Geothermal Heat Pump Rebate, Program Review|url=http://www.in.gov/oed/files/GHPProgramreport.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-24|date=June 2008|publisher=Indiana Office of Energy and Defense Development|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oakridge"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = P. | title = Geothermal (Ground-Source) Heat Pumps: Market Status, Barriers to Adoption, and Actions to Overcome Barriers| last1 = Hughes| publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory | year = 2008| doi = 10.2172/948543}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Energy estimates a price of $7500 on its website, last updated in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12670 |title=Energy Savers: Selecting and Installing a Geothermal Heat Pump System |publisher=Energysavers.gov |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source in Canada placed prices in the range of $30,000–$34,000 Canadian dollars.&lt;ref name="retscreen"&gt;{{Cite book |editor=RETscreen International|title=Clean Energy Project Analysis: RETscreen Engineering &amp; Cases Textbook |url=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/12.php |accessdate=2009-04-20 |year=2005 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |isbn=0-662-39150-0 |id=Catalogue no.: M39-110/2005E-PDF |chapter=Ground-Source Heat Pump Project Analysis |chapterurl=http://www.retscreen.net/ang/textbook_gshp.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid escalation in system price has been accompanied by rapid improvements in efficiency and reliability. Capital costs are known to benefit from economies of scale, particularly for open loop systems, so they are more cost-effective for larger commercial buildings and harsher climates. The initial cost can be two to five times that of a conventional heating system in most residential applications, new construction or existing. In retrofits, the cost of installation is affected by the size of living area, the home's age, insulation characteristics, the geology of the area, and location of the property. Proper duct system design and mechanical air exchange should be considered in the initial system cost.

Capital costs may be offset by government subsidies; for example,  Ontario offered $7000 for residential systems installed in the 2009 fiscal year. Some electric companies offer special rates to customers who install a ground-source heat pump for heating or cooling their building.&lt;ref name="geothermal_incentive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |title=Geothermal Heat Pumps |publisher=[[Capital Electric Cooperative]] |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206122801/http://www.capitalelec.com/Energy_Efficiency/ground_source/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where electrical plants have larger loads during summer months and idle capacity in the winter, this increases electrical sales during the winter months. Heat pumps also lower the load peak  during the summer due to the increased efficiency of heat pumps, thereby avoiding costly construction of new power plants. For the same reasons, other utility companies have started to pay for the installation of ground-source heat pumps at customer residences. They lease the systems to their customers for a monthly fee, at a net overall saving to the customer.

The lifespan of the system is longer than conventional heating and cooling systems. Good data on system lifespan is not yet available because the technology is too recent, but many early systems are still operational today after 25–30 years with routine maintenance. Most loop fields have warranties for 25 to 50 years and are expected to last at least 50 to 200 years.&lt;ref name="ghpcCons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghpcFAQ"/&gt; Ground-source heat pumps use electricity for heating the house.

The payback period for larger commercial systems in the US is 1–5 years, even when compared to natural gas.&lt;ref name="economics" /&gt; Additionally, because geothermal heat pumps usually have no outdoor compressors or cooling towers, the risk of vandalism is reduced or eliminated, potentially extending a system's lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of a Geothermal Heat Pump System |url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/benefits-of-a-geothermal-heat-pump-system.html |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ground source heat pumps are recognized as one of the most efficient heating and cooling systems on the market. They are often the second-most cost effective solution in extreme climates (after [[co-generation]]), despite reductions in thermal efficiency due to ground temperature. (The ground source is warmer in climates that need strong air conditioning, and cooler in climates that need strong heating.) The financial viability of these systems depends on the adequate sizing of ground heat exchangers (GHEs), which generally contribute the most to the overall capital costs of GSHP systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.icebookshop.com/Products/Geothermal-Energy,-Heat-Exchange-Systems-and-Energ.aspx|title=Geothermal Energy, Heat Exchange Systems and Energy Piles|last=Craig|first=William|last2=Gavin|first2=Kenneth|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763983|location=London|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial systems maintenance costs in the US have historically been between $0.11 to $0.22 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year in 1996 dollars, much less than the average $0.54 per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year for conventional HVAC systems.&lt;ref name="bloomquist"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bloomquist | first = R.

Governments that promote renewable energy will likely offer incentives for the consumer (residential), or industrial markets. For example, in the United States, incentives are offered both on the state and federal levels of government.&lt;ref name="mmar2009"&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222100703/http://www.dsireusa.org/searchby/searchtechnology.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=2&amp;EE=1&amp;RE=1 |date=2008-02-22 }}. US Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the [[Renewable Heat Incentive]] provides a financial incentive for generation of renewable heat based on metered readings on an annual basis for 20 years for commercial buildings. The domestic Renewable Heat Incentive is due to be introduced in Spring 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 to 2015 government policy: low carbon technologies|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies#appendix-6-renewable-heat-incentive-rhi|publisher=www.gov.uk|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for seven years and be based on deemed heat.

==Installation==
Because of the technical knowledge and equipment needed to design and size the system properly (and install the piping if heat fusion is required), a GSHP system installation requires a professional's services. Several installers have published real-time views of system performance in an online community of recent residential installations.

This stage of ''Ashrama'' is conceptually followed by [[Vanaprastha]] (forest dweller, retired&lt;ref&gt;L Mullatti (1995), Families in India: Beliefs and Realities, Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 26(1): 11-25&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Sannyasa]] (renunciation).&lt;ref name=rks&gt;RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with other three life stages, Hindu philosophy considers these stages as a facet of [[Dharma]] concept, something essential to completing the full development of a human being and fulfilling all the needs of the individual and society.&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref name=wih/&gt;

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider ''Grihastha'' stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offsprings that continues mankind.&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2377977 The Principles of Hindu Ethics], International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 232-245&lt;/ref&gt; The householder stage is also considered in Indian philosophy as one where the most intense physical, sexual, emotional, occupational, social and material attachments exist in a human being's life.&lt;ref&gt;Mazumdar and Mazumdar (2005), Home in the Context of Religion, in Home and Identity in Late Life: International Perspectives (Editor: Graham D. Rowles et al.), Springer, {{ISBN|978-0826127150}}, pages 81-103&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian traditions, ''Grihastha'' stage of life is a recommendation, but not a requirement. Any ''Brahmacharya'' may, if he or she wants, skip householder and retirement stage, go straight to Sannyasa stage of life, thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=wih&gt;What is Hinduism?

==Etymology==
{{Hinduism}}
The Sanskrit word ''Grihastha'' (गृहस्थ) is a composite "Grih-astha" of two root words ''Grih'' (गृह) and ''Astha'' (अस्थ). ''Grih'' means "home, family, house",&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=stha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU gRha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Asth'' means "devoted to, occupied with, being in".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=stha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU stha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt; Grihastha means that which "being in and occupied with home, family" or simply "householder".&lt;ref name=grhastha&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=gRhastha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 gRhastha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Grihastha is part of the ancient [[Hindu]] concept called [[Chaturashrama]], which identified four stages of a human life, with distinct differences based on natural human needs and drives, as well as how these ''stages'' integrated with fulfilling, joyful four ''goals'' of life called [[Purushartha]] - [[Dharma]] (piety, morality, duties), [[Artha]] (wealth, health, means of life), [[Kama]] (love, relationships, emotions) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom, self-realization).&lt;ref name=wih/&gt; Grihastha is considered to be the most intense of all four stages, where a man or woman pursues all four goals of life, with greater emphasis on first three - Dharma, Artha and Kama.&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref name=mb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Sharma (1986), A Socio-political Study of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120800786}}, page 435&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Sannyasa]] is the stage where the individual renounces Artha and Kama, and pursues Moksha with a single minded pursuit.&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref name=wih/&gt;

The stage "Grihastha" is preceded by [[Brahmacharya]] (student) stage of life, and followed by [[Vanaprastha]] (retirement, forest dweller, still an advisor to the next generation) stage. In ancient texts, Grihastha stage of life is said to extend from the age of about 25 to about 50.&lt;ref name=wih/&gt;

A man or woman entered the ''Grihastha'' stage after a [[Hindu wedding]]. They would build a home, raise a family, earn wealth, enjoy worldly life and participate in the society through virtues such as [[Dāna|charity]].&lt;ref name=sgn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Gray (2009), Where truth happens: The Nepali house as Mandala, Anthropologica, 51(1): 195-208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and [[Brahma Sutras|Vedānta Sūtras]] discuss all four stages of life - student, householder, retired/hermit and ascetic. However they hold ''Grihastha'' ashram as the highest because, explains verse III.4.48, not only does the householder performs the duties recommended for all four asramas, they have to produce food and goods on which people in other ashramas survive. The shared duties of four ashramas are - tenderness for all living creatures ([[ahimsa]]), [[Yamas|self-restraints]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, The [[Sacred Books of the East]]: The Vedanta-Sutras, Pt. 2, Vol. XXXVIII, Oxford University Press, pages 324-325&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chapters of the Upanishads, for example hymn 4.4.22 of [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], specify only three stages of human life – Brahmacharya, Grihastha and Vanaprastha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]] (1906), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, pages 54-61&lt;/ref&gt; They make no mention of gender, class or caste restrictions on these stages of life. All three stages are recommended as path to [[Brahman]] (inner Self, Soul). In contrast, later texts&lt;ref&gt;See the following Upanishads: Brahma, Sannyasa, Aruneya, Kantha, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Ashrama; For English translations and secondary source - see Paul Deussen (1906), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh, pages 374-377&lt;/ref&gt; specify four stages of human life.

;Dharmasutras and Dharmasmritis
Grihastha ashram, declares [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama Dharmasutra]] in verses 3.2 and 3.3, is the foundation of all the ashrams, and essential to the existence and continuation of society because the other three ashrams do not produce offspring.&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/dharma/gautama_dharma_sutra.pdf Gautama Dharma Sutra] page 3;&lt;br&gt;
English Translation: UC Pandey, Gautama Dharma Sutra, with the Mitaksara' Sanskrit commentary of Haradatta, 1966, {{oclc|702663294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manusmṛti|Manusmriti]], similarly states in Sections VI.87 through VI.90, that it is the householders who feed all those in other three stages of life, and those who seek spiritual pursuits live on, attain fulfillment because of those who accept and prosper in Grihastha ashram.&lt;ref&gt;Original: [https://archive.org/stream/ManuSmritHindi-GpDwivedi#page/n343/mode/2up ManuSmriti] Chapter 6, Verses 87-90 (in Sanskrit);&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Max Muller, {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=214}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, pages 214-215&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Manusmriti uses the concept of ashram broadly, and in verses III.77 to III.80, declares Grihastha stage as noble, excellent and that "just like all beings need air to survive, so do all beings take life from the ''Grihastha Ashram'' because of the food they produce and knowledge they apply".&lt;ref name=rks/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=89}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sections IV.1 through IV.6, Manusmriti states a Brahmana, after being twice-born and completing his studies with his teacher, should marry and live in his house.&lt;ref name=mm2/&gt; He must seek a means of living that causes no injury or least possible injury to all living beings, except in times of distress. For this householder stage, the text declares that the Brahmana (graduate from Brahmacharya) should accumulate property by ethically pursuing his caste's occupation.&lt;ref name=mm2/&gt; Manusmriti lists&lt;ref name=mm2&gt;Original: [https://archive.org/stream/ManuSmritHindi-GpDwivedi#page/n253/mode/2up ManuSmriti] Chapter 4, Verses 1-6, pages 114-115 (in Sanskrit);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 1: Max Muller, {{Google books|VAobAAAAYAAJ|The Laws of Manu|page=128}}, The Sacred Books of the East, Oxford University Press, pages 128-129;&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: William Jones (1796), [https://archive.org/stream/institutesofhind00manu#page/88/mode/2up Manu Smriti - Ordinances of Manu] Chapter the Fourth, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; five appropriate sources of income or means for survival for the educated Brahmana - [[Ṛta]] (ऋत, lawful gleaning and gathering, proper natural work&lt;ref&gt;Muller translates it as gleaning of corn, William Jones as lawful gleaning and gathering, Prasad translates it as proper natural work&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Amrita|Amrta]] (अमृत, accepting gifts and charity), Mrta (मृत, begging), Pramrta (प्रमृत,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=pramrita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU pramRta] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture, tillage) and Satyanrta (सत्यानृत,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=Satyanrita+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU satyAnRta] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; trade, commerce, money lending). The text disapproves of one means of survival for the householder - Shvavritti (श्ववृत्ति,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=zvavRtti&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 zvavRtti] Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; dog-like subsistence, servitude, slavery&lt;ref&gt;Muller translates it as dog-like menial subsistence, William Jones translates this as service for hire, Prasad translates it as slavery&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Hanlon's razor''' is an [[aphorism]] expressed in various ways, including:

:Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&lt;ref name="Wigosky-2004"/&gt;
It suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations ("[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s") for human behavior and its consequences. Statements of this kind are known as [[philosophical razor]]s. It is an [[List of eponymous laws|eponymous law]], probably named after a Robert J. Hanlon.

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

{{sections|date=October 2018}}
'''Hexis''' ({{lang-grc|ἕξις}}) is a relatively stable arrangement or disposition, for example a person's health or knowledge or character. It is an [[Ancient Greek]] word, important in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], and because of this it has become a traditional word of philosophy. It stems from a verb related to [[Ownership|possession]] or "having", and [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], for example, translates it as "possession". It is more typically translated in modern texts occasionally as "state" (e.g., H. Rackham), but more often as "[[disposition]]". Joe Sachs translates it as "active condition", in order to make sure that ''hexis'' is not confused with passive conditions of the soul, such as feelings and impulses or mere capacities that belong to us by nature. Sachs points to Aristotle's own distinction, explained for example in ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 8b, which distinguishes the word ''diathesis'', normally uncontroversially translated as disposition. In this passage, ''diathesis'' only applies to passive and shallow dispositions that are easy to remove and change, such as being hot or cold, while ''hexis'' is reserved for deeper and more active dispositions, such as properly getting to know something in a way that it will not be easily forgotten. Another common example of a human ''hexis'' in Aristotle is health (''hugieia'', or sometimes ''eu(h)exia'', in Greek) and in cases where ''hexis'' is discussed in the context of health, it is sometimes translated as "constitution".

Apart from needing to be relatively stable or permanent, in contexts concerning humans (such as knowledge, health, and good character) ''hexis'' is also generally understood to be contrasted from other dispositions, conditions and habits, by being "acquired" by some sort of training or other habituation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''hexis'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%28%2Fcis entry] in [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plotinus]], virtue is a hexis of the soul that is not primarily related to [[praxis (process)|praxis]] and habituation; hexis is a quality of being in an active state of possession that intellectualizes the soul in permanent contemplation of the intelligible world (Enn. VI.8.5.3–37).&lt;ref&gt;Stamatellos, G. (2015) "Virtue and Hexis in Plotinus", International Journal of the Platonic Tradition 9.2: 129-45 [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18725473-12341312]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses also occur, for example it is sometimes translated as "habit", based upon the classical translation from Greek to Latin "''habitus''", which also comes from a verb indicating having.

Being in a truly fixed state, as opposed to being stable, is not implied in the original Aristotelian usage of this word.&lt;ref&gt;''Stasis'', in Greek, was “rest”. In fact, neither a ''hexis'' nor a ''[[dunamis]]'' are static or moving because they do not [[Existence|exist]] in the way that moving things exist ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] IX).&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the example of "[[health]]" being a ''hexis''.

{{Quotation|"Having" (''hexis'') means (a) In one sense an activity (''[[energeia]]''), as it were, of the haver and the thing had, or as in the case of an action (praxis) or motion; for when one thing makes and another is made, there is between them an act of making. In this way between the man who has a garment and the garment which is had, there is a "having (''hexis'')." Clearly, then, it is impossible to have a "having" (''hexis'') in this sense; for there will be an infinite series if we can have the having of what we have. But (b) there is another sense of "having" which means a disposition (''diathesis''), in virtue of which (''kath' ho'') the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else. E.g., health is a state (''hexis''), since it is a disposition of the kind described. Further, any part of such a disposition is called a state (''hexis''); and hence the excellence ([[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]) of the parts is a kind of state (''hexis'').|Aristot. Met. 5.1022b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022b Greek from Perseus Project]: ἕξις δὲ λέγεται ἕνα μὲν τρόπον οἷον ἐνέργειά τις τοῦ  [5]  ἔχοντος καὶ ἐχομένου, ὥσπερ πρᾶξίς τις ἢ κίνησις （ὅταν γὰρ τὸ μὲν ποιῇ τὸ δὲ ποιῆται, ἔστι ποίησις μεταξύ: οὕτω καὶ τοῦ ἔχοντος ἐσθῆτα καὶ τῆς ἐχομένης ἐσθῆτος ἔστι μεταξὺ ἕξις）: ταύτην μὲν οὖν φανερὸν ὅτι οὐκ ἐνδέχεται ἔχειν ἕξιν （εἰς ἄπειρον γὰρ βαδιεῖται, εἰ τοῦ ἐχομένου ἔσται ἔχειν τὴν [10] ἕξιν）, ἄλλον δὲ τρόπον ἕξις λέγεται διάθεσις καθ᾽ ἣν ἢ εὖ ἢ κακῶς διάκειται τὸ διακείμενον, καὶ ἢ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ ἢ πρὸς ἄλλο, οἷον ἡ ὑγίεια ἕξις τις: διάθεσις γάρ ἐστι τοιαύτη. ἔτι ἕξις λέγεται ἂν ᾖ μόριον διαθέσεως τοιαύτης: διὸ καὶ ἡ τῶν μερῶν ἀρετὴ ἕξις τίς ἐστιν.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

So according to Aristotle, a "''hexis''" is a type of "disposition" (diathesis) which he in turn describes in the same as follows...

{{Quotation|"Disposition" means arrangement (''taxis'') of that which has parts, either in space (''[[topos]]'') or in potentiality ([[dunamis]]) or in form (''[[Theory of forms|eidos]]''). It must be a kind of position (''thesis''), as indeed is clear from the word, "disposition" (''diathesis'').|Aristot. Met. 5.1022b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022b Greek from Perseus]: διάθεσις λέγεται τοῦ ἔχοντος μέρη τάξις ἢ κατὰ τόπον ἢ κατὰ δύναμιν ἢ κατ᾽ εἶδος: θέσιν γὰρ δεῖ τινὰ εἶναι, ὥσπερ καὶ τοὔνομα δηλοῖ ἡ διάθεσις.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And specifically it is the type of disposition "in virtue of which (''kath' ho'') the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else".

The wording "in virtue of which" was also described in the same passage...

{{Quotation|"That in virtue of which" has various meanings. (a) The form or essence of each individual thing; e.g., that in virtue of which a man is good is "goodness itself." (b) The immediate substrate in which a thing is naturally produced; as, e.g., color is produced in the surface of things. Thus "that in virtue of which" in the primary sense is the form , and in the secondary sense, as it were, the matter of each thing, and the immediate substrate. And in general "that in virtue of which" will exist in [[Four causes|the same number of senses as "cause."]] For we say indifferently "in virtue of what has he come?" or "for what reason has he come?" and "in virtue of what has he inferred or inferred falsely?" or "what is the cause of his inference or false inference?" (And further, there is the positional sense of ''kath' ho'', "in which he stands," or "in which he walks"; all these examples denote place or position).|Aristot. Met. 5.1022a&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1022a Greek from Perseus Project]: τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ λέγεται πολλαχῶς, ἕνα μὲν τρόπον τὸ εἶδος  [15]  καὶ ἡ οὐσία ἑκάστου πράγματος, οἷον καθ᾽ ὃ ἀγαθός, αὐτὸ ἀγαθόν, ἕνα δὲ ἐν ᾧ πρώτῳ πέφυκε γίγνεσθαι, οἷον τὸ χρῶμα ἐν τῇ ἐπιφανείᾳ. τὸ μὲν οὖν πρώτως λεγόμενον καθ᾽ ὃ τὸ εἶδός ἐστι, δευτέρως δὲ ὡς ἡ ὕλη ἑκάστου καὶ τὸ ὑποκείμενον ἑκάστῳ πρῶτον. ὅλως δὲ τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ ἰσαχῶς καὶ  [20]  τὸ αἴτιον ὑπάρξει: κατὰ τί γὰρ ἐλήλυθεν ἢ οὗ ἕνεκα ἐλήλυθε λέγεται, καὶ κατὰ τί παραλελόγισται ἢ συλλελόγισται, ἢ τί τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ συλλογισμοῦ ἢ παραλογισμοῦ. ἔτι δὲ τὸ καθ᾽ ὃ τὸ κατὰ θέσιν λέγεται, καθ᾽ ὃ ἕστηκεν ἢ καθ᾽ ὃ βαδίζει: πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα τόπον σημαίνει καὶ θέσιν.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Aristotle then, a ''hexis'' is an arrangement of parts such that the arrangement might have excellence, being well arranged, or in contrast, might be badly arranged. Also see Aristotle's [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] viii&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classicallibrary.org/aristotle/categories/2.htm#8&lt;/ref&gt; where a hexis ("habit" in the translation of Edghill) is contrasted with a disposition (''diathesis'') in terms of it being more permanent and less easy to change. The example given is "knowledge" (''epistemē'').

In perhaps the most important case, Aristotle contrasted ''hexis'' with ''[[energeia]]'' (in the sense of activity or operation) at [[Nicomachean Ethics]] I.viii.1098b33 and [[Eudemian Ethics]] II.i.1218b. The subject here was ''[[eudaimonia]]'', the proper aim of human life, often translated as "happiness" and ''hexis'' is contrasted with ''energeia'' (ἐνέργεια) in order to show the correctness of a proposed definition of ''eudaimonia'' - "activity (ἐνέργεια) in conformity with virtue"

{{Quotation|Now with those who pronounce happiness to be virtue, or some particular virtue, our definition is in agreement; for ‘activity ({{lang|grc|ἐνέργεια}}) in conformity with virtue’ (''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]'') involves virtue. But no doubt it makes a great difference whether we conceive the Supreme Good to depend on possessing virtue or on displaying it—on disposition ({{lang|grc|ἕξις}}), or on the manifestation of a disposition in action. For a man may possess the disposition without its producing any good result, as for instance when he is asleep, or has ceased to function from some other cause; but virtue in active exercise cannot be inoperative—it will of necessity act (''praxis''), and act well (''eu praxei''). And just as at the Olympic games the wreaths of victory are not bestowed upon the handsomest and strongest persons present, but on men who enter for the competitions—since it is among these that the winners are found,—so it is those who act rightly who carry off the prizes and good things of life.|Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1098b&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0053:bekker%20page=1098b Greek from Perseus Project]: τοῖς μὲν οὖν λέγουσι τὴν ἀρετὴν ἢ ἀρετήν τινα συνῳδός ἐστιν ὁ λόγος: ταύτης γάρ ἐστιν ἡ κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐνέργεια. διαφέρει δὲ ἴσως οὐ μικρὸν ἐν κτήσει ἢ χρήσει τὸ ἄριστον ὑπολαμβάνειν, καὶ ἐν ἕξει ἢ ἐνεργείᾳ. τὴν μὲν γὰρ ἕξιν ἐνδέχεται μηδὲν ἀγαθὸν ἀποτελεῖν ὑπάρχουσαν, οἷον τῷ καθεύδοντι ἢ καὶ ἄλλως πως ἐξηργηκότι, τὴν δ᾽ ἐνέργειαν οὐχ οἷόν τε: πράξει γὰρ ἐξ ἀνάγκης, καὶ εὖ πράξει. ὥσπερ δ᾽ Ὀλυμπίασιν οὐχ οἱ κάλλιστοι καὶ ἰσχυρότατοι στεφανοῦνται ἀλλ᾽ οἱ ἀγωνιζόμενοι （τούτων γάρ τινες νικῶσιν）, οὕτω καὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ βίῳ καλῶν κἀγαθῶν οἱ πράττοντες ὀρθῶς ἐπήβολοι γίνονται.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Happiness then, is an ''energeia'', but virtue of character (often translated as "moral virtue") is made up of ''hexeis''. Happiness is said to deserve honoring like the divine if it actually achieved, while virtue of character, being only a potential achievement, deserves praise but is lower.&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Nic. Eth. Book I Ch.12 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1101b 1101b]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1102a 1102a]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalpanā''' ([[Sanskrit]]: कल्पना) is derived from the root - ''kalpanama'' (कल्पनम्) + ना, and means – 'fixing', 'settlement', 'making', 'performing', 'doing', 'forming', 'arranging', 'decorating', 'ornamenting', 'forgery', 'a contrivance', 'device'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=548|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PvmAwVXPKbQC&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=kalpana+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oYCbVOKVLceiuQSrh4CoAw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also means – 'assuming anything to be real', 'fictional'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B2%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvaracharya]] in his ''Taittirīyavārttika'' (commentary on [[Adi Shankara|Śankāra]]'s work on the ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittirīya Upanişad]]'') (II.297) has used the term ''kalpanā'' to mean – 'inferior conception'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taittiriyopanishad Bhasyavartikam|publisher=Brill|page=105|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WAYVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=kalpana+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uIGbVPihH9TmuQTen4HQCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishnu Purana]] (VI.vii.90) and [[Naradiya Purana]] (lxvii.70) define ''kalpanā'' as a two-termed relation which is a distinction between the contemplation and the object-to-be-contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga-system of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=205|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=J3nca_uUpVkC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=kalpana+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uIGbVPihH9TmuQTen4HQCQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Badarayana]] has used the word ''kalpanā'' only once in his composition, [[Brahma Sutras]], but while translating Sri Govinda Bhāshya of [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]], a commentary on Vedānta sutras, this word has been translated by Srisa Chandra Vasu to mean – 'the creative power of thought, formation, creation (and not imagination) ', which meaning is in the context of explaining [[Pradhana]] purported to have been referred to by the word - ''ajā'' (birthless entity)  occurring in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (IV.5). Badarayana states:-

:कल्पनोपदेशाच च, मध्वादिवदविरोधः |

:"Because it is taught that Pradhana is the creation of the Lord, so there is no contradiction in calling her both created and uncreated, as in the case of honey (a reference to [[Madhu-vidya]])."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus|author=Baman Das Basu|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=173-174|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TD2TmogOfdYC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=kalpana+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O4ObVKaWEcWUuATu_4CIBQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roer in his translation of the commentary of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] on [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] has translated the word ''kalpanā'' as 'fictitious view', and '' [[upadhi]] '', as 'fictitious attribute'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad|author=Dr. E.Roer|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bengal|pages=72-73|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wCYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lXubVPb8H4ONuATXoYLgCQ&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara in his Brahma Sutra Bhāsya has interpreted this ''sutra'' as follows:-

:"And since this is an instruction in the form of an imagery, just as in the case of honey etc., therefore there is no incongruity." (Translated by [[Swami Gambhirananda]])

explaining that the word ''ajā'' neither indicates the form of a she-goat nor has it been used in the derivative sense of that which is unborn; what is said by the Shvetashvatara Upanishad is as an instruction about the material source of all things – moving and immobile, using a form of imagery (kalpanā) - the analogy to a she-goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=262|url= http://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dignāga]] in his ''Pramāna-samuccya'', tells us that amongst '' [[pratyaksha]] '' ('perception') that has the particular for the object and '' [[Pramana|anumāna]] '' ('inference') that has only the universal cognisance, the former ('perception') is free from ''kalpanā'' or 'conceptual construction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Comparative History of World Philosophy|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein| publisher=SUNY Press|page=501|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1xXJBZLn04IC&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lXubVPb8H4ONuATXoYLgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katha Upanishad]] tells us that virtual objects exist only during ''kalpanā-kāla'' i.e. during the period of imagination, owing to '' [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidyā]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Destined Encounters

Man is able to think because he has a perceiving and arranging  '' [[Early Buddhism|manas]] '' ('mind') which self-illuminated gives him '' [[Chaitanya (consciousness)|chetnā]] '' ('consciousness') and the faculties of '' [[pratyaksha]] '' ('perception'), '' [[Chinta (mentation)|chintā]] '' ('thought'), ''kalpanā'' ('imagination'), '' [[Volition (psychology)|prayatna]] '' ('volition') and '' [[Chaitanya (consciousness)|chaitanya]] '' ('higher sentience and intelligence').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia Vol.1|page=5839|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4H2bVMitHceNuATrnoDoCQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vedic]] thinkers held the view that the universe is merely an idea, a ''kalpanā'' ('phantasm') or projection of the mind of the creator; even the experience of birth and death by the [[Jiva]] is a ''kalpanā'' ('hallucination') created by ignorance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Harper|pages=155,318|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WWUpAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=kalpana+upanishads&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZH-bVN-RCYeJuASDwYHYCQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzge }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental ''kalpanā'' is false superimposition on account of ignorance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Indian Mysticism|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=57|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3063k1-2mowC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4H2bVMitHceNuATrnoDoCQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the '' [[siddha]] '', exclusively intent on attaining '' [[yoga]] ''  with own self, and self-reliant, gains powers arising spontaneously as devoid of any ruse or ploy (''kalpanā'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tantra: the Path of Ecstsy| author=Georg Feurstein|publisher=Shambhala Publications|page=261|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=3EgjLiXBivcC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=kalpana+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZH-bVN-RCYeJuASDwYHYCQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=kalpana%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lars Endel Roger Vilks Lanat'''  (born 20 June 1946) is a Swedish [[artist]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], and [[activist]] who garnered fame for his drawings of [[Muhammad]], which resulted in at least two failed attempts by Islamic extremists to murder him. He is also known for his sculptures, ''Nimis'' and ''Arx'', made entirely of driftwood, and the small area where the sculptures are located which was proclaimed by Vilks as an independent country, "[[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]]".

==Early life and academic career==
Vilks was born in [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, to a [[Latvia]]n father and a Swedish mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novelart.org/vilks.html Lars Vilks profile], NovelArt.org; accessed 14 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] in [[art history]] from [[Lund University]] in 1987, and worked at the [[Oslo National Academy of the Arts]] from 1988 to 1997. From 1997 to 2003, he was a [[professor]] in [[art theory]] at the [[Bergen National Academy of the Arts]]. As an art theorist, Vilks is a proponent of the [[institutional theory of art]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Artistic career==
Although an academically trained art theorist, Vilks is a self-taught artist. In the 1970s, he started painting, and in 1984, he embarked on creating the idiosyncratic [[sculpture]]s that have been his hallmark, starting with ''Nimis''. At this time, in the early 1980s, [[postmodernism]] made its definite entry into the Swedish art scene, using inspiration from e.g. the French art philosopher [[Jean-François Lyotard]]. [[Conceptual art]]ists took the place of the earlier [[Modernism|modernist]]s on the contemporary art scene. These conceptual artists did not want their art to have any aesthetic or programmatic content, but often focused on the artist's self. Vilks was part of this movement in Sweden. He turned himself in as a piece of art to the spring saloon at [[:sv:Vikingsberg|Vikingsberg, Helsingborg]], and turned his own car into a piece of art at the fall exhibition at [[Skånes konstförening]].&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"&gt;[http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/vikten-av-att-vara-vilks_4918471.svd Vikten av att vara Vilks "The importance of being Vilks"], ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', 27 June 2010 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nimis'' and ''Arx''===
[[Image:Nimis torn 2002.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Nimis. Wood sculptures by Vilks at [[Kullaberg]].]]
{{see also|Ladonia (micronation)}}
In 1980 Vilks created two wooden sculptures, ''Nimis'' and ''Arx'', made entirely of drift wood, now located in the [[Kullaberg|Kullaberg nature reserve]] in [[Höganäs Municipality|Höganäs, Skåne]]. In 1996, the small area where the sculptures are located was proclaimed by Vilks as an independent country, "[[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]]". ''Nimis'' was sold to [[Joseph Beuys]] as a means to circumvent the Swedish building code laws concerning unlawful building process. The sculpture of Nimis is now owned by concept artist [[Christo]]; the legal document documenting the sale is on display at the [[Museum of Sketches for Public Art|Swedish Museum of Sketches]]. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Critical reception and media attention===
Vilks has characterized his own skill in the actual crafts involved in sculpture as quite limited, and although his artistic ideas can be seen as characteristic for his generation of Swedish conceptual artists. One of the few works of Vilks to be incorporated into a collection is the concrete sculpture ''[[Omphalos (sculpture)|Omphalos]]'', measuring 1.6 meters high and weighing one tonne, which is owned by [[Moderna Museet]] after it was first bought by fellow artist [[Ernst Billgren]] for 10 000 Swedish kronor.&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"/&gt;

Vilks' long-standing controversies with different authorities due to his activities in the nature reserve Kullaberg, where ''Nimis'', ''Arx'' and ''Landonien'' are all located, receive significant attention in Swedish media, which has mostly portrayed Vilks' work as specifically designed to be provocative. This attention has turned the area into something of a tourist attraction. In Vilks' activity as an art theorist, he comments on his own artistic activities in the second or third person. His different works of art, his actions, actions by those authorities with whom Vilks has been in conflict, and the media attention, are brought together in a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]''.&lt;ref name="SvD 100627"/&gt; He has described himself as an "equal opportunity offender" in his critical depictions of religion.

==Muhammad drawings controversy==
{{Main|Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy}}
In 2007, Vilks caused an international controversy when he depicted  [[Muhammad]] as a [[roundabout dog]] in three drawings, designated to be shown at an art exhibition at Tällerud, in July of the same year. Shortly before its opening, the organizers cancelled their invitation with reference to serious security concerns, and despite Vilks' effort no other Swedish art gallery offered to exhibit his drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bosse|last=Brink|title=Teckningar på Muhammed togs bort|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_16316985.asp|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on 18 August, one of his drawings was published in the [[Örebro]]-based regional newspaper, ''[[Nerikes Allehanda]]'', as part of an [[editorial]] on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=na&gt;{{cite news

Following this controversy, Vilks has been forced to live under police protection after having received several death threats, including a statement by the [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated [[Islamic State of Iraq]] which has offered up to $150,000 for his [[assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Scherlund |title=Lars Vilks hotad till livet |url=http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |publisher=[[TV4Nyheterna]] |language=Swedish |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902105232/http://tv4nyheterna.se/1.163969/nyheter/2007/08/31/lars_vilks_hotad_till_livet |archivedate= 2 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vilks to get police protection|url=http://www.thelocal.se/8507/20070916|publisher=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]/[[The Local]]|date=16 September 2007|accessdate=16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bounty set over Prophet cartoon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6996553.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination plot===
In 2009, a failed plot to kill Vilks was hatched. Three U.S. citizens, [[Colleen LaRose]] (known as "[[Jihad Jane]]"), Mohammad Hassas Khalid, and Jamie Paulin Ramirez, participated in the plot. On 9 March 2010, LaRose's federal indictment was unsealed charging her with trying to recruit [[Muslim]]s to murder Vilks.&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite news|title=American Colleen LaRose Called Herself Jihad Jane|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/TheLaw/colleen-larose-jihad-jane-indicted-charges-helping-terrorists/story?id=10055608|publisher=''[[ABC News]]''|date=9 May 2010|accessdate=6 January 2014|author=Emily Friedman|author2=Jason Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jihad Jane arrested|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/06/22202049-jihad-jane-gets-10-year-sentence-for-terror-plot-against-cartoonist?lite|publisher=nbcnews.com|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, seven people were arrested in the Republic of Ireland over an alleged plot to assassinate Vilks. Police officers close to the investigation said those arrested were foreign-born Irish residents, mostly from [[Yemen]] and [[Morocco]] and had refugee status.&lt;ref name=rte&gt;{{cite news|title=Arrests over alleged plot to kill cartoonist|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0309/waterford.html|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]|date=9 March 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Stack|title=Seven held in Ireland over plot to assassinate cartoonist Lars Vilks|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/seven-held-in-ireland-over-plot-to-assassinate-cartoonist-lars-vilks-1918672.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=9 March 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven, three men and two women were arrested in [[Waterford (city)|Waterford]] and [[Tramore]], and another man and woman at [[Ballincollig]], near [[Cork (city)|Cork]].&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; [[Garda Síochána]] (the Irish police force), which conducted the arrests with support from the National Support Services and the [[counter-terrorist]] [[Special Detective Unit]], said the suspects ranged in age from mid 20s to late 40s.&lt;ref name=garda&gt;{{cite press release|title=Searches in Waterford and Cork on 9 March 2010. |publisher=[[Garda Síochána]] |date=9 March 2010 |url=http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5105 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616194353/http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5105 |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish police added that throughout the investigation they had been "working closely with law enforcement agencies in the United States and in a number of European countries".&lt;ref name=garda/&gt;

===Violent attacks===
On 11 May 2010, Muslim protesters assaulted Vilks while he was giving a lecture about [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] at [[Uppsala University]]. The attacks started when a film about Islam and homosexuality (the video depicts images of topless men, including one brief image of two fully clothed men kissing, all interspersed with Islamic imagery) was shown and some Islamists began to demand that the film be stopped, claiming it to be gay porn. The film in question was Iranian artist [[Sooreh Hera]]'s ''Allah ho Gaybar''. Vilks' eyeglasses were broken but he did not suffer any serious injuries, and was escorted to safety by security, while a few of the protesters were detained by police. Despite previous death threats, this was the first act of violence against Vilks. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A few days later, on 15 May 2010, Vilks' house in southern Sweden was attacked by arsonists.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; They smashed the windows and threw in bottles of gasoline.&lt;ref name=DW /&gt; There was a small fire, but the house was not burned to the ground. Vilks was not at home at the time of the attack.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite news |title=House of Swedish 'Muhammad' cartoonist attacked  |newspaper=Deutsche Welle|date=2010-05-15 |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5577216,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Kosovo|Kosovar]]-Swedish brothers were arrested, and July 15 they were sentenced to two and three years, respectively, of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/27806/20100715/ |title=Brothers jailed for Vilks arson attack |publisher=[[The Local]] |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008000004/http://www.thelocal.se/27806/20100715/ |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 24 November 2010, a video produced by the [[Somalia|Somali]] Islamic organization Al-Shaabab was sent out. In the video, a Swedish speaking voice appeals to "all the Somali brothers and sisters" in Sweden, to leave that country and come to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab. He announces a death threat against Vilks. On 11 December 2010, a [[2010 Stockholm bombings|suicide bomber in Stockholm]] said in a message to media and the Swedish Security Police that "Now will your children, daughters and sisters die the same way our brothers and sisters die. Our actions will speak for themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">In the social sciences, '''materiality''' is the notion that the physical properties of a [[cultural artifact]] have consequences for how the object is used.&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lievrouw|first1=Leah|editor1-last=Gillespie|editor1-first=Tarleton|editor2-last=Boczkowski|editor2-first=Pablo|editor3-last=Foot|editor3-first=Kirsten|title=Media technologies : essays on communication, materiality, and society|date=2014|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-52537-4|pages=21-51|chapter=2: Materiality and Media in Communication and Technology Studies: An Unfinished Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars expand this definition to encompass a broader range of actions, such as the process of making art, and the power of organizations and institutions to orient activity around themselves.&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt; The concept of materiality is used across many disciplines within the social sciences to focus attention on the impact of material or physical factors. Scholars working in science and technology studies, anthropology, [[Materiality turn|organization studies]], or communication studies may incorporate materiality as a dimension of their investigations. Central figures in the social scientific study of materiality are [[Harold Innis]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]].
== Communication studies ==
Communication studies investigated by scholars include the particular impacts of media as it emerged and spread. In particular, the growth of newspapers, radio, television, personal computing and the Internet have been examined. Collectively, these are termed “media effects” studies.&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt; Some communication scholars make use of the concept of concordances: the idea that the features of a particular technology may encourage certain behaviours from the technology's users. Other scholars explore how technologies and the communities that use them may be mutually determining (the way users respond to technology tends to drive both features and cultural norms among users of that technology) or they may behave as co-creators (the abilities and limitations of a technology may make it a part of the works created using that technology).&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt;

== Science and technology studies ==
Although [[Science,_technology_and_society|science and technology studies (STS)]] are typically associated with a social constructivist viewpoint, some STS scholars (e.g. [[Langdon Winner]]) incorporate materiality into their studies of technology and explore how the affordances of technology may shape or even control their use. [[Actor-network theory]], or ANT, is an example of an STS theory which incorporates both social and material interactions.&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt;

== Toronto School ==
{{main|Toronto School of communication theory}}
The Toronto School view of materiality, also known as the ‘medium’ view, includes the intellectual legacies of Innis and McLuhan, who focused attention on the consequences of the medium, on what authors communicate and on what audiences experience.&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="innis1951"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Innis|first1=Harold|title=The bias of communication|date=1951|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0802068392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innis explored the broad historical consequences of time-bound media (e.g. transportable but fragile media such as papyrus) and space-bound media (e.g. hard-to-transport but longer-lasting media such as stone tablets).&lt;ref name="innis1951"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alleyne2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alleyne|first1=Mark|editor1-last=Littlejohn|editor1-first=Stephen W.|editor2-last=Foss|editor2-first=Karen A.|title=Encyclopedia of communication theory|date=2009|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=9781412959377|chapter=International Communication Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cultures have used various media to store information and its availability and transportability through time impacts its use. In an extension of Innis' ideas, McLuhan wrote, “The medium is the message”, that is, the way people transmit ideas is consequential in and of itself.&lt;ref name="mcluhan1964"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=Understanding media : the extensions of man|date=1964|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262631594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the medium can be invisible and difficult to characterize.&lt;ref name="mcluhan1964" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lievrouw2014" /&gt;

'''Metal theft''' is "the theft of items for the value of their constituent metals".&lt;ref name="socsci.uindy.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socsci.uindy.edu/crc/metal.php |title=Indianapolis Metal Theft Project |location=Community Research Center, University of Indianapolis |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203052153/http://socsci.uindy.edu/crc/metal.php |archivedate=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually increases when worldwide prices for [[scrap metal]] rise, as has happened dramatically due to rapid industrialization in [[India]] and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Apart from [[precious metal]]s like [[gold]] and [[silver]], the metals most commonly stolen are [[Non-ferrous metal|non-ferrous]] metals such as [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[brass]], and [[bronze]]. However, even [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] are seeing higher rates of theft due to increased scrap metal prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iapci.org/seminar-one/index.php |title=2008 Metal Theft Investigations Seminar |website=International Association of Property Crime Investigators |archivedate=2011-10-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194740/http://www.iapci.org/seminar-one/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/national/articles/2008/03/27/price-hikes-lead-to-rash-of-metal-thefts.html|title=Price Hikes Lead to Rash of Metal Thefts|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=March 27, 2008|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One defining characteristic of metal theft is the motivation. Whereas other items are generally stolen for their [[extrinsic value]], items involved in metal theft are stolen for their [[intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] as raw material or commodities. Thefts often have negative consequences much greater than the value of the metal stolen, such as the destruction of valuable statues, power interruptions, and the disruption of railway traffic.

==Motivations for theft==
{{recentism|section|date=December 2011}}

[[File:Copper Price History USD.png|thumb|Global copper prices from 1986 to 2011]]
[[File:Day 148 - West Midlands Police - Tackling Metal Theft (7267919656).jpg|thumb|Police check a scrap van for questionable items (UK)]]
Scrap metal has drastically increased in price over recent years. In 2001, [[Ferrous metal recycling|ferrous scrap]] sold for $77 a ton, increasing to $300/ton by 2004. In 2008, it hit nearly $500/ton.&lt;ref name="Newsweek B"/&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This information is outdated scrap prices have recently dropped|date=October 2016}}

Some elected officials and [[Police|law enforcement officials]]  have concluded that many metal thefts are by [[Drug addiction|drug addicts]] stealing metal in order to fund their addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd05.senate.ca.gov/news/2007-03-29-berryhill-and-galgiani-metal-theft-legislation-clears-first-hurdle|title=Berryhill And Galgiani Metal Theft Legislation Clears First Hurdle|date=March 29, 2007|location=SACRAMENTO}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some officials believe that many of these drug-related metal thefts are caused by [[methamphetamine]] users;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oe.netl.doe.gov/docs/Updated%20Assessment-Copper-Final-101210%20c.pdf|title=An Updated Assessment of Copper Wire Thefts from Electric Utilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=US Department of energy|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this varies by the location of the metal being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/us/31copper.html?ex=1343534400&amp;en=d5fc191c8cd6656a&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=Unusual Culprits Cripple Farms in California|last=Steinhauer|first=Jennifer|date=31 July 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=10|location=[[Buttonwillow, California|BUTTONWILLOW, Calif.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another explanation for the phenomenon is the unusually high price of non-ferrous metals coupled with elevated levels of unemployment. Regardless of the reason, the [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] of developing nations helps to increase the demand for scrap metal.&lt;ref name="Newsweek B"/&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2008, world market prices for metals like copper, aluminium, and platinum dropped steeply. Although there is anecdotal evidence that this price decrease has led to fewer metal thefts, strong empirical research on the exact nature of the relationship between commodity prices and metal thefts is still lacking. Some have argued that the "genie is out of the bottle" now and drops in commodity prices will not result in corresponding drops in thefts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Copper Theft: The Metal Theft Epidemic |newspaper=CSO Online |date=2007-02-01 |url=http://www.csoonline.com/special/slideshows/copper_theft/ |first=Scott |last=Berinato |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202132848/http://www.csoonline.com/special/slideshows/copper_theft/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is possible that thefts may actually increase to compensate for the loss in value.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

As of December 2014 according to [[National Insurance Crime Bureau|The National Insurance Crime Bureau]] the number of insurance claims for metal theft has been decreasing in the U.S&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudla|first=Joe|title=Metal Theft Claims and Questionable Claim Referrals from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014|url=http://www.raleighscrapmetalrecycling.com/news/theft-scrap-copper-nicb.html|journal=Data Analytics Forecast Report|volume=|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630232000/http://www.raleighscrapmetalrecycling.com/news/theft-scrap-copper-nicb.html|archive-date=2016-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because of dropping scrap metal prices.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Economic impact ==
{{As of| 2014}} in the United States alone, metal theft costs the US economy $1 billion annually, according to Department of Energy estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isri.org/docs/default-source/scrap-metals-theft/sheriff-magazine-feature-article-september-2014.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title=METALS THEFT: Is this billion dollar crime on YOUR radar?|last=|first=|date=October 2014|website=Sheriff Magazine|publisher=National Sheriffs association|access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008 It was estimated that South Africa lost approximately 5 billion [[South African rand|Rand]] annually due to metal theft.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of 2008 metal theft was the fastest growing crime in the UK with the annual damage to industry estimated at [[Pound sterling|£]]360m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/china.commodities|title=The Big Meltdown|last=Edemariam|first=Aida|date=2008-06-25|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thieves often cause damage far in excess of the value they recover by selling stolen metal as scrap.  For example, thieves who strip copper [[plumbing]] and [[electrical wiring]] from houses render the residences uninhabitable without expensive, time-consuming repairs.

==Prevention==
Requiring scrap metal buyers to record the [[Photo identification|photo IDs]] of scrap metal sellers, and record scrap metal transactions may reduce the rate of metal theft. Paying scrap metal sellers by check rather than cash may reduce the rate of metal theft.  Utility companies who are often the targets of metal theft can electroplate coding on to copper wire, which can positively identify the wire as stolen even if the insulation is burned off.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://assets.www.wenatcheeworld.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/2013/05/30/1f60c5a1ea-20121214-144905-ass-65517pdf.pdf|title=Theft of Scrap Metal|last=Kooi|first=Brandon R.|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services|year=April 2010|isbn=978-1-935676-12-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Items often stolen==
[[File:BroadmoorManholeConesJune2008.jpg|thumb|A manhole with no cover in New Orleans]]
Anything made of metal has value as scrap metal, and can be stolen:
* [[Manhole cover theft|Manhole covers]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[Copper]] wiring, or copper pipes from houses or other buildings
* Utility company wiring and [[transformer]]s
* [[Aluminum]] or [[stainless steel]] beer [[keg]]s
* [[Bronze]] or [[brass]] statues or monuments
* [[Catalytic converters]] from motor vehicles (they contain precious metals)
* [[Air conditioner|Air conditioner units]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Notable metal thefts and law enforcement efforts by country==

===Australia===
In Australia in 2008, 8 tonnes of copper wiring, believed to be stolen from a variety of locations including rail tracks, power stations and scrap metal depots, was seized on its way to the Asian black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/police-bust-copper-theft-racket/2008/03/03/1204402346708.html|title=Police bust copper theft racket|publisher=The Age|date=2008-03-03|location=Melbourne|first=Matthew|last=Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
[[File:Rudolf Steiner Denkmal.jpg|thumb|All bronze components (portrait and letters) of this memorial have been removed ([[Vienna, Austria]])]]
In November 2011 a person tried to hand-saw a hot electrical line in a subway tunnel in Vienna. A fire arose; train traffic was stopped. The thief was probably hurt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krone.at/oesterreich/kupferdieb-legte-u4-lahm-taeter-entkam-verletzt-brand-ausgeloest-story-303656|title=Kupferdieb legte U4 lahm – Täter entkam verletzt|trans-title=Copper thief put U4 out – perpetrators escaped injured|date=27 November 2011|website=krone.at|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 a man burnt to death in Vienna in an empty building, one which had a 100 kV cable that went through the basement. The police found three people alive and assumed that they had been attempting to steal copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/wien/4872819/Kupferdieb-von-Starkstrom-getotet|title=Kupferdieb von Starkstrom getötet|trans-title=Copper thief killed by power|work=[[Die Presse|DiePresse]].com|date=23 November 2015|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2013 the [[Westbahn (Austria)|Westbahn]] near Amstetten had to be closed for safety reasons; grounding copper wires had been stolen; The copper stolen was worth €2,000, but total damages to the station cost upwards of €30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/news/stories/2582601/|title=Kabeldiebe legen Westbahn lahm|trans-title=Cable thieves paralyze Westbahn|publisher=noe.orf.at|date=2 May 2013|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2013 in Lower Austria {{convert|160|m|ft}} ({{convert|250|kg|lb|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) of copper wire worth less than €1,000 was stolen from a railway transformer station. The damage to the railways electronics cost €140,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/news/stories/2592175/|title=Kupferdiebe stehlen 250 Kilogramm Kabel|trans-title=Copper Thieves steal 250 kg Cable|publisher=noe.orf.at|date=8 July 2013|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2016, police caught several people that had stolen several tons of copper wire from a substation and caused 400,000 € worth of damage in Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noe.orf.at/news/stories/2774449|title=Kupferdiebe gefasst: 400.000 Euro Schaden|trans-title=Copper thieves focus: 400,000 EUR Damage|date=15 May 2016|publisher=noe.orf.at|accessdate=18 October 2016|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Quebec]], during May 2006, thieves stole sections of copper roofing, gutters and wiring from four [[Quebec city]] churches, two being St. Charles de Limoilou and St. Francois d'Assise. The thieves were discovered in action on their third night, whereupon they fled. High copper prices are believed to be the reason for the thefts. Repairs were expected to cost more than $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060529/copper_quebec_churches_060529/20060529?hub=Canada|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629065344/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20060529/copper_quebec_churches_060529/|archivedate=2011-06-29|title=Brazen thieves swipe copper from Que. churches|date=May 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
[[File:WWI War Memorial Union Buildings Pretoria 021.jpg|thumb|Metal theft from a memorial at the [[Union Buildings]], Pretoria]]
Metal theft in South Africa is rampant, with an estimated [[South African rand|R]]5 billion per annum lost due to the theft. The stolen metal ranges from copper cables, piping, bolts to manhole covers. The theft continuously disrupts and degrades services, such as the power supply provided by [[Eskom]] and the telecommunication services by [[Telkom SA|Telkom]]. Eskom estimated that the theft has cost the company about [[South African rand|R]]25 million per annum, with incidents increasing from 446 incidents in 2005; 1,059 in 2007 and 1,914 in 2008. The theft has cost Telkom [[South African rand|R]]863 million (April 2007 – January 2008 period). Despite the minimal copper reserve South Africa has, as much as 3000 tonnes of copper leave Cape Town harbour every month. Aside from the economic impact, the theft also impacted people's lives, this includes the death of six children due to [[Manhole cover theft|theft of manhole covers]] (2004–2008 figures).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/da-cable-theft-needs-urgent-action-1.410618|title=DA: Cable theft needs urgent action|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/metal-theft-is-crippling-industry-1.409566|last=Ndlovu|first=Sinegugu|title=Metal theft is crippling industry|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|date=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2008-03-03-cable-theft-costs-telkom-r863m|title=Cable theft costs Telkom R863m|publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|date=2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theft of copper cables is a serious problem in [[Gauteng]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A criminological analysis of copper cable theft in Gauteng |author=Pretorius, William Lyon |date=2013-10-02 |hdl=10500/10598 }}{{cite web|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10500/10598/dissertation_pretorius_wl.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202165614/http://uir.unisa.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10500/10598/dissertation_pretorius_wl.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the British Metals Recycling Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recyclemetals.org/ British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is working with authorities such as the Association of Chief Police Officers and the British Transport Police to halt the problem of metal being stolen from its members' sites and to identify stolen materials. Also see [[Operation Tremor]].

Roofs, [[manhole cover]]s, statues etc. have all been increasingly targeted recently due to the rising cost of metal. Most of the time metal is sold for scrap, but occasionally it is used by the thieves themselves. There have been many stories of metal theft; a bronze statue of former Olympic champion [[Steve Ovett]] disappeared from [[Preston Park, Brighton|Preston Park]] in Brighton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/18328/Who-did-a-runner-with-Ovett-s-statue-|title=Who did a runner with Ovett's statue?|publisher=Daily Express|date=September 5, 2007|first=David|last=Pilditch|accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and church bells in Devon were stolen by thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7056106.stm|title=Church bells saved from scrapyard |date=22 October 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statue made by [[Henry Moore]] and estimated to be worth £300,000 was stolen from a museum in 2006, and believed to have been melted down for its scrap value of around £5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/25/arttheft.highereducation|title=As another bronze is stolen, police fear treasures are going for scrap|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=25 January 2006 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churches, especially older churches, suffer as '[[lead]] theft' from church (and other) roofs is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/highest.ever.lead.theft.levels.threaten.community.churches/20332.htm|title='Highest ever' lead theft levels threaten community churches|date=July 10, 2008|publisher=Christian Today|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Ashmont train on Longfellow Bridge.jpg|thumb|Historic cast iron fencing on the [[Longfellow Bridge]] was stolen before refurbishment, requiring expensive replacement castings to be fabricated.]]
In [[Boston]] during the summer of 2008, two state employees stole {{convert|2347|ft|m}} of decorative iron trim that had been removed from the [[Longfellow Bridge]] for refurbishment and sold it for scrap. The men, one of whom was a Department of Conservation and Recreation district manager, were charged with receiving $12,147 for the historic original parapet coping.

In [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], two brothers dismantled a {{convert|40|by|15|ft|adj=on}} bridge by using a cutting torch to take it apart.

Cities across the United States have become targets for metal thieves. [[Manhole cover theft]]s increased dramatically between 2007 and 2008, with [[Philadelphia]] as one of the hardest hit targets. Other cities dealing with this trend include [[Chicago, Illinois]]; [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], [[Long Beach, California]];&lt;ref name="Newsweek B"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/05/19/rising-ripoffs.html |title=Manhole Covers Stolen for Scrap Metal |newspaper=Newsweek Business |date=2010-07-10 |author=Newsweek Staff |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902082210/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/05/19/rising-ripoffs.html |archivedate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Palm Beach County, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/08/29/copper-thieves-leave-i-95-in-palm-beach-co-in-the-dark/|title=Copper Thieves Leave I-95 In Palm Beach Co.

Copper wire thefts have also become increasingly common in the US. With copper prices at $3.70 a pound {{as of|2007|06|lc=y}}, compared to $0.60 a pound in 2002, people have been increasingly stealing copper wire from telephone and power company assets. Gangs have been created, a black market for copper wire has emerged, and men even have been injured in power plants while trying to obtain copper wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/08/salem_man_badly_burned_in_atte.html|title=Salem man badly burned in attempted metal theft, police say|last=Mitchell|first=Kay|date=August 31, 2009|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://froggyweb.com/news/articles/2013/sep/05/copper-stolen-from-otter-tail-power-company-substation-in-wahpeton/ |title=Copper stolen from Otter Tail Power Company substation in Wahpeton |date=September 5, 2013 |first=Bonnie |last=Amistadi |publisher=KVOX–FM – Today's Froggy 99.9 |accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of stolen copper include railroad signal lines, grounding bars at electric substations, and even a {{convert|3000|lb|adj=on}} bell stolen from a [[List of Buddhist temples#Washington|Buddhist temple]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]], which was later recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Bell-heralds-break-in-theft-case-1266678.php|title=Bell heralds break in theft case|date=March 7, 2008|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Georgia, like many other states, has seen enough copper crime that a special task force has been created to fight it. The Metro Atlanta Copper Task Force is led by the [[Atlanta Police Department]] and involves police and recyclers from surrounding metro areas, [[Georgia Power]], and the Fulton County District Attorney's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/08/02/copper_theft.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205083447/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/08/02/copper_theft.html|archivedate=2008-12-05|title=E.

Many states around the nation have passed – or are exploring – legislation to combat the problem. A new Georgia law took effect in July 2007 making it a crime to knowingly buy stolen metal. It allows prosecutors to prosecute for the actual cost of returning property to original conditions, as many of these thefts dramatically hurt the surrounding property value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgiafrontpage.blogspot.com/2008/07/emcs-mark-one-year-of-tougher-copper.html |title=EMCs Mark One Year of Tougher Copper Theft Law |website=Georgia Front Page |date=2008-07-06 |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 1, 2007, Earl Thelander of Onawa, Iowa, became the United States' first innocent copper theft fatality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iowacoldcases.org/case-summaries/earl-thelander/|title=Earl Thelander — A Nation's First|author=Jody Ewing|website=Iowa Cold Cases|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thelander sustained second- and third-degree burns over 80% of his body during an August 28, 2007, explosion, after copper thieves stripped propane and water lines from a rural residence and let the home fill with gas. Thelander, who, along with his wife, was preparing the empty home for a new tenant, reported the burglary to the Monona County Sheriff's Office, who investigated the initial crime. Hours after local law enforcement sent the Thelanders home, Thelander returned to the home to see if officials had cleared the home for entry. With no law enforcement nor fire department personnel present, he entered the home, and, smelling no fumes, felt it safe to work. In the basement, he plugged in a fan to help dry water on the basement floor, the electricity sparking an explosion.

In response to the growing concerns and the lack of hard numbers on these crimes in [[Indianapolis]], the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) and the University of Indianapolis Community Research Center (CRC) began in 2008 a collaborative effort to collect data on metal thefts.&lt;ref name="socsci.uindy.edu"/&gt; The Indianapolis Metal Theft Project gathers and analyzes a wide variety of data to provide a clearer understanding of the incidence, types, costs, and impacts of metal theft in Indianapolis in order to inform and implement strategies to reduce these crimes and their impacts.

The Department of Justice's Office of Community-Oriented Policing and the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing published its 58th problem-solving guide in 2010 directed towards theft of scrap metal. Brandon Kooi provides a review of the problem in the US and internationally, followed by a number of suggested responses and what to consider in those responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popcenter.org/problems/metal_theft/1 |website=Center for Problem-Oriented Policing |title=Theft of Scrap Metal |first=Brandon |last=Kooi |accessdate=2014-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association of Property Crime Investigators]] presents the annual National Metal Theft Investigation Seminar uniting law enforcement and corporate security to share, learn and network to combat metal theft.

The [[Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries]] is one of the groups backing these educational efforts throughout the country. As the nation’s trade association for the scrap recycling industry, ISRI provides members and community leaders with resources that they can use when facing the issue.&lt;ref name="Newsweek B"/&gt; They have also teamed with the [[National Crime Prevention Council]] (known for [[McGruff the Crime Dog]] and the “Take a Bite Out of Crime” slogan) in an effort to team with law enforcement and crime prevention organizations to fight and solve this problem, and have established a theft alert system that these groups can use.&lt;ref name="Newsweek B"/&gt; ISRI and the National Crime Prevention Council offer a number of tips for how to fight and prevent metal theft, including requiring photo ID and license plate information for every transaction, training employees on identifying stolen goods, and keeping good records that might be useful later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2008/05/21/ferrous-infrastructure-theft-on-the-rise.aspx |title=Ferrous Infrastructure Theft on the Rise |newspaper=Environmental Protection |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum'''|長崎原爆資料館|Nagasaki Genbaku Shiryōkan}} is in the city of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. The museum is a remembrance to the [[Bombing of Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; by the United States of America 9 August 1945 at 11:02:35 am. Next to the museum is the [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]], built in 2003. The bombing marked a new era in war, making Nagasaki a symbolic location for a memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=T. M.|title=The Making of a Peace Museum Tradition: Case-Studies from Japan and Cambodia|journal=Hiroshima Daigaku|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterpart in [[Hiroshima]] is the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]]. These locations symbolize the nuclear age, remind visitors of the vast destruction and indiscriminate death caused by nuclear weapons, and signify a commitment to peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duff|first=T|title=Civic zones of peace|year=1997|journal=Peace review|volume=9|series=2|pages=199–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nagasaki museum was completed in April 1996, replacing the deteriorating International Culture Hall.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seltz|first=D|title=Remembering the War and the Atomic Bombs: New Museums, New Approaches|journal=Radical history review|year=1999|issue=75|pages=92–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum covers the history of the event as a story, focusing on the attack and the history leading up to it. It also covers the history of [[nuclear weapons]] development. The museum displays photographs, relics, and documents related to the bombing.&lt;ref name="at-n"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at-nagasaki.jp/foreign/english/spot/003.html|title=Learn about the menace of the atomic bomb and the value of peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Museum==
The museum at the Nagasaki Peace Park replaced the Nagasaki International Culture Hall, where artifacts related to the bombing of Nagasaki were originally exhibited. These artifacts are now supplemented with photographs depicting daily life in Nagasaki before the atomic bomb was dropped, the devastation produced by the bomb, and the history of nuclear arms development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/download/leaflet_e.pdf], Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum English language leaflet.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History covered in the museum==
The Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum covers the history of the bombing of [[Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]. It portrays scenes of [[World War II]], the dropping of the atomic bomb, the reconstruction of Nagasaki, and present day. Additionally, the museum exhibits the history of [[nuclear weapons]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum|url=http://www.at-nagasaki.jp/foreign/english/spot/003.html|work=Nagasaki City Tourism Guide Amazing Nagasaki|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atomic bomb was developed by scientists working under the [[Manhattan Project]]. The project was granted funding on December 6, 1941, with American leaders aiming for a new invention that would serve as a wartime weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crane|first=Conrad|title=The Atomic Bomb (6 and 9 August 1945)|url=https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5234.htm|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to drop an atomic bomb on Japan had been made by 1943, and a shortlist of candidate target cities was in place in 1945. At the time, it was argued that an atomic bombing would bring about a more rapid end to the war. Hiroshima, the first target, was selected to show the power of America's new weapon. The second bombing, of Nagasaki, was intended to demonstrate that the [[United States of America|USA]] had a large arsenal.&lt;ref name="z" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Zuberi|first=Martin|title=Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|journal=Strategic Analysis|year=2001|volume=25|series=5|pages=623–662|doi=10.1080/09700160108458986}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 11:02 A.M. local time on August 9, 1945, the atomic bomb, nicknamed [[Fat Man]] as its code name by [[Robert Serber]] [[Fat Man#Naming|in the United States]] (after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Vincent |title=Manhattan: The Army and the Atomic Bomb |publisher=United States Army Center of Military History |location=Washington, DC |year=1985 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/011/11-10/CMH_Pub_11-10.pdf |page=517 |accessdate=25 August 2013|oclc=10913875 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; was dropped on Nagasaki, forever changing the city's landscape.&lt;ref name="z" /&gt;  A mushroom cloud rose to an altitude of 45,000 feet above the city.

Within the museum is a history of the city before the bomb was dropped. The [[hypocenter]] of the explosion was the Urakami district, which was a traditionally rustic and isolated suburb. However, the population soared after the 1920s when the district was chosen as the site for munitions factories. An industrial zone was quickly created. Additionally, the Urakami district was home to the Nagasaki Medical College. When the bomb was dropped at 11:02 A.M. on August 9, 1945, the 20 neighborhoods within a one-kilometer radius of the hypocenter were completely destroyed by the heat flash and blast winds generated by the explosion. They were then reduced to ashes by the fires which followed. Within 2&amp;nbsp;km of the hypocenter, roughly 80% of the houses collapsed and burned. When the smoke cleared, the area was strewn with corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1945.8.9 At 11:02 a.m. August 9, 1945|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/record/photo/part_2_01.html|work=Nagasaki City-Peace &amp; Atomic Bomb|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523122932/http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/record/photo/part_2_01.html|archivedate=May 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction of the city proceeded slowly. It was not until the latter half of 1946 that the first emergency dwellings were provided to the communities. The need for buildings far surpassed the availabilities. As late as 1950, applications for corporate dwellings exceeded the availability ninety times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After the Bomb: Life in the Ruins|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/4_ruins.shtml|author=AtomicBombMuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national government of Japan created a war disaster reconstruction plan in November 1945 which projected a city concept which would abandon the old war industries and focus instead on a revival of foreign trade, shipbuilding, and the fishing industry. Today, the city is considered a peace city and has pledged itself to the mission of world peace.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Terence|title=The Peace Museums of Japan|journal=Museum International|date=28 June 2008|volume=49|issue=4|pages=49–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0033.1997.tb00012.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inside the Museum==
The residents of Nagasaki consider it their duty to make sure the horrors which they experienced due to the atomic bombing are never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/|publisher=Nagasaki Aatomic Bomb Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64zoZgZS7?url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/|archivedate=2012-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the museum is designed in such a way that the audience can see just what effect the bomb had on the city, the reconstruction, and the lasting effects of the atomic bomb. The museum opens with a room dedicated to the city as it was just before the bomb decimated Nagasaki. A clock which stopped at 11:02, the precise time the bomb hit the city, is also on display to demonstrate how so many people were killed in an instant.

In the next section, visitors enter a room which shows Nagasaki just after the bombings. Included in this room is a water tank with contorted legs which was located at Keiho Middle School, approximately 800m away from the hypocenter of the bombing. The section "Events leading up to the Nagasaki Atomic Bombiing" isolates historical events from contemporary biases.&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt; The permanent exhibition rooms display large materials exposed to the blast, as well as a replica of a sidewall of the [[Urakami Cathedral]] which was hit by the bomb.

The purpose is to reproduce the state which the city was in immediately after the bombing. Photographs and facts are shown alongside artifacts left by the deceased.&lt;ref name="nabmb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum Brochure|url=http://www1.city.nagasaki.nagasaki.jp/peace/english/abm/download/leaflet_e.pdf|work=Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the second section contains some of the rosaries found inside the Urakami Cathedral. At the time of the bombing, dozens of people were inside the Cathedral for confession. This section also exhibits a timeline of events which shows a course of events that occurred prior to the bomb being dropped in Nagasaki. Leaflets which American forces dropped on Japan during the early part of 1945 are on display. One gives information on the bombing of Hiroshima and the power of the atomic bomb, warning citizens to leave the city and stop fighting. Also included are melted bottles, the bones of a human hand stuck to a clump of melted glass, burnt clothing, a lunchbox with its contents still charred inside of it, and a helmet with the remains of a victim’s skull on the inner surface. Section B shows damage caused by the [[radiation]], damages caused by the blast, appeals of the [[atomic bomb survivors]], and the rescue and relief activities which were carried out.&lt;ref name="nabmb" /&gt;

After viewing the city scene, museum visitors are invited to think about issues related to war and [[nuclear non-proliferation]]. This section of the museum contains the political sections entitled "The Road to the Atomic Bombing" and "The War between China and Japan and the Pacific War". It is there that the experience of militarism in Japan and the demands of war are juxtaposed with arguments for the end of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref name="dt" /&gt; Visitors are presented with facts on modern [[nuclear weapons]] alongside facts related to victims of the atomic bombing. It is a call for peace and an end of the nuclear age.

The final room in the museum contains videos and documents related to the [[Nagasaki bombing]]. Visitors can also find answers to their questions and documents like Nagasaki’s Peace Declaration.&lt;ref name="nabmb" /&gt;

==Maintenance of Exhibits==
The museum exhibits objects that were exposed to radiation from the atomic bomb. Though some materials are double-cased, display techniques generally are not tailored in any special way for the preservation of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:6vDPJkWZRPAJ:scholar.google.com/+%22nagasaki+atomic+bomb+museum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,9 page 22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
When the museum initially opened in 1966 there was criticism of the re-interpretation of Japanese history. Furthermore, the museum was considered highly political, as it presented only one side of the story and did not promote the concept of peace.&lt;ref name="s" /&gt;

The '''Nepalese scripts''' are alphabetic writing systems of Nepal. They have been used primarily to write [[Newar language|Newah]] (also known locally as [[Nepal Bhasa]]) and Classical Nepalese, but has also been used to transcribe [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

Page 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Some claims it has also been used to write the Pahari Nepali language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lienhard |first=Siegfried |title=Songs of Nepal |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/152599001/Songs-of-Nepal-Siegfried-Lienhard |accessdate=30 September 2013|year=1984 |publisher=Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, University of Hawaii, University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=0-8248-0680-8 |pages=2, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--where in this book did the author write Nepali in Nepalese script--&gt; but all [[Pahari languages]] were traditionally written with the [[Takri alphabet]] and now Devanagari.

The older alphabets, known as '''Nepal Lipi''' or '''Nepal script''', were in widespread use from the 10th to the early 20th-century A.C.E., but have since been largely supplanted by the modern script known as [[Devanagari]].  Of the older scripts, about 50,000 manuscripts written in Nepal Lipi have been archived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/wiki/Category:Manuscripts_written_in_Newari_script Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Nepal, Brahmi scripts also have been used to write [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Braj Bhasha]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&amp;uid=e9c942b88c |title = Writing systems that use this script |last = |first = |publisher =  |date =  |website = Scriptsource |accessdate= 16 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pokharel, Balkrishna (1975).

Page 607. Retrieved 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in the 10th century. The earliest instance is a manuscript entitled ''[[Lankavatara Sutra]]'' dated [[Nepal Era]] 28 (908 AD). Another early specimen is a palm-leaf manuscript of a Buddhist text the ''[[Prajnaparamita]]'', dated Nepal Era 40 (920 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Rebati Ramanananda (2001). ''Newah.'' Lalitpur: Sahityaya Mulukha. Page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest manuscript of Ramayana, preserved till date, was written in Nepal Script in 1041.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120818172407/http://serveveda.org/?p=87 Institute of Scientific Research on Vedas]&lt;/ref&gt;

The script has been used on stone and copper plate inscriptions, coins ([[Nepalese mohar]]), palm-leaf documents and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendall|first=Cecil |year=1883 |title=Catalogue of the Buddhist Sanskrit Manuscripts in the University Library, Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge: At the University Press |url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogueofbuddh00camb#page/n301/mode/2up |accessdate=21 August 2012|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.asianart.com/articles/inscriptions/index.html#3 |title= Nepalese Inscriptions in the Rubin Collection |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the different scripts based on Nepal script, [[Ranjana script|Ranjana]] (meaning "delightful"), [[Bhujimol|Bhujinmol]] ("fly-headed") and [[Prachalit Nepal script|Prachalit]] ("ordinary") are the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lienhard |first=Siegfried |title=Songs of Nepal |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/152599001/Songs-of-Nepal-Siegfried-Lienhard |accessdate=30 September 2013|year=1984 |publisher=Center for Asian and Pacific Studies, University of Hawaii, University of Hawaii Press |location=Hawaii |isbn=0-8248-0680-8 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranjana is the most ornate among the scripts. It is most commonly used to write Buddhist texts and inscribe [[mantra]]s on prayer wheels, shrines, temples, and monasteries. The popular Buddhist mantra ''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' (meaning ("Hail to the jewel in the lotus" in Sanskrit) is often written in Ranjana.

Besides the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and the [[Himalaya]]n region in [[Nepal]], the Ranjana script is used for sacred purposes in [[Tibet]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Mongolia]], [[Bhutan]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= Ranjana Alphabet |url= |accessdate=|newspaper= |publisher= Lipi Thapu Guthi|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jokhang]] Temple in [[Lhasa]], Tibet is ornamented with mantras embossed in Ranjana script, and the panels under the eaves are numbered using Nepal Lipi.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Kamal Ratna (second edition 2011). ''Caravan to Lhasa: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet.'' Kathmandu: Lijala and Tisa. {{ISBN|99946-58-91-3}}. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the famed historical texts written in Nepal Lipi are ''Gopalarajavamsavali'', a history of Nepal, which appeared in 1389 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Vajracarya, Dhanavajra and Malla, Kamal P. (1985). ''The Gopalarajavamsavali.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH.&lt;/ref&gt; the Nepal-Tibet treaty of Nepal Era 895 (1775 AD) and a letter dated Nepal Era 535 (1415 AD) sent by Chinese Emperor Tai Ming to Shakti-simha-rama, a feudatory of [[Banepa]].&lt;ref&gt;Tamot, Kashinath (2009).

Pages 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Rolamba|publisher=|date=April–June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

The different scripts derived from Nepal script are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Shakyavansha, Hemraj (1993, eighth edition). ''Nepalese Alphabet.'' Kathmandu: Mandas Lumanti Prakashan.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ranjana script]]
* [[Nepal script]]
** [[Bhujimol]] typeface
** [[Litumol script|Litumol typeface]]
* Kunmol script
* Kwenmol script
* Golmol script
* Pachumol script
* Hinmol script
* [[Prachalit Nepal script]]

==Decline==

Nepalese scripts saw a widespread use for a thousand years in Nepal. In 1906, the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] regime banned Nepal Bhasa, [[Nepal Era]] and Nepal Lipi from official use as part of its policy to subdue them, and the script fell into decline.

Authors were also encouraged to switch to [[Devanagari]] to write Nepal Bhasa because of the availability of moveable type for printing, and Nepal Lipi was pushed further into the background.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-56-00-X}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the script continued to be used for religious and ceremonial purposes till the 1950s.

==Revival==

After the Rana dynasty was overthrown and democracy established in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, T. Louise (1996). ''The Challenge to Democracy in Nepal: A Political History.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-08576-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-08576-2}}. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; restrictions on Nepal Bhasa were lifted. Attempts were made to study and revive the old scripts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sada|first=Ivan|title=Interview: Hem Raj Shakya|url=http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=177|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=ECS Nepal|publisher=|date=March 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126233320/http://www.ecs.com.np/feature_detail.php?f_id=177|archivedate=26 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and alphabet books were published. Hemraj Shakyavamsha published an alphabet book of 15 types of Nepalese alphabets including Ranjana, Bhujimol and Pachumol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Nepal Lipi Sangraha|url=http://50.57.175.244:8001/xmlui/bitstream/10887/858/1/20100108.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=Gorkhapatra|publisher=|date=20 April 1953}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, a pressman [[Pushpa Ratna Sagar]] of Kathmandu had moveable type of Nepal script made in India. The metal type was used to print the dateline and the titles of the articles in ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title= A man of letters|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2009/03/22/expression/a-man-of-letters/185728.html|accessdate=23 February 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date= 22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the first book to be printed using a computer typeface of Nepal script, ''Prasiddha Bajracharyapinigu Sanchhipta Bibaran'' ("Profiles of Renowned Bajracharyas") by Badri Ratna Bajracharya, was published.

Today, Nepal Lipi has gone out of general usage, but it is sometimes used in signage, invitation and greeting cards, letterheads, book and CD covers, product labels and the mastheads of newspapers. A number of private organizations are engaged in its study and promotion.

Nepal Lipi (with the name “Newa”) was [https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14285r-newa.pdf] approved for inclusion in Unicode 9.0.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1600">In [[biogeography]], particularly [[phytogeography]], the '''nunatak hypothesis''' about the origin of a biota in formerly glaciated areas is the idea that some or many species have survived the inhospitable period on icefree land such as [[nunatak]]s. Its antithesis is the ''[[tabula rasa#Biogeography|tabula rasa hypothesis]]'', which posits that all species have immigrated into completely denuded land after the retreat of glaciers.

By the mid-20th Century, the nunatak hypothesis was widely accepted among biologists working on the floras of [[Greenland]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/pdf/aegisdottir2004.pdf Ægisdóttir, Hafdís Hanna &amp; Þórhallsdóttir, Þóra Ellen (2004) Theories on migration and history of the North-Atlantic flora: a review. JÖKULL No. 54: 1-15]&lt;/ref&gt; However, while modern geology has established the presence of icefree areas during the last glacial maximum in both [[Greenland]] and [[Scandinavia]], molecular techniques have revealed limited between-region genetic differentiation in many [[Arctic]] [[taxon|taxa]], strongly suggesting a general capacity for long-distance dispersal among polar organisms. This does not directly disprove glacial survival. But it makes it less necessary as an explanation. Moreover, populations that survived on icefree land have probably in most cases been genetically flooded by postglacial immigrants.

{{Governance}}
{{distinguish redirect|Open source government|Adoption of free and open-source software by public institutions{{!}}Open source software in government}}
'''Open-source governance''' (also known as '''open politics''') is a [[political philosophy]] which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open-source]] and [[open-content]] movements to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy, as with a [[wiki]] document. Legislation is democratically opened to the general citizenry, employing their [[collective wisdom]] to benefit the decision-making process and improve democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=450zYUjsPNQC&amp;pg=PT56 Open-source democracy: how online communication is changing offline politics] by [[Douglas Rushkoff]], published by [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]]. Page 56 et al&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories on how to constrain, limit or enable this participation vary.  Accordingly, there is no one dominant theory of how to go about authoring legislation with this approach. There are a wide array of projects and movements which are working on building open-source governance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects|title=Related projects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Left-libertarianism|left-libertarian]] and [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] organizations around the globe have begun advocating open-source governance and its related political ideas as a reformist alternative to current governance systems. Often, these groups have their origins in [[decentralization|decentralized]] structures such as the Internet and place particular importance on the need for anonymity to protect an individual's right to free speech in democratic systems. Opinions vary, however, not least because the principles behind open-source government are still very loosely defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1841026/Upholding_online_anonymity_in_Internet_governance_Affordances_ethical_frameworks_and_regulatory_practices|title=Upholding online anonymity in Internet governance: Affordances, ethical frameworks, and regulatory practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of the principles ==

In practice, several applications have evolved and been used by actual democratic institutions in the developed world:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wwxKluxdL-kC&amp;pg=PT369 Service-oriented architecture governance for the services driven enterprise]; Eric A. Marks&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Open-government]] mechanisms including those for public participation and engagement, such as the use of [[IdeaScale]], [[Google Moderator]], [[Semantic MediaWiki]], GitHub, and other software by actual ruling governments – these mechanisms are well-developed, especially in the UK and the USA.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gfzzrnHy5cQC&amp;pg=PA241 Knowledge governance: processes and perspectives]; Snejina Michailova, [[Nicolai J. Foss]], [[Oxford University Press]]. Page 241 et al&lt;/ref&gt; or by civil society and citizens directly for example, Opengovpioneers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opengovpioneers.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page|title=Open Government Pioneer Project|website=opengovpioneers.miraheze.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK.
*[[Open politics|Open-politics]] [[web forum|forums]] and [[wiki]]s, where political issues and arguments can be debated, either within or between political party constraints, taking three distinct forms:
**Political-party-platform development, in which ideas are solicited from anyone or almost anyone and openly discussed to a point but the ranking and devotion of resources to developing ideas is reserved to party members or supporters. A variant is the non-partisan think-tank or citizen-advocacy group-platform development as has become common in Canada, for example the [[Dominion Institute]] policywiki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/as-one-experiment-ends-a-new-one-begins-for-policy-wiki/article654853/  As one experiment ends, a new one begins for Policy Wiki] [[The Globe and Mail]] / [[Dominion Institute]] policywiki&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Citizen journalism]] forums obeying stricter rules to ensure equal [[power relationship]]s than is typically the case in blogs, strictly designed to balance libel and [[free speech]] laws for a local jurisdiction (following laws strictly is part of the open politics ideal).
**Open party mechanisms to actually govern and operate formal political parties without the usual insider politics and interest groups that historically have taken over such parties;  these experiments have been limited and typically take the form of parties run by referenda or online. An example of this is Italy's [[Five Star Movement]].
*In the [[California Assembly]], [[Crowdsourced legislation]] via a 'wiki bills' website is being initiated via an online wiki, with an introduction deadline of early February, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;(Jan 8, 2015) "[http://www.crescentavalleyweekly.com/news/01/08/2015/gatto-promotes-wiki-bill-project/ Gatto Promotes 'Wiki Bill' project]" ''Crescenta Valley Weekly'' '''6'''(19) p.1,8 accessdate=2015-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hybrid mechanisms which attempt to provide journalistic coverage, political platform development, political transparency, strategic advice, and critique of a ruling government of the same party all at the same time.  [[Dkosopedia]] is the best known example of this.

Some models are significantly more sophisticated than a plain wiki, incorporating semantic tags, levels of control or scoring to mediate disputes – however this always risks empowering a clique of moderators more than would be the case given their trust position within the democratic entity – a parallel to the common wiki problem of [[official vandalism]] by persons entrusted with power by owners or publishers (so-called "sysop vandalism" or "administrative censorship").

== Common and simultaneous policy ==

Some advocates of these approaches, by analogy to software code, argue{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} for a "central codebase" in the form of a set of policies that are maintained in a public registry and that are ''infinitely reproducible''. "[[Distribution (business)|Distributions]]" of this policy-base are released (periodically or dynamically) for use in localities, which can apply "patches" to customize them for their own use.  Localities are also able to cease subscribing to the central policy-base and "fork" it or adopt someone else's policy-base. In effect, the government stems from emergent cooperation and self-correction among members of a community. As the policies are put into practice in a number of localities, problems and issues are identified and solved, and where appropriate communicated back to the core.

These goals for instance were cited often during the [[Green Party of Canada]]'s experiments with open-political-platform development.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}  As one of over a hundred national [[Green party]] entities worldwide and the ability to co-ordinate policy among provincial and municipal equivalents within Canada, it was in a good position to maintain just such a central repository of policy, despite being legally separate from those other entities.

== Difference from prior initiatives ==
Open-source governance differs from previous open-government initiatives in its broader emphasis on collaborative processes.

==History==
The "Imagine Halifax" (IH) project was designed to create a citizens' forum for elections in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in fall 2004.  Founded by Angela Bischoff, the widow of [[Tooker Gomberg]], a notable advocate of combining [[direct action]] with open politics methods, IH brought a few dozen activists together to compile a platform (using live meetings and email and seedwiki followup).  When it became clear that candidates could not all endorse all elements of the platform, it was then turned into questions for candidates in the election.  The best ideas from candidates were combined with the best from activists – the final scores reflected a combination of convergence and originality.  In contrast to most such questionnaires, it was easier for candidates to excel by contributing original thought than by simply agreeing.  One high scorer, [[Andrew Younger]], had not been involved with the project originally but was elected and appeared on TV with project leader [[Martin Willison]].  The project had not only changed its original goal from a partisan platform to a citizen questionnaire, but it had recruited a previously uninvolved candidate to its cause during the election.  A key output of this effort was a [[glossary]] of about 100 keywords relevant to municipal laws.

The 2004–05 [[Green Party of Canada#Internet innovation|Green Party of Canada Living Platform]] was a much more planned and designed effort at open politics.  As it prepared itself for an electoral breakthrough in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the [[Green Party of Canada]] began to compile citizen, member and expert opinions in preparation of its platform.  During the election, it gathered input even from [[Internet troll]]s including supporters of other parties, with no major problems: [[anonymity]] was respected and, if they were within the terms of use, comments remained intact.  Despite, or perhaps because of, its early success, it was derailed by [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], the party's leader, when he discovered that it was a threat to his status as a [[party boss]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The Living Platform split off as another service entirely out of GPC control and eventually evolved into OpenPolitics.ca&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.uniteddiversity.com/Decision_Making_and_Democracy/Decision_Making_Handout.pdf Decision Making Handout]&lt;/ref&gt; and a service to promote wiki usage among citizens and  political groups.

The [[Liberal Party of Canada]] also attempted a deep policy renewal effort in conjunction with its leadership race in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://annemclellan.com/edmonton2_e.pdf Liberal Party of Canada Renewal Commission, Notes from Task Force on Women Meeting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.ca/|title=Liberal Party of Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While candidates in that race, notably [[Carolyn Bennett]], [[Stéphane Dion]] and [[Michael Ignatieff]], all made efforts to facilitate web-threaded policy-driven conversations between supporters, all failed to create lateral relationships and thus also failed to contribute much to the policy renewal effort.

Numerous very different projects related to open-source governance collaborate under the umbrella of the [[Metagovernment]] project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects|title=Active projects|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metagovernment uses the term "collaborative governance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance|title=Collaborative governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are building platforms of open-source governance.

A more extensive [http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects list of these and similar organizations] is available externally.

The New Zealand Police Act Review was a wiki used to solicit public commentary during the public consultation period of the acts review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.policeact.govt.nz/ New Zealand Police Act Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410175829/http://wiki.policeact.govt.nz/ |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey reported that the motivation for her work was personal uncertainty about the nature and accuracy of models, estimates and assumptions used to prepare policies released with the 2014 Australian Federal Government Budget, and whether and to what extent their real world impact is assessed following implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2015/Case_Room_3/Wednesday/Evaluating_Government_Policies_Using_Open_Source_Models.webm|title=Evaluating Government Policies Using Open Source Models|author=Audrey Lobo-Pulo|accessdate=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A white paper on "Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models" was released on September 10, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phoensight.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Phoensight-Evaluating-Government-Policies-using-Open-Source-Models-Sept-2015-1.pdf|title=Evaluating Government Policies using Open Source Models|work=Phoensight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open politics as a distinct theory {{anchor|Open politics}} ==

The open-politics theory, a narrow application of open-source governance, combines aspects of the [[free software]] and [[open-content]] movements, promoting [[decision-making]] methods claimed to be more open, less antagonistic, and more capable of determining what is in the [[public interest]] with respect to [[public policy]] issues.  It takes special care for instance to deal with equity differences, geographic constraints, defamation versus free political speech, accountability to persons affected by decisions, and the actual standing law and institutions of a jurisdiction.  There is also far more focus on compiling actual positions taken by real entities than developing theoretical "best" answers or "solutions".  One example, [http://discoursedb.org DiscourseDB], simply lists articles pro and con a given position without organizing their argument or evidence in any way.

While some interpret it as an example of "open-source politics", open politics is not a top–down theory but a set of best practices from [[citizen journalism]], [[participatory democracy]] and [[deliberative democracy]], informed by [[e-democracy]] and [[netroots]] experiments, applying argumentation framework for issue-based argument as they evolved in academic and military use through the 1980s to present.  Some variants of it draw on the theory of [[scientific method]] and [[market method]]s, including [[prediction market]]s and [[anticipatory democracy]].

Its advocates often engage in legal lobbying and advocacy to directly change laws in the way of the broader application of the technology, e.g. opposing [[political libel]] cases in Canada, fighting [[libel chill]] generally, and calling for clarification of privacy and human rights law especially as they relate to citizen journalism.  They are less focused on tools although the [[semantic mediawiki]] and [[tikiwiki]] platforms seem to be generally favored above all others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8464">'''Peak signal-to-noise ratio''', often abbreviated '''PSNR''', is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] and the power of corrupting [[noise]] that affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide [[dynamic range]], PSNR is usually expressed in terms of the [[logarithm]]ic [[decibel]] scale.

== Definition ==
PSNR is most easily defined via the [[mean squared error]] (''MSE''). Given a noise-free ''m''×''n'' monochrome image ''I'' and its noisy approximation ''K'', ''MSE'' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MSE} = \frac{1}{m\,n}\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} [I(i,j) - K(i,j)]^2&lt;/math&gt;

The PSNR (in [[decibel|dB]]) is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\mathit{PSNR} &amp;= 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\mathit{MAX}_I^2}{\mathit{MSE}} \right)\\ 
&amp;= 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\mathit{MAX}_I}{\sqrt{\mathit{MSE}}} \right)\\ 
&amp;= 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( {\mathit{MAX}_I} \right) - 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( {{\mathit{MSE}}} \right)\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''MAX&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. More generally, when samples are represented using linear [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] with ''B'' bits per sample, ''MAX&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;var&gt;B&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;−1.

=== Application in color images ===
For [[color image]]s with three [[RGB]] values per pixel, the definition of PSNR is the same except the MSE is the sum over all squared value differences divided by image size and by three. Alternately, for color images the image is converted to a different [[color space]] and PSNR is reported against each channel of that color space, e.g., [[YCbCr]] or [[HSL and HSV|HSL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oriani|first=Emanuele|title=qpsnr: A quick PSNR/SSIM analyzer for Linux|url=http://qpsnr.youlink.org/|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pnmpsnr User Manual|url=http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pnmpsnr.html|accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality estimation with PSNR ==
PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression [[codec]]s (e.g., for [[image compression]]). The signal in this case is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by compression. When comparing compression codecs, PSNR is an ''approximation'' to human perception of reconstruction quality.

Typical values for the PSNR in [[lossy compression|lossy]] image and video compression are between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;dB, provided the bit depth is 8&amp;nbsp;[[bit]]s, where higher is better. For 16-bit data typical values for the PSNR are between 60 and 80&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welstead|first=Stephen T.|title=Fractal and wavelet image compression techniques|year=1999|publisher=SPIE Publication|isbn=978-0-8194-3503-3|pages=155–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evGyv-mogukC&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raouf Hamzaoui, Dietmar Saupe|title=Fractal Image Compression|journal=Document and image compression|date=May 2006|volume=968|pages=168–169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmqPOsEYRsEC&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=image%20compression%20acceptable%20PSNR&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q=PSNR&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 April 2011|editor1-first=Mauro|editor1-last=Barni|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849335563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable values for wireless transmission quality loss are considered to be about 20&amp;nbsp;dB to 25&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;Thomos, N., Boulgouris, N.

ICME 2007 (pp. 947-950). School of Computer Engineering, [[Nanyang Technological University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of noise, the two images ''I'' and ''K'' are identical, and thus the MSE is zero. In this case the PSNR is infinite (or undefined, see [[Division by zero]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=David|title=Data Compression: The Complete Reference|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1846286025|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujnQogzx_2EC&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;ots=FolwqB8qsN&amp;dq=PSNR%20infinite&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q=PSNR%20infinite&amp;f=false|edition=4|accessdate=26 July 2012|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance comparison ==
Although a higher PSNR generally indicates that the reconstruction is of higher quality, in some cases it may not. One has to be extremely careful with the range of validity of this metric; it is only conclusively valid when it is used to compare results from the same codec (or codec type) and same content.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huynh-Thu|first1=Q.|last2=Ghanbari|first2=M.|year=2008|title=Scope of validity of PSNR in image/video quality assessment|journal=Electronics Letters|volume=44|issue=13|pages=800|doi=10.1049/el:20080522|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/xiphmont/Public/theora/demo7.html MIT.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, PSNR has been shown to perform poorly compared to other [[Video quality|quality metrics]] when it comes to estimating the [[Image quality|quality of images]] and particularly videos as perceived by humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh-Thu|first=Quan|last2=Ghanbari|first2=Mohammed|date=2012-01-01|title=The accuracy of PSNR in predicting video quality for different video scenes and frame rates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11235-010-9351-x|journal=Telecommunication Systems|language=en|volume=49|issue=1|pages=35–48|doi=10.1007/s11235-010-9351-x|issn=1018-4864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17720">'''Product lifetime''' or '''product lifespan''' is the time interval from when a product is sold to when it is discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is slightly different from [[service life]] because the latter consider only the effective time the product is used.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In recent years, there has been a growth in academic and policy discussions around product lifetimes. For example, discussion of product lifetimes are an integral part of the European Commission's action plan for the circular economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:8a8ef5e8-99a0-11e5-b3b7-01aa75ed71a1.0012.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF|title=Closing the loop - An EU action plan for the Circular Economy|last=European Commission|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In academia, the PLATE (Product Lifetimes and the Environment) Consortium hosts regular conferences and seminars around the topic of product lifetimes and the environment (see: http://www.plateconference.org/).

This article examines how product lifetimes are defined in the academic literature and discusses how product lifetimes can be measured. A distinction is made between the definition and measurement of ''actual'' and ''expected'' product lifetimes.

== Defining product lifetimes ==

Definitions of product lifetimes vary depending on what aspects those conducting research are interested in. Generally, actual product lifetimes refer to the actual time that a product exists in a particular state.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In contrast, expected product lifetimes refer to users' expectations for the lifetime of a product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, actual and expected product lifetimes are influenced by durability and longevity; these concepts are briefly outlined below.

Durability is described by Cooper&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond recycling: the longer life option|last=Cooper, T.|publisher=New Economics Foundation|year=1994|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal use conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). In contrast, longevity encompasses more than just the material properties of the product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cooper&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; notes that user behaviour, and broader social and cultural trends play important roles in the product's longevity. The paragraphs below outline the definitions of actual and expected product lifetimes.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Exhaustive work has been undertaken by Murakami et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Shinsuke|last2=Oguchi|first2=Masahiro|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part I|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=598–612|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00250.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oguchi|first=Masahiro|last2=Murakami|first2=Shinsuke|last3=Tasaki|first3=Tomohiro|last4=Daigo|first4=Ichiro|last5=Hashimoto|first5=Seiji|date=2010-08-01|title=Lifespan of Commodities, Part II|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=613–626|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00251.x|issn=1530-9290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to outline several definitions and discuss methods for identifying actual product lifetimes. Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; identify the following overarching concepts in product lifetime definitions which are discussed below: Age, Residential time, Service life, Possession span and Duration of use.

==== Age ====
A product's age is the time from when the product was created to either the present or "the time of interest" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 600) for the researchers.

==== Residential time ====
Residential time is considered to be time in which a product, its constituent materials and parts, exists in society.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Residential time includes the time in which a product may be broken and/ or discarded.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Service life ====
{{Main|Service life}}

According to Murkami et al.,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the service life of a product refers to the duration of time for which products continue to work and can be used.

==== Possession span ====
The possession span is the period of time that a user has possession of the product.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Duration of use ====
The duration of use indicates how long a user uses the product for.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Murkami et al.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; distinguish duration of use from [[Service life]] by noting that duration of use is measured for a specific user, whereas [[Service life]] describes the total in-service use of the product for all its users (accounting for transfers of ownership e.g. reuse). Additionally, possession span is distinguished from duration of use, as possession span includes "dead storage" (:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 601) time, where a product is owned by a user but not in use (i.e. in storage).

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
A conference paper by Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/28621/|title=Electronics Goes Green 2016+ Conference|last=Oguchi, M., Tasaki, T., Daigo, I., Cooper, T., Cole, C. and Gnanapragasam, A.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=|chapter=Consumers' expectations for product lifetimes of consumer durables.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to identify and test differences in definitions of product lifetime expectations. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; illustrated that previous research into expected product lifetimes has been inconsistent in its use of the term expected product lifetimes. For example, Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|title=Inadequate Life? Evidence of Consumer Attitudes to Product Obsolescence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10603-004-2284-6|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=421–449|doi=10.1007/s10603-004-2284-6|issn=0168-7034}}&lt;/ref&gt; enquires about "reasonable" expected lifetimes, while Brook Lyndhurst&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.brooklyndhurst.co.uk/public-understanding-of-product-lifetimes-and-durability-_156.html|title=Public understanding of product lifetimes and durability (1)|last=Brook Lyndhurst|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|year=2011|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Jayne|last2=Griffith|first2=Sarah|last3=Giorgi|first3=Sara|last4=King|first4=Geoff|date=2013-10-01|title=Consumer understanding of product lifetimes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092134491300102X|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|series=SI: Resourceful Behaviours|volume=79|pages=21–29|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discusses "normal" expected lifetimes. Wieser et al.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Wieser, H., Tröger, N. and Hübner, R.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=The consumers’ desired and expected product lifetimes|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified the tension between everyday expectations and desires, distinguishing between these expectations in his study of 21 products. In addition, earlier work by Tasaki et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=智宏|first=田崎|last2=淳|first2=寺園|last3=祐一|first3=森口|date=2004-01-01|title=長期使用とリュース促進のための家電製品・パソコンの廃棄行動実態とその行動要因の調査|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jswme1990/15/4/15_4_310/_article/-char/ja/|journal=廃棄物学会論文誌|volume=15|issue=4|pages=310–319|doi=10.3985/jswme.15.310}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recent work by WRAP&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-longevity-measuring-active-use|title=Clothing longevity and measuring active use|last=Langley, E., Durkacz, S. and Tanase, S.|publisher=WRAP|year=2013|isbn=|location=Banbury|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have asked users to report both how long they have owned an item for, and how long they expect to use the item for in future: WRAP&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; term this "active use". Building on these previous studies (''described above''), Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; identified and tested three distinct definitions of expected product lifetimes, these are outlined below.

==== Intended lifetime ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; define the intended lifetime as the length of time for which a user intends to use the product in question.

==== Ideal lifetime ====
The ideal length of time for which a user expects their product to last. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; describe this as "the highest preference of consumers".

==== Predicted lifetime ====
The realist prediction by the user of how long a product will last. The user is thought to make this prediction based on their previous experiences and "other relevant factors" (Oguhci et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;).

== Measuring product lifetimes ==
Academic enquiry into the product lifetimes of electrical and electronic equipment was undertaken in 2000 by Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/6671/|title=Prospects for household appliances|author1=Cooper, T.  |author2=Mayers, K.|publisher=Sheffield Hallam University for E-SCOPE|year=2000|isbn=|location=Sheffield|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted household interviews and focus groups to establish the age at discard (actual product lifetime) and expected lifetimes for 17 products. Since this study, work has been undertaken by other academics into measuring actual and expected product lifetimes; the methods employed are outlined below.

=== Actual product lifetimes ===
Actual product lifetimes can be measured using a variety of methods which include: product testing, discard surveys, user interviews and modelling. These are discussed below.

==== Product testing ====
Products can be tested under laboratory conditions to assess their lifetime under different conditions of use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Discard surveys ====
Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; identify that surveys of waste treatment and recycling facilities can provide information on the age of the appliance at break or discard. Identifying information such as the product serial and/ or batch number can be used to find out a date of manufacturer from which the age of the appliance at break or discard can be calculated.

==== User interviews ====
Cooper and Mayers&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; conducted household [[interview]]s to establish the age of 17 electrical and electronic items at discard and break. However it has been noted that user interviews are subject to the accuracy of [[memory]], and that reviews of products which have failed in the past only provides information on "a historical situation" (:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;10), not taking into account the features and lifetime of extant products.

==== Modelling ====
Product lifetimes can be modelled using extant data from surveys with the application of [[probability]] and other [[Statistics|statistical concepts]] (e.g. [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www4.ntu.ac.uk/plate_conference/proceedings/index.html|title=Product Lifetimes and The Environment|last=Oguchi, M.|publisher=Nottingham Trent University|year=2015|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=388–393|chapter=Methodologies for estimating actual lifetime distribution of products|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to estimate product lifetimes was undertaken by Pennock and Jaeger&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pennock|first=Jean L.|last2=Jaeger|first2=Carol M.|date=1957-06-01|title=Estimating the Service Life of Household Goods by Actuarial Methods|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|volume=52|issue=278|pages=175–185|doi=10.1080/01621459.1957.10501377|issn=0162-1459}}&lt;/ref&gt; who utilised actuarial methods to measure the [[Service life]] of household goods for one owner. In the 1990s, Bayus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|date=1991-01-01|title=The Consumer Durable Replacement Buyer|jstor=1252202|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–51|doi=10.2307/1252202}}&lt;/ref&gt; modelled car replacement rates and Bayus and Gupta&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bayus|first=Barry L.|last2=Gupta|first2=Sachin|date=1992-08-01|title=An empirical analysis of consumer durable replacement intentions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016781169290021C|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|volume=9|issue=3|pages=257–267|doi=10.1016/0167-8116(92)90021-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated the user decision making process and factors around replacement car purchases.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 2010, Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; proposed modelling product lifetimes factoring the total number of products shipped and discarded in a year. Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; outlined a series of equations which represent lifespan distributions for a given product at a particular point in time.

=== Expected product lifetimes ===
Expected product lifetimes are measured at the individual level using survey methods and collectively using focus groups. With the exception of Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and Wieser et al.,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; many studies into expected product lifetimes have not distinguished between the different definitions (outlined above). The methods for measuring expected product lifetimes are outlined below.

==== Survey methods ====
Survey methods into expected product lifetimes encompass [[Online Questionnaires|online questionnaires]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; household&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and telephone&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Echegaray|first=Fabián|date=2016-10-15|title=Consumers' reactions to product obsolescence in emerging markets: the case of Brazil|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652615012202|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|series=Special Volume: Transitions to Sustainable Consumption and Production in Cities|volume=134, Part A|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[interview]]s. These studies asked individual participants to report their expectations for product lifetimes in units of time. Survey methods (such as Oguchi et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) can also use [[Likert scale|Likert items]] to evaluate if current products meet users expectations with regards to durability and longevity.

==== Focus groups ====
[[Focus group]]s can be convened where participants take part in discussions to reach a group consensus on product lifetime expectations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Project Lyra''' is a feasibility study of a mission to the [[interstellar object]] [[ʻOumuamua]], initiated on the {{date|30 October 2017|in astronomy}} by the [[Initiative for Interstellar Studies]] (i4is).&lt;ref name=EA&gt;[https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/how-we-could-explore-that-interstellar-asteroid IEEE Spectrum: How We Could Explore That Interstellar Asteroid by Evan Ackerman (29th Nov. 2017) ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SA-1&gt;Scientific American: "SpaceX’s Planned Giant Rocket Could Chase Down Interstellar Asteroid" (29th Nov. 2017) | https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacex-rsquo-s-planned-giant-rocket-could-chase-down-interstellar-asteroid/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UT-1&gt;Universe Today: "Project Lyra, A Mission to Chase Down That Interstellar Asteroid" | [https://www.universetoday.com/137960/project-lyra-mission-chase-interstellar-asteroid-1/ PROJECT LYRA, A MISSION TO CHASE DOWN THAT INTERSTELLAR ASTEROID] Matt Williams, 24 Nov, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra/&gt;

==Overview==
The suggested options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years are based on using first a Jupiter [[Planetary flyby |flyby]] followed by a close solar [[Planetary flyby |flyby]] at 3 solar radii in order to take advantage of the [[Oberth effect]] or more advanced options such as a [[solar sails|solar sail]] and a [[Laser propulsion |laser sail]].&lt;ref name="Hein2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|W9Pr8mQoiRM|Oumuamua interstellar}} Xuất bản 26 thg 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
The [[Initiative for Interstellar Studies]] (i4is) launched Project Lyra to assess the feasibility of a mission to ʻOumuamua.&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Lyra – A Mission to ʻOumuamua |url=https://i4is.org/what-we-do/technical/project-lyra/ |website=I4IS |publisher=Initiative for Interstellar Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several options for sending a spacecraft to ʻOumuamua within a time-frame of 5 to 10 years were suggested. One option is using first a Jupiter flyby followed by a close solar flyby at {{convert|3|solar radius|e6km e6mi|sigfig=2|lk=in}} in order to take advantage of the [[Oberth effect]].&lt;ref name="Hein2017"&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=A.M. |last=Hein |first2=N. |last2=Perakis |first3=K.F. |last3=Long |first4=A. |last4=Crowl |first5=M. |last5=Eubanks |first6=R.G., III |last6=Kennedy |first7=R. |last7=Osborne |year=2017 |title=Project Lyra: Sending a Spacecraft to 1I/ʻOumuamua (former A/2017 U1), the Interstellar Asteroid |eprint=1711.03155 |class=physics.space-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mission durations and their velocity requirements were explored with respect to the launch date, assuming direct impulsive transfer to the intercept trajectory. Using a powered Jupiter flyby, a solar Oberth maneuver and Parker Solar Probe heat shield technology, a Falcon Heavy-class launcher would be able to launch a spacecraft of dozens of kilograms towards 1I/ʻOumuamua, if launched in 2021.{{CN|date=November 2018}} More advanced options of using solar, laser electric, and laser sail propulsion, based on [[Breakthrough Starshot]] technology, have also been considered. 

The challenge is to get to the asteroid in a reasonable amount of time (and so at a reasonable distance from Earth), and yet be able to gain useful scientific information. To do this, decelerating the spacecraft at ʻOumuamua would be "highly desirable, due to the minimal science return from a hyper-velocity encounter".&lt;ref name="Hein2017" /&gt; If the investigative craft goes too fast, it would not be able to get into orbit or land on the asteroid and would fly past it. The authors conclude that, although challenging, an encounter mission would be feasible using near-term technology.&lt;ref name="Hein2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProjectLyra /&gt; Seligman and Laughlin&lt;ref name="ARX-20180412"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Seligman |first1=Darryl |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |title=The Feasibility and Benefits of in situ Exploration of ʻOumuamua-like Objects |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=155 |issue=5 |pages=217 |date=12 April 2018 |arxiv=1803.07022v2|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aabd37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopt a complementary approach to the Lyra study but also conclude that such missions, though challenging to mount, are both feasible and scientifically attractive.

In [[mathematics]], a '''quasitoric manifold''' is a topological analogue of the [[Toric variety#Resolution of Singularities|nonsingular]] projective [[toric variety]] of [[algebraic geometry]]. A [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold]] is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an [[Torus#n-dimensional torus|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional torus]], with [[orbit space]] an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Simple polytope|simple]] [[Convex polytope|convex]] [[polytope]].

Quasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; who called them "toric manifolds". However, the term "quasitoric manifold" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth [[toric variety|toric varieties]], which are known to algebraic geometers as [[toric manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and T. Panov, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in [[algebraic topology]], such as [[Complex cobordism|complex cobordism theory]], and the other oriented [[Cohomology theory|cohomology theories]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Denote the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th subcircle of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-torus &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;T_1 \times \ldots \times T_n = T^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then coordinate-wise multiplication of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''standard representation'''.

Given open sets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that are closed under the [[Group action|action]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;, a &lt;math&gt;T^{n}&lt;/math&gt;-action on &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be '''locally isomorphic''' to the standard representation if &lt;math&gt;h(tx) = \alpha(t)h(x)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a [[homeomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an [[automorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a simple convex polytope &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; [[Facet (mathematics)|facets]], a &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''quasitoric manifold over''' &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; if,

# the &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-action is locally isomorphic to the standard representation,
# there is a [[projection map|projection]] &lt;math&gt;\pi : M^{2n} \rightarrow P^n&lt;/math&gt; that maps each &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional orbit to a point in the interior of an &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Face (geometry)|face]] of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;l = 0,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;...,&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition implies that the fixed points of &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; under the &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;-action are mapped to the vertices of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope.

==The dicharacteristic function==
A quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a '''dicharacteristic function''' and an associated '''dicharacteristic matrix'''. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets &lt;math&gt;F_1,\dots,F_m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; are ordered so that the intersection &lt;math&gt;F_{1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^{n}&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''initial vertex'''.

A '''dicharacteristic function''' is a [[homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda : T^m \rightarrow T^n&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[codimension]]-&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; face of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monomorphism]] on restriction to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1} \times  \dots  \times T_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt;.

The restriction of &amp;lambda; to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_1 \times \ldots \times T_n&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the initial vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism, and so &lt;math&gt;\lambda(T_1), \ldots, \lambda(T_n)&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be a basis for the [[Lie algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;T^n&lt;/math&gt;. The [[epimorphism]] of Lie algebras associated to &amp;lambda; may be described as a linear transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, represented by the &lt;math&gt; n \times m&lt;/math&gt; '''dicharacteristic matrix''' &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{1, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{1, m}\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{2, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{2, m}\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; \lambda_{n, n+1} &amp; \dots &amp; \lambda_{n, m}
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th column of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a primitive vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i = (\lambda_{1, i}, \dots, \lambda_{n, i})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''facet vector'''.  As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap  \dots  \cap F_{i_n}&lt;/math&gt; meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i_1}, \dots \lambda_{i_n}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with determinant equal to &lt;math&gt;\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[Isotropy group#Orbits and stabilizers|isotropy subgroup]] associated to each facet &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is described by

::&lt;math&gt; \{(e^{2\pi i \theta\lambda_{1,i}}, \ldots, e^{2\pi i \theta\lambda_{n,i}}) \in T^n \},  &lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

In their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; introduced the notion of a '''characteristic function''' that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign.  In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle &lt;math&gt;\lambda(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;. The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. Ray&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber and N. Ray, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory.  This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(I_n \mid S)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]] and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n \times (m-n)&lt;/math&gt; submatrix.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to the moment-angle complex==
The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the [[moment angle complex]] &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n}&lt;/math&gt;, and so defines a [[Principle fiber bundle|principal]] &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;-bundle &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n} \rightarrow M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; over the resulting [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.  This quotient space can be viewed as

:: &lt;math&gt;T^n \times P^n / \sim, &lt;/math&gt;

where pairs &lt;math&gt;(t_1, p_1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(t_2, p_2)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T^n \times P^n&lt;/math&gt; are identified if and only if &lt;math&gt;p_1 = p_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_1^{-1}t_2&lt;/math&gt; is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on restriction to the subtorus &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1} \times \dots \times T_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; that corresponds to the unique face &lt;math&gt;F_{i_1} \cap \dots \cap F_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; containing the point &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt;, for some &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

It can be shown that any quasitoric manifold &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[Equivariant map|equivariently]] [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis and T. Januskiewicz, 1991, Proposition 1.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[complex projective space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt; is a quasitoric manifold over the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-[[simplex]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n&lt;/math&gt; is embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; so that the origin is the initial vertex, a dicharacteristic function can be chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix is

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 &amp; -1\\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; -1
\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The moment angle complex &lt;math&gt;Z_{\Delta^n}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;(2n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the diagonal subgroup &lt;math&gt;\{(t, \dots, t)\} &lt; T^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, so the quotient of &lt;math&gt;Z_{\Delta^n}&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Bott manifold]]s that form the stages in a [[Bott tower]] are quasitoric manifolds over [[Hypercube|&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cubes]]. The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cube &lt;math&gt;I^n&lt;/math&gt; is embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; so that the origin is the initial vertex, and a dicharacteristic function is chosen so that the associated dicharacteristic matrix &lt;math&gt;(I_n \mid S)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1       &amp;0          &amp;\cdots &amp;0      &amp;0      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
-a(1,2)   &amp;1          &amp;\cdots &amp;0      &amp;0      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
\vdots      &amp;\vdots         &amp;   &amp;\vdots     &amp;\vdots     &amp;   &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots \\
-a(1,i)   &amp;-a(2,i)      &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(i-1,i)    &amp;1      &amp;\cdots &amp;0  &amp;0  \\
\vdots      &amp;\vdots         &amp;   &amp;\vdots     &amp;\vdots     &amp;   &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots \\
-a(1,n) &amp;-a(2,n)        &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(i-1,n)  &amp;-a(i,n)    &amp;\cdots &amp;-a(n-1,n)  &amp;1  
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;

for integers &lt;math&gt;a(i,j)&lt;/math&gt;.

The moment angle complex &lt;math&gt;Z_{I^n}&lt;/math&gt; is a product of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; copies of 3-sphere embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the kernel &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is given by

::&lt;math&gt;\{(t_1,t_1^{-a(1,2)}t_2,\dots,t_1^{-a(1,i)}\dots t_{i-1}^{-a(i-1,i)}t_i,\dots, t_1^{-a(1,n)}\dots t_{n-1}^{-a(n-1,n)}t_n, t_1^{-1}, \dots, t_n^{-1}) : t_i \in T,  1\leq i\leq n \} &lt; T^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;,

so that the quotient of &lt;math&gt;Z_{I^n}&lt;/math&gt; under the action of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th stage of a Bott tower.&lt;ref&gt;V. Buchstaber, T. Panov and N. Ray, 2007, Example 3.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The integer values &lt;math&gt;a(i,j)&lt;/math&gt; are the tensor powers of the line bundles whose product is used in the iterated sphere-bundle construction of the Bott tower.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Civan and N. Ray, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cohomology ring of a quasitoric manifold==
Canonical [[complex line bundle]]s &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:: &lt;math&gt;Z_{P^n} \times_{K(l)} \mathbb{C}_i \longrightarrow M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;,

can be associated with each facet &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}_i&lt;/math&gt;, by the restriction of &lt;math&gt;K(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; to the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th subcircle of &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt; embedded in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  These bundles are known as the '''facial bundles''' associated to the quasitoric manifold.  By the definition of &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the preimage of a facet &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(F_i)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;2(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional quasitoric '''facial submanifold''' &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;, whose isotropy subgroup is the restriction of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on the subcircle &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T^m&lt;/math&gt;.  Restriction of &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Normal bundle|normal]] 2-plane bundle of the embedding of &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;H^2(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; denote the first [[Chern class]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;. The integral [[cohomology ring]] &lt;math&gt;H^*(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; is generated by &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq m&lt;/math&gt;, subject to two sets of relations. The first are the relations generated by the [[Stanley–Reisner ring|Stanley–Reisner ideal]] of &lt;math&gt;P^n&lt;/math&gt;; linear relations determined by the dicharacterstic function comprise the second set:

:: &lt;math&gt;x_i = -\lambda_{i, n+1}x_{n+1} - \cdots - \lambda_{i, m}x_m,  \mbox{ for } 1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore only &lt;math&gt;x_{n+1}, \dots, x_m&lt;/math&gt; are required to generate &lt;math&gt;H^*(M^{2n}; \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt; multiplicatively.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Comparison with toric manifolds==
* Any projective toric manifold is a quasitoric manifold, and in some cases non-projective toric manifolds are also quasitoric manifolds.
* Not all quasitoric manifolds are toric manifolds. For example, the [[connected sum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}P^2 \sharp \mathbb{C}P^2&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed as a quasitoric manifold, but it is not a toric manifold.&lt;ref&gt;M. Masuda and D. Y. Suh 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''rationalism''' is the [[epistemology|epistemological]] view that "regards [[reason]] as the chief source and test of knowledge"&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification".&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"&gt;Lacey, A.R. (1996), ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1st edition, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1976. 2nd edition, 1986. 3rd edition, Routledge, London, UK, 1996. p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, rationalism is defined as a [[methodology]] or a [[theory]] "in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and [[deductive]]".&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"&gt;Bourke, Vernon J., "Rationalism," p. 263 in Runes (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an old controversy, rationalism was opposed to [[empiricism]], where the rationalists believed that reality has an intrinsically logical structure. Because of this, the rationalists argued that certain truths exist and that the intellect can directly grasp these truths. That is to say, rationalists asserted that certain rational principles exist in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]] that are so fundamentally true that denying them causes one to fall into contradiction. The rationalists had such a high confidence in reason that empirical proof and physical evidence were regarded as unnecessary to ascertain certain truths – in other words, "there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience".&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Rationalism vs. Empiricism] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position "that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge" to the more extreme position that reason is "the unique path to knowledge".&lt;ref name="Audi 771"&gt;Audi, Robert, The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition, 1999, p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to [[philosophy]], the [[Socrates|Socratic]] life of inquiry, or the zetetic ([[Skepticism|skeptical]]) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty). In recent decades, [[Leo Strauss]] sought to revive "Classical Political Rationalism" as a discipline that understands the task of reasoning, not as foundational, but as [[Maieutics|maieutic]].

In [[politics]], rationalism, since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], historically emphasized a "politics of reason" centered upon [[rational choice]], [[utilitarianism]], [[secularism]], and [[irreligion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.isi.org/catalog/resource/view/id/678 Oakeshott, Michael,"Rationalism in Politics," ''The Cambridge Journal'' 1947, vol. 1] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the latter aspect's [[antitheism]] was later softened by the adoption of pluralistic methods practicable regardless of religious or irreligious ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usj.sagepub.com/content/43/5-6/863.abstract Boyd, Richard, "The Value of Civility?," ''Urban Studies Journal'', May 2006, vol. 43 (no. 5–6), pp. 863–78] Retrieved 2013-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, the philosopher [[John Cottingham]]&lt;ref&gt;Cottingham, John. 1984. Rationalism. Paladi/Granada&lt;/ref&gt; noted how rationalism, a [[methodology]], became socially conflated with [[atheism]], a [[worldview]]:
{{quote|In the past, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the term 'rationalist' was often used to refer to free thinkers of an anti-clerical and anti-religious outlook, and for a time the word acquired a distinctly pejorative force (thus in 1670 Sanderson spoke disparagingly of 'a mere rationalist, that is to say in plain English an atheist of the late edition...'). The use of the label 'rationalist' to characterize a world outlook which has no place for the supernatural is becoming less popular today; terms like '[[secular humanist|humanist]]' or '[[materialism|materialist]]' seem largely to have taken its place. But the old usage still survives.}}

==Philosophical usage==
Rationalism is often contrasted with [[empiricism]]. Taken very broadly these views are not mutually exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist.&lt;ref name="Lacey 286"/&gt; Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']], that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]&amp;nbsp;– through the use of logic&amp;nbsp;– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as [[Galen Strawson]] once wrote, "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref&gt;Sommers (2003), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of [[epistemology]], their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the [[theory of justification]].

===Theory of justification===
{{Main|Theory of justification}}

The theory of justification is the part of [[epistemology]] that attempts to understand the justification of [[propositions]] and [[belief]]s. Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief, which include the ideas of [[Formal proof|justification]], warrant, [[rationality]], and [[probability]]. Of these four terms, the term that has been most widely used and discussed by the early 21st century is "warrant". Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone (probably) holds a belief.

If "A" makes a claim, and "B" then casts doubt on it, "A"'s next move would normally be to provide justification. The precise method one uses to provide justification is where the lines are drawn between rationalism and empiricism (among other philosophical views). Much of the debate in these fields are focused on [[Philosophical analysis|analyzing]] the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[Formal proof|justification]].

===Thesis of rationalism===
At its core, rationalism consists of three basic claims. For one to consider themselves a rationalist, they must adopt at least one of these three claims: The Intuition/Deduction Thesis, The Innate Knowledge Thesis, or The Innate Concept Thesis. In addition, rationalists can choose to adopt the claims of Indispensability of Reason and or the Superiority of Reason – although one can be a rationalist without adopting either thesis.

====The Intuition/Deduction Thesis====
{{Main|Intuition (philosophy)|Deductive reasoning}}

Rationale: ''"Some propositions in a particular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone; still others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions."''&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#2 The Intuition/Deduction Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, intuition is [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge or experiential belief characterized by its immediacy; a form of rational insight. We simply "see" something in such a way as to give us a warranted belief. Beyond that, the nature of intuition is hotly debated.

In the same way, generally speaking, deduction is the process of [[reasoning]] from one or more general [[premise]]s to reach a logically certain conclusion. Using valid [[argument]]s, we can deduce from intuited premises.

For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit that the number three is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, it can be said that intuition and deduction combined to provide us with ''a priori'' knowledge – we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.

Empiricists such as [[David Hume]] have been willing to accept this thesis for describing the relationships among our own concepts.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt; In this sense, empiricists argue that we are allowed to intuit and deduce truths from knowledge that has been obtained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'']].

By injecting different subjects into the Intuition/Deduction thesis, we are able to generate different arguments. Most rationalists agree [[mathematics]] is knowable by applying the intuition and deduction. Some go further to include [[Ethics|ethical truths]] into the category of things knowable by intuition and deduction. Furthermore, some rationalists also claim [[metaphysics]] is knowable in this thesis.

In addition to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary the strength of their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant. Some rationalists understand warranted beliefs to be beyond even the slightest doubt; others are more conservative and understand the warrant to be belief beyond a reasonable doubt.

Rationalists also have different understanding and claims involving the connection between intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition is not always a source of certain knowledge&amp;nbsp;– thus allowing for the possibility of a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in the same way a third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.

Naturally, the more subjects the rationalists claim to be knowable by the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the more certain they are of their warranted beliefs, and the more strictly they adhere to the infallibility of intuition, the more controversial their truths or claims and the more radical their rationalism.&lt;ref name="The Intuition/Deduction Thesis"/&gt;

To argue in favor of this thesis, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], a prominent German philosopher, says, "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…"&lt;ref&gt;1704, Gottfried Leibniz Preface, pp. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Innate Knowledge Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have knowledge of some truths in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#3 The Innate Knowledge Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Innate Knowledge thesis is similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim [[knowledge]] is gained [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.

This thesis targets a problem with the nature of inquiry originally postulated by [[Plato]] in ''[[Meno]]''. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Meno, 80d–e&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems."&lt;ref name="The Innate Knowledge Thesis"/&gt; The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this [[paradox]]. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either [[Consciousness|consciously]] or [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], a rationalist claims we don't really "learn" things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.

====The Innate Concept Thesis====
Rationale: ''"We have some of the concepts we employ in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational nature."''&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/#4 The Innate Concept Thesis] First published August 19, 2004; substantive revision March 31, 2013 cited on May 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis suggests that some concepts are simply part of our rational nature. These concepts are [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] in nature and sense experience is irrelevant to determining the nature of these concepts (though, sense experience can help bring the concepts to our [[Consciousness|conscious mind]]).

Some philosophers, such as [[John Locke]] (who is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and an [[Empiricism|empiricist]]) argue that the Innate Knowledge thesis and the Innate Concept thesis are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Concerning Human Understanding, Book I, Ch. III, par. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers, such as [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], argue that the two theses are distinct from one another. As with the other theses covered under the umbrella of rationalism, the more types and greater number of concepts a philosopher claims to be innate, the more controversial and radical their position; "the more a concept seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our concept of the latter.&lt;ref name="The Innate Concept Thesis"/&gt;

In his book, ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yMwiTTpwasgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor1-first= J. |editor1-last=Cottingham |date=April 1996 |origyear= 1986 |edition= revised |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-55818-1 |title= Meditations on First Philosophy With Selections from the Objections and Replies }}&amp;nbsp;–The original ''Meditations'', translated, in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]] postulates three classifications for our [[idea]]s when he says, "Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly, [[siren (mythology)|siren]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[hippogriff]]s and the like are my own invention."&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes AT VII 37–8; CSM II 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventitious ideas are those concepts that we gain through sense experiences, ideas such as the sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot [[Will (philosophy)|will]] away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in [[mythology]], [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of [[perfection]], are those ideas we have as a result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] defends the idea of innate concepts by suggesting the mind plays a role in determining the nature of concepts, to explain this, he likens the mind to a block of marble in the ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'', "This is why I have taken as an illustration a block of veined marble, rather than a wholly uniform block or blank tablets, that is to say what is called tabula rasa in the language of the philosophers. For if the soul were like those blank tablets, truths would be in us in the same way as the figure of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the marble is completely indifferent whether it receives this or some other figure. But if there were veins in the stone which marked out the figure of Hercules rather than other figures, this stone would be more determined thereto, and Hercules would be as it were in some manner innate in it, although labour would be needed to uncover the veins, and to clear them by polishing, and by cutting away what prevents them from appearing. It is in this way that ideas and truths are innate in us, like natural inclinations and dispositions, natural habits or potentialities, and not like activities, although these potentialities are always accompanied by some activities which correspond to them, though they are often imperceptible."&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1704, New Essays on human Understanding, Preface, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

====The other two theses====
The three aforementioned theses of Intuition/Deduction, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept are the cornerstones of rationalism. To be considered a rationalist, one must adopt at least one of those three claims. The following two theses are traditionally adopted by rationalists, but they aren't essential to the rationalist's position.

'''The Indispensability of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, "The knowledge we gain in subject area, ''S'', by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas and instances of knowledge in ''S'' that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience."&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In short, this thesis claims that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.

'''The Superiority of Reason Thesis''' has the following rationale, '"The knowledge we gain in subject area ''S'' by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior to any knowledge gained by sense experience".&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt; In other words, this thesis claims reason is superior to experience as a source for knowledge.

In addition to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']]. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this [[foundational knowledge]] to know more truths.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Rationalism"/&gt;

==Background==
Rationalism - as an appeal to human reason as a way of obtaining knowledge - has a philosophical history dating from antiquity. The [[analytic philosophy|analytical]] nature of much of philosophical enquiry, the awareness of apparently [[A priori knowledge|a priori]] domains of knowledge such as mathematics, combined with the emphasis of obtaining knowledge through the use of rational faculties (commonly rejecting, for example, direct [[revelation]]) have made rationalist themes very prevalent in the history of philosophy.

Since the Enlightenment, rationalism is usually associated with the introduction of mathematical methods into philosophy as seen in the works of [[Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Bourke 263"/&gt; This is commonly called '''continental rationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, because it was predominant in the continental schools of Europe, whereas in Britain [[empiricism]] dominated.

Even then, the distinction between rationalists and empiricists was drawn at a later period and would not have been recognized by the philosophers involved. Also, the distinction between the two philosophies is not as clear-cut as is sometimes suggested; for example, Descartes and Locke have similar views about the nature of human ideas.&lt;ref name="Rationalism vs. Empiricism"/&gt;

Proponents of some varieties of rationalism argue that, starting with foundational basic principles, like the axioms of [[geometry]], one could [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] derive the rest of all possible knowledge. The philosophers who held this view most clearly were [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], whose attempts to grapple with the epistemological and metaphysical problems raised by Descartes led to a development of the fundamental approach of rationalism. Both Spinoza and Leibniz asserted that, ''in principle'', all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, could be gained through the use of reason alone, though they both observed that this was not possible ''in practice'' for human beings except in specific areas such as [[mathematics]]. On the other hand, Leibniz admitted in his book ''[[Monadology]]'' that "we are all mere [[Empirics]] in three fourths of our actions."&lt;ref name="Audi 771"/&gt;

==History==
===Rationalist philosophy from antiquity===
Although rationalism in its modern form post-dates antiquity, philosophers from this time laid down the foundations of rationalism. {{Cn|date=April 2018}} In particular, the understanding that we may be aware of knowledge available only through the use of rational thought. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

====Ajita Kesakambali (600 BCE)====
[[Ajita Kesakambali]] was an ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] philosopher in the 6th century BCE. He is considered to be the first known proponent of Indian materialism, and forerunner to the [[Charvaka]] school of Indian thought, which holds [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, embraces [[philosophical skepticism]] and rejects Vedas, [[Vedic ritualism]], and [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pythagoras (570–495 BCE)====
{{Main|Pythagoras}}
Pythagoras was one of the first Western philosophers to stress rationalist insight.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68592/History-of-rationalism|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often revered as a great [[mathematician]], [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[scientist]], but he is best known for the [[Pythagorean theorem]], which bears his name, and for discovering the mathematical relationship between the length of strings on lute and the pitches of the notes. Pythagoras "believed these harmonies reflected the ultimate nature of reality. He summed up the implied metaphysical rationalism in the words "All is number". It is probable that he had caught the rationalist's vision, later seen by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1564–1642), of a world governed throughout by mathematically formulable laws".&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; It has been said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'', 5.3.8–9 = [[Heraclides Ponticus]] fr. 88 Wehrli, [[Diogenes Laërtius]] 1.12, 8.8, [[Iamblichus]] ''VP'' 58. Burkert attempted to discredit this ancient tradition, but it has been defended by C.J. De Vogel, ''Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism'' (1966), pp. 97–102, and C. Riedweg, ''Pythagoras: His Life, Teaching, And Influence'' (2005), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plato (427–347 BCE)====
{{Main|Plato}}
Plato held rational insight to a very high standard, as is seen in his works such as [[Meno]] and [[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]. He taught on the [[Theory of Forms]] (or the Theory of Ideas)&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas," but the latter has a long and respected tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too. See W D Ross, Plato's Theory of Ideas (1951) and [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php this] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }} reference site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Forms:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}...., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | pages=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself." See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that the highest and most fundamental kind of reality is not the material world of change [[allegory of the cave|known to us through sensation]],  but rather the abstract, non-material  (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) world of forms (or ideas).&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.'' [http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php Plato's theory of forms (or ideas)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061811/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophies/platos-theory-of-forms.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, these forms were accessible only to reason and not to sense.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt; In fact, it is said that Plato admired reason, especially in [[geometry]], so highly that he had the phrase "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter" inscribed over the door to his academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/faq/faq009.htm|title=Plato FAQ: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter"|first=Bernard F.|last=SUZANNE|website=plato-dialogues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle (384–322 BCE)====
{{Main|Aristotle}}
[[Aristotle]]'s main contribution to rationalist thinking was the use of [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic and its use in argument. Aristotle defines syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Prior Analytics'', 24b18–20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this very general definition, Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms which consist of three [[categorical proposition]]s in his work ''[[Prior Analytics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#SynSemSen] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Non-Modal Syllogistic&lt;/ref&gt; These included categorical [[modal logic|modal]] syllogisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Ancient Logic'' Aristotle Modal Logic&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-Aristotle====
Although the three great Greek philosophers disagreed with one another on specific points, they all agreed that rational thought could bring to light knowledge that was self-evident – information that humans otherwise couldn't know without the use of reason. After Aristotle's death, Western rationalistic thought was generally characterized by its application to theology, such as in the works of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]] and Jewish philosopher and theologian [[Maimonides]]. One notable event in the Western timeline was the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who attempted to merge Greek rationalism and Christian revelation in the thirteenth-century.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in ancient philosophies"/&gt;

===Classical rationalism===
Early modern rationalism has its roots in the 17th-century [[Dutch Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavaert, Sonja; Schröder, Winfried: ''The Dutch Legacy: Radical Thinkers of the 17th Century and the Enlightenment''. (BRILL, 2016, {{ISBN|978-9004332072}})&lt;/ref&gt; with some notable intellectual representatives like [[Hugo Grotius]],&lt;ref&gt;Berolzheimer, Fritz: ''The World's Legal Philosophies''. Translated by Rachel Szold. (New York: The MacMillan Co., 1929. lv, 490 pp. Reprinted 2002 by The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd). As [[Fritz Berolzheimer]] noted, "As the Cartesian "cogito ergo sum" became the point of departure of rationalistic philosophy, so the establishment of government and law upon reason made Hugo Grotius the founder of an independent and purely rationalistic system of [[natural law]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]], and [[Baruch Spinoza]].

====René Descartes (1596–1650)====
{{Main|René Descartes}}
Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the 'Father of Modern Philosophy.' Much subsequent [[Western philosophy]] is a response to his writings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&amp;pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp. 511, 516–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger [1938] (2002) p. 76 "Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Richard A. |last1=Watson |authorlink1=Richard Watson (philosopher) |title=René Descartes |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |date=31 March 2012 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/158787/Rene-Descartes |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are studied closely to this day.

Descartes thought that only knowledge of eternal truths{{spaced ndash}} including the truths of mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the sciences{{spaced ndash}} could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the [[scientific method]]. He also argued that although [[dream]]s appear as real as [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge. Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about sensory reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or [[reason]]) can be classified as knowledge. These truths are gained "without any sensory experience," according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive process, will result in clear truths about reality.

Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the senses. For instance, his famous dictum, ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' or "I think, therefore I am", is a conclusion reached ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' i.e., prior to any kind of experience on the matter. The simple meaning is that doubting one's existence, in and of itself, proves that an "I" exists to do the thinking. In other words, doubting one's own doubting is absurd.&lt;ref name="Epistemological rationalism in modern philosophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492034/rationalism/68594/Epistemological-rationalism-in-modern-philosophies|title=Rationalism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was, for Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical [[Cartesian dualism|dualism]], distinguishing between the substances of the human body ("''res extensa''") and the [[mind]] or soul ("''res cogitans''"). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved and lead to what is known as the [[mind-body problem]], since the two substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and irreducible.

====Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716)====
{{Main|Gottfried Leibniz}}
Leibniz was the last of the great Rationalists who contributed heavily to other fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[jurisprudence]], and the [[philosophy of religion]]; he is also considered to be one of the last "universal geniuses".&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz "&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz].&lt;/ref&gt; He did not develop his system, however, independently of these advances. Leibniz rejected Cartesian dualism and denied the existence of a material world. In Leibniz's view there are infinitely many simple substances, which he called "[[Monadology|monads]]" (possibly taking the term from the work of [[Anne Conway, Viscountess Conway|Anne Conway]]).

Leibniz developed his theory of monads in response to both Descartes and [[Spinoza]], because the rejection of their visions forced him to arrive at his own solution. Monads are the fundamental unit of reality, according to Leibniz, constituting both inanimate and animate objects. These units of reality represent the universe, though they are not subject to the laws of causality or space (which he called "[[well-founded phenomenon|well-founded phenomena]]"). Leibniz, therefore, introduced his principle of [[pre-established harmony]] to account for apparent causality in the world.

====Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)====
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
Kant is one of the central figures of modern [[philosophy]], and set the terms by which all subsequent thinkers have had to grapple. He argued that human perception structures natural laws, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to hold a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/ |title=Immanuel Kant (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant named his brand of epistemology "[[Transcendental Idealism]]", and he first laid out these views in his famous work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason|The Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those things that are necessarily beyond the realm of all possible experience: the [[existence of God]], free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as "The Thing in Itself" and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. "In Kant's views, [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/rationalism.html Excerpt from the Encyclopædia Britannica]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary rationalism===
Rationalism has become a rarer label ''tout court'' of philosophers today; rather many different kinds of specialised rationalisms are identified. For example, [[Robert Brandom]] has appropriated the terms [[rationalist expressivism]] and [[rationalist pragmatism]] as labels for aspects of his programme in ''Articulating Reasons'', and identified [[linguistic rationalism]], the claim that the content of propositions "are essentially what can serve as both premises and conclusions of inferences", as a key thesis of [[Wilfred Sellars]].&lt;ref&gt;''Articulating reasons'', 2000. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
Rationalism was criticized by [[William James]] for being out of touch with reality. James also criticized rationalism for representing the universe as a closed system, which contrasts to his view that the universe is an open system.&lt;ref name="pragmatism"&gt;{{cite speech|last=James|first=William|date=November 1906|location=Lowell Institute|title=The Present Dilemma in Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
In 2007, [[Maajid Nawaz]] renounced his previous association with the radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] in favor of [[Islam and secularism|secular Islam]]. He is co-founder and chairman of [[Quilliam (think tank)|Quilliam]], a counter-extremism [[think tank]] based in [[London]] that seeks to challenge Islamist ideology.&lt;ref name="Radical"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawaz|first=Maajid|date=2012|title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C|publisher=WH Allen|page=210|isbn=9781448131617|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/about/staff/maajid-nawaz/|title=Maajid Nawaz (Quilliam)|publisher=Quilliam|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nawaz has used the phrase "regressive left" to describe left-leaning people who—in his opinion—pander to Islamism, which he defines as a "global totalitarian theo-political project" with a "desire to impose any given interpretation of Islam over society as law"&lt;ref name="rad"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nawaz|first=Maajid|date=2012|title=Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIjms8hwoW8C|publisher=WH Allen|isbn=9781448131617}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which he opposes on the ground that "any desire to impose any version of Islam over anyone anywhere, ever, is a fundamental violation of our basic civil liberties".&lt;ref name="beast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/08/the-british-left-s-hypocritical-embrace-of-islamism.html|title=The British Left's Hypocritical Embrace of Islamism|author=Maajid Nawaz|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nawaz, such sympathizers of Islamism include "[[Atheism|atheists]] who are on the side of the Islamists, defending Islamism in the name of cultural tolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQhu1A-Ats|title=Lateline: An atheist and a Muslim on the future of Islam|author=[[Tony Jones (news journalist)|Tony Jones]]|work=[[Lateline]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=28 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2015 interview with political talk show host [[Dave Rubin]], Nawaz elucidated further the reasoning behind his choice of the word "regressive" and hypothesized that a section of people on the left "genuinely believe" that they are fighting an "ideological war" against neoconservative and neocolonialist foreign policies of Western governments which promote state-organized violence and chaos in the form of wars and military invasions. In contrast, he claims that such leftists forgo their duty to denounce the violent acts of theocratic extremists such as Islamists, at times going so far as to "make alliances" with some of the most regressive, theocratic and murderous regimes and organizations. He cited [[Jeremy Corbyn]], leader of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], as an example of someone who "has been historically very close" to supporters of Islamist organisations like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]]. In Nawaz's opinion, it is possible to denounce both neoconservative foreign policies such as the Iraq War (which he had opposed) and theocratic extremism, but those that he labels "regressive leftists" fail to do so he says.&lt;ref name=Nawaz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Dave|title=Maajid Nawaz and Dave Rubin Discuss the Regressive Left and Political Correctness|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/2/maajid-nawaz-and-dave-rubin-discuss-the-regressive-left-political-correctness-0_twq2e3jhwn8|accessdate=3 January 2016|work=Rubin Report|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nawaz, the notion that Muslims cannot cope with criticism or mockery of Islam and only react violently is "patronizing, self-pity inspiring mollycoddling" of the very Muslims it claims to serve and emancipate, because it does not expect them to be civil and control their anger.&lt;ref name="beast"/&gt; This "racism of low expectations" lowers the moral standards of people within minorities, seeking excuses if they express [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]],&lt;!-- Source has been checked: although not in the text, it is in the actual video presentation. --&gt; [[chauvinism]], [[bigotry]] or [[antisemitism]], whilst holding members of the majority to "universal liberal standards".&lt;ref name="Bigthink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/maajid-nawaz-on-islamic-reform|title=Je Suis Muslim: How Universal Secular Rights Protect Muslim Communities the Most|author=Maajid Nawaz|date=18 November 2015|publisher=[[Big Think]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haras Rafiq, managing director of Quilliam, expressed the view that there is a tendency of some on the left to excuse Islamism: "We have not got to grips with the symbiotic relationship between Islamism and far-right hatred, and the regressive left that is prepared to excuse Islamism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Lebor|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/25/donald-trump-worse-voldemort-europeans-say-404653.html|title=Donald Trump: The America Stereotype Europeans Love To Hate|work=Newsweek|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of the term ==

In September 2015, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz participated in a public forum hosted by [[Harvard University]]'s Institute of Politics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI9QwEKqrso|title=Islam and the Future of Tolerance|author=Harvard's Institute of Politics hosting Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz|publisher=Harvard’s Institute of Politics|date=|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later published in a short book, titled ''[[Islam and the Future of Tolerance]]'' (2015). In a review of the book in the magazine ''[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]'', political writer Brian Stewart noted that according to both Nawaz and Harris "regressive leftists" in the West are "willfully blind" to the fact that jihadists and Islamists make up a significant portion (20% in Harris's estimate) of the global Muslim community and the minority Muslim communities within the West, even though these factions are opposed to liberal values such as individual autonomy, freedom of expression, democracy, women's rights, gay rights, etc. Nawaz and Harris have denounced the paradoxically illiberal, isolationist and censuring attitude towards any criticism of this phenomenon, which they contend betrays universal liberal values and also abandons supporting and defending the most vulnerable liberal members living within the Muslim community such as women, homosexuals and apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Brian|date=7 October 2015|title=A Liberal Atheist and a Liberal Muslim Discuss the Problems of Contemporary Islam|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425169/sam-harris-maajid-nawaz-islam-book|journal=[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, ''The Washington Times'' reported that American comedian and show host [[Bill Maher]] and British biologist and [[New Atheism|New Atheist]] author [[Richard Dawkins]] "lamented regressive leftists who fail to understand they are anything but liberal when it comes to Islam".&lt;ref name="WT20151003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/3/bill-maher-richard-dawkins-blast-regressive-libera/|title=Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins blast 'regressive liberals' giving a 'free pass' to Islam|author=Kellan Howell|date=3 October 2015|work=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maher noted a willingness to criticise anything except [[Islam]], excusing it as "their culture", to which Dawkins responded: "Well, to hell with their culture".&lt;ref name="Maher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvvQJ_zsL1U|title=Real Time with Bill Maher: Richard Dawkins – Regressive Leftists (HBO)|date=2 October 2015|work=[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]|publisher=HBO|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/611231/Richard-Dawkins-in-extraordinary-blast-at-Muslims-To-hell-with-their-culture|title='To hell with their culture' - Richard Dawkins in extraordinary blast at Muslims|author=John Worthing|work=The Independent|date=27 October 2015|access-date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making reference to student initiatives to disinvite ex-Muslim speakers on campus, Dawkins saw this as "a betrayal of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-dawkins-free-speech_561038c4e4b0af3706e11397|title=Richard Dawkins: College Students Are Betraying The Free Speech Movement|author=Tyler Kingkade|work=Huffington Post|date=3 October 2015|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November 2015, Sam Harris frequently used the term in his exchanges with the media, saying the greatest danger is that the "regressive left" is willing to give up [[freedom of speech]] "out of fear of offending minorities", which will lead to [[censorship]] imposed by those minorities, citing American journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]'s comments on the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] as an example.&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splicetoday.com/politics-and-media/sam-harris-unloads-on-the-regressive-left|title=Sam Harris Unloads on the Regressive Left|author=Chris Beck|work=[[Splice Today]]|publisher=[[Russ Smith (publisher)|Russ Smith]]|date=21 October 2015|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Illing|title=Sam Harris talks Islam, ISIS, atheism, GOP madness: "We are confronting people, in dozens of countries, who despise more or less everything that we value"|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/11/25/harris_and_illing_correspondence/|publisher=Salon.com|date=25 November 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris considers [[Reza Aslan]]&lt;ref name="Chris Beck"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salon20151125/&gt; and [[Noam Chomsky]] to be of the regressive left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2015/10/sam-harris-is-still-mad-about-liberals-who-followed-noam-chomsky-off-the-edge-of-the-world/|title=Sam Harris is still mad about 'liberals who followed Noam Chomsky off the edge of the world'|publisher=Rawstory.com|date=16 October 2015|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell'', 15 October 15, 2015, MSNBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 in an appearance on the talk radio show ''[[American Humanist Association|The Humanist Hour]]'', author and philosopher [[Peter Boghossian]] defined the term as a pejorative used to describe those on the left that have made the "strangest bedfellows" with the Islamists. According to him, the word "regressive" is used to contrast with the word "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" – the latter being the group that is egalitarian and wants to create systems of justice and [[racial equality]], while the former being a group that "[looks] for the worst in people... and [does] not extend hermeneutics of charity, or a charitable interpretation of anything anyone says, but uses it as a hammer to beat people down". In addition, Boghossian believes that "regressive leftists" have become "hyper-moralists" and champions of their perceived victims. He cites the historical wrongdoings such as [[slavery in the United States]] and [[colonialism]] as a legitimate concern that has caused mistrust of anything Western and capitalistic. He also added that "there are people who have suffered and still suffer legitimate instances of racism, homophobia etc. The problem is that every time the word racist is just thrown around like that, that word loses its meaning. And it should have quite a sting. That should be a horrible word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|title=The Humanist Hour #175: The "Regressive Left" and Safe Spaces, with Dr. Peter Boghossian|website=thehumanist.com|publisher=The Humanist Hour|host=Bo Bennett, Kim Ellington|date=4 November 2015|time=4:08, 9:48, 0:10|accessdate=7 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111234501/http://thehumanist.com/multimedia/podcast/the-humanist-hour-175-the-regressive-left-and-safe-spaces-with-dr-peter-boghossian|archivedate=11 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, talk show host Dave Rubin hosted discussions about the "regressive left" in several ''[[The Rubin Report]]'' segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/rubinreport/2015/10/8/milo-yiannopoulos-and-dave-rubin-discuss-gay-rights-and-cultural-libertarians-0_40xbq9svp490|title=Milo Yiannopoulos and Dave Rubin Discuss Gay Rights and Cultural Libertarians|publisher=Ora TV|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin describes the regressive left as "the left's version of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]", saying that the regressive left will damage the Democratic Party in a similar way the Tea Party damages the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Rubin7Oct"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzzLiJ6na1k|title=Dave Rubin: Regressives are the Left's Tea Party|work=[[The Rubin Report]]|date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator [[David Pakman]] supported the concept in his [[The David Pakman Show|talk show]], saying "there are liberals who do use [[cultural relativism]] and distaste for US foreign policy as an excuse to defend or at least minimize violence and injustice that they would certainly otherwise oppose". Pakman has distanced himself from the term, saying that it is misused by conservatives to insult all liberals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Would David Appear on Drunken Peasants or Illiberal Podcasts?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMremqM8Q28|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=The Truth About the Regressive Left|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=315icKVWb6w|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakman suggests that the actual regressive leftists are leftists who use authoritarianism to enforce progressivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pakman|first=David|authorlink=David Pakman|title=Authoritarian Leftism: The Actual "Regressive Left"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCUrTMmtHbo|website=[[The David Pakman Show]]|date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In November 2015, psychiatrist Khwaja Khusro Tariq from ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' classified the term as an unsubstantiated [[Ad hominem|''ad hominem'' attack]], stating that the harshest critics of Islam are courted by both liberal and conservative media in the United States. Khusro also stated the term has been directed towards Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky, both of whom he said have never condoned violence or opined on the doctrine of Islam. He argued that there was no genuine inhibition on speaking against the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tariq|first=Khwaja|date=11 November 2015|title="Regressive Liberals": The New Mantra of Islamophobia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/khwaja-khusro-tariq/regressive-liberals-the-n_b_8597284.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|accessdate= 9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Joseph Bernstein, a ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' reporter on [[World Wide Web|web culture]], wrote that according to [[Google Trends]] interest in the term "shot up" in late 2015. According to Bernstein, instead of criticising "cultural tolerance gone too far", the phrase has "become a catch-all for any element of the dominant [[new media]] culture that the anti-[[Social justice warrior|SJW]] internet doesn't like". He also suggests that even though the term can be sourced back to self-described liberal commentators like Nawaz, Maher and Dawkins, it is currently heavily used by the [[alt-right]] and other Anti-SJW Groups on Internet forums and social media as part of their rhetorical warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Joseph|date=16 March 2016|title=The Rise Of The #Regressiveleft Hashtag|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-rise-of-the-regressiveleft-hashtag#.tf71OEVY1|newspaper=Buzzfeed|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In experiments, subjects judged variations of sayings which did and did not rhyme, and tended to evaluate those that rhymed as more truthful (controlled for meaning). For example, the statement "What sobriety conceals, alcohol reveals" was judged to be more accurate than by different participants who saw "What sobriety conceals, alcohol unmasks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlone|first=M. S.|author2=J.

The effect could be caused by the [[Keats heuristic|''Keats'' heuristic]], according to which a statement's truth is evaluated according to aesthetic qualities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlone|first=M.

For an example of the persuasive quality of the rhyme-as-reason effect, see "''If it doesn't fit, you must acquit''" the signature phrase used by [[Johnnie Cochran]] to gain acquittal for [[O.J. Simpson]] in Simpson's [[murder]] trial.

The '''right to be heard''' (also children's participation) is a child rights principle as defined by the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. According to Article 12 of the Convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children’s participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child’s right to be heard reflects the concept of children‘s ‘agency’, viewing children not only as [[social vulnerability|vulnerable persons]] in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be heard from Article 12 relates closely to other articles under the Convention, which together form the so-called ‘participatory rights’ of children and underline the understanding of children as citizens who are rights holders. These articles include:
* Article 13 - the child’s right to seek, receive and impart information 
* Article 14 - freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
* Article 15 - freedom of association.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Implementation Handbook for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Fully Revised Edition, New York, 2002, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trust === 
Trust is a key element of encouraging a child to express their views. Strategies for building trust with children include: 
* Demonstrate that you care for and respect the child as a person.
* Ask the girl or boy how she or he is, how she or he feels about where they are living and their life situation, ask if there is anything she or he needs. 
* Engage in a gentle conversation with the child about day-to-day matters. 
* Show empathy and express positive feelings. Talk to the child about things that are important to the child and that interest her or him.
* Sense if the child is comfortable talking with you, reassure the child and give the child a feeling of control of what is happening. 
* Make the meeting room child-friendly. 
* Introduce yourself and explain your professional role. 
* Explain the purpose of your meeting and what the meeting is about, why you are there to talk to the child and what will happen afterwards. 
* Allocate sufficient time to speak to the child and to listen.
* Provide quality interpretation and cultural mediation wherever required. 
* Give the child time to reflect about the information you shared, to digest it and to come back for a second or third meeting, if and as required and appropriate. 
* Ask the child if she or he has understood the information and to explain what they understood, and take time to ask the questions you need to ask.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age-sensitive communication ===
In the cases of younger children or children with impaired cognitive skills, the child’s participation can be through drawing or play, or by observing of the child’s behaviour with family members and care staff. Adapting the language to the age and development of the child helps insure the child can understand the issues at stake and express her or his feelings and views.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, Communicating With Children, Principles and practices to nurture, inspire, excite, educate and heal, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

National laws usually define age limits for children to have the right to contact social services on their own initiative, to be heard in judicial and administrative procedures, to act as a litigant or party to a case, to appeal against decisions, and to complain and seek redress. The age limits defined under national law differ among countries and, in some cases, also between the various laws applying to different groups of children and contexts. The right of younger children to be heard is often not addressed in the same way as the right of adolescents. Special measures nationally can ensure younger children are not excluded from exercising their right to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12 (2009). UNHCR Guidelines on Child Asylum Claims.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender considerations for the right to be heard ===
For some children, the gender of the interviewer, interpreter, cultural mediator, guardian or care staff may change their willingness to express themselves. The may depend on the experiences that children have with men and women in their homes and communities, and if in [[Child migration|migration]], during their journey or in places of destination. Traditional gender roles and relations can also play a role. The [[gender identity]] of the child should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children, Communicating with Children, Helping children in distress, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enabling factors in transnational cases ==
Many children do not want to tell their story to the authorities because they fear it might not be in their interest and might lead to unwanted consequences, such as being returned. Children might have been instructed or even threatened by third persons to only tell parts of their story, and the child might not trust the police and local authorities can protect them. A reception system that respects and upholds the dignity of the child can foster a sense of trust.

== Quality interpretation and cultural mediation ==
[[Interpreters]] can influence the information gathering process in [[transnational child protection]] cases, [[Right of asylum|asylum]] procedures and criminal investigations as they affect how the child’s disclosure is being understood and perceived. Inaccurate translation might compromise the child’s statement to the effect that decisions are taken on the basis of incorrect information. This relates not only to the content translated but also to the style and semantic choices made by the child and how these are rendered by the interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Heaven, Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to training and recruiting qualified interpreters, the following measures protect the child's right to be heard: 
* Clarify which authority is responsible for providing interpretation.
* Make the participation of an interpreter mandatory whenever a child does not master the official language of the interview.
* Avoid the use of informal interpreters, such as family members, other children, other asylum seekers or staff.
* Use telephone interpretation when a qualified and suitable interpreter is not available locally. 
* Train law enforcement officers, immigration officials and other interviewers as well as the interpreters on how to collaborate in the context of interviews with children. 
* Develop standard procedures to ensure quality and ethical standards of interpretation and confidentiality.
* Train interpreters to act also as cultural mediators.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, Let’s Talk, Developing effective communication with children victims of violence and trafficking, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, The Heart of the Matter, Assessing credibility when children apply for asylum in the European Union, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 12, The right of the child to be heard, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hearing a child in investigations and proceedings ==
Child victims of crime have a right to be protected from harm and secondary victimisation during investigations and proceedings. The standards for are described in the UN Guidelines on Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The following protect children from harm in investigations and proceedings: 
* Repeat interviews during the investigation, prosecution and trial only when necessary. 
* Use video recorded interviews or similar to avoid the child victim or witness giving evidence in open court and to prevent visual contact between victims, witnesses and defendants. 
* Specifically trained professionals conduct the interviews with child, preferably the same person each time. 
* Conduct interviews in a child-friendly environment.

The Children’s House model  is a good practice for conducting forensic interviews and gathering evidence from child victims of crime.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/docs/2005/resolution 2005-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] and the 2011 EU Anti-Trafficking Directive.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forensic interviews ==
Interview style and the type of questions asked affect the quality of the interview. They can influence the child’s willingness to disclose information. They can also influence the type and quality of information, and the level of detail, that the child is able and willing to share. Strategies for interviewers and interpreters to lessen this include prioritising open questions and avoiding closed and focused questions, suggestive prompts and leading questions; remaining neutral; be open and empathic; avoid criticism and confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;PROTECT 2nd Expert Meeting, Riga, May 2014, presentation by Ann-Christin Cederborg, University Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''"self-made man"''' (later expanded to include "self-made women") is a classic phrase first coined on February 2, 1832 by United States senator [[Henry Clay]] who referred to the self-made man in the United States senate, to describe individuals in the manufacturing sector whose success lay within the individuals themselves, not with outside conditions. [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as the greatest exemplar of the self-made man. Inspired by Franklin's autobiography, [[Frederick Douglass]] developed the concept of the self-made man in a [[Self-Made Men|series of lectures]] that spanned decades starting in 1859. Originally, the term referred to an individual who arises from a poor or otherwise [[disadvantaged]] background to eminence in financial, political or other areas by nurturing qualities, such as perseverance and hard work, as opposed to achieving these goals through [[Inheritance|inherited fortune]], family connections, or other privileges. By the mid-1950s, success in the United States generally implied "business success".

According to the 2017 "World Ultra Wealth Report" by research company [[Wealth-X]], self-made individuals, mainly men, have "largely driven" global "wealth creation" from 1997 through 2017. The report noted that while there are an increasing number of women who are designated as high net worth, most inherited their wealth and only a small percentage sourced their wealth as self-made.

In the intellectual and [[cultural history of the United States]], the idea of the self-made man as an archetype or cultural ideal has been criticized by some as being a [[myth]] or a [[cult]].

==Origins==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis 1778.jpg|left|thumb|Benjamin Franklin. c. 1785.

Franklin's autobiography was described by the editor of the 1916 edition, as the "most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt; His autobiography, which was dedicated to his son [[William Franklin]], with the first chapter based on a 1771 letter to William,&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"&gt;{{Citation| title = Benjamin Franklin, his autobiography| last = Franklin | first = Benjamin| publisher = P.F.

Franklin's introduced the archetypal self-made man through his own life story in which in spite of all odds he overcame his low and humble origins and inherited social position—his father was candle-maker—to re-invent himself through self-improvement based on a set of strong moral values such as "industry, economy, and perseverance"&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}} thereby attaining "eminence" in the classic rags to riches narrative. Franklin's maxims as published in his ''Autobiography'' provide others, specifically his own son, with strategies for attaining status in the United States, described as a "land of unequaled opportunity" in the last quarter of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

In his 1954 book entitled ''The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches'', Irvin G. Wyllie described how on February 2, 1832 [[Henry Clay]] had "coined the phrase 'self-made men'" during his speech to the United States Senate.&lt;ref name="1955_review_Wyllie"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of "The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches" (1954) |first=John William |last=Ward |journal=Journal of American History  |volume=42 |number=2 |date=September 1, 1955 |doi= 10.2307/1897672 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jah/article-abstract/42/2/344/695032?redirectedFrom=fulltext |quote="Clay used the classic phrase to describe the autonomy of our manufacturers ... in behalf of a paternalistic tariff and the irony has persisted throughout the history of the idea of self-help.

If it were true, would gentlemen prefer ·supporting foreign accumulations of wealth, by that description of industry, rather than their own country? But is it correct? The joint stock companies of the North, as I understand them, are nothing more than associations, sometimes of hundreds, by means of which the small earnings of many are brought into a common stock; and the associates, obtaining corporate privileges, are enabled to prosecute, under one superintending head, their business to better advantage. Nothing can be more essentially democratic, or better devised to counterpoise the influence of individual wealth. In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me is in the hands of enterprising self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor. Comparisons are odious, and, but in defence, would not be made by me. But is there more tendency to aristocracy in a manufactory, supporting hundreds of freemen, or in a cotton plantation, with its not less numerous slaves, sustaining, perhaps, only two white families-that of the master and the overseer?}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100}}

The essential doctrine behind the self-made man is that success lies within the person himself and not with outside conditions. Wyllie investigated intellectual history, "not the history of a great abstraction but the saga of an idea that had power among the people."

One cannot be “made” by the help of a father, teacher, mentor, etc.…, but must rise by one’s own grit, determination, discipline, and opportunism. The irony is that they have made themselves free from bounds and possessions, in a sense impoverished, so that they can then begin to acquire power and wealth on their own. The key is to acquire those possessions and power without help. The goal, then, is not to become famous or wealthy in the literal sense, but to participate in something precise and mythical."&lt;ref name="Dixon_thesis_2011"/&gt;

[[File:Frederick Douglass, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing right, ca 1850-1860 edit.jpg|left|thumb|Frederick Douglass, photographed between 1850 and 1860.]]Frederick Douglass developed the concepts in a series of lectures "[[Self-Made Men]]" from 1859 onward, for example 1895,&lt;ref name="Douglass_1895_selfmademen"&gt;{{cite web |series=The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress: Speech, Article, and Book File |title=Self-Made Men: Address before the Students of the Indian Industrial School |quote="Self-made men […] are the men who owe little or nothing to birth, relationship, friendly surroundings; to wealth inherited or to early approved means of education; who are what they are, without the aid of any of the favoring conditions by which other men usually rise in the world and achieve great results."|location=Carlisle, Pennsylvania |agency=Library of Congress |year=1895}}Folder 1 of 16 (Series: Speech, Article, and Book File—B: Frederick Douglass, Undated)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|549–50}} which were published and archived in "The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress".

In John G.

{{main|Ultra high-net-worth individual}}

According to the 2017 "World Ultra Wealth Report" by research company Wealth-X, "wealth creation" from 1997 through 2017 has been "driven largely by self-made individuals", mainly men.&lt;ref name="wealthx_2017_report"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wealthx.com/report/exclusive-uhnwi-analysis-the-world-ultra-wealth-report-2017/ |publisher=Wealth-X |series=World Ultra Wealth Report |title=The World Ultra Wealth Report 2017 |edition=5 |date=June 27, 2017 |access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} According to the report, ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), those who have a [[net worth]] of at least [[US$]]30 million, were "predominantly self-made" having "earned their fortunes". Two-thirds of the UHNWI sourced "their wealth from their own efforts" such as "fruitful business ventures or successful investments."&lt;ref name="wealthx_2017_report"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Of the 226,450 UHNWIs, 66% were self-made; of the 7,200 UHNW millennials (born between 1980–1995), 66% were self-made; of the 28,985 UHNW women, 45% were self-made; of the 33,290 UHNWI from emerging Asia (excluding Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong), 68% were self-made; and of the 34,961 UHNW Ivy League individuals, 75% were self-made.&lt;ref name="wealthx_2017_report"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

==Cultural history==
In his 2000 book ''Creating the Modern Man'', cultural historian Tom Pendergast traced the way in which the concept of the self-made man was referenced in men's magazines from 1900 through 1950.&lt;ref name="Pendergast_2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom|title=Creating the Modern Man: American Magazines and Consumer Culture, 1900–1950|year=2000|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, Missouri and London, UK|isbn=9780826212801|pages=289|edition= |url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=FWdKPEtBAHcC&amp;q=self-made+man#v=snippet&amp;q=self-made%20man&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} Pendergast divided masculinity into only two periods: Victorian, which was "based on property-ownership and family", and "post-Victorian", which was "based on a cult of personality, self-improvement, and narcissism".&lt;ref name="Corrales_Pendergast_2003"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Corrales on Pendergast, 'Creating the Modern Man: American Magazines and Consumer Culture, 1900-1950' |first=Barbara Smith |last=Corrales |journal=Journal of History|date=January 2003 |access-date=November 12, 2017 |url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/14542/reviews/14821/corrales-pendergast-creating-modern-man-american-magazines-and-consumer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the "ideal Victorian man" as a "property owning man of character who believed in honesty, integrity, self-restraint, and duty to God, country, and family".&lt;ref name="Pendergast_2000"/&gt;{{rp|10}} The post-Victorian image of the self-made man was crucial to Pendergast's study. He revealed how through magazines men "were encouraged to form their identities around an ideology of hard work."&lt;ref name="Pendergast_2000"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4556">In mathematics, '''set inversion''' is the problem of characterizing the [[Inverse image|preimage]] ''X'' of a set ''Y'' by a function ''f'', i.e., ''X'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y'') = {''x'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | ''f''(''x'') ∈ ''Y''}. It can also be viewed as the problem of describing the solution set of the quantified constraint "Y(f(x))", where Y(y) is a constraint, for example, an inequality, describing the set Y.

In most applications, ''f'' is a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and the set ''Y'' is a box of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e. a Cartesian product of ''p'' intervals of '''R'''). 

When ''f'' is nonlinear the set inversion problem can be solved 
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Walter|first2=E.|title=Set inversion via interval analysis for nonlinear bounded-error estimation|journal=Automatica|year=1993|volume=29|issue=4|url=http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/paper_automatica93.pdf
|doi=10.1016/0005-1098(93)90106-4|pages=1053–1064}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
using [[interval analysis]] combined with a [[branch and bound|branch-and-bound]] algorithm.
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Jaulin|first1=L.|last2=Kieffer|first2=M.|last3=Didrit|first3=O.|last4=Walter|first4=E.|
title=Applied Interval Analysis|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=1-85233-219-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The main idea consists in building a paving of R&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; made with non-overlapping boxes. For each box [''x''], we perform the following tests:
# if ''f''([''x'']) ⊂ ''Y'' we conclude that [''x''] ⊂ ''X'';
# if ''f''([''x'']) ∩ ''Y'' = ∅ we conclude that [''x''] ∩ ''X'' = ∅;
# Otherwise, the box [''x''] the box is bisected except if its width is smaller than a given precision.

To check the two first tests, we need an [[Interval arithmetic|interval extension]] (or an inclusion function) [''f''] for ''f''. Classified boxes are stored into [[subpaving]]s, i.e., union of non overlapping boxes. 
The algorithm can be made more efficient by replacing the inclusion tests by [[interval contractor|contractors]].

==Example==

The set ''X'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;([4,9]) where ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''x''{{su|b=2|p=2}} is represented on the figure. 

For instance, since [−2,1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + [4,5]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,4] + [16,25] = [16,29] does not intersect the interval [4,9], we conclude that the box [-2,1] × [4,5] is outside ''X''. Since [−1,1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + [2,{{sqrt|5}}]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,1] + [4,5] = [4,6] is inside [4,9], we conclude that the whole box [-1,1] × [2,{{sqrt|5}}] is inside ''X''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7589">'''Single-subject research''' is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]] with both human and non-human participants. Principal methods in this type of research are: A-B-A-B designs, Multi-element designs, Multiple Baseline designs, Repeated acquisition designs, Brief experimental designs and Combined designs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods form the heart of the data collection and analytic code of behavior analysis. Behavior analysis is data driven, inductive, and disinclined to hypothetico-deductive methods.&lt;ref&gt;Chiese, Mecca. (2004). ''Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy and the Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical methods have been largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael, J. |title=Statistical inference for individual organism research: mixed blessing or curse? |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=647–653 |pmid=16795486 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1974.7-647 |year=1974 |pmc=1311683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental questions ==
Experimental questions are decisive in determining the nature of the experimental design to be selected. There are four basic types of experimental questions: demonstration, comparison, parametric, and component.&lt;ref name=kennedy65-66&gt;Kennedy, 2005, pp 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; A demonstration is "Does A cause or influence B?". A comparison is "Does A1 or A2 cause or influence B more?". A parametric question is "How much of A will cause how much change or influence on B?". A component question is "Which part of A{1,2,3} - A1 or A2 or A3... - causes or influences B?" where A is composed of parts which can be separated and tested.&lt;ref name=kennedy65-66 /&gt;

The A-B-A-B design is useful for demonstration questions.

== A-B-A-B  ==

=== A-B ===
An AB design is a two part or phase design composed of a baseline ("A" phase) with no changes, and a treatment or intervention ("B") phase.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/user/sw/ssd/issd10b.htm "Introduction to Single Subject Designs: AB (Baseline And Intervention) Design"]. ''www.msu.edu'', 2000. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010731191638/http://www.msu.edu/user/sw/ssd/issd10b.htm |date=July 31, 2001|accessdate=March 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a change then the treatment may be said to have had an effect. However, it is subject to many possible competing hypotheses, making strong conclusions difficult. Variants on the AB design introduce ways to control for the competing hypotheses to allow for stronger conclusions.

=== Reversal or A-B-A ===
The reversal design is the most powerful of the single-subject research designs showing a strong reversal from baseline ("A") to treatment ("B") and back again. If the variable returns to baseline measure without a treatment then resumes its effects when reapplied, the researcher can have greater confidence in the efficacy of that treatment. However, many interventions cannot be reversed, some for ethical reasons (e.g., involving self-injurious behavior, smoking) and some for practical reasons (they cannot be unlearned, like a skill).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kazdin |first=Alan |title=Single-Case Research Designs |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1982 |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ethics notes: It may be unethical to end an experiment on a baseline measure if the treatment is self-sustaining and highly beneficial and/or related to health. Control condition participants may also deserve the benefits of research once all data has been collected. It is a researcher's ethical duty to maximize benefits and to ensure that all participants have access to those benefits when possible.

=== A-B-C ===
The A-B-C design is a variant that allows for the extension of research questions around component, parametric and comparative questions.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multielement ==
Multi-element designs sometimes referred to as alternating-treatment designs are used in order to ascertain the comparative effect of two treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Two treatments are alternated in rapid succession and correlated changes are plotted on a graph to facilitate comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple baseline ==
The [[multiple baseline design]] was first reported in 1960 as used in basic operant research. It was applied in the late 1960s to human experiments in response to practical and ethical issues that arose in withdrawing apparently successful treatments from human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hersen, Michael &amp; Barlow, David H. (1976) ''Single-case Experimental Designs: Strategies for Studying Behavioral Change''. Pergamon, New York. {{ISBN|978-0205474554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it two or more (often three) behaviors, people or settings are plotted in a staggered graph where a change is made to one, but not the other two, and then to the second, but not the third behavior, person or setting. Differential changes that occur to each behavior, person or in each setting help to strengthen what is essentially an AB design with its problematic competing hypotheses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

== Repeated Acquisition ==
In addition to multiple baseline designs, a way to deal with problematic reversibility is the use of repeated acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Boren, J. J. (1963). "Repeated acquisition of new behavioral chains". ''American Psychologist'', '''18''', p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief ==
A designed favored by applied settings researchers where logistical challenges, time and other limits make research difficult are variants of multi-element and A-B-A-B type designs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 2005, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Wacker, Sasso, Reimers, and Dunn (1990) "Using Parents as therapists to evaluate appropriate behavior of their children: application to a tertiary diagnostic clinic". ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', '''23''', pp. 285-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Combined ==
The combined design has arisen from a need to obtain answers to more complex research questions. Combining two or more single-case designs, such as A-B-A-B and multiple baseline, may produce such answers.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Wolf, Risley (1968) "Some still current dimensions of applied behavior analysis". ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', '''1''', 91-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multipleprobe ==
Popular in [[Verbal Behavior]] research, the multipleprobe research design has elements of the other research designs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

== Changing-Criterion ==
In a changing-criterion research design a criterion for reinforcement is changed across the experiment to demonstrate a functional relation between the reinforcement and the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dixon, M.R. |author2=Falcomata, T.S. |title=Preference for progressive delays and concurrent physical therapy exercise in an adult with acquired brain injury |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=101–105 |year=2004 |doi=10.1901/jaba.2004.37-101 |pmid=15154223 |pmc=1284485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spencer1.jpg| 195px | thumb | right | [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the phrase "survival of the fittest".]]

"'''Survival of the fittest'''" is a phrase that originated from Darwinian [[evolutionary theory]] as a way of describing the mechanism of [[natural selection]]. The biological concept of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is defined as [[reproductive success]]. In Darwinian terms the phrase is best understood as "Survival of the form that will leave the most copies of itself in successive generations."

[[Herbert Spencer]] first used the phrase, after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', in his ''Principles of Biology'' (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin's biological ones: "This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life."&lt;ref name=sotf&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-5140#back-mark-5140.f5 | title=Letter 5140 – Wallace, A.

Darwin responded positively to [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s suggestion of using Spencer's new phrase "survival of the fittest" as an alternative to "natural selection", and adopted the phrase in ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' published in 1868.&lt;ref name=sotf/&gt;&lt;ref name="Variation "&gt;"This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest.

==History of the phrase==
[[Herbert Spencer]] first used the phrase – after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species]]''&amp;nbsp;– in his ''Principles of Biology'' of 1864&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;444&lt;/ref&gt; in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin's biological, evolutionary ones, writing, "This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called 'natural selection', or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life."&lt;ref name=sotf /&gt;

In July 1866 [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] wrote to Darwin about readers thinking that the phrase "[[natural selection]]" personified nature as "selecting", and said this misconception could be avoided "by adopting Spencer's term" ''Survival of the fittest''. Darwin promptly replied that Wallace's letter was "as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer's excellent expression of 'the survival of the fittest'. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb". Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the ''Origin'' which was then being printed, and he would use it in his "next book on Domestic Animals etc.".&lt;ref name=sotf /&gt;

Darwin wrote on page 6 of ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' published in 1868, "This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term "natural selection" is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity". He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the "attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets", or the way in which "agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection". He had "often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,—and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events."&lt;ref name="Variation " /&gt;

In the first four editions of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', Darwin had used the phrase "natural selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb19/plantphysiology/wallace.pdf |title=A Comparative Analysis of the Darwin-Wallace Papers and the Development of the Concept of Natural Selection |author=U. Kutschera |date=14 March 2003 |publisher=Institut für Biologie, Universität Kassel, Germany |accessdate=20 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414023545/http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb19/plantphysiology/wallace.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of ''The Origin'' published in 1869,&lt;ref name=1stD/&gt; Darwin implies again the synonym: "Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest".&lt;ref name=OriginCh4/&gt; By "fittest" Darwin meant "better adapted for the immediate, local environment", not the common modern meaning of "in the best physical shape" (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete).&lt;ref name=sjg/&gt; In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing "I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Darwin | first=Charles | author-link=Charles Darwin | year=1869 | title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life | edition=5th | publication-place=London | publisher=John Murray |page=72 | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F387&amp;pageseq=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Man Versus The State'', Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by "societies of militant type". He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle.&lt;ref&gt;The principle of natural selection applied to groups of individual is known as [[Group selection]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Herbert Spencer |author2=Truxton Beale |title=The Man Versus the State: A Collection of Essays |publisher=M.

Though Spencer’s conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of [[Lamarckism]],{{efn|Though Spencer was an advocate of the inheritance of acquired characters, he considered Lamarck’s failure to explain organic evolution in physical terms as a serious weakness of his theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://evolutioncognition.wordpress.com/2013/05/26/adaptation-and-progress-spencers-criticism-of-lamarck/|title=Adaptation and Progress: Spencer’s Criticism of Lamarck|publisher=[https://evolutioncognition.wordpress.com/ Evolution &amp; Cognition]|author=Federico Morganti|date=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Herbert Spencer]] is sometimes credited with inaugurating [[Social Darwinism]]. The phrase "survival of the fittest" has become widely used in popular literature as a catchphrase for any topic related or analogous to evolution and natural selection. It has thus been applied to principles of unrestrained competition, and it has been used extensively by both proponents and opponents of Social Darwinism.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Evolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in [[pop culture|popular culture]]. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term [[natural selection]]. The biological concept of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] refers to [[reproductive success]], as opposed to survival, and is not explicit in the specific ways in which organisms can be more "fit" (increase reproductive success) as having [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Critiquing the phrase "survival of the fittest"==
While the phrase "survival of the fittest" is often used to mean "[[natural selection]]", it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important. Another problem is that the word "fit" is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness. In the evolutionary meaning "[[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]" is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants.&lt;ref name=IntroEvolutionaryBiology&gt;{{Citation | last=Colby | first=Chris | title=Introduction to Evolutionary Biology | date=1996–1997 | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-intro-to-biology.html |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpreted as expressing a biological theory==
The phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that "fit" as opposed to "unfit" individuals or species, in some sense of "fit", will survive some test.

Interpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]], meaning roughly "those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive"; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.&lt;ref name=sjg&gt;"Stephen Jay Gould, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tBxGpaV-ocsC&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Darwin's Untimely Burial]", 1976; from Philosophy of Biology:An Anthology, Alex Rosenberg, Robert Arp ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, May 2009, pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de"&gt;von Sydow, M.

Interpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example,  amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty [[ecological niches]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | pmid=20106856 | journal=Biology Letters | pmc=2936204 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[punctuated equilibrium]] model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a [[meteor]] impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally. The main land dwelling animals to survive the [[K-Pg boundary|K-Pg]] impact 66 million years ago had the ability to live in underground tunnels, for example.

In 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty [[ecological niches]] and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Interpreted as expressing a moral theory==

===Social Darwinists===
It has been claimed that "the survival of the fittest" theory in biology was interpreted by late 19th century capitalists as "an ethical precept that sanctioned cut-throat economic competition" and led to the advent of the theory of "[[social Darwinism]]" which was used to justify [[laissez-faire]] economics, war and racism. However, these ideas predate and commonly contradict Darwin's ideas, and indeed their proponents rarely invoked Darwin in support.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The term "social Darwinism" referring to capitalist ideologies was introduced as a term of abuse by [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'' published in 1944.&lt;ref name=EvolutionPhilosophy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonard&gt;{{Citation | last=Leonard | first=Thomas C. | title=Mistaking Eugenics for Social Darwinism: Why Eugenics is Missing from the History of American Economics | journal=History of Political Economy | volume=37 | issue=supplement: | pages=200–233 | year=2005 | url=http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/mistaking.pdf | doi=10.1215/00182702-37-Suppl_1-200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchists===
Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] viewed the concept of "survival of the fittest" as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Applying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle – has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tautology==

"Survival of the fittest" is sometimes claimed to be a [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].&lt;ref name=Corey&gt;{{Citation |title=Back to Darwin: the scientific case for Deistic evolution |author=Corey, Michael Anthony |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-8191-9307-0 |chapter=Chapter 5. Natural Selection |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lBYuCMyaS4MC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning is that if one takes the term "fit" to mean "endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction" (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then "survival of the fittest" can simply be rewritten as "survival of those who are better equipped for surviving". Furthermore, the expression ''does'' become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of "fitness" in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin's entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

However, the expression "survival of the fittest" (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of ''heritability''. It is true that the phrase "survival of the fittest", in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by ''[[heritable]]'' characters (see the article on [[natural selection]]).&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

If certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of "heritable") that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called "[[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]". On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, "survival of the fittest" or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that "survivors survive" or "reproducers reproduce"; rather, it states that "survivors survive, reproduce and ''therefore'' propagate any ''heritable'' characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success". This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the [[testable]] hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.)&lt;ref name=Corey/&gt;

Momme von Sydow suggested further definitions of 'survival of the fittest' that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an "implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection ... while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses".&lt;ref name="crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. von Sydow, M. (2012). ''[http://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/content/list.php?cat=subject&amp;show=Biologie&amp;details=isbn-978-3-86395-006-4 From Darwinian Metaphysics towards Understanding the Evolution of Evolutionary Mechanisms: A Historical and Philosophical Analysis of Gene-Darwinism and Universal Darwinism]''. Universitätsverlag Göttingen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic Society founder and ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine publisher [[Michael Shermer]] addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]'', in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are [[testable]] and [[falsifiable]] by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if [[hominid]] [[fossils]] were found in the same geological strata as [[trilobite]]s, it would be evidence against natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]]; ''[[Why People Believe Weird Things]]''; 1997; Pages 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The City of the Sun''''' ({{lang-it|La città del Sole}}; {{lang-la|Civitas Solis}}) is a philosophical work by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]]. It is an important early [[utopia]]n work. The work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanella's imprisonment for [[heresy]] and [[sedition]]. A [[Latin]] version was written in 1613&amp;ndash;1614 and published in [[Frankfurt]] in 1623.

==Synopsis==

The book is presented as a [[dialogue]] between "a Grandmaster of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Sea-Captain". Inspired by [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']] and the description of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', it describes a [[theocracy|theocratic]] society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the ''[[Picatrix]]'', an Arabic [[grimoire]] of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies&amp;mdash;in the veiled language of astrology&amp;mdash;that the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish kings]], in alliance with the [[Pope]], are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the [[New World]], it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before ''The City of the Sun'', ''The Monarchy in Spain'', in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] monarchy.

== The City ==
Protected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located in a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer. One of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit [[polemic]] with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue.

In the City of the Sun no occupation is vile or base, and [[equality before the law|all are of equal]] [[dignity]]—in fact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as artisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants, and no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to privilege the [[decent work|dignity of work]] and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility, linked to inactivity and vice.

Thanks to the equal [[division of labour]], it is sufficient for each person to spend only four [[working time|hours a day working]]; but it is essential that they all work, because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is held in [[common ownership|common]], from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women to children.

There are “officials” in charge of the [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that this happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself. According to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces “self-love”, with all the dire consequences this generates. They live “like philosophers in common” because they are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also on the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.

One of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of the Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted walls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces are painted with images of all the arts and sciences.

Starting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles, following the order of the planets from Mercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds, until we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented.

Campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The City of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions, such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one's feet, leaving one's hands free. On the external wall legislators are depicted; and it is here, in “a place of great honor”—but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and Muhammad—that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the twelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone's eyes. Visualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more efficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the [[art of memory]], which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images. From a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge, appropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they learn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.

In addition to the [[common ownership|community of goods]] and the painted walls, another characteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as “hard and arduous”, is the community of wives. This is the solution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing the teaching of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Ocellus Lucanus]], Campanella says that they are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses and dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a large responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of suffering.

Moreover, there is a close connection between a person's natural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not afterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable terrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore respect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual sentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. [[Affection]] between men and women, based on friendship and respect more than sexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from sexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing. Sexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a union is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate relationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of generation and to love for the collective community.

The religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include fundamental principles of Christianity (such as the [[immortality of the soul]] and divine providence), form a [[natural religion]] that establishes a sort of [[osmosis]] between the city and the stars. The temple is open and not surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises: “I shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar”.&lt;ref&gt;''Le poesie'', 1998, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; On the vault of the temple's dome the stars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs. The altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is in the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The task of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using astronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between God and human beings.

==Trento 1602 manuscript==
[[File:Pagina di manoscritto 1602.jpg|thumb|Manuscript page (Trento) 1602]]
In [[Trento]]'s Civic Library, there is kept a 1602 manuscript of ''The City of the Sun'' (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian [[Luigi Firpo]]. It is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time. The text arrived at the Library through the baron Antonio Mazzetti [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mazzetti] 's (1781–1841) bequest. He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library. 

The manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined together years after their writing: the first is a Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of "Hospedali di Venezia" ("Hospitals in Venice"). At the bottom, it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it's a copy by anonymous author of "The City of the Sun". The transcription is meticulous and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.

In 2016, the manuscript was uploaded to the digital library [[Wikisource]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:s:Indice:Campanella - La Città del Sole, manoscritto, 1602.djvu|La Città del Sole]] (Wikisource).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Principle of Hope''''' ({{lang-de|Das Prinzip Hoffnung}}) is a book by the Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], published in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959, in which the author explores utopianism, studying the utopian impulses present in art, literature, religion and other forms of cultural expression, and envisages a future state of absolute perfection. ''The Principle of Hope'' has become fundamental to dialogue between Christians and Marxists.&lt;ref name="Corrington"&gt;{{cite book |author=Corrington, Robert S. |title=The Community of Interpreters: On the Hermeneutics of Nature and the Bible in the American Philosophical Tradition |year=1987 |publisher=Mercer University Press |page=103 |isbn=0-86554-284-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Originally written between 1938 and 1947 in the United States,&lt;ref name="Corrington" /&gt; an enlarged and revised version of ''The Principle of Hope'' was published successively in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959. Bloch, who had emigrated to the United States in 1938, returned to Europe in 1949 and became a Professor of Philosophy in [[East Germany]]. Despite having initially supported the regime, Bloch came under attack for his philosophical unorthodoxy and support for greater cultural freedom in East Germany, and publication of ''The Principle of Hope'' was delayed for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kołakowski, Leszek |title=Main Currents of Marxism Volume 3: The Breakdown |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |pages=425–439 |isbn=0-19-285109-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]] calls ''The Principle of Hope'' Bloch's ''magnum opus'', writing that it contains all his important ideas.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski" /&gt; The work has been described as "monumental" by the philosopher [[Robert S. Corrington]]&lt;ref name="Corrington" /&gt; and the psychoanalyst [[Joel Kovel]].&lt;ref name="Kovel"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=History and Spirit: An Inquiry into the Philosophy of Liberation |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |year=1991 |pages=99  |isbn=0-8070-2916-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vested interest''' (Crano, 1983&lt;ref name="Crano"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crano | first=William D. | title= Assumed consensus of attitudes: The effect of vested interest | journal= Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume=9 | year=1983 | pages=597-607}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Crano &amp; Prislin, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crano | first=William D. | last2=Prislin | first2=Radmila | title=Components of Vested Interest and Attitude-Behavior Consistency | journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=17 | issue=1-2 | year=1995 | issn=0197-3533 | doi=10.1080/01973533.1995.9646129 | pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Sivacek &amp; Crano, 1982&lt;ref name=" Sivacek "&gt;{{cite journal | last= Sivacek | first=J. | last2=Crano | first2=W.D. | title= Vested interest as a moderator of attitude-behavior consistency | journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume=43 | year=1982 | pages=210-221}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[communication theory]] that seeks to explain how certain hedonically relevant (Miller &amp; Averbeck, 2013)&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=C. H. | last2=Averbeck | first2=J. M. | title= Hedonic relevance and outcome relevant involvement | journal= Electronic Journal of Communication | publisher= Communication Institute for Online Scholarship, Inc.(CIOS) | volume=23 | issue=3 | year=2013}} | Retrieved from the CIOS  http://www.cios.org/www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/023/3/023031.html | &lt;/ref&gt; attitudinal dimensions can influence and consistently predict behavior based on the degree of subjective investment an individual has in a particular attitude object. As defined by [[William Crano]], ''vested interest'' refers to the degree to which an attitude object is deemed [[wikt:hedonic|hedonic]]ally relevant by the attitude holder. According to Crano, "an attitude object that has important perceived personal consequences for the individual will be perceived as highly vested. Highly vested attitudes will be functionally related to behavior" (Crano, 1983). Simply put, when people have more at stake with the result of an object (like a law or policy) that will greatly affect them, they will behave in a way that will directly support or defy the object for the sake of their own self-interest.

For example, a 30-year-old learns that the legal driving age in his state is being raised from 16 to 17. While he may not agree with this proposed change, he is not affected as much as a 15-year-old would be and is unlikely to protest the change. A 15-year-old, however, has much to lose (waiting another year to get a driver license) and is more likely to vehemently oppose the new proposed law. To gather support for his position, a course of action the 15-year-old might take would be to tell other soon-to-be drivers about the new law, so that they collectively have a vested interest in perhaps changing the law. This example illustrates the point that highly vested attitudes concerning issues depend on the situational point of view.

Another example of vested interest can be found in a study conducted by Berndsen, Spears and van der Pligt&lt;ref name="Berndsen, Spears, van der Pligt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berndsen |first1=M. |last2=Spears |first2=R. |last3=van der Pligt |first3=J. |title=Illusory Correlation and Attitude-Based Vested Interest |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=1996 |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=252-253 |issn=0046-2772}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which involves students from a University in Amsterdam where the teaching faculty proposed the use of English to teach the curriculum instead of Dutch.  Vested interest, in this case, suggests that students would be opposed to the use of English rather than Dutch simply based on the potential impact lectures conducted in English might have on their grades. &lt;ref name="Berndsen, Spears, van der Pligt" /&gt;  

==Key Factors==
===Involvement===
A key factor to consider with vested interest is the level or type of involvement the individual has with a particular attitude object. This can be broken up into three main involvement components: Value-relevant, Impression-relevant, and Outcome-relevant. Value-relevant involvement concerns behaviors which support/reinforce values of the individual. Impression-relevant involvement relates to those behaviors which serve to create or maintain a specific image of the individual. This could, in some ways, be compared to a [[Self-monitoring|low-self monitor]]. Outcome-relevant involvement concerns those behaviors which hold direct personal consequences at a premium for the individual and as a result, corresponds most closely to vested interest.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

The concept of involvement closely relates to collaboration which encompasses value, impression and desired outcome.  Vested interest is essential in achieving success in collaboration where two or more individuals have the potential to gain or lose. &lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guard |first1=R. |title=Musing on Collaboration and Vested Interest |journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |date=2005 |volume=31 |issue=2 |page=89-90 |issn=0099-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations who strive for collaborative success benefit from understanding vested interest and that of other collaborators in order to maintain a supportive level of involvement. &lt;ref name="Guard" /&gt;

===Ego involvement===
The way people view vested interest as distinct from ego involvement, is a construct that has been the topic of social psychological research for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M., &amp; Hovland, C. (1961). Social judgment: Assimilation and contrast effects in communication and attitude change. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by John Sivacek and William D. Crano,&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"&gt;Sivacek, J., &amp; Crano, W. D. (1982). Vested interest as a moderator of attitude behavior consistency. 'Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43, 210-221&lt;/ref&gt; they prove that the aforementioned statement of ego involvement and vested interest are indeed separate. Sivacek and Crano state,&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; "It was possible to have circumstances that an individual would perceive as involving but that it would not arouse his or her vested interest." [[Id, ego and super-ego|Ego]]-involvement’s main focus points are on individual’s psychological attitudes that are experienced as being a part of “me”. The more emotionally connected people are to an idea, concept, or value, minor differences in beliefs can be viewed as significantly large and perhaps make harsh judgments or have stronger reactions. Conversely, a person with less emotional connectivity (low ego-involvement) will have more latitude in their reactions. It is important to note that while highly vested attitudes can be experienced as ego involving, the opposite is not always true. An individual can be ego involved in a certain attitude that has no hedonic consequence. For example, religious or political ideals with little or no hedonic value may still be ego-involved because individuals view those types of beliefs as part of who they are.

Ego-involvement, as it pertains to vested interest, is relative to [[Social_judgment_theory|Social Judgment Theory]] in that the concept of one’s identity is the primary focus of efforts in continued involvement. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherif |first1=C. W. |last2=Kelly |first2=M. |last3=Rodgers Jr. |first3=H. L. |last4=Sarup |first4=G. |last5=Tittler |first5=B. L. |title=Personal Involvement, Social Judgment, and Action |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1973 |volume=27 |issue=3 |page=311-313 |doi=10.1037/h0034948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to social judgment theory is the idea of ego thus actions or ideas with a varying degree of ego involvement carry a commensurate amount of vested interest to the individual as detailed by Sherif, Kelly, Rogers, Sarup, and Tittler.  Sherif, et al.&lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt; conducted a series of studies to develop “indicators of ego involvement” (p. 311).  One of the leading questions they sought to answer was how much ego involvement (vested interest) does an induvial in a situation with no alternatives solutions have and does this ego involvement correlate to the number of options at hand. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt; Sherif et al., suggest the question was answered by Beck and Nebergall&lt;ref name="Beck &amp; Neberall"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beck |first1=D. |last2=Nebergall |first2=R. E. |last3=Sherif |first3=C.W. |last4=Kelly |first4=M. |last5=Rodgers Jr. |first5=H.L. |last6=Sarup |first6=G. |last7=Tittler |first7=B.L. |title=Relationship Between Attitude Neutrality and Involvement; (in Personal Involvement, Social Judgment, and Action) |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-05117-001 |website=PsycNET |publisher=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |accessdate=21 June 2018 |doi=10.1037/h0034948}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 who stated that individuals with little to no options have corresponding vested interest indicating low ego involvement. &lt;ref name="Sherif et al." /&gt;

===Attitude importance===
The factor to consider with vested interest and its application towards attitude-consistent actions is attitude importance. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] (or issue) importance concerns not only matters of personal consequence, but also matters of national or international interest.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; While both of these can fall in line with each other, vested interest and attitude importance are not the same. For example, consider the plight of an African nation that has been ravaged by an influenza epidemic. Although an individual in America may consider this objectively important, because of the low probability of personal consequence—i.e., vested interest — his resultant behavior may not be indicative of his attitude towards the epidemic. In other words, since the issue is of little hedonic relevance to the perceiver, the amount of vested interest is low, and is therefore unlikely to produce attitude-consistent actions. Geographic distance and cultural differences are also a factor in attitude importance. Tragic circumstances halfway around the world or shocking behaviors by members of a culture different from the perceiver, will most likely never result in attitude change. The physical distance or cultural difference of an occurrence directly correlates to the vested interest of the perceiver. Things too far away or customs perceived to be too strange will almost never trigger a vested interest.

Indicators of vested interest can include attitude importance, as detailed by Jon Krosnick&lt;ref name="Krosnick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krosnick |first1=J.A. |title=The Role of Attitude Importance in Social Evaluation: A Study of Policy Preferences, Presidential Candidate Evaluations, and Voting Behavior |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1988 |volume=55 |issue=2 |page=196-198 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who defined this concept by stating that “central, ego-involved, and salient attitudes” often include attitudes significantly important to individual interests.  In politics, for example, voters have a vested interest in candidates whose values (policy) align with their own to include attitudes toward these values.  Due to the nature of politics, voters come to conclusions about one candidate over another based on perceived attitude importance (object) on these policies rather than vocal support alone placing a high value on this concept as it pertains to vested interest. &lt;ref name="Krosnick" /&gt; 

Attitude object continuously makes an issue salient which correlates to outcome relevant involvement.  Two differences exist between vested interest and outcome relevant involvement where attitude objects remain highly important. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=B.J. |last2=Crano |first2=W. |title=The Pervasive Effect of Vested Interest on Attitude Consistency in Political Judgement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2002 |volume=38 |issue=2 |issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially,  outcome relevant objects retain a high degree of vested interest while not appearing to be.  Secondly,  outcome relevant involvement suggest interest ends once the goal is achieved whereas vested interest suggests a self-perpetuated interest. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lehman |first1=B.J. |last2=Crano |first2=W. |title=The Pervasive Effect of Vested Interest on Attitude Consistency in Political Judgement |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2002 |volume=38 |issue=2 |issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
There are five key components that may diminish or enhance the effects of vested interest on [[attitude-behavior consistency]]. These are (a) stake, (b) attitudinal salience, (c) the certainty of the attitude outcome link, (d) the immediacy of attitude-implicated consequences, and (e) the [[self-efficacy]] of the individual to perform an attitudinally implicated act. Attitudes affect behavior. However, social psychologists recognize that contextual, [[interpsychic]], and [[intrapsychic]] sources of variation can drastically affect the strength of this relation. A factor that has been shown to strongly affect attitude-behavior consistency is [[self-interest]] or vested interest.&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Crano 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brewer |first1=M.B. |last2=Crano |first2=W.D. |title=Social psychology |date=1994 |publisher=West Pub. Co (West Group) |location=Minneapolis/St. Paul |isbn=0314028404 |edition=[1. Dr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections explain each of these variables in greater detail.

===Stake===
Stake refers to the perceived personal consequence of an attitude that is directly related to the intensity of vested interest and influences components that contribute to attitude-behavior consistency. In its basic form, the more that is at stake concerning a particular issue, the stronger the attitude will be. Consequently, as attitude strength increases, the consistency of attitude-based actions also increases.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

Referring to the concept of vested interest as it relates to attitude-behavior consistency, stake is an individual’s macro involvement in a particular situation where the consequence is salient&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anker |first1=A.E. |last2=Feeley |first2=T.H. |last3=Kim |first3=H. |title=Examining the Attitude-Behavior Relationship in Prosocial Donation Domains |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |date=2010 |volume=40 |issue=6 |issn=0021-9029}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In a situation where stake is operationalized using certainly and immediacy, one found the likely effect of this was behavior relative to the immediate consequence, positive or negative&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim" /&gt;. For instance, in a study conducted to measure the relevance stake has on vested interest, students given a health assessment showed greater enthusiasm for items inquiring about donating blood when saving a life was salient (i.e. a child’s life depends on my donation)&lt;ref name="Anker, Feeley, &amp; Kim" /&gt;.

Stake may contribute to attitude-behavior consistency by inducing thoughts that support the attitude. This serves as the basis for future behavior. Stake may also strengthen the attitude-behavior relation by indirectly amplifying the awareness of stimuli associated with people's attitudes. Stake is the most powerful impression that comes from all the components of vested interest regarding attitude and behavior. Stake influences perceptions of attitude and action, but also of other action-relevant components as well. When stake is high, people also find the critical issue highly salient. Stake also affects the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing the issue is perceived to be. Finally, stake was found to affect the perception of immediacy. The greater the personal consequence of the issue, the more pressing it was perceived to be. The phrases, "the stakes are/were high" or "high stakes", are used when issues of high salience or immediacy are raised, usually in regards to gambling or other high-risk activities involving vested interest.

===Salience===
[[social salience|Salience]] refers to the perceiver’s awareness of the effects of an attitude upon himself.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; In other words, the prominence of an issue, as perceived by an individual, shapes the strength of his resulting attitude. Salient attitudes have a greater effect directly on subsequent behavior. Linking this discovery to vested interest, the research concluded that the salience effect was heightened when the attitude had important personal outcomes for someone. When the consequences of the behavior issuing from an attitude are highly salient, attitude-behavior consistency increases. If consequences are not salient, the consistency of the effects of vested interest on attitude behavior will be dramatically reduced. For instance, two people may have negative attitudes towards living near a prison. The first person lost a loved one at the hands of an inmate who escaped during a jailbreak. The second person simply does not like the eyesore the prison building creates in the area around his home. The first person's attitude towards inmates and prisons will probably be more salient than that of the second person who has not experienced a similar trauma. The first person's more salient attitude will foster the operation of vested interest, which will result in greater attitude-behavior consistency.

Attitudes that have been acquired through direct experience, such as the example just given, may be more salient than those acquired through vicarious processes. This greater salience results in greater consistency in attitude behavior. The attitude of someone who is non-salient reduces vested interest and weakens attitude-behavior consistency. The most powerful impression to emerge from all the analyses is the overwhelming effect of stake, or personal consequence, on attitude and behavior. When stake is high, people assume that a person would find the critical issue highly salient. Stake does not interact with, but enhances the perception of, issue salience. This is an important effect, because salience significantly affects actions that are expected to happen.

Additionally, salience can be described as the most recent and accessible memory associated with a specific object (i.e. idea) in which an individual has developed their own unique attitude&lt;ref name="Bradley &amp; Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradley |first1=A. |last2=Miller |first2=C. |title=Vested Interest: Developing Scales for Assessing Flooding Preparedness |journal=Disaster Prevention and Management |date=2016 |volume=25 |issue=3 |page=283-285 |issn=0965-3562}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Mortality, for instance, would become salient when faced with a situation where death was probable or the known death of a friend, relative or an experienced event which resulting in someone’s death.  This death salience would then influence behavior for a short amount of time following the event&lt;ref name="Pashak et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pashak |first1=T. |last2=Oswald |first2=S.R. |last3=Justice |first3=M.D. |last4=Seely |first4=L.T. |last5=Burns |first5=B.R. |last6=Sheperd |first6=S. |title=You are Alive Right Now: An Experimental Exploration of The Interplay Between Existential Salience, Mental Health, and Death Anxiety |journal=College Student Journal |date=2017 |volume=51 |issue=4 |page=452-453 |issn=0146-3934}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Certainty===
Certainty refers to perceived [[likelihood]] of personal consequences as a result of an attitude or action.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; Simply stated, if a certain course of action is taken, then the chances of a specific event occurring as a result of this action are evaluated by the perceiver to help shape his resultant attitudes and behaviors. Certainty can be easily applied to situations in which an individual knowingly takes a calculated risk. For instance, let's continue with our aforementioned example of people living near a prison. Although the chance of a prison escape is minimal, particularly in a maximum-security prison, it could occur and crimes against those living close by would increase. Those living further away from the prison might argue that a prison break is unlikely and that there is no real risk. Alternatively, those living close to the prison could make an equally valid argument about the dangers of living near the prison in the event of prisoners escaping. Still others might realize there to be a potential risk to their safety, but would not deem it risky enough to move elsewhere.

Certainty in attitude, relative to vested interest, remains difficult to define without an understanding of two particular concepts.  One is the acceptance of truth in the events or idea requiring approximation of occurrence.  Two requires that certainty is not dependent on external factors which can undermine its validity. &lt;ref name="Bolyard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bolyard |first1=C. |title=Truth and Certainty in Peter Auriol |journal=Vivarium |date=2015 |volume=53 |issue=1 |page=45-48 |issn=0042-7543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certainty must be a concept which is pushed onto us much like truth is a certainty beyond our immediate control.&lt;ref name="Bolyard" /&gt; 

If the consequences of an attitude consistent act are uncertain, attitude-consistent action is not likely to occur, due to the fact that vested interest will be reduced. An example of this is a person who has a negative attitude towards living near a prison. If the person assumes that the link between living near a prison and being a victim of a violent crime is minimal, then health and safety promoting behaviors consistent with this negative attitude are not likely. However, if someone believes that living near the prison and being a victim of a violent crime is almost certain, that person would be unlikely to move close to the prison, assuming the person has a positive attitude toward safety or a negative attitude toward prisons and inmates.

===Immediacy===
Immediacy refers to an individual’s perceived amount of time between an action and its resulting consequences.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; Immediacy can be considered an extension of certainty, however, these two entities are completely separate. For instance, in our prison example, people in opposition to the construction of the prison in their neighborhood may have felt that the amount of time to build the prison to and the eventual housing of prisoners was not long enough to make an informed decision. They may also feel that it is only a matter of time before something negative happened to the local citizens as a result of having a prison nearby.

Immediacy refers to the apparent temporary lag between an attitudinally implicated action and its consequences. If the results of an attitude consistent action are thought to be immediate rather than delayed, the effects of stake, or vested interest, on attitude-behavior consistency will be more dramatic. In other words, if a person living near the prison in the previous example perceives the possibility of a jailbreak could occur at a much later time in life, he may act in manner that is not consistent. This is because the lack of immediate consequences reduces the perception of vested interest. Therefore, immediacy can help explain self-destructive behaviors.

Immediacy, in vested interest,  can also be thought of in terms of positive or negative consequence disassociated from a timeline.  Vested interest such as organ donation, for example, make life and death salient which brings about the concept of immediacy to decide not necessarily to act.&lt;ref name="Siegel, et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siegel |first1=Jason T. |last2=Alvaro |first2=Eusebio M. |last3=Lac |first3=Andrew |last4=Crano |first4=William D. |last5=Dominick |first5=Alexander |title=Intentions of Becoming a Living Organ Donor Among Hispanics: A Theory-Based Approach Exploring Differences Between Living and Nonliving Organ Donation |journal=Journal of Health Communication |date=8 February 2008 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=80–99 |doi=10.1080/10810730701807142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is seen in a mechanism which allows people to agree to donate organs in the event of their death (i.e. drivers licenses).&lt;ref name="Siegel, et al." /&gt; 

Another example of immediacy is that of marketing companies who implement immediacy to encourage consumers to act or remain inactive. If what they market is something a person is highly vested in and the marketing firm has simultaneously created an immediate need, then they have done their job to get consumers to behave as they desired. This use of immediacy can be both helpful and harmful. Consumers who are not well versed in how marketing works may find themselves situations they did not wish to be in. However, consumers who are cognizant of how marketing works may find this very useful in how they do or do not expend their resources.

===Self-efficacy===
[[Self-efficacy]] in regards to vested interest, is the amount that an individual believes that they are capable of performing an action associated with an attitude or advocated position.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt; In short, it is a person's sense of competence in regards to a specific task. Continuing with our prison example, residents with high vested interest that was covered by the other four components would need self-efficacy to protest the location of the new prison. In other words, the residents opposing the prison would have to believe in their abilities to effectively stop the construction. Conversely, if they lacked self-efficacy and therefore believed there was nothing they could do, then they would not act on their held attitude and vested interest will not have been attained. Variations in self-efficacy will produce differences in perceptions of the likelihood of someone working against the opposed plan. Higher levels of manipulated self-efficacy result in higher levels of expected action. However, variations in stake also influence perceptions of self-efficacy. When the stakes are high, people assume higher levels of perceived self-efficacy.

Another way the concept of self-efficacy can be described is using [[social cognitive theory]] to understand the role thought, drive and emotion have on self-efficacy (20).  Cognitively, one works to quantify actions, emotion, and drive resulting in self-efficacy.  However, this concept remains volatile as a change in one or more of these influences degrades self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik &amp; Sia"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pattanaik |first1=S. |last2=Sia |first2=N. |title=Self-Efficacy, Political Efficacy and Political Orientation |journal=Indian Journal of Health and Wellbeing |date=2015 |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=222-225 |issn=2229-5356}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be physical fitness, in that, elevated or decreased self-efficacy will cause one to accept or deny a strenuous task daily.&lt;ref name="Pattanaik &amp; Sia" /&gt;

==Relevant research==
===Drinking age experiment===
Various studies have been conducted to determine the effects of vested interest on attitude strengths. In one such study, Crano and Sivacek&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; visited a university in Michigan and gathered the results of a proposed drinking-age referendum. The referendum sought to increase the legal drinking age from 18 to 21. The respondents were divided into three categories: 1. high vested interest (those who would be significantly and immediately affected as a result of the referendum), 2. low vested interest (those who would be unaffected by the law change at the time of its inception), and 3. moderate vested interest (those who fell between the first two extremes). Although 80% of the subjects were opposed to the referendum, their respective levels of vested interest clearly indicated that the strength of their attitudes significantly affected their resultant behaviors. Half of the highly vested interest groups joined the anti-referendum campaign, but only a quarter of the moderately vested interest group and an eighth of the low vested interest group joined the campaign.&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; These results support Crano's theory of vested interest and reinforce the implications and considerations of stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy discussed above. It also proves the correlation between vested interest and action, based on what level of involvement the three types of students were willing to participate in.

===Comprehensive exam experiment===
In a second study, Sivacek and Crano&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt; visited [[Michigan State University]]. In this experiment, subjects were informed that the university was considering the addition of a senior comprehensive examination to the graduate prerequisites. Respondents were given the following options:
#Do nothing
#Sign an opposing petition
#Join a group that opposed the referendum
#Volunteer specific numbers of hours to the opposing group's activities
The respondents were grouped into the same three categories as the drinking age study: high, moderate, and low vested interest. The study found that those with the highest levels of vested interest were significantly more inclined to take action based on their attitudes concerning the issue; that is, their resultant behaviors (signing the petition, joining the group, pledging multiple hours with the group) occurred much more consistently and prevalently than that of the other two vested interest groups.&lt;ref name="S&amp;C"/&gt;

===Assumed consensus===
Crano conducted another study to prove that vested interest may affect people's belief that a majority of a population will support their attitude on an issue. This bias is known as [[False consensus effect|false-consensus]] or assumed-consensus effect. Under the guise of a public opinion survey, Crano&lt;ref name="Crano83"&gt;Crano, W. D. (1983). Assumed consensus of attitudes: the effect of vested interest. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 9, 597-608&lt;/ref&gt; created high and low vested interest groups by identifying whether upper- or lower-classmen would pay a surcharge to subsidize lost funding from the government. The class who was selected to pay the surcharge had a high degree of vested interest while the student body not required to pay exhibited a lower degree of vested interest. The study then determined the participants estimate of what percentage of the student body would support their beliefs regardless of impact. Crano found that vested interest influenced assumed consensus and students believed that a majority of the university's population would support their plight even though only half would be affected.&lt;ref name="Crano"/&gt;

===The effect of smoking on attitudes toward cigarette tax and smoking restrictions===
Dale Miller and Rebecca Ratner&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"&gt;Miller, D., &amp; Ratner, R. (1998). The Disparity Between the Actual and Assumed Power of Self-Interest. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 1, 53-62&lt;/ref&gt; conducted this study utilizing 81 male and female students at the University of Yale. In this experiment the objective was for half of the participants to show their own attitude toward smoking policies and the other half to show their thoughts on others attitudes toward smoking policies. The group with the questionnaire regarding their personal attitude about smoking were asked: 1. if they were a smoker or a nonsmoker, 2. how heavy or light a smoker they were, 3. whether they would support an increase on cigarette tax, 4. would they do away with smoking advertisements, and 5. their thoughts on smoking restrictions in public places. The second half of the participants were asked what percentage they thought smokers would support the previously mentioned policies for smokers or nonsmokers. They were not asked whether or not they smoked. The results of this study replicated Green and Gerkin's 1989 study&lt;ref&gt;Green, D., &amp; Gerken, A. (1989). Self-interest and public opinion toward smoking restrictions and cigarette taxes. Public Opinion Quarterly, 53, 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; that nonsmokers had more support for smoking restrictions than did those that smoke.&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt; These results supported the hypothesis: "Smokers in this study were more opposed to policies that regulated smoking than were nonsmokers, but the effect of smoking status on expressed attitudes was significantly less than that predicted by respondents".&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt; The smokers had a higher vested interest in smoking policies because they were directly affected. This study also revealed a direct correlation between vested interest and attitudes.&lt;ref name="M&amp;R"/&gt;

===Voter Registration===
Barbara Lehman and William Crano conducted a study regarding the persuasive effects of vested interest on attitude concerning political judgment which was published in 2001. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt; In this study, they utilized data from 1976 national election studies concentrating on three areas (e.g. living conditions, health insurance and school integration).  Their discoveries were such that self-interest was a significant contributor to values placed on all three areas of concern. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt; Further, outside analysis of the study revealed self-interest had a direct correlation to ideologies, affiliation, and intolerance.  Additionally, respondents with vested interest in any one of the three areas were more than likely to endorse candidates whose focus was in that particular area. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt;

	These findings, set in 1976, show a significant relationship between vested interest and aligned values associated with electoral candidates which can be either perceived or marketed.  Understanding these values, one can conclude, would allow for use of vested interest harvested by surveys to decide which values to champion for use in maximizing voter endorsement. &lt;ref name="Lehman &amp; Crano" /&gt;

==Issues==
Vested interest appears to affect people's tendency to overestimate the extent to which others agree with their beliefs, a bias known variously as the false-consensus or assumed-consensus effect.&lt;ref name="Crano83" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marks &amp; Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marks |first1=Gary |last2=Miller |first2=Norman |title=Ten years of research on the false-consensus effect: An empirical and theoretical review. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=1987 |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=72–90 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.102.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross, Greene &amp; House"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Lee |last2=Greene |first2=David |last3=House |first3=Pamela |title=The “false consensus effect”: An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=May 1977 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=279–301 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;If people tend to overestimate the number of others who share their beliefs, this tendency should be exacerbated in situations involving personally consequential, or highly vested, beliefs. Research supports this expectation.&lt;ref name="Crano83"/&gt; College student participants who thought that a new university policy would disadvantage them personally assumed that the great majority of the student body would evaluate the policy as they had, despite the fact that only half the student population would be similarly disadvantaged.

==Summary==
Each of the five components (stake, salience, certainty, immediacy, and self-efficacy) co-exist within an individual’s realm of conscious judgment. If it creates a sufficiently strong attitude, any of these components can cause an individual to adopt or reject a certain position. All five are considered any time an individual is presented with a message that attempts to influence or persuade him to adopt a certain position or perform an action. The process of evaluating these components can range from almost instantly to taking several years. At any rate, all five are considered (consciously or subconsciously) before making a decision with implications of vested interest.

'''Voluntarism''', sometimes referred to as '''voluntary action''', is the principle that individuals are free to choose goals and how to achieve them within the bounds of certain societal and cultural constraints, as opposed to actions that are coerced or [[predetermined]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|chapter=Chapter Four: Talcott Parsons and Robert Merton, Functionalism and Modernization|title=Introduction to Sociological Theory: Theorists, Concepts, and their Applicability to the Twenty-First Century|last=Dillon|first=Michele|publisher=Wiley|orig-year=2009|year=2013|isbn=9781118471906|page=161, 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteerism==
Volunteer management specialist Susan Ellis differentiates between "voluntarism" and "[[volunteerism]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Voluntarism" (the older term) refers to everything voluntary. In the United States this includes religion. It certainly encompasses the entire "[[voluntary sector]]," but "voluntary" in the "voluntarism" context means not mandated by law (as government is). Many voluntary sector (nonprofit) agencies have a volunteer board because that is a legal requirement, but may not utilize volunteers in direct service in any way. There are subjects within "voluntarism" that have nothing to do with volunteers, such as [[Unrelated Business Income Tax]] legislation, proposal writing, and compensation law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan J. Ellis |title=Volunt/ar/eer/ism: What's the Difference? |url=https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030822/https://www.energizeinc.com/tips/voluntareerism-whats-difference |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Voluntary provision of services to religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history. Such volunteer efforts keep expenses down for non-profit and philanthropic organizations, empower individuals and groups to help others, and make volunteers feel needed.&lt;ref name="Perkins"&gt;{{cite web |author=Susan Perkins |url=http://www.learningtogive.org/papers/paper67.html |title=Voluntarism |publisher=Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism flourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and was empowering especially to the women who had been excluded from political participation outside the home. Women’s organizations dealt with social problems created by rapid industrialization and urbanization, and by massive immigration which were not addressed by institutions of the time and had a great influence on American political culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kathryn Kish Sklar |url=http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |date=1998 |title=The "Quickened Conscience"], |publisher=Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806053219/http://www.puaf.umd.edu/IPPP/summer98/quckened_conscience.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntarism has been a phrase used in labor relations.  In Britain, it means the state refrains from directly intervening in industrial relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/UNITED%20KINGDOM/VOLUNTARISM-EN.htm |title=United Kingdom, Voluntarism |publisher=Eurofound |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early American labor movement it meant trade unions should focus on "pure and simple" gains in wages and working conditions and not independent labor politics and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David Brian Robertson |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=38781 |title=Voluntarism Against the Open Shop: Labor and Business Strategies in the Battle for American Labor Markets] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |journal=Studies in American Political Development |date=April 1999 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=146–85 |accessdate=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Willful Liberalism: Voluntarism and Individuality in Political Theory and Practice'', [[Johns Hopkins University]] political science professor [[Richard E. Flathman]] argues that liberals must understand more about individuality and self-reliance and self-responsibility and therefore be more open of acceptance of voluntary action and less concerned with ordering political society. He notes, "Americans of all ages, all conditions, and all dispositions constantly form associations," which he describes as "of a thousand other kinds, religious, moral, serious, futile, general or restricted, enormous or diminutive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard E.

In [[sociology]], voluntarism is an important aspect of the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]], as well as other theories of [[social action]] and [[agency (sociology)|agency]].

[[Voluntaryism|Voluntaryists]], [[free market]] advocates, [[libertarians]] and [[anarchists]] call for voluntary efforts to replace most or all government efforts, using both moral and utilitarian arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David T.

Voluntary provision of services to the religious, civil, medical, educational, environmental and other private or governmental organizations doubtless has a long history.
* [[William Penn]], who established the Quakers in the late 17th century, preached taking responsibility for others and improving the world.
* [[Cotton Mather]], who lived during the colonial period, encouraged the formation of associations and causes.
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] organized a voluntary militia in Quaker-controlled Pennsylvania, whose pacifist legislature refused to support the American revolutionary war.
* [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] noted the unusually large number of voluntary associations in America.
* The [[Underground Railroad]] was a network of volunteers who helped slaves escape from their captors in the South.
* [[Dorothea Dix]], a nurse, recruited and trained other women as nurses during the Civil War.
* [[Clara Barton]] also served as a Civil War nurse and went on to establish the American Red Cross in 1881 for relief of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.
* [[Jane Addams]] opened a settlement house in 1889 to teach volunteers how to help the poor improve their lives.
* In 1995, 93 million Americans volunteered an average of 4.3 hours per week.&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt;

'''WinCustomize''' is a [[website]] that provides content for users to customize [[Microsoft Windows]]. The site hosts thousands of [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[theme (computer)|themes]], [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other graphical content to modify the Windows [[graphical user interface]].  There are some premium or paid content, however the vast majority of the content is free for users to download.

== Site history ==
WinCustomize was launched in March 2001 by [[Brad Wardell]] and [[Pat Ford (businessman)|Pat Ford]], both of whom work at [[Stardock]]. After the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com recession]] had taken down many popular [[skin (computing)|skin]] sites, WinCustomize quickly grew in popularity due to a combination of wide variety of content, uptime reliability, and being the preferred content destination by [[Stardock]] customers.

The site has grown at a far greater pace than its founders had anticipated. It has managed to avoid having to put many limitations on users or having to resort to pop-up advertising because of its corporate patron Stardock subsidizing its costs.
This growth has prompted several site redesigns to offer improved functionality and reliability to users.

Since launch, WinCustomize has undergone several iterations:

'''WinCustomize 2k5''' - Launched at the end of 2004, WinCustomize was redesigned for improved stability, and added functionality (personal pages for subscribers, an articles system, tutorials etc.).

'''WinCustomize 2k7''' - Launched January 15, 2007, WC2k7 was a from-the-ground-up rewrite using [[ASP.NET]]. The focus was to build a foundation that was easier to maintain and, in the future, expand.

'''WinCustomize v6''' - Planned for Late 2008/Early 2009, the WC v6 project aims be a major revision to how users navigate and interact with the site and the community as a whole. Where 2k7 was focused on the core codebase, v6 is focused on the user interface and experience.

In July 2007 the WinCustomize Wiki was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.wincustomize.com/?aid=157328|title=Welcome to the WinCustomize Wiki!|author=Mike Crassweller|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WinCustomize 2010''' - WinCustomize 2010 was launched on April 20, 2010.  This major revision represents a major change in the sites look and navigation for users. A guided tour of the new site was published for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wincustomize.com/article/378698/|title=WinCustomize 2K10 Guided Tour|author=Frogboy|date=2010-03-25|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forum criticisms==
{{peacock|section|date=July 2011}}
While nearly all users visit WinCustomize.com to download [[skin (computing)|skins]], [[Theme (computing)|themes]], [[icons]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]], and other content for their personal computers, WinCustomize does have extensive forums and articles areas. As with most large sites, WinCustomize is not without its critics with regards to how the forums are run and the content in the articles and forums area.

The site's news contains a great deal of editorial content. As a result, some users are occasionally concerned with stories that they feel are biased against policies or issues they disagree with. For example, site owner [[Brad Wardell]] has written articles that are critical of Apple, European policy, commercialism, anti-commercialism, and more. One recent article criticized Norway's banning of the iPod music store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wincustomize.com/articles.aspx?aid=142193 Norway bans iTunes store, cuts nose, spites face]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of WinCustomize is the site's close association with [[Stardock]] which owns the site. Some feel there is a [[conflict of interest]] in the world's largest skinning site (over 20 million visitors monthly){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} being operated by a software developer that sells skinning solutions.

== Popular skinning programs ==
Programs heavily associated with Windows customization include:

*''[[WindowBlinds]]'' – enables users to customize the look and feel of the Windows GUI
*''[[Winamp]]'' – A skinnable media player from Nullsoft
*''[[IconPackager]]'' – A program that enables users to change their Windows icons
*''[[Rainlendar]]'' — A skinnable calendar and small desktop application (widgets &amp; monitoring) program
*''[[DesktopX]]'' — A program that enables users to build their own desktop with objects and widgets
*''[[Windows Media Player]]'' — Microsoft's skinnable media player.
*''[[LiteStep]]'' – A noted desktop shell replacement for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].
*''[[ObjectDock]]'' — provides a dock that adds functionality to the Windows interface, similar but not an emulation of the dock in Mac OS X
*''[[LogonStudio]]'' — alters the [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]] [[welcome screen]]
*''[[BootSkin]]'' — alters the [[Windows 2000]] and Windows XP [[boot screen]]
