      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4730">'''Aclla''' ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: '''aklla''' or '''aqlla,''' pl. '''aqllakuna'''), also called '''Chosen Women''', '''Virgins of the Sun''', and '''Wives of the Inca,''' were sequestered women in the  [[Inca Empire]].  They were [[virgins]], chosen at about age 10.  They performed several services. They were given in marriage to men who had distinguished themselves in service to the empire; they produced luxury items, weaving fine cloth, preparing ritual food, and brewing the [[chicha]] (beer) drunk at religious festivals; and some, the most "perfect", were selected as [[human sacrifices]] for religious rites.  Others lived out their lives in a [[monastery|monastic]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Costin, Cathy Lynne (1998), "Housewives, Chosen Women, Skilled Men: Cloth Production and Social Identity in the Late Prehistoric Andes," ''Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association,'' vol. 8, No. 1, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection and training==
The Inca Empire (1438-1533) created, or adopted from earlier cultures, several institutions to manage the labor of the people in the territory it ruled. Among the institutions were the [[mit'a]], the [[yanakuna]], and the aclla.

Each year the Inca government sent out representatives, called apupanaca, to collect girls eight to ten years old from the provinces as tribute for the state.  The girls selected were mostly from the higher social classes, frequently coming from the families of non-Inca provincial leaders. The girls were sent for training in provincial centers to live together in complexes of buildings called acllawasi (house of the chosen women) which might have up to 200 women in residence.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. (2003), ''The Incas'', Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The girls were trained for about 4 years in religion, spinning and weaving, preparation of food, and brewing chicha.  They then became mamakuna (priestesses) and were married to prominent men or assigned to religious duties.  The most skilled and physically perfect were sent to [[Cuzco]], the capital of the empire, and might become secondary wives or concubines of the Inca emperor and other noblemen.  A few were destined to be sacrificed in a religious ceremony called [[capacocha]].&lt;ref name="INCA IMPERIAL DILEMMAS, KINSHIP, AND HISTORY"&gt;{{cite book |author=Irene Silverblatt |title=Inca Imperial Dilemmas, Kinship, and History |publisher=Comparative Studies in Society and History Vol. 30. No. 1: Cambridge University Press |date=January 1988 |location=83-102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently discovered archaeological evidence contained the remains of a male ''aclla''.&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/peru/worlds/sacrifice1.html |title=The Sacrificial Ceremony |author=Liesl Clark |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social significance== 
The use of ''acllas'' was tied to [[kinship]] and the maintenance of [[hegemony]] within the empire. The family of a chosen ''aclla'' would be raised in social status. The ''acllas'' themselves would honour the main Inca [[god]]s and be honoured in return. Those not sacrificed at Cuzco might be returned to their own communities and be sacrificed there. This would create a ritual bond between Cuzco and the local region; Cuzco had taken a member of the local community and made them a representative of the central state. The ''aclla'' had been blessed by the Emperor and became the guardian of the local [[huacas]]. This signaled the entrance of the empire into local [[tradition]] and religion. This tying of the centre to the periphery was one of the most important aspects of the sacrifice of ''acllas''. The story of Tanta Carhua is one such account of the process of binding the centre and the periphery together.&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies" /&gt;

Colonial documents contain record of Tanta Carhua, who was sacrificed as a ''capacocha'' in her home [[ayllu]] of Urcon. After visiting Cuzco and being honoured by the emperor, Tanta Carhua was credited with saying “You can finish with me now because I could not be more honoured than by the feasts which they celebrated for me in Cuzco."&lt;ref name="Nova - Ice Mummies" /&gt; Upon her return home, Tanta’s father became the [[curaca]] of his [[ayllu]]. Tanta was deified and her “sacrifice... ritually asserted her father’s, and father’s descendants’, new role as a nexus between Urcon and Cuzco while dramatizing the community’s subordination to Cuzco.”&lt;ref name="INCA IMPERIAL DILEMMAS, KINSHIP, AND HISTORY" /&gt;

'''Adnan Khashoggi''' ({{lang-ar|عدنان خاشقجي}}; 25 July 1935&amp;nbsp;– 6 June 2017) was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n businessman, known for his lavish business deals and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/arts/lavish-lifestyle-of-a-wheeler-dealer.html|title=Lavish Lifestyle Of a Wheeler-Dealer|last=Salmans|first=Sandra|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is estimated to have had a peak [[net worth]] of around US$4 billion in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author=David Leigh and Rob Evans|title=Biography: Adnan Khashoggi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/bae52|website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=29 January 2012 |location=London |date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and education ==
Khashoggi was born in [[Mecca]], the son of [[Muhammad Khashoggi|Mohammad Khashoggi]], who was King [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz Al Saud]]'s personal doctor.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Bin Laden family|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/family.html|access-date=26 February 2013|newspaper=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/men/adnan-khashoggi-net-worth/ |title=Adnan Khashoggi Net Worth |publisher=Therichest.com |date=25 July 1935 |access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Khashoggi himself has also said that he had a Jewish grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;New York Magazine, "Stepping Out", By Jeanie Kasindorf, 18 Dec 1989, Page 44. https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=NugCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=khashoggi+Jeanie+Kasindorf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimvtGk7JjeAhVDYxoKHQi9ACcQ6AEIMTAD#v=snippet&amp;q=grandfather&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Adnan Khashoggi's sister was author [[Samira Khashoggi]] who married businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] and was the mother of [[Dodi Fayed]].&lt;ref name="ponton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ponton|first1=Rebecca|title=Soheir Khashoggi: Success Is No Mirage|journal=Woman Abroad Magazine|volume=Sept/Oct 2001|issue=7|url=http://www.rebeccaponton.com/skhashoggi.htm|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sister, [[Soheir Khashoggi]], is a well-known Arab writer (''Mirage'', ''Nadia's Song'', ''Mosaic'').&lt;ref name="ponton" /&gt; He was an uncle of journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]].

Khashoggi was educated at [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; and the [[United States|American]] universities [[California State University, Chico]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. Khashoggi left his studies in order to seek his fortune in business.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bry0sOwstIMC |title=Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam |last=Sidhu |first=Jatswan S.  |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780810870789 |edition=2, illustrated |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheNabila-1.jpg|alt=|thumb|478x478px|Khashoggi's super-yacht The Nabila, later sold to [[Donald Trump]]&lt;ref name=vanity/&gt;]]

== Business career ==

Khashoggi's early years were spent among some of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures. "While attending school he met [[Hussein bin Talal]], the future [[King of Jordan]]. It was at school that Khashoggi first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate whose father manufactured towels, earning US$1,000 for the introduction. Khashoggi's subsequent education at university would serve as a launchpad for his commercial career."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Cross|first=Jim|title=Adnan Khashoggi|date=1985-02-23|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7553370/|last2=Gessner|first2=Hal|accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his first big deals, a large construction company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands. Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of [[Kenworth]] trucks, whose wide wheels made traversing the desert considerably easier. Khashoggi made his first US$250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped bring together Western companies and the Saudi Arabian Government to satisfy the needs of the young Kingdom for its infrastructure and defense needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. Khashoggi "became for all practical purposes a marketing arm of Lockheed. Khashoggi would provide not only an entrée but strategy, constant advice, and analysis", according to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed's [[international marketing]].&lt;ref name="R000185"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963261-5,00.html|title=Cover Stories: Khashoggi's High-Flying Realm|last=Stengel|first=Richard|date=19 January 1987|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=25 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919071454/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C963261-5%2C00.html|archivedate=19 September 2008|deadurl=no|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial pioneer, he established companies in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to handle his commissions as well as developing contacts with notables such as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officers [[James H. Critchfield]] and [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.|Kim Roosevelt]] and United States businessman [[Charles Rebozo|Bebe Rebozo]], a close associate of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. His yacht, the [[Kingdom 5KR|''Nabila'']], was the largest in the world at the time and was used in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After Khashoggi ran into financial problems he sold the yacht to the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]], who in turn sold it for $29 million to [[Donald Trump]], who sold it for $20 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-the-fabulous-world-of-donald-trump-where-money-is-no-problem/2015/10/09/e51ae0fc-6161-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|title=Inside the fabulous world of Donald Trump, where money is no problem|last1=Roberts|first1=Roxanne|date=9 October 2015|access-date=16 August 2016|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Prince [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]] as part of a deal to keep his [[Trump Taj Mahal|Taj Mahal]] casino out of bankruptcy.

Khashoggi headed a company called Triad International Holding Company, which among other things built the [[Triad Center]] in [[Salt Lake City]], which later went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-29/news/mn-2279_1_bankruptcy-court |title=Utah Company of Khashoggi Goes Bankrupt |access-date=7 June 2017 |work=Los Angeles Times |agency=Associated Press |publication-date=29 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was famed as an arms dealer, brokering deals between US firms and the [[Saudi Arabia#Politics|Saudi government]], most actively in the 1960s and 1970s. In the documentary series ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', Saudi author Said Aburish states that one of Khashoggi's first weapons deals was providing [[David Stirling]] with weapons for a covert mission in [[Yemen]] during the [[Aden Emergency]] in 1963. Among his overseas clients were [[Arms industry|defense contractors]] [[Lockheed Corporation]] (now [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martin Corporation]]), [[Raytheon]], [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] and [[Northrop Corporation]] (the last two of which have now merged into [[Northrop Grumman]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/world/middleeast/adnan-khashoggi-dead-saudi-arms-trader.html?_r=0 |title=Adnan Khashoggi, High-Living Saudi Arms Trader, Dies at 81 |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |access-date=7 June 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publication-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triad International ==

'''Triad International''' is a multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by Khashoggi. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the world. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standardmedia" /&gt;
[[File:Adnan Khashoggi Khalidia Yacht.jpg|thumb|Khashoggi's yacht Khalidia]]
The Global span of the businesses prompted the creation by the Khashoggi family of a board-game called Triopoly which was modeled after the classic game of Monopoly. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. The game was manufactured and given to family and friends.

Triad International was formed in the early 1960s and as it grew spanned five continents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The company holdings included hotels, shopping centers, banks, oil refineries, a computer manufacturer, a gold mine, construction companies, car and truck franchises, and a professional sports team, the [[Utah Jazz]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="standardmedia" /&gt;
[[File:Adnan Khashoggi Triad Triopoly Board Game.jpg|thumb|Khashoggi's custom board game of his properties]]
The company was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with its subsidiary companies located in the United States, Canada, and Saudi Arabia.

In 1990, a United States federal jury in [[Manhattan]] acquitted Khashoggi and [[Imelda Marcos]], widow of the exiled Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], of racketeering and fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-02/news/mn-640_1_imelda-marcos-acquitted |title=Imelda Marcos Acquitted : Cleared of Looting Philippines to Buy N.Y.

'''Basil El-Baz''' is an Egyptian [[industrialist]], [[entrepreneur]] and business executive serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Carbon Holdings, a mid-to-downstream oil and gas development company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=98342239 "Company Overview of Carbon Holdings"] ''Bloomberg Businessweek''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

While studying government and economics at [[Harvard University]], El-Baz developed the concept for building an ammonia plant in Egypt, which ultimately became [http://www.orascom.com/our-capabilities/case-studies/egypt-basic-industries-corporation-ebic/ Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC]). He submitted a feasibility study on this concept and was awarded a grant by the United States Trade and Development Agency to conduct further studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromoneyconferences.com/Speaker-Details/8385/The-Euromoney-Egypt-Conference.html?id=6560 "Egypt: Forward Forum Concludes on High-Note With New Commercial Partnerships"]&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Baz has developed and financed two major industrial greenfield projects in Egypt, Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC) and Egypt Hydrocarbon Corporation (EHC).  EBIC represents and still is the only project to receive a comprehensive loan guarantee from the Export – Import Bank of the United States. Furthermore, EBIC is one of a select number of projects in Egypt to be financed entirely by consortium of international banks. The project had an approximate value of US$650 million at closing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/06/30/egypt-us-companies-partner-on-35-bln-petrochemical-project/ "Egypt, US companies partner on $3.5 bln petrochemical project"] ''Daily News Egypt''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; EBIC proved to be successful and today is the 6th largest global exporter of ammonia. EBIC was eventually sold to Orascom Construction Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/Orascom-Construction-Industries-Invests-in-Ammonia-Plant-667856.htm "Orascom Construction Industries Invests in Ammonia Plant"] ''Market Wired''. Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon Holdings’ second project, Egypt Hydrocarbon Corporation (EHC), with a transaction value of approximately US$550 million is considered as the first major industrial project to close in post-revolution Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2011/07/31/egypt-hydrocarbon-company-signs-454-million-deal/ "Egypt Hydrocarbon Company signs $454 million deal"] ''Daily News Egypt''.

Retrieved 2014-7-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the second project commenced in August 2011 with commercial operation scheduled to commence during the first quarter of 2017.

In December 2012, Carbon Holdings concluded its US$114 million acquisition of the Egyptian polypropylene producer, Oriental Petrochemicals Corporation (OPC), which had been shut down since 2011. After a technical and commercial restructuring, OPC re-commenced commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Carbon Holdings is developing the approximate of US$11 billion Naphtha Cracker and Polyethylene Complex project named Tahrir Petrochemicals Corporation (TPC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/news/479566 "GE, Carbon Holdings sign $500m technology cooperation deal"] ''Arab News''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8112">'''Body shopping''' is the practice of [[consultancy]] firms recruiting workers (generally in [[information technology]] sector) in order to contract their services out on tactical short to mid-term basis. IT services companies that practice body shopping assert that they provide real services (such as software development) rather than the "sham" of merely farming out professionals to overseas companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=39&amp;ndash;40|title=Virtual Migration|author=[[A. Aneesh|Aneesh Aneesh]]|chapter=Body Shopping|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2006|isbn=9780822336693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and origin ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Body shopping in IT originated during the mid-1990s when there was a huge demand for people with [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]], [[COBOL]] and related technology skills to prevent systems being affected by the [[Y2K]] bug.

Most specialist Y2K consulting companies operating in the US, Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Australia outsourced their technical manpower requirements to companies operating in India. 

During the period of 1996-97, such companies operating with India base responded to the heavy demand by recruiting and training local graduates in India specifically for [[Y2K]]. Their consultants either worked onshore or offshore at high utilization rates generating huge [[profit margin]]s and cash reserves. The high-profit margin during this period resulted in fast growth and sufficient assets to invest and expand operations to other IT related business segments post-Y2K.

=== Modern era ===
In the modern era of IT off-shoring, outsourcing, and cloud computing, it is widely accepted that IT service companies' strategy (especially for those operating with a huge technical manpower base in India) still continue to focus on similar lines. The companies that do body shopping are renowned for training and developing technical skills for a wide range of client base that is of current demand.
Researchers point out that many Indian companies focus heavily on developing a large pool of human resources with technical skills creating a [[marketplace]] to 'buy' technical skills on an hourly or daily basis.

This led to significant market developments in two areas in the early 2000s:

# Fierce competition amongst IT service companies from India competing on a global level to win 'time and material and labor tenders' from multinational giants for their IT needs. Such a strategy, though heavily linked to procurement needs of the end-customer, enables IT companies operating from offshore (in particular India) to forecast demand for technical and managerial competencies based on IT-skills-market trends in order to position themselves competitively.&lt;ref name=body&gt;Brenda S. Yeoh and Katie Willis, editors, 'State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific', Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30279-1}}, pp. 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Technology and consulting companies operating mainly in western markets during the 1990s (e.g. [[Accenture]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard]]) were forced to open offices in southeast Asia and move their manpower base there to compete with traditional manpower providers operated from India (e.g. [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services]]) on large global-level IT bids.

According to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services report to Congress, for fiscal year 2012, 59 percent of H-1B visas went to computer-related occupations. The same report also cited that 64 percent of the H-1B visa petitions granted were given to workers originating from India.&lt;ref name="Indentured Servitude"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stock |last2=Putnam |last3=Pham |last4=Carroll |first1=Stephen |first2=Julie |first3=Scott |first4=Jeremy|title=Silicon Valley's "Body Shop" Secret: Highly Educated Foreign Workers Treated Like Indentured Servants|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Silicon-Valleys-Body-Shop-Secret-280567322.html|website=NBC Bay Area|publisher=The Investigate Unit|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Vallance|first1=Brian|title=Characteristics of H1B Specialty Occupation Workers|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1347381-2b-h1b-fy-12-characteristics.html|website=Document Cloud|publisher=US Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue model ==
Body shopping companies mainly recruit off-shore and provide training to their employees using their off-shore facilities.

Employment costs (both short-term and permanent) are generally offset by the highly profitable billing ratio, especially for on-site assignments abroad. Most companies boast a utilization rate of 80%, which also takes into account the potentially long 'bench period', where an employee is not billable or when their skills are not in demand.

== Indian body shopping networks ==
In India, traditional body shopping has evolved in its due course post-[[Y2K]] era to create strong networking and collaboration between competing Indian body shops working abroad. All body shops claim to have the ability to place Indian workers in almost any country using the resources and services of other Indian body shops operating in the target country.&lt;ref name=Biao1&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Brenda S. Yeoh |editor2=Katie Willis |title=State/Nation/Transnation: Perspectives on Transnationalism in the Asia-Pacific|publisher=Routledge|date=2004|isbn=978-0-415-30279-1|pages=166&amp;ndash;167|author=Xiang Biao|chapter=Indian information technology professionals' world system: the nation and the transnation in individuals' migration strategies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one documented case study deemed as a typical example, a body shop in Hyderabad was able to win a 360 man-month deal with a U.S. company that urgently needed 40 IT workers with a very "specific" skill on a 9-month project. Although the Indian body shop company could easily find lower paid workers in India for the job, the [[H-1B visa]] process would take too long to bring them into the United States to work. Thus, the Indian firm forwarded a request to its associates' network to locate 40 Indian temporary workers in the United States. A search was undertaken by the network for available Indian H-1B workers, resulting in a list of recently laid-off Indian H-1B workers in the US. Sponsorship for the laid-off Indian H-1B workers was reassigned to a body shop and a portion of the newly employed worker's salary was given as commission to the peer body shop that helped to locate the laid off H-1B workers in their associated peer network of Indian body shops. This process of quickly recruiting available H-1B holders is what is referred to as "body shopping".&lt;ref name=Biao1/&gt;

== Offshoring and nearshoring ==

A similar "[[offshoring]]" practice started appearing more and more in the 2010 timeframe and which was a practice known as "[[nearshoring]]".  Nearshoring was the practice of hiring mostly IT professionals from Mexico.  The outward appearance being the advantage of "nearshoring" personnel being within a 2 hour or less time difference to continental U.S. companies opting to use these nearshoring services.

{{Contract law}}
'''Breach of contract''' is a [[legal]] [[cause of action]] and a type of [[civil wrong]], in which a [[binding agreement]] or bargained-for exchange is not honored by one or more of the parties to the contract by non-performance or interference with the other party's performance. Breach occurs when a party to a contract fails to fulfill his or her obligation as described in the contract, or communicates an intent to fail the obligation or otherwise appears not to be able to perform his or her obligation under the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breach of Contract|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/breach-of-contract/|website=The Law Dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor breaches==
In a "minor" breach (a partial breach or immaterial breach or where there has been substantial performance), the non-breaching party cannot sue for [[specific performance]], and can only sue for actual [[damages]].

Suppose a homeowner hires a contractor to install new plumbing and insists that the pipes, which will ultimately be hidden behind the walls, must be red. The contractor instead uses blue pipes that function just as well. Although the contractor breached the literal terms of the [[contract]], the homeowner cannot ask a court to order the contractor to replace the blue pipes with red pipes. The homeowner can only recover the amount of his or her actual damages. In this instance, this is the difference in value between red pipe and blue pipe. Since the color of a pipe does not affect its function, the difference in value is zero. Therefore, no damages have been incurred and the homeowner would receive nothing (see ''[[Jacob &amp; Youngs v. Kent]]''.)

However, had the pipe colour been specified in the agreement as a ''[[covenant (law)|condition]]'', a breach of that condition would constitute a "major" breach. For example, when a contract specifies [[time is of the essence]] and one party to the contract fails to meet a contractual obligation in a timely fashion, the other party could sue for damages for a major breach.

==Material breach==
A ''material breach'' is any failure to perform that permits the other party to the contract to either compel performance, or collect damages because of the breach. A breach of contract will constitute a material breach if the term of the contract that has been breached is a '''condition'''. A term is a condition if it satisfies the test of essentiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|37|1938|litigants=Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park |parallelcite=(1938) 38 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 632 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The test of essentiality requires that the promise (term) was of such importance to the promisee that he or she would not have entered into the contract unless he had been assured of strict or substantial performance of the promise and this ought to have been apparent to the promisor. This is an objective test of the parties' intention at the time of formation of the contract. 

If the contractor in the above example had been instructed to use copper pipes, and instead used iron pipes that would not last as long as the copper pipes would have lasted, the homeowner can recover the cost of actually correcting the breach – taking out the iron pipes and replacing them with copper pipes.

There are exceptions to this. Legal scholars and courts often state that the owner of a house whose pipes are not the specified grade or quality (a typical hypothetical example) cannot recover the cost of replacing the pipes for the following reasons:

# '''Economic waste'''. The law does not favor tearing down or destroying something that is valuable (almost anything with value is "valuable"). In this case, significant destruction of the house would be required to completely replace the pipes, and so the law is hesitant to enforce damages of that nature. See ''[[Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co.]]''.
# '''Pricing in'''. In most cases of breach, a party to the contract simply fails to perform one or more terms. In those cases, the breaching party should have already considered the cost to perform those terms and thus "keeps" that cost when they do not perform. That party should not be entitled to keep those savings. However, in the pipe example the contractor never considered the cost of tearing down a house to fix the pipes, and so it is not reasonable to expect them to pay damages of that nature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Most homeowners would be unable to collect damages that compensate them for replacing the pipes, but rather would be awarded damages that compensate them for the ''loss of value'' in the house. For example, say the house is worth $125,000 with copper and $120,000 with iron pipes. The homeowner would be able to collect the $5,000 difference, and nothing more.


In the United States, the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]] lists the following criteria to determine whether a specific failure constitutes a material breach:&lt;ref&gt;[[American Law Institute]], Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 241 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In determining whether a failure to render or to offer performance is material, the following circumstances are significant:

:(a) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected;
:(b) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately [[payment|compensated]] for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived;
:(c) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture;
:(d) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure, taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances;
:(e) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.}}

==Fundamental breach==
A ''[[fundamental breach]]'' (or ''repudiatory breach'') is a breach so fundamental that it permits the aggrieved party to terminate performance of the contract. In addition, that party is entitled to [[lawsuit|sue]] for damages.

==Anticipatory breach==
A ''breach by [[anticipatory repudiation]]'' (or simply ''anticipatory breach'') is an unequivocal indication that the party will not perform when performance is due, or a situation in which future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1985|litigants=Progressive Mailing House v Tabali Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1985) 157 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 17 at p. 48 |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|51|1989|litigants=Foran v Wight |parallelcite=(1989) 168 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 385 at pp 416, 441-2 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15, A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paterson|first1=Jeannie|last2=Robertson|first2=Andrew|last3=Duke|first3=Arlen|title=Principles of Contract Law|date=2012|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited|location=Sydney|page=440|edition=Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coinjection''' is a [[polymer injection]] technology in which different [[polymer]]s are injected into the same [[mold]]. 

Reasons for using coinjection are:
# reducing cost by using a cheaper fill material as the non-visible core of a product{{ref|cheap}}
# combining desired properties of polymers, such as colour (the differently colored parts in car tail lights), feel (soft-touch toothbrush) or mechanical properties.
# alter the density and elasticity of the final project making it either float in water or shock absorbent. 

Despite these advantages, coinjection requires machinery that is more expensive and difficult to maintain than standard single injection machines.  The coinjection process also has difficulty with complex geometric shapes.{{ref|machine}}

'''Cyberport''' ({{zh|t=數碼港}}) is a [[business park]] in [[Hong Kong]] consisting of four office buildings, a hotel, and a retail entertainment complex. It describes itself as a "creative digital community" with a cluster of technology and digital content tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberport.hk/cyberport/en/home/about_cyberport/ |title=Cyberport website |publisher=Cyberport.hk |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is owned and managed by Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited which is wholly owned by the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR Government]].

As of February 2016, Cyberport has incubated and funded over 320 startup companies since inception in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1913957/hong-kong-cyberport-narrows-target-hk200m-macro-fund-unveiled|title=Hong Kong Cyberport narrows target of HK$200m Macro Fund unveiled by CY Leung to start-ups past seed stage|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also announced in 2016 that it would set up a Cyberport Macro Fund to support local start-ups after seed stage but generally before or around Series A stage of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/economy/article/1913957/hong-kong-cyberport-narrows-target-hk200m-macro-fund-unveiled|title=Hong Kong Cyberport narrows target of HK$200m Macro Fund unveiled by CY Leung to start-ups past seed stage|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project background==
In March 1999, the Hong Kong government announced their intention to develop a "cyberport", which would help local businesses capitalise on the rapid growth of the Internet. The government hailed it as development where information technology and multimedia would be nurtured so that future demands of these industries could be met. According to the press release by the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, only one-third of the site would be for residential, the sale of which would then help finance the Cyberport development concept.&lt;ref name=19990303cedb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedb.gov.hk/ctb/eng/press/pr030399.htm|title=$13 billion Cyberport project announced|date=3 March 1999|work=Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (Communications and Technology Branch)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cyberport is billed as the home to one incubation facility for ICT startups called Entrepreneurship Centre providing office space, financial aid package,training, micro fund and network access to the investment community.

The Hong Kong government inked a partnership deal with the Pacific Century Group (PCG) to develop a {{convert|26|ha|adj=on}} site with open sea view at [[Telegraph Bay]] in [[Pok Fu Lam]], Hong Kong Island, at a total cost of HK$13 billion. It was announced as part of the 1999 budget by then-Financial Secretary, Donald Tsang. It was also hoped that this development would help the HKSAR's economy rebound after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], and bring a "strategic cluster of information technology and services companies situated in a world-class setting".&lt;ref name=19990303cedb/&gt; The "strategic telecommunication node" was due to be formed due to its close proximity to the proposed "Teleport" in Chung Hom Kok.&lt;ref name=19990303cedb/&gt; Touted benefits include "a range of shared facilities for tenants, including a multi-media based network, telecommunication links, media laboratory, cyber library and other information technology and services support facilities. There will also be educational, entertainment and recreational facilities related to information technology and services for local visitors and tourists".&lt;ref name=19990303cedb/&gt;

As part of the deal, PCG would construct a {{convert|990000|sqft|adj=on|disp=flip}} office complex with a {{convert|300000|sqft|adj=on|disp=flip}} shopping mall and a 173-room hotel that would be put out to management.  Title to these properties would be transferred to the government at zero cost, while PCG received land for {{convert|4500000|sqft|disp=flip}} of residential housing in exchange, and would reap 64.5 percent of the profits from their sale.&lt;ref name=20060712sentinel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/after-selling-pccw-in-which-industry-will-richard-li-find-his-future-2/|title=After Selling PCCW, in which industry will RICHARD LI find his future?|work=Asia Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the Cyberport portion consisting of four office buildings, The Arcade and [[Le Meridien Cyberport Hotel]] was completed in phases between 2002 and 2004. The residential developments consists of approximately 2,800 units or houses was completed in phases between 2004 and 2008.

==Controversy==
Granting the project to Pacific Century Group (PCG) controlled by [[Richard Li]], son of Hong Kong's wealthiest man [[Li Ka-Shing]], to develop the site generated much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/752181.stm|title=ASIA-PACIFIC – Hong Kong signs cyberport deal|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20101207wsj/&gt; Three private and wholly owned companies, namely, Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings Limited, Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited and Hong Kong Cyberport (Ancillary Development) Limited (collectively referred to as the "Cyberport companies") have been set up under the Financial Secretary Incorporated (FSI) to oversee the implementation of the project. The project was criticised as unnecessary government intervention in the property sector. The granting of the project to PCG without the benefit of a formal open tender attracted criticism for lack of transparency; other interested developers complain of being sidelined.&lt;ref name=20101207wsj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/hong-kong/2010/12/07/how-to-make-web-30-reality/|title=Cyberport's Chief Executive on Web 3.0 and Technology in Hong Kong |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Ko  | first = Eric  | title = Cyberport critics get stake hint  | work = The Standard  | location = Hong Kong  | date = 21 March 1999  | url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=25641&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990321&amp;sear_year=1999  | accessdate = 11 January 2007  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071122134958/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=25641&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990321&amp;sear_year=1999  | archivedate = 22 November 2007  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics, Cyberport was in reality a residential property project in disguise, as it has arguably failed in its mission of becoming a high-technology hub for the city.&lt;ref name=20120716eurasia/&gt;&lt;ref name=20040511theage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/11/1084041395274.html|title=Cyberport tech park still has doubters |author=Andrew Coffey|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eurasia Review'' suggested that the government land was injected into the project at under value. The overall rationale of the project has been questioned: details that have emerged about the planning and budgeting for the project indicate that 75% of the area developed is residential, and office space allocated for the technology companies would only be around 17% of the total. Also the "shared facilities" make up part of a small {{convert|18000|sqm|adj=on}} block which includes houses and apartments.&lt;ref name=20120716eurasia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/16072012-hong-kong-revelations-in-shk-bribery-case-collusion-between-politicians-and-property-tycoons-oped/|title=Hong Kong: Revelations In SHK Bribery Case; Collusion Between Politicians And Property Tycoons – OpEd|date=16 July 2012|work=Eurasia Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project had the reputation of being a "ghost town", as the government owned portion suffered low occupancy.&lt;ref name=20101207wsj/&gt; Fifteen companies signed letters of intent with the developer, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft and Yahoo, but only three moved in at the initial opening due to a technology slump.&lt;ref name=20020405taipei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2002/04/05/0000130662|title=Multinationals back away from Hong Kong's IT park|work=Taipei Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government rejected accusations of favouritism by arguing that PCG's presence as an anchor tenant would be an advantage for marketing to prestigious international technology companies. In addition, tendering was bypassed ostensibly to shorten the sensitive time frame to bring forward the economic benefits of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/199903/16/0316213.htm|title=Secret deal on Cyberport dismissed|date=16 March 1999| publisher=info.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCG later hived off the residential property interests into a shell company separate from the telecoms operation so that the shell company would receive the residential housing sales revenues; it was also accorded right of first refusal to redevelop sites of 60 existing telephone exchanges of [[PCCW]], the telecoms operator.&lt;ref name=20060712sentinel/&gt;&lt;ref name=20040511theage/&gt; In October 2004, [[David Webb (Hong Kong activist)|David Webb]] cited lack of transparency in the government's business dealings and demanded audited financial accounts and directors' reports for three companies related to the project to be released under the non-statutory Code on Access to Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webb-site.com/articles/cybersecrets.asp|title=Cyberport Secrets|publisher=webb-site.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing==

===Residence Bel-Air===
[[File:Residence Bel-Air2.JPG|thumb|Residence Bel-Air]]
Bel-Air (貝沙灣) is a luxury residential development in Cyberport. The development is split in six phases; phase 1 and 2 are referred to '''Residence Bel-Air''' and Phase 3 is referred as '''Bel-Air on the Peak'''. Phase 1 and 2 each have a clubhouse and 7 blocks that are about 48 floors tall. Floor 40 and upwards are flats that have the area of two flats combined into one, creating over {{convert|3200|sqft|m2}}. All of which feature sky gardens with ocean views. Enumeration of "Block 4" and all 4th floors of each block has been avoided [[Tetraphobia|for superstitious reasons]].  However the management company neglected to omit 4 when naming the construction phases.

Each floor of "Bel-Air on the Peak" has three apartments, 2 larger units, 'A' and 'C' and a smaller 2-bedroom unit 'B'.  The clubhouse of "Bel-Air on the Peak" is significantly newer with more artistic features.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  They maintain an indoor pool, gym, restaurant, snooker room, and children's game room.

Bel-Air has two clubhouses: the Bay Wing and Peak Wing. They feature a [[spa]], indoor and outdoor swimming pool, game room, gym, children's play room, restaurant, and personal cinema. Each floor of the "Residence Bel-Air" has two flats with 3 bedrooms, 1 kitchen, and a [[balcony]]. Additionally there are single family homes near "Residence Bel-Air".

'''David Henderson''' (born 1953) is an [[Auckland]] [[property developer]]. He is regarded as one of the city's most influential businessmen and is said to have development work worth up to NZ$1 billion.

The son of a fitter and turner, he grew up in [[Milford, New Zealand|Milford]], and started his empire by renovating old [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]] houses. In the 1970s, he opened the Stove Shop, a second-hand dealership in Ponsonby Rd. In 1997 he bought and developed Princes Wharf and has since developed the $100 million Interplex [[industrial park]] at [[Albany, New Zealand|Albany]], Q City and Q Central [[apartment block]] and Precinct apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile: David Henderson, Auckland | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/organisation/story.cfm?o_id=176&amp;ObjectID=10339271 | date = 2005-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4456">'''Distribution Center Management System''' (DCMS) is a user friendly [[Warehouse Management System]] (WMS), designed to track the activities performed in a Distribution Center (DC)/ [[Warehouse]]. It is created and owned by a private company called Eclipse Systems Pvt Ltd. It automates the entire process flow of receiving, managing and shipping goods to customers from the warehouse. DCMS solutions are designed for both large and small scale businesses. In January 2015, the product went open source. 

DCMS helps warehouses to remove the risk of stock pile-up, stock outs, pending orders and loss of sales due to customer dissatisfaction. It dramatically improves the warehouse productivity and increase inventory accuracy to 99.8%.

It helps strengthening customer relationships, reduce operating expenses and increase warehouse and distribution efficiencies. Due to its modular design, DCMS can be easily customized for various clients as per their requirements. WMS is an intelligent investment that will instantly boost accuracy in the warehouse operations and yields long term financial benefits.

==DCMS modules==
A typical list of modules for DCMS can be as follows:

* receiving
* putaway
* order processing
* replenishment
* pulling
* restocking
* picking
* validation
* sorting
* shipping
&lt;br /&gt;
Features of a DCMS also has the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scan-infotech.com/distribution-chain-mobility-software.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* crate management
* supervisory control
* reports

==Benefits==
An effective DCMS helps to prevent stock outs, stock pile-ups, pending orders and loss of sales due to customer dissatisfaction. It improves the warehouse productivity and increases inventory accuracy too. Some other benefits include reducing operating expenses and improvement in efficiencies.

==Radio Frequency and Paper based Solution==
DCMS works in both Radio Frequency (RF) as well as paper based environment. DCMS is a future ready solution. Warehouses which do not wish to make heavy investments in RF immediately, have the option of choosing paper based environment first, and can later adopt RF technology with minimal time and effort.

==Third Party Integration==
DCMS provides an open interface and can be easily integrated with third party software applications. It reduces unnecessary paper work and office routines. Having DCMS in place means warehouses do not need to depend on someone’s experience any more.

==DCMS Vs Warehouse Module of Enterprise Resource Planning==
Inventory initiative in recent times such as JIT (Just In Time), ECR (Efficient Customer Response) and QR (Quick Response) have turned traditional inventory management users to WMS application users. Not only this, more and more Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) users are replacing their existing warehouse module of ERP with WMS because of its functionality fit, knowledgebase, latest up gradations, integration, adaptation to ever changing customer requirement which the ERP warehouse module cannot provide.

==System Architecture==
DCMS is based on Microsoft Technology with an Oracle as Database. It uses web based three tier architecture that provides a standard suite of warehousing applications. DCMS can also be installed on cloud and used as SAAS. DCMS provides rich source of WEB based reports that can be used by all levels of organizations for making important decisions.

==Future ready solution==
Think of a warehouse problem, DCMS will have comprehensive solution for that. Not only this, it is also ready for all future possibilities for which the warehouse may not be prepared in the current scenario. Eclipse System's rich knowledge base and R&amp;D department keeps the application up to date to provide the latest industry features.

A '''facilitating payment''' is a certain type of payment to foreign officials that is not considered to be [[bribery]] according to [[legislation]]s of some states as well as in the international anti-bribery conventions, e.g., coming from the [[OECD]].

==Dangers==
For legal purposes, it is distinguished from [[bribery]], however the distinction is often blurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/business/opinion/is-facilitating-payment-a-bribe-or-not-758043 "Is 'facilitating payment' a bribe or not?"], ''Business Report'', September 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Determining whether a payment is a facilitating one may be difficult and depend on the circumstances. The value of the payment is not immediately relevant, however the greater the value, the higher are chances that it will be a [[red flag (signal)|red flag]] for law enforcement. Small unofficial payments are customary and even legal in some countries, nevertheless they may present a risk of liability according to the laws of the host country. There also exists a [[slippery slope]] danger of evolving into dubious payments.&lt;ref name=deming/&gt;

==Business ethics==
While being legal, facilitating payments are still considered to be questionable from the point of view of [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Argandoña|first1=Antonio|title=Corruption and Companies: The Use of Facilitating Payments|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=251–264|doi=10.1007/s10551-005-0133-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailes, Robert (2006). Facilitation Payments: Culturally Acceptable or Unacceptable Corrupt? ''[[Business Ethics: A European Review]]'', 15(3), 293-298.&lt;/ref&gt; The following arguments have been made:
*[[Unfair competition]]: smaller business have fewer opportunities and less financial possibilities to "grease" foreign officials.
*sustaining questionable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rdoger|first1=Raliigh|title=Ways to improve international business payment solutions|url=http://www.transferguru.com/blog/9-ways-improve-your-international-business-payment-solutions/|website=www.transferguru.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*dependence on irregular payments creates additional risk and hence discourages investment&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many companies therefore restrict or severely limit making facilitating payments in their policies, however this practice is not yet widespread. For example, {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, in [[Australia]], among the [[S&amp;P ASX 100]] only 24 companies control facilitating payments and only 15 are reported to prohibit them.&lt;ref name=walters&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/management-companies-enterprises/1188858-1.html "Just how is business done? A review of Australian business's approach to bribery and corruption"], by Julie Walters, ''Keeping Good Companies'',  July 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development==
[[OECD]] defines a payment to be a facilitating one if it is paid to government employees to speed up an administrative process where the outcome is already pre-determined.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
{{As of|2006}}, the [[Australia]]n law has discrepancies as to the definition of the facilitating payment.

The Criminal Code defines a facilitating payment to be a payment which is &lt;ref name=walters/&gt;
* of a nominal value (the term is not defined in the Code)
* paid to a foreign official for the sole or predominant purpose of expediting a minor routine action, and
* documented as soon as possible.

The  [[Income Tax Assessment Act]] as amended in 1999 permit companies claim facilitation payments as deductions (before 1999 bribes were also valid deductions), but its definition does not refer to the size of the payment.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

Many Australian states override the federal legislation and define facilitating payments as illegal.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===Russia===
In Russia this phrase (in English) means payment to a bureaucrat when he does off-job extra work for a private entity by helping deal with his ministry. It is generally unclear whether it has a part of corruption in it. It was generally considered legal, until economy minister [[Ulyukaev]] received 8 years jail for it. After this case, Russian bureaucrats are reported to heavily refrain from this practice.

===United Kingdom===
{{As of|2010}}, subsequent to the Bribery Act, the [[United Kingdom]] does not recognize the legality of facilitating payments and does not draw any distinction from bribes. However the OECD notes that the UK is unlikely to prosecute for minor facilitating payments in the areas where it is a common practice. The Ministry of Justice guidance, however, confirms that prosecutors will exercise discretion in determining whether to prosecute. In addition, informal guidance received from the SFO indicate that where it is considering action, it will be guided by the following six principles:
* Whether the company has a clear and issued policy.
* Whether the company has written guidance available to employees as to the procedures they must follow where a facilitation payment is requested or expected.
* Whether such procedures are really being followed (monitoring).
* Evidence that gifts are being recorded at the company.
* Proper action, collective or otherwise, to inform the appropriate authorities in countries when a breach of the policy occurs.
* The company is taking what practical steps it can to curtail such payments.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;

===United States===
Within the [[United States federal legislation]], a '''facilitating payment''' or '''"grease payment"''', as defined by the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) of 1977 and clarified in its 1988 amendments, is a payment to a foreign official, political party or party official for "routine governmental action", such as processing papers, issuing permits, and other actions of an official, in order to expedite performance of duties of non-discretionary nature, i.e., which they are already bound to perform. The payment is not intended to influence the outcome of the official's action, only its timing.&lt;ref name=deming&gt;Stuart H. Deming (2005)  The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act And the New International Norms",   American Bar Association, {{ISBN|1-59031-326-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITG208fCRvcC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aAgWUfUiD4&amp;sig=2zCEc0NNJwgL-GSgPosF0xCxJTU p.15]&lt;/ref&gt; Facilitation payments are one of the few exceptions from anti-[[bribery]] prohibitions of the law.

==Evolution of the notion==
Prior to the 1988 amendments, the exclusion of "grease payments" was via the definition of the "foreign official", which did not include persons without discretionary (decision-making) duties, e.g., ones with clerical functions. The major drawback of this approach is that often it is difficult to properly identify the scope of duties of a foreign official. The 1988 amendment eliminated this drawback by placing the emphasis on the purpose of the payment rather than on the duties of the recipient. At the same time the scope of the "routine governmental actions" in question was made sufficiently narrow and supplied with detailed examples.&lt;ref&gt;Don Zarin (1995) "Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act",  Practising Law Institute {{ISBN|0-87224-087-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bv8jACUiP74C&amp;pg=PT4&amp;vq=facilitating&amp;dq=%22facilitating+payment%22&amp;sig=WLtZd_725SOmPExCTH8MP-fRvMs#PPT114,M1  $5.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

His company, the Houston-based Farouk Systems, currently employs 600+ people in the US, and exports its line of hair and skin care products under the BioSilk, SunGlitz and Cationic Hydration Interlink (CHI) brands to over 106 countries worldwide.

On May 1, 2011, Shami made an appearance on ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 11)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]'', when the show's contestants were given a project in which they promoted Farouk Systems products. He appeared again in the 4th episode of [[The Apprentice (U.S. season 13)|All Star Celebrity Apprentice]].

==Controversy as Gubernatorial candidate==
On Nov 19, 2009 Shami announced he was [[Texas gubernatorial election, 2010|running for governor]] of Texas as a Democrat.&lt;ref&gt;http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/11/08-barack-hussein-obama-10-far.html&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaign, he stated that he is not a member of any one specific organized religion, but said that he has a deep sense of personal relationship with God and that he felt a 'religious tug' in deciding to run for the public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Farouk's Official Statement On His Personal Religious Beliefs 1/11/2010 |work=Farouk Shami campaign web site |url=http://www.faroukforgovernor.com/page/farouks-official-statement-on-his-personal-religious-beliefs |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115064033/http://www.faroukforgovernor.com/page/farouks-official-statement-on-his-personal-religious-beliefs |archivedate=January 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 50 facts about Farouk Shami | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/politics/state/stories/022110dnpol50thingsshami.1320e5707.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shami lost to former Mayor [[Bill White (Texas politician)|Bill White]] in Democratic Primary by over a 60% margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/2010/maps/&lt;/ref&gt;

Shami has had controversial moments on the campaign trail. Most notably, when asked if he believed it was possible the U.S. government had involvement in the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Shami stated that he was "not sure" if the U.S. government was behind the bombing or not. After being given a chance to clarify his statement, Shami again stated the jury was out and refused to rule out the possibility. In the same interview with a Dallas radio station, Shami stated that he mostly hired blacks and Hispanics because he does not believe that whites wanted to work on factory floors. He stated that white people would want positions as supervisors or would want to be paid more than their counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;KVUE-TV Austin.[http://www.kvue.com/news/Shami-Whites-dont-want-to-work-in-factories-84298902.html Shami: 'Whites don't want to work in factories' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216084840/http://www.kvue.com/news/Shami-Whites-dont-want-to-work-in-factories-84298902.html |date=2010-02-16 }}, [[Dallas Morning News]], February 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = People they admire him | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/03/texas_primary | work=The Economist | date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shami was a member of the board of the [[American Task Force on Palestine]], he resigned in 2010. [https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Detail.jsp?ssl=1298%20%20%20%200334 Tax records show] he currently owns the building at 1732 Wisconson Ave used by PLO as their mission in Washington, DC. The Trump administration asked the PLO to close their mission  on Sept 10, 2018. 

== Relationship with Donald Trump ==
Shami has described himself as "Trump’s friend of 12 years" and has a long business relationship with Donald Trump through The [[Miss USA]]/[[Miss Universe]] pageants and Celebrity Apprentice. Donald Trump also [[Donald Trump's hair|famously uses]] Farouk System's CHI Helmet Head product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewak|first1=Doree|title=Hairdressers reveal the secrets of Donald Trump’s hair|url=https://nypost.com/2016/01/03/hairdressers-reveal-the-secrets-of-donald-trumps-hair/|website=NY Post|publisher=NY POst|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2015, Farouk Systems withdrew advertising sponsorship of the Miss USA pageant due to Donald Trump's anti-Hispanic comments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pugh|first1=Clifford|title=In hair-raising move, Houston company tells Donald Trump: You're Fired!|url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/entertainment/06-30-15-in-hair-curling-move-houston-company-tells-donald-trump-youre-fired/|website=Culture Map Houston|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Farouk System products continued to be used by contestants at the event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10963">There is substantial confusion about the role of merchandisers, and much of this can be attributed to the loose manner in which the term is used by various industries. Merchandising in football refers to the range of goods sold to supporters by football clubs. Store managers at Zara will commonly refer to department layout reorganization as “re-merchandising.” In fashion retailing, the visual merchandising team has the responsibility of managing the aesthetics of store and window displays. It is a completely separate function from merchandising, and the two must not be confused.

'''Merchandising, within fashion retail, refers specifically to the stock planning, management, and control process'''. This position requires well-developed quantitative skills, and natural ability to discover trends, meaning relationships and interrelationships among standard sales and stock figures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fashion-Buying-Merchandising-mass-market-luxury-x/dp/1517632943/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496258095&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=miguel+hebrero|title=Fashion Buying and Merchandising: From mass-market to luxury retail|last=Hebrero|first=Miguel|date=2015-10-15|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781517632946|location=Printed in the USA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Atinea by Jean Bernier and Leon Bakst.jpg|thumb|Atinéa by [[Jean Bernier]] and [[Léon Bakst]]]]

'''Fashion merchandising''' involves the production of [[fashion design]]s and distribution of final products to the [[end consumer]]. Fashion merchandisers work with designers to ensure that designs will be affordable and desired by the [[target market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iadt.edu/student-life/iadt-buzz/april-2011/what-is-fashion-merchandising|title=What Exactly is Fashion Merchandising Anyway?|last=Rangel|first=Cynthia|date=April 28, 2011|website=IADT School of Design at Sanford-Brown College|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion merchandising involves apparel, accessories, beauty, and housewares.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/business-sales-marketing-fashion-merchising|title=Fashion Merchandising College Degree Programs|last=The College Board|first=|date=|website=bigfuture.collegeboard.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end goal of fashion merchandising in any of these departments is to earn a profit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|last=Steele|first=Valerie|last2=Stone|first2=Elaine|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2010|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=296–297|quote=|via=Berg Fashion Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion merchandisers' decisions can considerably impact the success of the manufacturer, designer, or retailer for which they work.

== Background ==
[[File:Marchand de vêtements de laine.jpg|thumb|left]]
During [[Ancient history|ancient]] times, individuals shopped in [[Market (place)|markets]] for goods. The ancients were attracted to rare fashions that brought variation and excitement into their lives. These markets have transformed into today's department, specialty, and discount retailers. For many years, business people in the [[Clothing industry|fashion industry]] were convinced that they could persuade consumers to desire their particular products. Fashion executives had no interest in the needs and wants of consumers. However, fashion personnel realized that they would have to adapt fashion items to the [[demand]]s of consumers.

== Rights of merchandising ==
In modern merchandising, distribution responsibilities are absent, and focus is placed on planning and analysis. A separate team is tasked with distribution. Large organizations separate merchandisers by type. There are retail merchandisers and product merchandisers. Retail merchandisers manage store allocation and must maximize sales. Product merchandisers manage the flow of materials to suppliers and then the flow of product to stores. Product merchandisers then pass control of product to the retail merchandisers.

Modern Structure

Many large organizations have concluded that distribution requires highly detailed work and that it is necessary to have a team specifically for that purpose. This is due to the fine details of allocation, which require focus on aspects such as colour and sizes for a specific store. This approach not only minimizes costs but also extends to areas like better control of the overall process. Organizations that do not conduct distribution this way risk losing control of their stock at both the highest and lowest level. This is a result of the lack of uniformity and oversight.

The distribution team specializes not only in managing distribution, but they are also focused on sales and profit. They employ detailed, accurate information about distribution points sourced from product planners. They possess the ability to manage dynamic stock demands. They partner with buyers and merchandisers for any necessary repeat buying. Though they are positioned to manage stock, they still operate within the limits of the buying plan, and merchandisers ensure they remain within this realm. Buyers provide guidelines for distribution such as the type of stores where product should be distributed; for example, a product may have only been acquired for the top 3 stores. The team also supports the goals of an organization through being instrumental in responding to trends.

The nature of modern analysis has allowed many merchandisers to plan as much as four seasons ahead, and they are expected to apply the data. This further increases the demands placed on their roles and emphasizes the need to task out minor details that do not require their input or much of their supervision.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fashion merchandisers follow the five rights of [[merchandising]], or 5Rs, to ensure that they properly meet the needs of consumers; thus, turning a profit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The five rights of merchandising include:
* the right [[merchandise]]
* at the right [[price]]
* at the right time
* in the right place
* in the right quantities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By researching and answering the five rights of merchandising, fashion merchandisers can gain an understanding of what products consumers want, when and where they wish to make purchases, and what prices will have the highest demand. Both fashion retailers and manufacturers utilize the 5Rs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Manufacturers ==
[[File:Fashion at Griffith College.jpg|thumb]]
Clothing manufacturers practice fashion merchandising differently than retailers. Manufacturer merchandisers [[Fashion forecasting|forecast]] customers' preferences for silhouettes, sizes, colors, quantities, and costs each season. When making decisions, manufacturer merchandisers must keep retailers and end consumers in mind. Following the forecasting stage, manufacturer merchandisers meet with designers to develop products that consumers will purchase most. By referring to the five rights of merchandising, manufacturer merchandisers determine the best fabric, notions, product methods, and promotions for products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These decisions all contribute to final retail costs, which must be affordable to end consumers.

== Retailers ==
[[File:Kleider Bauer Flagship-Store Wiener Neustadt.jpg|thumb|Kleider Bauer Flagship]]
In comparison to manufacturer merchandisers, retailer merchandisers also begin their process by forecasting industry and fashion trends with their target markets in mind. Sales are predicted in retail dollars and beginning of the month (BOM) stock. Similar to manufacturer merchandisers, retailer merchandisers must make all decisions regarding the final consumer. Decisions are made based on the past, present, and future of the economy, sales, industry and fashion trends, region and world events, and the fashion cycle. When selecting merchandise to offer, retailer merchandisers will consider their target markets' color, style, size, and cost preferences. Once accurate decisions are made, retailer merchandisers will order goods from vendors or produce [[private label]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following shipment, ordered seasonal apparel assortments are strategically arranged on sales floors, or [[Visual merchandising|visually merchandised]].

== Education ==
The field of merchandising is less competitive than buying. Individuals interested in building a career in fashion merchandising should earn an associate's or bachelor's degree in fashion merchandising or a related field, such as marketing. Relevant courses include, but are not limited to, fashion, accounting, marketing, advertising, management, and psychology. In addition to schooling, those aspiring to work as fashion merchandisers should gain retail work experience. It is highly recommended to read fashion trade magazines such as The Business of Fashion or Drapers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://learn.org/articles/What_Training_is_Required_for_a_Career_in_Fashion_Merchandising.html|title=What Training Is Required for a Career in Fashion Merchandising?|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fashion Business Education|title=4 Tips to Get Into Fashion Buying and Merchandising|date=2016-12-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHu2OxAVQCM&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Careers ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">Baron '''François du Four''' ([[Turnhout]], [[Belgium]], 1871 – 1945) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrialist. He married Germaine Herry in 1902, and together they had seven daughters and a son.

When his mother, Josephina Frederika Dessauer, died in 1904, he became the owner of the family business [[Brepols]], a paper - and playing card factory. The company at that moment had about 1000 employees. From 1919 up to 1932 François du Four was mayor of Turnhout. In 1929, King [[Albert I of Belgium]] knighted him and granted him the title of [[baron]]. The heraldic motto of the du Fours is ''Melius esse quam vider'', which means ''it is better to be than to seem'', and their own weapon-shield represents a lion.

In Turnhout there is a street named after him: the baron François du Four street, which starts on the central market place of Turnhout. In this street the old factory buildings of Brepols were located. In 1945, Francois du Four died at the age of 74.

François du Four liked racing-horses. His [[thoroughbred]]s won a lot of races and a lot of price money. After he died, regretfully, all his horses were sold. In 1904, he had bought a small farm in [[Retie]] with neighboring pasture. He was especially looking for a place where he could breed thoroughbreds. In 1905, he started with the construction of the park where now the castle of Retie stands. In 1906, he started the building of a castle and the stables for his horses.

'''Guerrilla marketing''' is an advertisement strategy to promote products or services on the streets or other public places with little money. This involves getting the attention of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeguerrillamarketing.com/what-is-guerrilla-marketing/ |title=What Is Guerrilla Marketing? |website=Creativeguerrillamarketing.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrilla marketing is done in public places such as shopping centers, parks or beaches to attract a big audience.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg |first=Lena G. |url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=48201%20 |title=Taryn Rose Launches Dresr: Street Marketing a Luxury Brand - Case - Harvard Business School |website=Hbs.edu |date=2014-11-06 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized by [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in the book ''Guerrilla Marketing,'' 1984. Traditional advertising media are channels such as print, radio, television and direct mail&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Belch|first=Michael A.|title=Integrated Marketing Communications|date=2008-06-05|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781405186407.wbieci038|work=The International Encyclopedia of Communication|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781405186407|access-date=2018-09-14|last2=Belch|first2=George E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as we are moving away from these channels the marketers and advertisers have to find new strategies to get their commercial messages to the consumer. Guerrilla marketing is an alternative strategy and is about taking the consumer by surprise to make a big impression about the brand (What is Guerrilla Marketing, 2015), this in turn creates [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] about the brand or product being marketed. It is a way of advertising that increases engagement with the product or service, and is designed to create a memorable experience for the consumer. By creating this memorable experience for the consumer, it also increases the likelihood that a consumer, or someone who interacted with the campaign will tell their friends about it and via word of mouth the product or service being advertised reaches a lot more people than initially anticipated, and means it has more of a mass audience.

This style of marketing is extremely effective for small businesses to advertise their product or service, especially if they are competing against bigger companies as it is inexpensive and focuses more on reach rather than frequency. For guerrilla campaigns to be successful companies don’t need to spend large amounts, they just need to have imagination, energy and time (Bourn, 2009).
Guerrilla marketing is also an effective way companies who do not provide a tangible service can advertise their products through the non traditional channels as long as they have an effective strategy.

As opposed to traditional media Guerrilla marketing cannot be measured by statistics, sales and hits but is measured by profit made. It is designed to cut through clutter of traditional advertising and have no mystery about what is being advertised. The message to consumers will be clear and concise, the business will not diversify the message to the consumer and focus will be maintained. This type of marketing also works on the unconscious mind, as purchases quite often are decided by the unconscious mind. To keep the product or service in the unconscious mind means repetition is needed, so if a buzz is created around a product and it is shared amongst friends it enables repetition. (Bourn, 2009)

Two types of marketing encompassed by guerrilla marketing are [[viral marketing]] and [[buzz marketing]].

Unlike typical public marketing campaigns that use billboards, guerrilla marketing involves the application of multiple techniques and practices in order to establish direct contact with the customers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cova &amp; Marcel Saucet, "The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014;Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of this interaction is to cause an emotional reaction in the clients and the final goal of marketing is to get people to remember brands in a different way than they are used to . The technique involves from flyer distribution in public spaces to creating an operation at major event or festival mostly without directly connecting to the event but using the opportunity. The challenge with any guerrilla marketing campaign is to find the correct place and time to do the operation without getting involved in legal issues.

According to Marcel Saucet, 2013, the different types of guerrilla marketing are [[Ambient awareness|ambient]], [[ambush marketing|ambush]], [[stealth marketing|stealth]], [[viral marketing|viral]] and [[street marketing|street]] marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Saucet, Street Marketing™, Diatéino, Paris, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambient awareness|Ambient communication]] is a complex form of corporate communication that uses elements of the environment, including nearly every available physical surface, to convey messages that elicit customer engagement.&lt;ref name="Rossella Gambetti"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambient Communication: How to Engage Consumers in Urban Touch-Points|author=Rossella Gambetti|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259729300_Ambient_Communication_How_to_Engage_Consumers_in_Urban_Touch-Points|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a compilation of intelligence, flexibility, and effective use of the atmosphere.

Ambient marketing, which can be referred to as presence marketing can be defined as:

"The placement of advertising in unusual and unexpected places (location) often with unconventional methods (execution) and being first or only ad execution to do so (temporal)"&lt;ref&gt;Luxton, S., &amp; Drummond, L. (2000). What is this thing called 'Ambient Advertising'. In Proceedings of ANZMAC (pp. 734-738).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambient marketing can be found anywhere and everywhere from hand dryers in public bathrooms and petrol pumps through to bus hand straps and golf-hole cups&lt;ref name="Solomon, M. 2008"&gt;Solomon, M., Marshall, G., Stuart, E. (2008). Marketing, Real People, Real Choices. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, United States of America: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt; and can often interact with consumers.

===Ambush marketing===
[[Ambush marketing]] is a form of associative marketing, used by an organization to capitalize upon the awareness, attention, goodwill, and other benefits, generated by having an association with an event or property, without that organization having an official or direct connection to that event or property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambushed!|author=Simon Chadwick And Nicholas Burton|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204731804574391102699362862|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is typically seen at major events where rivals of official sponsors use creative and sometimes covert tactics to build an association with the event and increase awareness for their brands. For example, Nike during the 2012 London Olympics, Nike created 'find your Greatness' spots where they featured athletes from several locations called London (but without showing the real London or referring to the Olympic games) which helped in building a strong association between London Olympics and Nike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nathan Sorrell, Nike's Fat Jogger, Vows to Get Thin|author=Rebecca Cullers|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/nathan-sorrell-nikes-fat-jogger-vows-get-thin-142543|publisher=AdWeek|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stealth marketing===
Stealth marketing is a deliberate act of entering, operating in, or exiting a market in a furtive, secretive or imperceptible manner, or an attempt to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Keeping up with The Joneses: Stealth, secrets, and duplicity in marketing relationships|author1=Ekin Pehlivana |author2=Pierre Berthonb |author3=Mine Üçok Hughesc |author4=Jean-Paul Berthond |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000768131500083X|publisher=Science Direct|accessdate=April 12, 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2015.06.002 |volume=58 |journal=Business Horizons |pages=591–598}}&lt;/ref&gt; People get involved with the product without them actually knowing that they are the part of advertisement campaign. This needs to be implemented with uttermost covertness because if the participants become aware of the campaign, it will have a negative effect on the brand resulting in ethical doubts about its use.

===Viral/buzz marketing===
[[Viral marketing]] describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message’s exposure and influence. Like viruses, such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to explode the message to thousands, to millions. Off the Internet, viral marketing has been referred to as "word-of-mouth", "creating a buzz", "leveraging the media", "network marketing", But on the Internet, for better or worse, it’s called "viral marketing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmarketingtoday.com/articles/viral-principles/ |title=Practical Ecommerce &amp;#124; Insights for Online Merchants |website=Webmarketingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[marketing buzz|buzz marketing]] uses high-profile media to encourage the public to discuss the brand or product.&lt;ref name="Solomon, M. 2008"/&gt; Buzz marketing works best when consumer’s responses to a product or service and subsequent endorsements are genuine, without the company paying them. Buzz generated from buzz marketing campaigns is referred to as "amplified WOM" (word-of-mouth), and "organic WOM" is when buzz occurs naturally by the consumer.&lt;ref name="Solomon, M. 2008"/&gt;

===Guerrilla projection advertising===
Guerrilla projection advertising is effectively a digital billboard that is projected at night onto the side of a building without permission of the governing bodies (i.e. council permits), or the permission from owner of the building.&lt;ref name="altterrain.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Corey Capetillo |url=http://www.altterrain.com/outdoor-advertising-video-building-projection-advertising-company/ |title=Guerilla Building Light Projection Advertising &amp;#124; ALT TERRAIN &amp;#124; Interactive Outdoor Digital Advertising Projection on Building Walls in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington D.C |publisher=Alt Terrain |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays are projected on buildings in high traffic locations (i.e. people on foot and in vehicles). Guerrilla projection advertising is an effective addition to campaigns of a considerable size, for example a product launch, the release of a new film, retail promotions etc.&lt;ref name="altterrain.com"/&gt; As with several guerrilla marketing techniques, guerrilla projection advertising may incur fines or penalties for advertising without the consent of the building owner. This comes at a risk to the company and/or brand. The advantages and disadvantages of this form of guerrilla marketing must be carefully considered before proceeding to avoid unwanted expenses.&lt;ref name="altterrain.com"/&gt;

===Grassroots marketing===
[[Grassroots|Grassroots campaigns]] aim to win customers over on an individual basis. A successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention, but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand and builds a lasting relationship with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, M. &amp; Hart, S. (2008). The Marketing Book. (6th ed.). Oxford, England: Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wild posting===
Wild posting is a form of advertising where posters are placed in multiple locations and mostly on the urban areas to attract maximum exposure. Wild posting is an inexpensive way of advertising that offers a huge exposure for marketers, especially in the film industry (concerts) to drive awareness. Wild posting is one of the effective ways to reach people and enhance your brand popularity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildposting.com/wild-posting-outdoor-advertising/|title=Wild Posting {{!}} 5555 Inglewood Blvd Suite 205 Culver City, CA 90230|author=|first=|date=2013-10-17|website=|publisher=Wild Posting|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild posting marketing can encompass different varieties including paper posters, tear-away posters, guerrilla cling posters (statically charged plastic posters which can stick to most smooth surfaces), magnets, stickers and vinyl labels.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; There may be legal issues around wild posting, however, if the display is not posted on a paid advertising space as it is illegal to advertise on private property without prior consent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Astroturfing===
Of all the guerrilla marketing strategies, [[Astroturfing]] is among the most controversial and has a high risk factor for the company marketing the product or service.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, J. 2012"&gt;Jacobs, J. (2012). Faking it – how to kill a business through astroturfing on social media. Professional Updates Management, 64(9), 567-570.&lt;/ref&gt; Astroturfing derives from artificial “turf”, often used in stadiums or tennis courts – also known as fake grass. Hence, fake endorsements, testimonials and recommendations are all products of Astroturfing in the public relations sector.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, J. 2012"/&gt; Astroturfing involves generating an artificial hype around a particular product or company through a review or discussion on online blogs or forums by an individual who is paid to convey a positive view. This can have a negative and detrimental effect on a company, should the consumer suspect that the review or opinion is not authentic, damaging the company’s reputation or even worse, resulting in litigation.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, J. 2012"/&gt;

===Street marketing===
[[Street marketing]] uses unconventional means of advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas with the main goal to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, events etc. Street marketing is not limited to areas as it also encompasses advertising outdoors such as on [[Shopping cart|shopping trolleys]], public toilets, sides of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins etc.&lt;ref&gt;Berman M. (c2007). Street-Smart Advertising: How to Win the Battle of the Buzz. Plymouth, United Kingdom: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Street marketing isn’t confined to fixed advertisements. It is common practice for organisations to use brand ambassadors who can distribute product samples and discount vouchers and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a bicycle kiosk which contains the product samples or demonstration materials, or they may be wearing a "walking billboard". The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketing-schools.org/types-of-marketing/street-marketing.html |title=Street Marketing &amp;#124; What is Street Marketing? |website=Marketing-schools.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marcel Saucet and Bernard Cova,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bernard Cova &amp; Marcel Saucet, "The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities:

====Distribution of flyers or products====
This activity is more traditional and the most common form of street marketing employed by brands.

====Product animations====
This form of operation consists of personalizing a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro-universe in order to promote a new product or service.

====Human animations====
The goal of such actions is to create a space in which the brand's message is communicated through human activity.

====Road shows====
This form of mobile presentation is based on the development of means of transport: Taxi, bike, Segway, etc.

====Uncovered actions====
These activities involve the customization of street elements.

====Event actions====
These activities take the form of spectacles, such as flash mobs or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service or brand value through organization of a public event.

====Presence marketing====
This is a guerrilla marketing type that goes along the same lines as ambient marketing. Products are to maintain a constant presence through product placements, street ads, stalls at local festivals and markets.

==Etymology and origin==
The term "guerrilla marketing" is traced to [[guerrilla warfare]], which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective.  In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|Leo Burnett]]'s creative director [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 25 Most Influential Business Management Books|author=Josh Sanburn|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2086680_2086683_2087674,00.html|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JLgrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OeYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3455,2835554&amp;dq=guerilla-marketing+levinson&amp;hl=en | publisher = Lawrence Journal-World | date = March 12, 1989 | accessdate = June 5, 2017 | title = 'Guerrilla marketing' gives small firms the edge | author = Linda S. Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greco|first1=Susan|title=30 Seconds with Guerrilla Marketing's Guru|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19950801/2371.html|website=inc.com|publisher=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|accessdate=26 June 2015|location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term itself was from the inspiration of guerrilla warfare which was unconventional warfare using different techniques from usual and small tactic strategies used by armed civilians. It involves high imagination and energy to execute a guerrilla marketing campaign. This kind of marketing is purely focusing on taking the consumer by surprise, creating a greater impression and eventually leading to buzz through word-of-mouth or social media platforms. Guerrilla marketing is perfect for any small or medium size businesses to bring their product or services to its consumers without investing more money on advertisements. This has also been used by large companies to show the difference from its competitors and to make use of social media campaigns. Lately, individuals use unconventional methods of job hunting or to work more.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Bernard Cova &amp; Marcel Saucet, "The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe", Journal of Marketing Communications, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the concept of street marketing was born. It has evolved from being only the application of activities on the streets, to be the development of innovative practices of promotion.&lt;ref name="Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984"&gt;Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one method used by many enterprises to promote their products or services on the streets is the distribution of fliers. This activity does not focus on creativity, but on making publicity on the streets. However, with the passage of time, companies have developed more unconventional techniques to catch the attention of the clients.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Street marketing==
{{main|Street marketing}}
Street marketing is a subset of guerrilla marketing. Like guerrilla marketing, street marketing has the characteristic of being unconventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Takin’ it to the Streets" – Dr. Marcel Saucet’s TOP 10 STREET MARKETING ™ TIPS|author=Pikke Allen|url=https://artifice-magazine.com/2015/09/22/takin-it-to-the-streets-dr-marcel-saucets-top-10-street-marketing-tm-tips/|publisher=ARTIFICE ATELIER|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is limited to the streets or public places. Other forms of guerrilla marketing use other media and processes, such as the Internet, to establish communication with the customers.

Guerrilla marketing is indeed being understood more and more as mobilizing not only the space of the streets but also the imagination of the street: that of street culture and street art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghini | first1 = Stefania | last2 = Visconti | first2 = Luca M. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Laurel | last4 = Sherry Jr | first4 = John F. | year = 2010 | title = Symbiotic postures of commercial advertising and street art: Implications for creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 115–28 | doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367390308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Y-generation]] broadly consisting of young urbanites (15 – 30 years old), is often put forth as the most susceptible target for the campaigns due to its associations with the culture of the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 =  | last2 = Neville | first2 =  | year = 2009 | title = Fly-Posting: An Exploration of a 'Controversial' Medium | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Communications | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 209–226 | doi=10.1080/13527260802091022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success on any guerrilla marketing campaign lies on the relationship between advertiser and the agency. Both parties will have feel the need and work on it with same goals. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine wait marketing with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using 'loading' pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages.

Street marketing, unlike traditional media like usual flyers or billboards, uses different techniques trying to get engaged with the target audience. This was born when companies wanted to take steps to make customers attracted to the brand rather than waiting for them to come. This was especially the case with small and medium businesses.&lt;ref name="Marcel Saucet. 2013"&gt;Marcel Saucet. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson, in 1984 mentioned that the guerrilla marketing can be executed in the street but street marketing itself was coined by Saucet in 2013. The different types of street marketing types, according to the model of Cova and Saucet are: Street/ Ambient; Ambush/ Parasitic; Stealth/ undercover; Viral / Buzz.&lt;ref&gt;Cova, B. &amp; Saucet, M, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty with street marketing campaign is to plan, organize and execute the operation. The agencies or advertisers will always have to identify a unique and creative idea, integrate the message required by the advertisers in the operation in such a way that most of the target audience understands it clearly and has the potential to get it viral. If the campaign’s intent is vague or abstract, the viewers will fail to notice the effect and the message.

==Typical procedure==
First, enterprises identify the public places where the campaign can be developed such as beaches, cultural events, close to schools, sporting events and recreation areas for children.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Saucet &amp; Bernard Cova, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Next, companies have to develop a plan to get close to different media and the target market.&lt;ref name="Rossella Gambetti"/&gt; In order to attract attention, street marketing events not only involve unusual activities, but use technology as part of the events. The purpose is to increase the value of the campaigns and get potential consumers' attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |ssrn=2411026 |title=The Secret Lives of Unconventional Campaigns: Street Marketing on the Fringe by Bernard Cova, Marcel Saucet :: SSRN |website=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, the plans that companies develop take into account that guerrilla or street marketing involves global communication and interaction not only with the customers or the media.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; They are also developed to identify opportunities and collect enough information about products, markets and competitors. For example, for business it is important that customers stay with them, instead of choosing the competitors’ offers. They implement innovative strategies with which they will not lose position in the market, and they consider supplementation with other advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television, when using street marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Conrad Levinson, 1984;Marcel Saucet &amp; Bernard Cova, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}

There are various examples of strategies that are used in guerrilla marketing. One of them is to provide offers to increase sales. In many cases, businesses do not only supply their products or services to be recognized, but they also offer other things for free. Another instance is to present a fundraiser offer. The point of this strategy is to help other organizations, such as schools, by offering them money. Most companies implement this method not only to increase their sales, but to improve their reputation and image among the community. Finally, there is a strategy called "team selling" that consists of conforming groups of people, the majority of them young, who go knocking the doors of different houses in a neighborhood. They do this in order to help companies promoting and selling their products or services.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

When doing guerrilla marketing or street marketing, organizations also consider focusing on the psychological approach. For many companies, this implies if they are having success or not. Street marketing focuses on some psychological aspects to know customers' behavior and preferences. For example, certain psychological areas study how people’s brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest combine the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides the way they are going to manage their street marketing campaigns. Besides, almost all the enterprises base their street marketing campaigns on repeating the messages they spread among their customers. Repetition is related to the unconscious part of the mind. This is the one in charge of making decisions. It lets people know what they are going to choose, as well as what they are going to buy. Businesses follow the principle that establishes that, the more people paying attention to the campaign, the more possibilities that campaign has for being remembered.

When a company decides to do a guerrilla marketing campaign which could be anything out of viral, ambient, ambush, street or stealth, the focus for them is to meet the objectives. The main objectives for them are:
*To create enough buzz to serve in word-of-mouth, helping the brand to establish well with its products. 
*To touch most of the five sensory identities of the customer/consumer enhancing personal experience with the brand and building good reputation.
*To reach the target successfully by taking the brand to them in their daily routine.
Through the experience and the ephemeral feelings shared between the company and the target, advertisers and agencies generate a feeling of intimacy that resonates beyond the encounter. This feeling of nearness becomes all the more lasting as the affected individuals relive this encounter on the internet through social media.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made," in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The guerrilla marketing promotion strategy was first identified by [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] in his book ''Guerrilla Marketing''(1984).The book describes hundreds of "guerrilla marketing weapons" in use at the time.  Guerrilla marketers need to be creative in devising unconventional methods of promotion to maintain the public's interest in a product or service.  Levinson writes that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, smaller organizations and [[entrepreneurs]] are actually at an advantage. Ultimately, however, guerrilla marketers must "deliver the goods."  In ''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook'', the authors write: "...in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer.  It must build trust and support the customer's needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits..."&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;''The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook''; Levinson, Jay Conrad; Godin, Seth; Mariner Books; November 1994; {{ISBN|0395700132}}; accessed March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online guerilla marketing==
The web is rife with examples of guerrilla marketing, to the extent that many of us don't notice its presence - until a particularly successful campaign arises. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine wait marketing with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using 'loading' pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages.

Many online marketing strategies also use social media such as [[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] to begin campaigns, share-able features and event host events. Other companies run competitions or discounts based on encouraging users to share or create content related to their product. Viral videos are an incredibly popular form of guerrilla marketing in which companies film entertaining or surprising videos that internet users are likely to share and enjoy, that subtly advertise their service or product. Some companies such as [[Google]] even create interactive elements like the themed Google logo games to spark interest and engagement. These dynamic guerrilla marketing tactics can become news globally and give businesses considerable publicity.

==Associated marketing trends==
[[File:Guerrilla marketing v Usti nad Labem.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Guerrilla marketing for McDonald's]]
The term, guerrilla marketing, is now often used more loosely as a descriptor for the use of non-traditional media, such as or [[street art]], graffiti (or "[[reverse graffiti]]"), flyer-posting, [[ambush marketing]], and [[forehead advertising]].  It may also be a strong component of promotions involving associated strategies, such as:
* [[Grassroots]] marketing and [[astroturfing]]—disguising company messaging as an authentic [[grassroots movement]];
* [[Street marketing|Street]] or [[Tissue-pack marketing|"tissue pack"]] marketing—hand-to-hand marketing;
* [[Wait marketing]]—presented when and where consumers are waiting (such as medical offices, urinals, or gas pumps).
* Internet marketing—having presence on sites, subliminally encouraging its users (thereby creating "buzz" through a combination of viral and undercover marketing);
* Viral marketing—through social networks.
* Publicity stunts - A publicity stunt is defined as a pre-planned event that is designed to attract the public’s eye and attention, to create hype about that topic, event or service.

===Undercover marketing=== &lt;!--Anchor for redirect; caution. --&gt;
''Undercover marketing'' (also known as "stealth marketing", or, by its detractors, "roach baiting") is where consumers do not realize they are being marketed to.  Buzz campaigns can reach consumers isolated from all other media, and unlike conventional media, consumers tend to trust it more often, as it is usually coming from a friend or acquaintance.  Overall, the person doing the marketing must look and sound like a [[peer group|peer]] of their target audience, without any signs of an ulterior motive for endorsing the item.

==Examples==
There are various organizations who have implemented the guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The majority of them are small companies, but there are also big companies that have involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Bernard Cova and Marcel Saucet, Unconventional Marketing: from Guerrilla to Consumer Made," in Routledge Companion on The Future of Marketing, Routledge, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, people providing samples, among others.
As stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide fliers. The goal is to create awareness on the customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in [[Montpelier, Vermont]], where the [[New England Culinary Institute]] (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 fliers. Those fliers had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston's Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers instead of placing its advertisements on the newspapers. The purpose of the fliers was to promote the company's self-defence classes for women.

Other businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, [[match.com]] organized a street marketing activity in the “Feria del Libro” (“Book Fair”) in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who was walking among the crowd looking for his “real love”. He had a glass slipper and even got to try the shoe on some people. A woman behind him was giving bookmarks to the people which contained messages such as “Times have changed; the way to find love, too” or “You have been reading love stories all your life; experience yours on Match.com”. Also, in Madrid and Barcelona, Nokia developed a campaign called “Avestruz” (“Ostrich”) to promote the 5500 and 5700 mobiles. In the campaign, a group of real-size ostrich puppets tried to interact with young people in order to let them know these mobiles provide a high-quality MP3 playback. The puppets were holding their own telephones and listening to the music. When a young person appeared, the puppet tried to catch his/her attention to show him/her the quality of the mobile. The reason why Nokia decided to use ostriches was that they are big animals, so people could easily look at them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

There are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to different events. For example, Sony invests on joining promoters and tells them that they have to infiltrate in public meetings. What they have to do is to distribute free tickets to concerts and other musical events sponsored by the company . Another instance is the Spanish company Clickair (an extension of Iberia airlines), that developed a campaign in which a group of five people had to walk through Barcelona streets dressed as Euros. The group was supplying approximately 3,000 tickets to promote different Clickair destinations. The people who first sent a text message with the required information would get free tickets to go on a trip. In the end, the company received a total of 3,390 messages.
Along with these examples, there are other street marketing techniques that are even more unusual. Lee Jeans, a French company dedicated to the selling of jeans, promoted the opening of their new store in rue des Rosiers in Paris. The method they applied consisted of distributing denims, as well as denim accessories, on the different streets of the neighborhood. Furthermore, in Italy, the members of the company Nintendo put into action a campaign in which they used post-it’s to promote the Wii console. They pasted several post-it with the shapes of some characters from different video games. Those images were placed as if they were billboards on the streets. “Wii not forget”, the name of the campaign, and a brief explanation of it, were the words written on the post-its.
In some cases, some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities; such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW’s ad agency (Street Factory Media in Minneapolis)attached a replication, made from Styrofoam, of a Mini-Cooper to the side of a downtown building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502075919/http://en.actu-cci.com/videos/293-street-marketing-by-marcel-saucet |archivedate=2014-05-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising on the Houston Chronicle.

[[Sony Ericsson]] used an undercover campaign in 2002 when they hired 60 actors in ten major cities and had them accost strangers and ask them: "Would you mind taking my picture?"  The actor then handed the target a brand new picture phone while talking about how cool the new device was. "And thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hidden (In Plain Sight) Persuaders''; Walker, Rob;  "[[The New York Times Magazine]];" December 5, 2004; pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerrilla marketing is not just exclusive to small companies. For big companies it is a high risk, high reward strategy. When successful it can capture even more market share, but if it fails it can damage the company’s brand image. One successful guerrilla marketing campaign is the Coca-Cola ‘Happiness Machine”. In January 2010, Coca-Cola, with the help of Definition 6, filmed a reaction video of a Coke vending machine dispensing ‘doses’ of happiness to unsuspecting students in St. John’s University. A seemingly normal vending machine surprised students by dispensing items that were more than they bargained for. The students received goodies ranging from extra coke, pizza, flowers, to even a twelve-foot hero sub. “Coke’s goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness” said Paul Iannacchino Jr., Creative Director, Definition 6. With a budget of only $60,000, the video generated 500,000 views in the first week. It now has over 7 million views to date. The campaign was so popular that a 30-second edit of the footage was featured during American Idol’s season finale. The Coca-Cola “Happiness Machine” also went on to receive the CLIO’s prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards dinner held in New York City. After the campaign’s success, Coca-Cola decided to continue with the ‘Happiness’ theme and has released similar videos since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://adage.com/article/special-report-small-agency-2010/small-agency-campaign-definition-6-s-happiness-machine/145066/|title = Small Agency of the Year, Campaign of the Year: Definition 6's 'Happiness Machine'|website = adage.com|access-date = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic risk==
Because of the nature of guerrilla marketing, the message and objective must be clearly defined in order to avoid being misunderstood.  Misinterpretation by the targeted audience of the message intended to be promoted is a risk.  Word-of-mouth advertising does not always stay focused enough to present the intended message.  The rumor-like spread of word-of-mouth marketing is uncontrollable once released, and can result in a misrepresentation of the message or confusion about a brand.

Another risk involves wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, which may actually be perceived to be against the interests of the consumer.  For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on [[2007 Boston bomb scare|January 31, 2007]], several magnetic circuit boards—each with an flashing [[LED]] cartoon figure—were attached to metal surfaces in and around [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to promote the animated series, ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''.  The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for [[explosive devices]].  Several subway stations; bridges; and a portion of [[Interstate 93]] were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2007-01-31/us/boston.bombscare_1_bomb-scares-charlestown-district-court-peter-berdovsky?_s=PM:US ''Boston Bomb Scare'']; article; [[CNN News]] online; retrieved March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some guerrilla marketing may incite the ire of local authorities.  Then risks are assessed and may still be considered worthwhile.  Such was the case in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], when [[BMW|BMW Auto]]'s ad agency, Street Factory Media, attached a replica of a [[Mini]]-Cooper (made of [[Styrofoam]]), to the side of a downtown building in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwblog.com/2013/01/10/houston-issues-ticket-to-a-mini-cooper-parked-on-a-wall/ |title=Houston Issues Ticket To A MINI Cooper Parked On A Wall |website=Bmwblog.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the small cost of a city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising in the [[Houston Chronicle]].

Another problem presents itself if marketers fail to properly execute an undercover campaign.  They run considerable risk of backlash.  An example of this can be found in [[Sony Entertainment]]'s on-line debacle with Zipatoni.  The company attempted to promote Zipatoni through a stealth marketing campaign, which was quickly detected by the internet community, resulting in Sony immediately experiencing a backlash from video game enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2006/12/11/new_sony_viral_marketing_ploy_angers_consumers.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=New Sony viral marketing ploy angers consumers | first=Aleks | last=Krotoski | date=2006-12-11 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Street art is thus a subversive activity, hijacking public places and inventing rather paradoxical forms of expression that reformulate ways of communicating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghini | first1 = Stefania | last2 = Visconti | first2 = Luca M. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Laurel | last4 = Sherry Jr | first4 = John F. | year = 2010 | title = Symbiotic postures of commercial advertising and street art: Implications for creativity | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 115–28 | doi=10.2753/joa0091-3367390308}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which inform street marketing practices. Thus marketing in the street, given that it is inspired by the work of such artists, brings with it constraints and statutory risks for which agencies and advertisers are generally not prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas West, John Ford, (2001), Advertising agency philosophies and employee risk taking, Journal of Advertising 30, no. 1: 77–91&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem is that, by definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This is just as true for simple operations like distributing flyers as it is for mobilizing products or people and, of course, for a disguised campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/31/dr-dre-beats-olympic-brand-police |title=Dr Dre beats Olympic brand police by sending headphones to Team GB &amp;#124; Media |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorizations necessary to carry out such a campaign are often very difficult to obtain within the time allotted for bringing the plan to fruition. Numerous potential operations have failed to obtain authorization for safety reasons, and in certain urban areas it is even expressly forbidden to undertake a guerrilla marketing campaign. In such cases, many agencies and advertisers will simply go ahead with the operation, meaning that they choose to act without authorization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; How is such a choice reached, and on what bases? How is it justified? What impact does this choice have on the performance and costs of the operation? What transformations does this choice bring to the agency–advertiser relationship? These are the main questions posed in the development of street marketing operations today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Inexpensive costs ==
In a declining economy, guerrilla marketing is an increasing solution to giving companies the comparative edge over others. During times where companies are downsizing and cutting costs, companies look to guerrilla marketing as a cheaper strategy than conventional marketing. Instead of investing money in the marketing process, guerrillas invest energy, time and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/206202|title = How to Pull Off a Guerrilla Marketing Campaign|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; If done successfully, companies will be able to reach conventional goals for profits and growth with a smaller marketing budget. One such example is the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''. A group of film students filmed an amateur horror movie. By setting up an internet campaign devoted to spreading rumors about the fictitious 'Blair Witch', it created a lot of interest for the film. With a budget of $50,000, the movie grossed $250 million worldwide.

According to Jay Levinson, guerrilla marketing emphasizes strongly on customer follow-up rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because the cost of selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, it is important to focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/65486|title = Guerrilla Marketing in a Tough Economy|last = Levinson|first = Jay Conrad|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honesty is an important attribute when marketing to customers during tough times. When companies show that they are fully aware of the economic situation and why they have priced their products accordingly, this earns the customer's respect. Explaining the current situation and the risks and the steps the company is taking to the customers will give the customers assurance and also maintains their trust. One example is the Las Vegas tourism board. During the 2008 recession, Las Vegas was one of the cities that were hit the hardest. They released an ad campaign showing people they were fully aware of the recession yet, in a dramatic way, showing 'that regular people are coming here and having a blast'. This piqued a lot of interest which in turn led to an increase in tourism to Las Vegas during the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=7586371&amp;page=1|title = Too Far?

'''Hector de Jesus Ruiz Cardenas''' (born December 25, 1945) is the chairman and CEO of [http://www.ansiinc.com Advanced Nanotechnology Solutions, Inc.] and former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] &amp; [[Chair (official)|executive chairman]] of semiconductor company [[Advanced Micro Devices|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.]] (AMD).&lt;ref name="statesman.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/ladder/entries/2010/07/22/a_slew_of_nonprofit_board_appo.html?cxntfid=blogs_up_the_ladder |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725030440/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/ladder/entries/2010/07/22/a_slew_of_nonprofit_board_appo.html?cxntfid=blogs_up_the_ladder |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruiz is the author of ''Slingshot: AMD’s Fight To Free An Industry From The Ruthless Grip Of Intel'', "a book that memorializes his bet-the-company decision in 2005 to file an antitrust case against its much larger rival."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/02/14/former-amd-chiefs-book-describes-fight-against-intel/?KEYWORDS=don+clark | title= Former AMD Chief’s Book Describes Fight Against Intel| access-date= 2017-04-28 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also "elaborates on his humble upbringing as well as advice and lessons learned from relatives and teachers."

==Education==
Ruiz was born in the border town of [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila]], [[Mexico]]. As a teenager, he walked across the [[Mexico – United States border]] every day to attend a high school in nearby [[Eagle Pass, Texas]], from which he graduated as [[valedictorian]] just three years after beginning to learn [[English language|English]].  Ruiz earned a B.S. and M.S. in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1968 and 1970 respectively and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Rice University]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=9182&amp;SnID=2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612172746/http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW |archive-date=2010-06-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ruiz—along with former First Lady [[Laura Bush]], Charles Matthews, Melinda Perrin, Julius Glickman and Admiral [[William H. McRaven]]—was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the [[University of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/highereducation/entries/2012/05/08/texas_exes_name_6_distinguishe.html?cxntfid=blogs_the_lowdown_on_higher_education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://alcalde.texasexes.org/2012/05/texas-exes-announce-2012-distinguished-alumni/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ruiz worked at [[Texas Instruments]] for six years and [[Motorola]] for 22 years, rising to become president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector before being recruited in 2000 by AMD founder [[Jerry Sanders (businessman)|Jerry Sanders]] to serve as AMD's president and chief operating officer, and to become [[heir apparent]] to lead the company upon Sanders' retirement. Ruiz succeeded Sanders in the CEO's seat in 2002, and was named [[chairman of the board]] in 2004.

Ruiz endorsed the decision to buy [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], which led to a period of financial reverses. Ruiz survived rumors of his ouster in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=9687|title=Report: AMD to Replace CEO Hector Ruiz with Dirk Meyer|publisher=DailyTech|first=Wolfgang|last=Hansson|date=November 17, 2007|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN1153631020071211|title=AMD CEO says no plans to step down in 2008|date=Dec 11, 2007|first=Duncan|last=Martell|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he resigned as CEO on July 18, 2008, after AMD reported its seventh consecutive quarterly loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/technology/18amd.html|title=Another Loss at A.M.D. Leads to Chief’s Ouster|first=John|last=Markoff|author2=Laurie J. Flynn|date=July 18, 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruiz took AMD "off death watch," according to a leading industry analyst.&lt;ref name="statesman1103"/&gt; As CEO, Ruiz led AMD to "important technical accomplishments and strides in its competition against Intel," but " he was never able to stanch the company's persistent financial losses." Analyst Rob Enderle gives Ruiz credit for the strategy to spin off the manufacturing operations, "relieving AMD of the cost of running chip plants and allowing more focus on chip design." Ruiz was behind the deal in which an Abu Dhabi government arm funded the new venture.&lt;ref name="statesman1103"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/search/content/business/stories/other/2009/11/03/1103ruiz.html|publisher=Austin American Statesman|title=Former AMD chief Ruiz resigns from manufacturing spinoff|first=Tim|last=Eaton|date=November 3, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New York Times, "From about 2003 to 2006, A.M.D. offered a line of chips that analysts and many computer makers hailed as superior to Intel’s products. Executives from A.M.D. contended that Intel blunted the adoption of these chips through its financial arrangements."&lt;ref name="nytimes0805"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/technology/05chip.html|title=Intel Settles With F.T.C. On Antitrust|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|author2=Ashless Vance|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=2011-06-03|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] settled a number of anti-competition complaints against Intel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/08/intel.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; Intel "accepted all the terms of the settlement without admitting that it had committed any anticompetitive acts."&lt;ref name="nytimes0805"/&gt;  In 2009, AMD "settled its own antitrust complaint against Intel in November with Intel agreeing to pay $1.25 billion."&lt;ref name="nytimes0805"/&gt;

In February 2012, the [[Albany Times Union]] looked back at the June 2006 announcement by Ruiz and then-current New York Governor George Pataki that AMD and then its spin-off GlobalFoundries "would be building the world's most advanced 'chip fab' on the planet." The news "vault[ed] the Capital Region into the global technology spotlight virtually overnight." Pataki said GlobalFoundries is likely to end up spending $7 billion and hiring 2,000 employees at the plant, with 9,000 additional jobs created as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesunion.com/business/article/Pataki-tours-impressive-Fab-8-2927169.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruiz was named Chairman of AMD spin-off [[GlobalFoundries]] in March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/41615-amd%E2%80%99s-fabs-now-on-their-own-globalfoundries |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221020940/http://www.tgdaily.com/business-and-law-features/41615-amd%E2%80%99s-fabs-now-on-their-own-globalfoundries |archive-date=2014-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned concurrent with reports that identified Ruiz as the previously unnamed AMD executive who allegedly discussed AMD's plans for the spin-off with an investment manager before it had been publicly disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itp.net/578337-ruiz-resigns-from-globalfoundries&lt;/ref&gt; Ruiz has not been charged with any criminal activity.&lt;ref name="statesman1103"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=January 11, 2011|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703779704576074290806361636|title=AMD Chief Meyer Is Forced Out|first=Don|last=Clark|author2=Shara Tibken|quote=No charges were filed against him}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "There were never any allegations made against me, no one from the government side or the Justice side have ever contacted me," Ruiz told [[MarketWatch]]. Ruiz added that he even volunteered to speak with investigators. “They never took me up on it." Ruiz also said, "I strongly believe that I never have done anything wrong or inappropriate.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-amd-chief-tells-a-bit-but-not-all-2013-02-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling globally in 2010 as an adviser to technology companies, Ruiz commented on the rise of Brazil's tech economy in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20101221083028/http://www.statesman.com/opinion/ruiz-brazils-emergence-is-by-design-783236.html?sms_ss=email%20 column] published in the Austin American-Statesman, saying "there seems to be a new sense of confidence among Brazilian business and political leaders [and] a growing realization that Brazil's time might, at last, be now."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/opinion/ruiz-brazils-emergence-is-by-design-783236.html?sms_ss=email{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 [http://edcoonline.org/ EDCO Ventures], an economic development organization, added Hector Ruiz  to its board of directors.&lt;ref name="statesman.com"/&gt;

[[Bloomberg News]] reported in June 2011 that Ruiz and another former AMD executive, Bharath Rangarajan, had formed a new consultancy called Bull Ventures. The company aims "to win business by touting his experience in leading strategy and transactions while at the chipmaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-28/amd-former-ceo-hector-ruiz-starts-company-touts-deal-experience.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Ian | last=King | title=AMD Former CEO Hector Ruiz Starts Company, Touts Deal Experience | date=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Ruiz re-entered the public debates surrounding semiconductors and the information technology industry with a column published by [[BusinessWeek]] entitled, [http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-20/amds-former-ceo-has-advice-for-intels-next-ceo "AMD's Former CEO Has Advice for Intel's Next CEO."]

In September 2015, the Mexican Consulate in Austin, Texas, announced that it would honor Dr. Hector Ruíz with its Ohtli Award.&lt;ref&gt;E-mail from Carlos González Gutiérrez, Consul General of Mexico in Austin, September 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Ruiz supports a legal path to U.S. citizenship for undocumented or unauthorized immigrants, and criticized [[FWD.us|Mark Zuckerberg's high-skilled immigration lobby efforts]] as elitist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruiz|first=Hector|title=Hector Ruiz: U.S. must not reserve citizenship for lucky elite of immigrants|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/sunday-commentary/20130503-hector-ruiz-u.s.-must-not-reserve-citizenship-for-lucky-elite-of-immigrants.ece|publisher=[[Dallas News]]|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}
'''Industrial wastewater treatment''' describes the processes used for [[Wastewater treatment|treating wastewater]] that is produced by industries as an undesirable by-product. After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) may be reused or released to a [[sanitary sewer]] or to a [[surface water]] in the environment. 

Most industries produce some [[wastewater]]. Recent trends have been to minimize such production or to recycle treated wastewater within the production process.

== Sources of industrial wastewater ==

===Battery manufacturing===
Battery manufacturers specialize in fabricating small devices for electronics and portable equipment (e.g., power tools), or larger, high-powered units for cars, trucks and other motorized vehicles. Pollutants generated at manufacturing plants includes cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, cyanide, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, oil &amp; grease, silver and zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/battery-manufacturing-effluent-guidelines |title=Battery Manufacturing Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-06-12 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organic chemicals manufacturing===
The specific pollutants discharged by organic chemical manufacturers vary widely from plant to plant, depending on the types of products manufactured, such as bulk organic chemicals, resins, pesticides, plastics, or synthetic fibers. Some of the organic compounds that may be discharged are [[benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[napthalene]], [[phenol]]s, [[toluene]] and [[vinyl chloride]]. [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD), which is a gross measurement of a range of organic pollutants, may be used to gauge the effectiveness of a biological wastewater treatment system, and is used as a regulatory parameter in some discharge permits. Metal pollutant discharges may include [[chromium]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[nickel]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name="EPA-OCPSF"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1987 |title=Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Organic Chemicals, Plastics And Synthetic Fibers Point Source Category; Volume I |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/organic-chemicals-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-87/009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric power plants===
[[Fossil-fuel power station]]s, particularly [[coal]]-fired plants, are a major source of industrial wastewater. Many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]] and [[chromium]], as well as [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[nitrogen]] compounds ([[nitrate]]s and [[nitrite]]s). Wastewater streams include [[flue-gas desulfurization]], [[fly ash]], [[bottom ash]] and [[flue gas]] mercury control. Plants with air pollution controls such as [[wet scrubber]]s typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream.&lt;ref name="EPA-steam-electric"&gt;{{cite web |date=2015-09-30 |title=Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2015-final-rule |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ash pond]]s, a type of surface impoundment, are a widely used treatment technology at coal-fired plants. These ponds use gravity to [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|settle out]] large particulates (measured as [[total suspended solids]]) from power plant wastewater. This technology does not treat dissolved pollutants. Power stations use additional technologies to control pollutants, depending on the particular wastestream in the plant. These include dry ash handling, closed-loop ash recycling, [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]], biological treatment (such as an [[activated sludge]] process), membrane systems, and evaporation-crystallization systems.&lt;ref name="EPA-steam-electric"/&gt; Technological advancements in [[ion exchange membranes]] and [[electrodialysis]] systems has enabled high efficiency treatment of [[flue-gas desulfurization]] wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowering Cost and Waste in Flue Gas Desulfurization Wastewater Treatment|url=http://www.powermag.com/lowering-cost-waste-flue-gas-desulfurization-wastewater-treatment/|website=Power Mag|publisher=Electric Power|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.

=== Food industry ===
Wastewater generated from agricultural and food operations has distinctive characteristics that set it apart from common municipal wastewater managed by public or private [[sewage treatment]] plants throughout the world: it is [[biodegradable]] and non-toxic, but has high concentrations of BOD and [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]] (SS).&lt;ref&gt;European Environment Agency. Copenhagen, Denmark. [http://themes.eea.europa.eu/Specific_media/water/indicators/bod/index_html "Indicator: Biochemical oxygen demand in rivers (2001)."]&lt;/ref&gt; The constituents of food and agriculture wastewater are often complex to predict, due to the differences in BOD and [[pH]] in effluents from vegetable, fruit, and meat products and due to the seasonal nature of food processing and post-harvesting.

Processing of food from raw materials requires large volumes of high grade water. Vegetable washing generates waters with high loads of [[Suspended solids|particulate matter]] and some dissolved [[organic matter]]. It may also contain surfactants.

Animal slaughter and processing produces very strong organic waste from body fluids, such as [[blood]], and [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] contents. This wastewater is frequently contaminated by significant levels of [[antibiotic]]s and growth [[hormone]]s from the animals and by a variety of pesticides used to control external [[parasite]]s.

Processing food for sale produces wastes generated from cooking which are often rich in plant [[organic material]] and may also contain [[salt]], [[flavouring]]s, [[color|colouring]] material and [[acid]]s or [[alkali]]. Very significant quantities of oil or fats may also be present.

Food processing activities such as plant cleaning, material conveying, bottling, and product washing create wastewater. Many food processing facilities require on-site treatment before operational wastewater can be land applied or discharged to a waterway or a sewer system. High suspended solids levels of organic particles increase BOD and can result in significant sewer surcharge fees. Sedimentation, wedgewire screening, or rotating belt filtration (microscreening) are commonly used methods to reduce suspended organic solids loading prior to discharge.

=== Iron and steel industry ===
The production of [[iron]] from its ores involves powerful [[Redox|reduction]] reactions in blast furnaces. Cooling waters are inevitably contaminated with products especially [[ammonia]] and [[cyanide]]. Production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from coal in coking plants also requires [[water cooling]] and the use of water in by-products separation. Contamination of waste streams includes gasification products such as [[benzene]], [[naphthalene]], [[anthracene]], cyanide, ammonia, [[phenol]]s, [[cresol]]s  together with a range of more complex [[organic compound]]s known collectively as [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH).&lt;ref name="EPA ironsteel"&gt;{{cite report |date=2002 |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category |chapter=7. Wastewater Characterization |url=http://www.epa.gov/eg/iron-and-steel-manufacturing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |pages=7-1ff |id=EPA 821-R-02-004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of iron or steel into sheet, wire or rods requires hot and cold mechanical transformation stages frequently employing water as a lubricant and coolant. Contaminants include [[hydraulic oil]]s, [[tallow]] and  particulate solids.
Final treatment of iron and steel products before onward sale into manufacturing includes ''pickling'' in strong mineral acid to remove rust and prepare the surface for [[tin]] or [[chromium]] plating or for other surface treatments such as [[galvanisation]] or [[paint]]ing.  The two acids commonly used are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]]. Wastewaters include acidic rinse waters together with waste acid. Although many plants operate acid recovery plants (particularly those using hydrochloric acid), where the mineral acid is boiled away from the iron salts, there remains a large volume of highly acid [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]] or [[ferrous chloride]] to be disposed of. Many steel industry wastewaters are contaminated by hydraulic oil, also known as ''soluble oil.''

=== Mines and quarries ===
[[Image:Wastewater effluent.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Mine wastewater effluent in Peru, with neutralized pH from tailing runoff.]]
The principal waste-waters associated with [[mining|mine]]s and [[quarry|quarries]] are slurries of rock particles in water. These arise from rainfall washing exposed surfaces and haul roads and also from rock washing and grading processes. Volumes of water can be very high, especially rainfall related arisings on large sites.&lt;ref name="EPA-mineral mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1979 |title=Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Mineral Mining and Processing Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/mineral-mining-and-processing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-76/059b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialized separation operations, such as [[coal]] [[washing]] to separate coal from native rock using [[Density Gradient|density gradients]], can produce wastewater contaminated by fine particulate [[haematite]] and [[surfactants]]. [[Oil]]s and hydraulic oils are also common contaminants.&lt;ref name="EPA-coal mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1982 |title=Development Document for the Coal Mining Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/coal-mining-effluent-guidelines-documents-related-1982-amendment |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-82/057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater from metal mines and ore recovery plants are inevitably contaminated by the minerals present in the native rock formations. Following crushing and extraction of the desirable materials, undesirable materials may enter the wastewater stream. For metal mines, this can include unwanted metals such as [[zinc]] and other materials such as [[arsenic]]. Extraction of high value metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]] may generate [[wikt:slime|slime]]s containing very fine particles in where physical removal of contaminants becomes particularly difficult.&lt;ref name="EPA-ore mining"&gt;{{cite report |date=November 1982 |title=Development Document for Final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Ore Mining and Dressing Point Source Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/ore-mining-and-dressing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 440/1-82/061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the geologic formations that harbour economically valuable metals such as [[copper]] and [[gold]] very often consist of sulphide-type ores.  The processing entails grinding the rock into fine particles and then extracting the desired metal(s), with the leftover rock being known as tailings.  These tailings contain a combination of not only undesirable leftover metals, but also sulphide components which eventually form sulphuric acid upon the exposure to air and water that inevitably occurs when the tailings are disposed of in large impoundments. The resulting [[acid mine drainage]], which is often rich in heavy metals (because acids dissolve metals), is one of the many [[Environmental impact of mining|environmental impacts of mining]].&lt;ref name="EPA-ore mining"/&gt;

=== Nuclear industry ===
The waste production from the nuclear and radio-chemicals industry is dealt with as ''[[Radioactive waste]].''

=== Petroleum refining and petrochemicals ===
Pollutants discharged at petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants include [[conventional pollutant]]s (BOD, oil and grease, [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]]), ammonia, chromium, phenols and sulfides.&lt;ref name="EPA refineries"&gt;{{cite report |date=June 1985 |title=Guide for the Application of Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Petroleum Refining Industry |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/petroleum-refining-effluent-guidelines-studies-and-guidance |publisher=EPA |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulp and paper industry ===
Effluent from the [[pulp and paper industry]] is generally high in [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]] and BOD. Plants that [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleach wood pulp]] for paper making may generate [[chloroform]], [[dioxins]] (including [[2,3,7,8-TCDD]]), [[furans]], phenols and [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD).&lt;ref name="EPA pulppaper"&gt;{{cite report |date=2000 |title=Permit Guidance Document: Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Manufacturing Point Source Category |url=http://www.epa.gov/eg/pulp-paper-and-paperboard-effluent-guidelines |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-B-00-003 |pages=4-1ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] or [[dissolved air flotation]]. Increased BOD or COD loadings, as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as [[activated sludge]] or [[Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion|upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors]]. For mills with high inorganic loadings like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like [[ultrafiltration]] or [[reverse osmosis]] or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.
{{Seealso|Environmental impact of paper}}

=== Textile Dyeing ===
[[Dyeing|Textile dyeing]] plants generate wastewater that contain synthetic and natural dyestuff, gum thickener (guar) and various wetting agents, pH buffers and dye retardants or accelerators. Following treatment with polymer-based flocculants and settling agents, typical monitoring parameters include BOD, COD, color (ADMI), sulfide, oil and grease, phenol, [[Total suspended solids|TSS]] and heavy metals (chromium, [[zinc]], lead, copper).

===Industrial oil contamination===
Industrial applications where oil enters the wastewater stream may include vehicle wash bays, workshops, fuel storage depots, transport hubs and power generation. Often the wastewater is discharged into local sewer or trade waste systems and must meet local environmental specifications.  Typical contaminants can include solvents, detergents, grit. lubricants and hydrocarbons.

===Water treatment===
Many industries have a need to treat water to obtain very high quality water for demanding purposes such pure chemical synthesis or boiler feed water. Many water treatment produce organic and mineral sludges from [[filtration]] and [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]]. [[Ion exchange]] using natural or synthetic resins removes [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[carbonate]] ions from water, typically replacing them with [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[hydroxyl]] and/or other ions. Regeneration of ion exchange columns with strong acids and alkalis produces a wastewater rich in hardness ions which are readily precipitated out, especially when in admixture with other wastewater constituents.

===Wood preserving===
[[Wood preservation|Wood preserving]] plants generate conventional and toxic pollutants, including arsenic, COD, copper, chromium, abnormally high or low pH, phenols, oil &amp; grease, and suspended solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timber Products Processing Effluent Guidelines |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/timber-products-processing-effluent-guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-13 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wool processing===
Insecticide residues in fleeces are a particular problem in treating waters generated in [[wool]] processing. Animal fats may be present in the wastewater, which if not contaminated, can be recovered for the production of tallow or further rendering.

== Treatment of industrial wastewater ==
The various types of contamination of wastewater require a variety of strategies to remove the contamination.&lt;ref name=Metcalf&gt;{{cite book|author=Tchobanoglous, G., Burton, F.L., and Stensel, H.D.|title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=2003|isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | id= [[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brine treatment===
Brine treatment involves removing dissolved salt ions from the waste stream. Although similarities to seawater or brackish water [[desalination]] exist, industrial brine treatment may contain unique combinations of dissolved ions, such as hardness ions or other metals, necessitating specific processes and equipment.

Brine treatment systems are typically optimized to either reduce the volume of the final discharge for more economic disposal (as disposal costs are often based on volume) or maximize the recovery of fresh water or salts.  Brine treatment systems may also be optimized to reduce electricity consumption, chemical usage, or physical footprint.

Brine treatment is commonly encountered when treating cooling tower blowdown, [[produced water]] from [[Steam-assisted gravity drainage|steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)]], produced water from [[natural gas]] extraction such as [[Coalbed methane|coal seam gas]], frac flowback water, [[Acid mine drainage|acid mine or acid rock drainage]], reverse osmosis reject, [[Chloralkali process|chlor-alkali]] wastewater, pulp and paper mill effluent, and waste streams from food and beverage processing.

Brine treatment technologies may include: membrane filtration processes, such as [[reverse osmosis]]; ion exchange processes such as [[electrodialysis]] or [[Ion-exchange resin|weak acid cation exchange]]; or evaporation processes, such as brine concentrators and [[Crystallization#Evaporative crystallizers|crystallizers]] employing [[mechanical vapour recompression]] and steam.

[[Reverse osmosis]] may not be viable for brine treatment, due to the potential for fouling caused by hardness salts or organic contaminants, or damage to the reverse osmosis membranes from [[hydrocarbons]].

Evaporation processes are the most widespread for brine treatment as they enable the highest degree of concentration, as high as solid salt. They also produce the highest purity effluent, even distillate-quality. Evaporation processes are also more tolerant of organics, hydrocarbons, or hardness salts. However, energy consumption is high and corrosion may be an issue as the prime mover is concentrated salt water. As a result, evaporation systems typically employ [[titanium]] or [[Stainless steel#Types of stainless steel|duplex stainless steel]] materials.

====Brine management====
Brine management examines the broader context of brine treatment and may include consideration of government policy and regulations, [[corporate sustainability]], environmental impact, recycling, handling and transport, containment, centralized compared to on-site treatment, avoidance and reduction, technologies, and economics. Brine management shares some issues with [[Leachate#Leachate management|leachate management]] and more general [[waste management]].

=== Solids removal ===
Most solids can be removed using simple sedimentation techniques with the solids recovered as [[slurry]] or sludge. Very fine solids and solids with densities close to the density of water pose special problems. In such case filtration or [[ultrafiltration]] may be required. Although, [[flocculation]] may be used, using [[alum]] salts or the addition of [[polyelectrolyte]]s. Wastewater from industrial food processing often requires on-site treatment before it can be discharged to prevent or reduce sewer surcharge fees. The type of industry and specific operational practices determine what types of wastewater is generated and what type of treatment is required. Reducing solids such as waste product, organic materials, and sand is often a goal of industrial wastewater treatment. Some common ways to reduce solids include primary sedimentation (clarification), Dissolved Air Flotation or (DAF), belt filtration (microscreening), and drum screening.

=== Oils and grease removal ===
The effective removal of oils and grease is dependent on the characteristics of the oil in terms of its suspension state and droplet size, which will in turn affect the choice of separator technology.
Oil in industrial waste water may be free light oil, heavy oil, which tends to sink, and emulsified oil, often referred to as soluble oil. Emulsified or soluble oils will typically required "cracking" to free the oil from its emulsion. In most cases this is achieved by lowering the pH of the water matrix.

Most separator technologies will have an optimum range of oil droplet sizes that can be effectively treated. 

Analysing the oily water to determine droplet size can be performed with a video particle analyser. 
Each separator technology will have its own performance curve outlining optimum performance based on oil droplet size. the most common separators are gravity tanks or pits, API oil-water separators or plate packs, chemical treatment via DAFs, centrifuges, media filters and hydrocyclones.

;API separators
{{Main|API oil-water separator }}
[[Image:API Separator.png|thumb|right|375px|A typical API oil-water separator used in many industries]]
Many oils can be recovered from open water surfaces by skimming devices. Considered a dependable and cheap way to remove oil, grease and other hydrocarbons from water, oil skimmers can sometimes achieve the desired level of water purity. At other times, skimming is also a cost-efficient method to remove most of the oil before using membrane filters and chemical processes. Skimmers will prevent filters from blinding prematurely and keep chemical costs down because there is less oil to process.

Because grease skimming involves higher viscosity hydrocarbons, skimmers must be equipped with heaters powerful enough to keep grease fluid for discharge. If floating grease forms into solid clumps or mats, a spray bar, aerator or mechanical apparatus can be used to facilitate removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hobson |first=Tom |date=May 2004 |title=The Scoop on Oil Skimmers |url=http://eponline.com/articles/2004/05/01/the-scoop-on-oil-skimmers.aspx |journal=Environmental Protection (formerly Water and Wastewater News) |publisher=1105 Media, Inc. |location=Dallas, TX |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, hydraulic oils and the majority of oils that have degraded to any extent will also have a soluble or emulsified component that will require further treatment to eliminate. Dissolving or emulsifying oil using surfactants or [[solvent]]s usually exacerbates the problem rather than solving it, producing wastewater that is more difficult to treat.

The wastewaters from large-scale industries such as [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[Petrochemical|petrochemical plants]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plant]]s commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids. Those industries use a device known as an [[API oil-water separator]] which is designed to separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater [[effluents]]. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according to standards published by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API).&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt;&lt;ref name=API421&gt;{{cite book|author=[[American Petroleum Institute|American Petroleum Institute (API)]]|title=Management of Water Discharges: Design and Operations of Oil-Water Separators|edition=1st|publisher=American Petroleum Institute|date=February 1990|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The API separator is a gravity separation device designed by using [[Stokes Law]] to define the rise velocity of oil droplets based on their [[density]] and size. The design is based on the [[specific gravity]] difference between the oil and the wastewater because that difference is much smaller than the specific gravity difference between the suspended solids and water. The suspended solids settles to the bottom of the separator as a sediment layer, the oil rises to top of the separator and the cleansed wastewater is the middle layer between the oil layer and the solids.&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt;

Typically, the oil layer is skimmed off and subsequently re-processed or disposed of, and the bottom sediment layer is removed by a chain and flight scraper (or similar device) and a sludge pump. The water layer is sent to further treatment for additional removal of any residual oil and then to some type of biological treatment unit for removal of undesirable dissolved chemical compounds.

[[Image:Parallel Plate Separator.png|thumb|right|375px|A typical parallel plate separator&lt;ref name=HP&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beychok, Milton R. |date=December 1971 |title=Wastewater treatment |journal=Hydrocarbon Processing |volume= |issue= |pages=109–112 |issn=0887-0284}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel plate separators are similar to API separators but they include tilted parallel plate assemblies (also known as parallel packs). The parallel plates provide more surface for suspended oil droplets to coalesce into larger globules. Such separators still depend upon the specific gravity between the suspended oil and the water. However, the parallel plates enhance the degree of oil-water separation. The result is that a parallel plate separator requires significantly less space than a conventional API separator to achieve the same degree of separation.&lt;ref name=HP/&gt;

;Hydrocyclone oil separators
[[Hydrocyclone|Hydrocyclone oil separators]] operate on the process where wastewater enters the cyclone chamber and is 
spun under extreme centrifugal forces more than 1000 times the force of gravity. This force causes the water 
and oil droplets to separate. The separated oil is discharged from one end of the cyclone where treated 
water is discharged through the opposite end for further treatment, filtration or discharge.

=== Removal of biodegradable organics ===
Biodegradable organic material of plant or animal origin is usually possible to treat using extended conventional [[sewage treatment]] processes such as [[activated sludge]] or [[trickling filter]].&lt;ref name=Metcalf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aqueous/&gt; Problems can arise if the wastewater is excessively diluted with washing water or is highly  concentrated such as undiluted blood or milk. The presence of cleaning agents, disinfectants, pesticides, or antibiotics can have detrimental impacts on treatment processes.

==== Activated sludge process ====
{{Main|Activated sludge}}
[[Image:Activated Sludge 1.svg|thumb|right|300 px|A generalized diagram of an activated sludge process.]]
Activated sludge is a [[biochemical]] process for treating sewage and industrial wastewater that uses air (or [[oxygen]]) and [[microorganism]]s to [[Biological oxidizer|biologically oxidize]] organic pollutants, producing a waste sludge (or [[Flocculation|floc]]) containing the oxidized material. In general, an activated sludge process includes:
* An aeration tank where air (or oxygen) is injected and thoroughly mixed into the wastewater.
* A settling tank (usually referred to as a [[clarifier]] or "settler") to allow the waste sludge to settle. Part of the waste sludge is recycled to the aeration tank and the remaining waste sludge is removed for further treatment and ultimate disposal.

==== Trickling filter process ====
{{Main|Trickling filter}}
[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|250px|Image 1: A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter]]
[[Image:Trickle Filter.svg|thumb|right|264px|A typical complete trickling filter system]]
A '''trickling filter''' consists of a bed of [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], [[gravel]], [[slag]], [[peat moss]], or plastic media over which wastewater flows  downward and contacts a layer (or film) of [[microbial]] slime covering the bed media. [[wikt:aerobic|Aerobic]] conditions are maintained  by forced air flowing through the bed or by natural convection of air. The process involves [[adsorption]] of organic compounds in the wastewater by the microbial slime layer, diffusion of air into the slime layer to provide the oxygen required for the biochemical [[oxidation]] of the organic compounds. The end products include [[carbon dioxide]] gas, water and other products of the oxidation. As the slime layer thickens, it becomes difficult for the air to penetrate the layer and an inner anaerobic layer is formed.

The fundamental components of a complete trickling filter system are:
* A bed of filter medium upon which a layer of microbial slime is promoted and developed.
* An enclosure or a container which houses the bed of filter medium.
* A system for distributing the flow of wastewater over the filter medium.
* A system for removing and disposing of any sludge from the treated effluent.

The treatment of sewage or other wastewater with trickling filters is among the oldest and most well characterized treatment technologies.

A trickling filter is also often called a ''trickle filter'', ''trickling biofilter'', ''[[biofilter]]'', ''biological filter'' or ''biological trickling filter''.

=== Removal of other organics ===
Synthetic organic materials including solvents, paints, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, products from [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] production and so forth can be very difficult to treat. Treatment methods are often specific to the material being treated. Methods include [[advanced oxidation process]]ing, [[distillation]], adsorption, [[Glass transition|vitrification]], [[incineration]], chemical immobilisation or landfill disposal. Some materials such as some detergents may be capable of biological degradation and in such cases, a modified form of wastewater treatment can be used.

=== Removal of acids and alkalis ===
Acids and alkalis can usually be [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralised]] under controlled conditions. Neutralisation frequently produces a [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] that will require treatment as a solid residue that may also be toxic. In some cases, gases may be evolved requiring treatment for the gas stream. Some other forms of treatment are usually required following neutralisation.

Waste streams rich in [[hard water|hardness]] ions as from de-ionisation processes can readily lose the hardness ions in a buildup of precipitated calcium and magnesium salts. This precipitation process can cause severe ''furring'' of pipes and can, in extreme cases, cause the blockage of disposal pipes.  A 1-metre diameter industrial marine discharge pipe serving a major chemicals complex was blocked by such salts in the 1970s. Treatment is by concentration of de-ionisation waste waters and disposal to landfill or by careful pH management of the released wastewater.

=== Removal of toxic materials ===
Toxic materials including many organic materials, metals (such as zinc, silver, [[cadmium]], [[thallium]], etc.) acids, alkalis, non-metallic elements (such as arsenic or [[selenium]]) are generally resistant to biological processes unless very dilute. Metals can often be precipitated out by changing the pH or by treatment with other chemicals. Many, however, are resistant to treatment or mitigation and may require concentration followed by landfilling or recycling. Dissolved organics can be ''incinerated'' within the wastewater by the advanced oxidation process.

====Smart capsules====
[[Molecular encapsulation]] is a technology that has the potential to provide a system for the recyclable removal of lead and other ions from polluted sources. Nano-, micro- and milli- capsules, with sizes in the ranges 10&amp;nbsp;nm-1μm,1μm-1mm and &gt;1mm, respectively, are particles that have an active reagent (core) surrounded by a carrier (shell).There are three types of capsule under investigation: [[alginate]]-based capsules, [[carbon nanotubes]], polymer swelling capsules. These capsules provide a possible means for the remediation of contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lead: Its Effects on Environment and Health|last2=Jastrząb|first2=Renata|publisher=de Gruyter|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=17|publication-date=2017|pages=61–78|chapter=Chapter 4.

An '''intellectual property broker''' mediates between the buyer and seller of intellectual property (IP) and may manage the many steps in the process of creating a deal with regard to the purchase, sale, license, or marketing of intellectual property assets. This may include: patents, trademarks, or inventions (prototypes).

Inventors are faced with several alternatives to making their invention a commercial success.  They can build their own start up company from scratch using their own resources.  In the United States, they can seek government grants; SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) and (TTR) Technology Transfer Research to fund the early stage development of their technology.  They can contract with third parties such as: [[venture capital]] or [[angel investors]] to finance a startup or they can sell or license their products to an existing and established company.  Often inventors are interested in expanding their own intellectual property assets through licensing and acquisitions.

Because there is not a well defined market around the buying and selling of patents or other IP assets, if an inventor or patent owner wants to monetize their asset, an intellectual property broker can help by serving to connect the inventor or patent owner with one or more interested buyers.  The broker should have a network of connections in various market segments which can be used to help market the patent being sold.  Potential buyers may include industry peers, competitors, entrepreneurs looking to commercialize the technology, but also defensive patent aggregators, and patent licensing companies.

A competent broker should be able to explain to the inventor or patent owner the spectrum of values that may be assessed to a patent depending on the situation or motivation of the buyer in the market.  In addition, in bringing buyers and sellers together, an intellectual property broker may provide any or all of the following services:

* initial due diligence
* technology assessment
* market analysis
* value analysis
* competitive analysis
* lead development
* introductions
* lead management
* contract negotiations
* relationship management

==Patent Brokers Market==
The estimated number of patent brokers varies greatly. For example, a 1999 World Intellectual Property Organization [[WIPO]] paper estimated 500 "patent brokers" in the United States in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/freepublications/en/intproperty/834/wipo_pub_834_ch9.pdf "Patent Brokers, Chapter 9"] by Hisamitsu Arai, [[WIPO]], December, 1999, in "Intellectual Property Policies for the Twenty-First Century: The Japanese Experience with Wealth Creation"&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2015 listing of patent brokerage companies includes only about 57 businesses worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardsonoliver.com/brokers/ "Patent Brokers/Patent Sellers"] website listing compiled by the ROL Group, October 15, 2015. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As none of these firms have a large number of employees, the 1999 estimates are either wrong as the number of businesses operating as patent brokers does not match the 1999 patent brokers estimates, or there has been a significant decline in the market for patent brokerage. Further research is required to estimate the number of patent brokers.

The estimated size of the brokered patent market was $165 million in 2016, down from $233 million in 2015. It was estimated that of all the brokered patent packages brought to market only 21% of them sell. Average asking price per patent asset was $197K in 2016. 137 people were estimated to be employed in the brokered patent market. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardsonoliver.com/news/2017/6/1/2016-secondary-market-report-available-for-download Richardson, Oliver, Costa, "Inside the 2016 brokered patent market", IAM Magazine, Issue #81, January/February 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2696">[[File:JJ Beijnes 1814-1888.jpg|thumb|Johannes Jacobus Beijnes 1814-1888]]
'''Johannes Jacobus''', or '''J.J. Beijnes''' ([[Haarlem]],1814 – [[Haarlem]],1888) was a Dutch businessman and entrepreneur who, along with his brother Antonie Johannes (A.J.) Beijnes, was creditted with growing the Haarlem factory [[Beijnes]] into an international manufacturer of train and tram wagons.

==Biography==
[[File:JJ Beijnes - wagenrijtuig -amsterdamsche omnibus maatschappij-1883.jpg|left|thumb|Omnibus built for the Amsterdam Omnibus Maatschappij in 1883]]
He was the son of J.J. Beijnes the elder who had a carriage shop behind the [[St. Bavochurch]] on the Riviervischmarkt in Haarlem. Both he and his brother went to work for his father, though young A.J. became an independent [[Metalsmith|smith]] in the [[Grote Houtstraat]] at number 179.&lt;ref name=Beijnes&gt;"Beijnes : een eeuw van arbeid : 1838 - 1 november - 1938"; by Henri Asselberghs with color plates by Herman Heijenbroek and drawings by Herman Moerkerk; Impressum Haarlem : Spaarnestad, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 both companies were merged, and in 1858 the company's name was changed to ''Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes'' when they moved premises to what is now Stationsplein, Haarlem in order to serve their largest customer, the [[Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij]] (HIJSM).&lt;ref name=Beijnes/&gt; To service the trains on the rails between Haarlem and [[Amsterdam]], the HIJSM took on the services of the Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes in Haarlem as sole supplier. The [[locomotive]] engines were imported, but all of the train cars were built by Beijnes. The company grew so fast, that in 1891, the HIJSM, aided by the social activist [[Daniel de Clercq]], began the Haarlem society called ''De Ambachtsschool'' to unify various city efforts to start a [[Vocational school (Haarlem)|vocational school in Haarlem]], in order to satisfy their need for workers in the booming train car business.&lt;ref name=deugd&gt;''Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995'', edited by Gineke van der Ree-Scholtens, 1995, {{ISBN|90-6550-504-0}}, p555&lt;/ref&gt;

The J.J. Beijnes carriage factory was in operation for 125 years from 1838–1963, and it built and serviced horse carriages (omnibusses), trams, and trains, based at Stationsplein, Haarlem, Netherlands. Today that land is used as a bus station across from the [[Haarlem railway station]], and all that remains is a sports hall and parking garage with the name Beijnes.

'''Lucas Fotsing Takou''' (born 1980), known as '''LucFosther Diop''', is a [[List of Cameroonian artists|Cameroonian artist]], filmmaker, actor and entrepreneur. As an artist, he is best known for his drawings, collages, performances and films exploring the ongoing repercussions of the western [[neocolonialism]] and [[imperialism]] within the contemporary context of [[globalisation]].

[[File:LucFosther Diop.jpg|thumb|LucFosther Diop]]

==Early life and career==
LucFosther Diop was born in 1980 in Douala. After spending his young age having a very difficult relationship specially with his father, at the age of 17, he moved from the family house in Douala to his uncle's place in [[Bafoussam]] ([[West Region (Cameroon)|the West Region of Cameroon]]) where he got his diploma of secondary studies in 2000. Then, went to study [[fine arts]] in [[Yaoundé]] where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the [[University of Yaoundé|Yaounde 1 University]] in 2003. After obtaining a grant from the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in 2009, he studied for two years at the [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

He is the first artist to benefit from a residency grant at [[ArtBakery]] (Bonendale, Douala, [[Cameroon]]) in 2003, at the [[MTN Group|MTN]] Cameroon Foundation (Douala) in 2007 and a digital arts research and production Unesco-Aschberg award for [[French Africa]] in 2013.

Diop exhibited his work during the 3rd OK Video International Festival, [[National Gallery of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]] (2007), World One Minute Video, [[Today Art Museum]] in Beijing (2008), 2nd Thessaloniki Biennial (2009), International Symposium on Electronic Arts ([[ISEA International|ISEA]]) 2010, [[PHotoEspaña]] (2011), the [[Havana biennial]] (2012) and the 18th International Contemporary Art Festival SESC_[[Videobrasil]], 2013.

==Work==
LucFosther Diop started making drawing on the free spaces of his books at the primary school like a hobby. His difficult familial atmosphere develops in him a strong solitary attitudes. He did not really got the feeling to play like other kids and was spending his time on trying to reproduce the images around. After he got the financial support of the Director of his secondary school in 1993, he bought colours, brushes and other tools for beginners. Then started making portraits, flowers and landscape in a very realistic ways. LucFosther represented his school and university many times in artistic competitions between 1995 and 2003. He really started getting in touch with film tools at the [[ArtBakery]] where he learned a lot about [[contemporary art]] and began to develop his process as an artist. Today, favouring a poetic point of view, LucFosther Diop is developing a research project on [[neocolonialism]] and [[imperialism]], and their social, political, cultural, historical, geographic, economic and urban influences and repercussions. This research is essentially based on digital and media experimentation through photography, collage, drawing, video, ephemeral interventions, video performances, recycled documents and files found on the web and diversion of their content's meaning. He is calling these works "virtual made" or &lt;nowiki&gt;''neo ready made''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and really enjoy the works by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Olga Kisseleva]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Mona Hatoum]], [[Pascal Kenfack]], [[Goddy Leye]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[Youssou Ndour]] and [[Richard Bona]]. LucFosther Diop is one of the artists presented in the documentary '’OF AMSTERDAM'’ directed by Catarina Neves Ricci in 2012.

'''Merge-in-transit (MIT)'''  is a distribution method in which several shipments from suppliers originating at different locations are consolidated into one final customer delivery.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Move it fast. Eliminate Steps. Transportation and Distribution|last = Dawe|first = R|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This removes the need for [[Warehouses|distribution warehouses]] in the [[Supply chain management|supply chain]], allowing customers to receive complete deliveries for their orders. Under a merge-in-transit system, merge points replace distribution warehouse. In today's global market, merge-in-transit is progressively being used in [[telecommunication]]s and electronic industries.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;O'Leary. D. E. 2000. ''Reengineering Assembly, Warehouse and Billing Processes, for Electronic Commerce Using "Merge-in-Transit"''.  [online] available at https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/doleary/intellcont/Merge%20in%20Transit%202000-1.pdf [Accessed 29 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; These industries are usually dynamic and flexible, in which products have been developed and changed rapidly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choosing a Third Party Logistics Provider. World Trade.|last = Celestino|first = M|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in-transit allows company to assemble and transport goods simultaneously. It aims to remove the needs for distribution warehouse in the [[Supply chain management|supply chain]], targets at cutting down the amount of inventory stored in firm warehouses into zero, and allows customers to receive complete deliveries of their orders.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Leal, T. 2014. ''Is Merge-In-Transit the Key to Supply Chain Efficiency?''. Transvoyant. [online] Available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.transvoyant.com/is-merge-in-transit-the-key-to-supply-chain-efficiency/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216204836/http://www.transvoyant.com/is-merge-in-transit-the-key-to-supply-chain-efficiency/ |archivedate=2015-12-16 |df= }} [Accessed 28 October 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transportation expenses can be lowered. From customer perspective, merge-in-transit provides value since it facilitates the delivery of a single and consolidated shipment rather than multiple smaller shipments. This also helps firms to reduce the overall inventory and process [[lean manufacturing]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Goldsby, T,J., Iyengar, D., Rao, S. 2014. ''The Definitive Guide to Transportation: Principles, Strategies, and Decisions for the Effective Flow of Goods and Services.'' New Jersey: Pearson Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies of merge-in-transit ==
There are basically two ways of approaching merge-in-transit, either merging and forwarding or synchronization. Merge-in-transit depends on several factors, including the availability of multiple vendors for a customer, regularity of shipments to the customers, order size and the availability of a strategically located merge point. When these elements have been identified, a MIT operation can be created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Merge-in-transit_diagram.jpeg|alt=This illustrate the process of merge-in-transit system|frame|'''The diagram of merge-in-transit system'''. The graph illustrates the models with and without MIT system by highlighting the main differentiation (Merge Centre).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Evaluation of Cooperative Planning in Supply Chains: An Empirical Approach of the European Automotive Industry|last = Diaz|first = Luis Martin|publisher = Springer|year = 2006|isbn = |location = Germany|pages = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;|427x427px]]

=== Merging and forwarding ===
A  [[logistics]] company receives the goods from multiple origins, and assembles them at a single point near a customer, which is called "merge point" or "merge centre".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shippers pick up separate shipments from several suppliers and deliver them to a location near their final destination (merge points), where a merge process is being undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Resources Planning and Beyond: Integrating Your Entire Organization|last = Langenwatler|first = Gary A|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = Florida|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, no colossoal inventory is stored at these merge points. This kind of [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in time sequence delivery]] shorten the time required to consolidate, which allows an efficient delivery to customers. For example, a company bought electronic devices from three sources in Southwest Michigan. Instead of paying for three separate lorries from Southwest Michigan to Phoenix, the three shipments can be combined in Southwest Michigan, followed by a single lorry to Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Definitive Guide to Inventory Management: Principles and Strategies for the Efficient Flow of Inventory across the Supply Chain|last = Waller|first = Mathew A|publisher = Pearson of Education|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New Jersey|pages = 162|last2 = Esper|first2 = Terry L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synchronization ===
Merge-in-transit can also be regarded as a synchronization of production, in which logistics and transportation operation prevents stocking of final products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Maritime Transport: Perspectives|last = Leggate, H., McConville, J., Morvillo, A.|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2004|isbn = |location = Oxon|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various shipments of goods will be delivered from multiple vendors, which they are all delivered to the customers at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Synchronization is different from merging and forwarding, which the former neglects consolidation process.

== Advantages of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in transit has various advantages comparing to the traditional method, which includes the following:

'''Increase in flexibility'''

Merge points can often be start-up expeditiously and cheaply, depending on the type of merge-in-transit system.&lt;ref&gt;Rhenus.com. (n.d.). ''Merge in transit.'' [online] available at http://www.nl.rhenus.com/services/transport-logistics/supply-chain-services/merge-in-transit.html{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [Accessed: 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  MIT system simplifies the receiving and deposit processes by eliminating various shipments and receipts, making it accessible for manufacturer and supplier to work together.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Elimination of redundant transportation'''

The transportation time can be diminished as there are no double shipments of goods from the suppliers to the principal and the principal to the customer. Goods can be sent to the customer directly and instantly from the vendor to the customer, without the principal looking at the product.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaw. M.J. (2006). ''E-Business Management: Integration of Web Technologies with Business Models.'' New York: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reduction of inventory'''

The most direct benefit is the reduced inventory that used to sustain the system. Many organizations target cut their inventories to zero by the replacement of merge points, whereby they no longer require warehouses to store inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Bfgloballogistics.com. (n.d.). ''Merge IN TRANSIT.'' [online] Available at

http://www.bfglogistics.com/en/our-services/supply-chain-services/merge-in-transit [Accessed 31 October 2015].
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Micron Technology|Micron technology]] does not store monitors or printers in their own warehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Curtail transportation and administration costs'''

Products are handled less frequently in merge-in-transit system due to the reduction of transportation and Inventory. Receiving and storing are not required as the products do not actually go into inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Donath, B., Mazel, J., Dubin, C., Patterson, P. (2002). ''The IOMA Handbook of Logistics and Inventory Management.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, goods are delivered directly to the customer rather than the principal then to the customer. Even the locations of merge points are placed near the customer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Consequently, the transportation and inventory costs could be exceedingly low.

'''Heighten supply chain visibility'''

Manufactures can take advantages of [[point of sale]] data, forwarding the information decoupling points further back upstream and allowing deferment both in time and form.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Gattolin, E. (2008). ''MERGE IN TRANSIT, A DISTRIBUTION METHOD IN THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT.'' [online] available at. http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:3794/fulltext01.pdf [Accessed 31 October 2015]. 
				&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the orders and material flows are separated. These may further reduce uncertainty and cost of forecasting.

'''Improved customer services'''

Merge-in-transit enables delivery to take place more rapidly, which aids the firms to generate the ability of improving customer service.&lt;ref&gt;Ala-Risku, T. (2002). ''Evaluating the costs and benefits of merge-in-transit for distributors''. [online] Available at. http://dialog.hut.fi/publications/Diplomityo_Ala-Risku.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030621113631/http://dialog.hut.fi/publications/Diplomityo_Ala-Risku.pdf |date=2003-06-21 }} [Accessed 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Customers have the opportunity to choose among a wider variety of products and a larger pool of suppliers due to the withdrawal of inventory and the increased flexibility. The distributor may also provide better customer service by broadening its product assortment.&lt;ref&gt;Karkkainen, M., Ala-Risku, T., Holmstrom, J. (2003). ''Increasing customer value and decreasing distribution costs with merge-in-transit''. [online] Available at. http://legacy-tuta.hut.fi/logistics/publications/merge_in_transit.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [Accessed 31 October 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lower capital requirements'''

Merge-in-transit demands lesser capital investment as it does not need to store inventory in a warehouse. With regard of this, firms might spend fewer resources to deliver goods to the customer,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; which benefits small and medium firms with limited capital.

== Disadvantages of merge-in-transit ==
Merge-in transit has several disadvantages over the traditional way, which includes the followings.

'''Advanced information systems requirement'''

The merge-in-transit system necessitates with a considerable alteration and investment in [[information technology]] and [[innovation]] processes. These system and development do not come without corresponding investments, containing an escalation of costs that might be arduous to recover from firm's revenue.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Rise in overall cost'''

Merge-in-transit system involves multiple loadings and unloading of consignments. This has the potential risk of increasing the overall cost if it is not optimized correctly, which the more times consignments is transiting, the higher the cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Poor on-time delivery'''

Given that the time allowance is only a few days, in which each time period is commensurate with one day. Under merge-in-transit system, the firms will not schedule early or late arrivals to customers. They may easily impede and amend the delivery time. Hence, they have to provide compensations to the customers.&lt;ref&gt;Croxton, K, L., Gendron, B., Magnanti, T, L. (2000). ''MODELS AND METHODS FOR MERGE-IN-TRANSIT OPERATINONS''. [online] Available at. http://fisher.osu.edu/~croxton.4/CRT_0030.pdf [Accessed 1 November 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escalate in complexity'''

As the requirements for coordination of orders and material flows are becoming more intensified, the complexity of distribution will be increased.&lt;ref&gt;Norelius, H. (2002). ''Merge in Transit – A non-stock distribution structure.'' Linköpings Studies in Science and Technology, Thesis No. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, firms might often create distribution problems such as sending the wrong items and out of stocks of certain products. In addition, increasing customer orders will lead to a double of time for accessible products since there are not enough stocks available, leading to the situation that the supply does not meet with the demand in the customer order cycle.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Lack of inventory'''

Under the merge-in-transit system, there is little or zero inventory stored in a company, which aids to cut costs. However, inventory sometimes can be regarded as an advantage. For example, if a [[strike action|strike]] occurs within the company, without the stored inventory, the company will bear risks of paying compensation or closing down by the failure in delivering customer orders on time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this regard, reduction of inventory is detrimental to firms.

'''Vicious circle of delay distribution'''

Merge-in-transit system involves consolidated deliveries. The system relies heavily on the assumptions that the vendors will fulfill the order-filling operation at the identical level of efficiency and cooperation between vendors, which might involve risks. For example, a postponement in receiving a shipment form a vendor at the merge point would undoubtedly delay the shipment to the end of customer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Losing brand recognition'''

There is a potential problem that dealer other than the organization of the brand will gain brand recognition under merge-in-transit system.  Unless the products has been consolidated properly in outlook with other elements, there might be a risk that dealer might gain control of the customer for further sales. This is one of the main reasons that merge-in-transit component products gather commodities, rather than [[Product differentiation|differentiated]] or customized products from the dealers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''''Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers''''',  is a 1988 [[book]] by [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Robert Jackall]] that investigates the world of corporate managers in the United States. 

In the introduction, Jackall writes that he "went into these organizations to study how [[bureaucracy]]—the prevailing organizational form of our society—shapes moral consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackall|first=Robert|title=Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers|year=1988|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVupDVBhfUsC&amp;pg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the book is "an interpretive sociological account of how managers think the world works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackall|first=Robert|title=Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers|year=1988|pages=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVupDVBhfUsC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was named the "Most Outstanding Business and Management Book" of 1988 by the [[Association of American Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;LibraryThing, [http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/AAP+Most+Outstanding+Business+and+Management+Book Book awards: AAP Most Outstanding Business and Management Book]. Accessed 2013-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

''Moral Mazes'' is based on several years of fieldwork during which the author conducted interviews with managers in several large corporations in the early 1980s. 

From these interviews, the book describes the [[social constructivism|social construction of reality]] within large corporations in the United States. The book argues that bureaucracy in large American corporations:  &lt;blockquote&gt;"regularizes people's experiences of time and indeed routinizes their lives by engaging them on a daily basis in rational, socially approved, purposive action; it brings them into daily proximity with and subordination to authority, creating in the process upward-looking stances that have decisive social and psychological consequences; it places a premium on a functionally rational, pragmatic habit of mind that seeks specific goals; and it creates subtle measures of prestige and an elaborate status hierarchy that, in addition to fostering an intense competition for status, also makes the rules, procedures, social contexts, and protocol of an organization paramount psychological and behavioral guides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackall|first=Robert|title=Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers|year=1988|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVupDVBhfUsC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most important finding is that successful managers are dexterous symbol manipulators. Successful managers provide a public face and may be categorized as providing [[emotional labor]] as one of their major activities. They must be able to work well with others and to sublimate their emotional and psychological needs to the demands of others. The very ambiguity of their work and its assessment leads to the feeling on the part of the managers that "instead of ability, talent, and dedicated service to an organization, politics, adroit talk, luck, connections, and self-promotion are the real sorters of people into sheep and goats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVupDVBhfUsC&amp;pg=PA3|title=Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers|last=Jackall|first=Robert|year=1988|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The book begins with historical context. It shows how the [[organizational structure]] of American business changed in the 19th century. The author explain the creation of large [[corporation]]s in the context of how the [[Industrial Revolution]] changed American industry. These changes demanded a professional management class. This new class then changed the [[organizational culture]] of American business, emphasizing decisions centered on money based measures such as profit and loss (see also [[rational choice theory]]).

The book then describes the results of the author's interviews. The author's research included interviews of managers at various levels of the organizations. These unnamed organizations are large and medium sized companies. The qualitative data collected by the interviews cover approximately four years, beginning in 1980, documenting changes in management within the corporations, business decisions, and the effect of those changes and decisions on the managers.

==Popularity among Hacktivists==

''Moral Mazes'' was one of the "very favorite books" of [[hacktivist]] [[Aaron Swartz]],&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Swartz, [http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/bizethics Business "Ethics"]. Accessed 2015-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; making it an influential book within that community. [[Peter Ludlow]], a writer on hacktivist culture, used the world of ''Moral Mazes'' to explain the actions of [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/the-banality-of-systemic-evil/ The Banality of Systemic Evil].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5676">'''Multivariate landing page optimization''' (MVLPO) is a specific form of [[landing page optimization]] where multiple variations of visual elements (e.g., graphics, text) on a webpage are evaluated. For example, a given page may have ''k'' choices for the title, ''m'' choices for the featured image or graphic, and ''n'' choices for the company logo. This example yields ''k×m×n'' landing page configurations.

The first application of an experimental design for MVLPO was performed by Moskowitz Jacobs Inc. in 1998 as a simulation/demonstration project for [[LEGO]]. MVLPO did not become a mainstream approach until 2003 or 2004.

Multivariate landing page optimization can be executed in a live (production) environment, or through simulations and [[market research]] surveys.

== Overview ==
Multivariate landing page optimization is based on [[experimental design]] (e.g., [[discrete choice]], [[conjoint analysis]], [[Taguchi methods]], [[IDDEA]], etc.), which tests a structured combination of webpage elements. Some vendors (e.g., Memetrics.com) use a "full factorial" approach, which tests all possible combinations of elements. This approach requires a smaller sample size—typically, many thousands—than traditional fractional Taguchi designs to achieve [[statistical significance]]. This quality is one reason that [[choice modeling]] won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 2000. Fractional designs typically used in simulation environments require the testing of small subsets of possible combinations, and have a higher [[margin of error]]. Some critics of the approach question the possible interactions between the elements of the webpages, and the inability of most fractional designs to address this issue.

To resolve the limitations of fractional designs, an advanced simulation method based on the [[Rule Developing Experimentation]] (RDE) paradigm was introduced.&lt;ref name="isbn0-13-613668-0"&gt;{{cite book

The system keeps track of the visitors and their behavior—including their [[conversion rate]], time spent on the page, etc. Once sufficient data has accumulated, the system estimates the impact of individual components on the target measurement (e.g., conversion rate).

Live environment execution has the following advantages:
* Capable of testing the effect of variations as a real-life experience
* Generally transparent to visitors
* Relatively simple and inexpensive to execute

Live environment execution has the following disadvantages:
* High cost
* Increased complexity involved in modifying a production-level website
* Long period of time required to achieve statistically reliable data. This situation is due to variations in the amount of traffic that generates the data necessary for a decision.
* Likely inappropriate for low-traffic, high-importance websites when the site administrators do not want to lose any potential customers

== Simulation (survey) execution ==
In simulation (survey) MVLPO execution, the foundation consists of advanced [[market research]] techniques. In the research phase, the respondents are directed to a survey that presents them with a set of experimentally designed combinations of a landing page. The respondents rate each version based on some factor (e.g., purchase intent). At the end of the research phase, [[regression analysis]] models are created either for individual pages or for the entire panel of pages. The outcome relates the presence or absence of page elements on the different landing page executions to the respondents’ ratings. These results can be used to synthesize new landing pages as combinations of the top-scoring elements optimized for subgroups or [[market segments]], with or without interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Gofman, Howard Moskowitz, and Tonis Mets. 2009. Integrating Science into Web Design: Consumer Driven Website Optimization. The Journal of Consumer Marketing, 26(4): 286-298. {{doi|10.1108/07363760910965882}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulation execution has the following advantages:
* Faster and easier to prepare and execute in many cases, as compared to live environment execution
* Applicable to low-traffic websites
* Capable of producing more robust and rich data because of increased control over the page design

Simulation execution has the following disadvantages:
* Possible bias because of a simulated environment rather than a live environment.
* Necessity to recruit and optionally incentivize the respondents

'''Nitro''' is a free collaborative [[task management]] application. It can be used as stand-alone or cloud-based environment. It is developed in CoffeScript&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/CaffeinatedCode/nitro&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore can be run on any platform that supports [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;http://coffeescript.org&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the frontend is similar to [[Wunderlist]] that was [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|acquired]] by [[Microsoft]] in June 2015. In contrast to Wunderlist its source code is available under the [[Open-source_software|open source]] [[BSD_licenses|BSD license]].

'''Oleksandr Pavlovych Popov''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Павлович Попов}}) (born 22 November 1960, in [[Kryvyi Rih]], [[Ukraine]]), is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician. In 2010 to 2013, he was a head of the [[Kiev City State Administration]].

Traditionally, the elected [[mayor of Kiev]] also automatically became chair of [[Kiev City Council]] and head of the city's state administration (i.e. [[head of government]]).  However, following dispute between the mayor and the president in 2010, President [[Viktor Yanukovych]] asked the parliament to give him the power to appoint the head of the state administration.  Parliament acquiesced, and mayor [[Leonid Chernovetskyi]] was dismissed from the state administration and replaced with presidential appointee Popov.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/2222090.html President Replaces Kyiv Mayor As City Administration Head]&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chernovetskyi remained the mayor, effective power then started to rests with the appointee Popov, not mayor Chernovetskyi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/2153450.html Ukrainian Capital Does Away With District Councils]&lt;/ref&gt; Kiev then did not have an elected mayor until mayor [[Vitali Klitschko]] was sworn in on 5 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/208052.html Vitali Klitschko sworn in as Kiev mayor], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 June 2014)&lt;br&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://kp.ua/kiev/457226-halyna-hereha-slozhyla-polnomochyia Halyna Hereha resign], [[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]] (13 June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Chernovetskyi tendered his resignation on 1 June 2012.&lt;ref name=KyivMayrnb&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/hereha-sends-petition-to-parliament-on-holding-of--310160.html Hereha sends petition to parliament on holding of early mayoral election in Kyiv], [[Kyiv Post]] (19 July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The City Council decided the same day that [[Halyna Hereha]] would temporarily act as the mayor of the capital city.&lt;ref name=KyivMayrnb/&gt;|group=nb}}

'''Oxford Entrepreneurs''' is an [[Oxford]]-based British student society which was founded in 2002 to encourage entrepreneurship among students at [[University of Oxford]] and established the Oxford Entrepreneurs Incubation Centre in 2009 for Oxford student startups in space provided by the institution. Its successes include [[PlinkArt]] – a mobile app that recognises well-known artworks – which was also [[Google]]'s first UK acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/apr/12/google-buys-uk-startup-plink | title=Google buys UK startup Plink | publisher = guardian.co.uk |accessdate=12 April 2010 | location=London | first=Jemima | last=Kiss | date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/05/student-entrepreneurs-uk-lack-business-angel |title=Student entrepreneurs frustrated by lack of funding |publisher=guardian.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |location=London }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

Oxford Entrepreneurs offers a range of student-targeted services. It arranges for successful, inspiring entrepreneurs to come to Oxford to offer advice and inspiration to budding entrepreneurs. OE also offers networking events and practical workshops in skills pertinent to entrepreneurship. In September 2009, the student society opened the doors to its Oxford Entrepreneurs Incubation Centre, which is based at [[Keble College, Oxford]], and already hosts three companies started by recent Oxford students: LabMinds, [[Zoombu]] and Plink.

Along with advice from some of these early Presidents (Goodson, Taggar, and Makharinsky), several UK universities including the [[London School of Economics]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[Oxford Brookes University]] adopted OE's entrepreneurship society template, i.e., OE's website technology and a particular branding style called "Bouncewithit". Based in the [[Said Business School]] with strong ties to OxCEI (Oxford Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation) OE has pioneered a nationwide student entrepreneurship movement, working with many partners including the National Council of Graduate Entrepreneurs, SIFE &amp; Make Your Mark to inspire and stimulate entrepreneurial activity, across the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.pleasefund.us/curators/oxford-entrepreneurs| title=Oxford Entrepreneurs | publisher = pleasefund.us | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">'''Parchmentising''' is a [[textile finishing]] treatment for [[cellulose]] [[fabric]], mainly [[cotton]] and [[flax]], which stiffens the fabric and imparts a degree of translucency.

== Development ==
The process was described in 1850 by [[John Mercer (scientist)|John Mercer]], who treated cotton with solutions of 110–125{{nbsp}}[[Twaddell scale|°Tw]] [[sulfuric acid]], at room temperature, followed by washing. Mercer observed that the treated fabric was soft like fine wool when treated at 110{{nbsp}}°Tw, shrank and stiffened at 114{{nbsp}}°Tw, or shrank, stiffened, and became semi-transparent from 116–125{{nbsp}}°Tw. 
In general, treating indefinitely with concentrations below 110{{nbsp}}°Tw (64%) only swells and shrinks the fabric, while higher concentrations produce the stiff, translucent parchment-like effect in a few seconds, with some loss of tensile strength.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;{{citation | author=J. T. Marsh | chapter=Dispersion Processes | title=An Introduction To Textile Finishing | year=1948 | pages=121–122 | url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.6810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile makers have combined sulfuric acid treatment with other processes to achieve different effects. For example, [[Mercerising]] cotton fabric before acid treatment appears to make it more susceptible to treatment at lower concentrations of sulfuric acid. At about 106 °Tw the Mercerised lustre is removed and the fabric becomes fuller, softer, and more wool-like, similar to a crêpe. The parchmentising effect is still present at higher concentrations, and may be obtained as low as 107.5 °Tw with somewhat longer treatment, perhaps a few minutes. Acid and alkaline treatments are sometimes applied several times in alternation, and patterns may be created by locally applying a [[resist]] before or between treatments.
At every stage the treatment is stopped by washing and neutralizing the fabric. After acid treatment and washing, a heavy [[calender]], sometimes heated, can be applied to the wet or dried fabric to vary its translucency.&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

'''''Port Royale 2''''' is the [[sequel]] to the [[business simulation game]] ''[[Port Royale: Gold, Power and Pirates]]''. It is set in the [[Caribbean]] during the 17th century. Created by [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]] in 2004, it combines a business simulator with real-time battles and towns that can be owned, built, developed or razed.

==Gameplay==
Port Royale 2 is an [[Open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended game]], so the player can choose to pursue any career they wish. This could range from a business tycoon to a [[pirate]]. Initially, you must trade goods between Caribbean colonies to make money, but over the long term you can have substantial business interests in many Caribbean ports, and support large fighting fleets.

As a business tycoon, you trade with towns to gain their friendship, and can then buy building permits to establish businesses there. Ultimately, you can even come to have your own town, but this can take a very long time.

As a buccaneer (with a [[Letter of Marque]]), you can attack any of the four colonial nations in the Caribbean circa 1600; from largest to smallest: Spain, England, France, and The Netherlands.  If you have not acquired a Letter of Marque, every nation will see you as an enemy - you are a pirate.

Ships in this game range from a small [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|Pinnace]] to a massive [[Ship of the Line]]. There are also missions you can complete for money, supplies, or improved relations. At higher levels you can also automate the game to some degree, by setting up trade routes that your trading fleets will follow from town to town.

True to history, home-country politics are fickle and impact the game: One year you might choose to be loyal to [[Spain]] and fight [[England]]–but a year later, might join the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in their fight against the [[France|French]].

Famous pirates of the age also make appearances. These sea wolves are likely to attack any ship or town that they please, including those that belong to the player. They usually operate from heavily fortified bases, but if you defeat them, you'll gain favor with any nation you choose.

Initially, you have operating constraints (how many fleets you may have and how many towns you can buy building permits in), but as you gain levels (based on net worth), you can have unlimited fleets and permits.

The game received generally good reviews.
*[[PC Format]] found the game unremarkable, stating that Port Royale 2 "...passes the time, but gets old fast."&lt;ref name="PC Format"/&gt;
*[[IGN]] was slightly more positive, saying it is "...a solid if unremarkable game." Because the game has an open ending, IGN said it had "good replay value as you can take different career paths each time you play."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The game received praise from 1Up.com, which stated that: "...it's a continually engaging experience." However, they disliked the pace at the beginning, saying "Port Royale 2 is somewhat slow to start. It can take a long time to earn enough money..."&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;
*[[GameSpot]] gave the game a solid 8.3/10, saying "Port Royale 2 might focus more on building shipping cartels than sea battles and swordplay, but its brilliantly realized design is more than just number crunching."{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Notes==
The developer, [[Ascaron|Ascaron Entertainment]] has gone bankrupt. Its website is closed, and PR2 must be bought through third parties. The final(?) patch (1.1.3.2, in the lower left of the home screen) can be found around the web. The title was acquired by [[Kalypso Media]] which founded [[Gaming Minds Studios]] from former Ascaron developers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kalypsomedia.com/en-us/news/index.shtml?pab=1_1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
''[[Port Royale 3: Pirates &amp; Merchants]]'' is the sequel.

      <comment>Robot - Speedily moving category Business continuity and disaster recovery to [[:Category:Business continuity]] per [[WP:CFDS|CFDS]].</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2704">The term '''recovery consistency objective''' (RCO) is used in [[business continuity planning]] in addition to [[recovery point objective]] (RPO) and [[recovery time objective]] (RTO). It applies [[data consistency]] objectives to [[continuous data protection]] services. Following the definitions for RPO and RTO, RCO defines a measurement for the consistency of distributed business data within interlinked systems after a disaster incident. Similar terms used in this context are "Recovery Consistency Characteristics" (RCC) and "recovery object granularity" (ROG). 
&lt;ref&gt;"How to evaluate a recovery management solution." West World Productions, 2006 [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+to+evaluate+a+recovery+management+solution-a0147748661]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term RCO focuses on business data consistency across multiple systems in [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]]-driven business applications such as [[SAP ERP]]. It can be defined per business processes and reflects the individual requirements of corresponding business data and cross-system consistency. While RTO and RPO are absolute per-system values, RCO is expressed as percentage measuring the deviation between actual and targeted state of business data across systems for individual business processes or process groups.

The following formula calculates RCO with "n" representing the number of business processes and "entities" representing an abstract value for business data:


&lt;math&gt;\text{RCO} = 1 - \frac{(\text{number of inconsistent entities})_n}{(\text{number of entities})_n}&lt;/math&gt;


Targeting 100% RCO for a business process (distributed across several systems) would mean that no business data deviation is allowed after a disaster incident whereas any target below 100% allows deviation. Target values for RCO increase with the criticality of the underlying business data: logistics and banking-related business processes are often characterized by higher RCO requirements than those of CRM or HR systems. 

Including RCO considerations in addition to RTO and RPO in the [[business impact analysis]] helps to focus on the integrity of business data and processes in complex application environments.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Krischer, Donna Scott, Roberta J. Witty: "Six Myths About Business Continuity Management and
Disaster Recovery", Gartner Research [http://www.gartner.com/it/content/868800/868812/six_myths_about_bcm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; RCO considerations should be included in the [[Disaster Recovery]] Architecture by manually defining multiple consistency points across the landscape or by special Disaster Recovery mirroring tools.

== History ==

Thomson Reuters Corp sold a 55-percent majority stake in its Financial &amp; Risk (F&amp;R) unit to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP on October 1, 2018, in a deal which valued the total F&amp;R business at about $20 billion. This business was formed into Refinitiv.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Operations==

Under the deal, Thomson Reuters transferred its complete Financial and Risk product portfolio to Refinitiv, with the exception of Regulatory Intelligence, Risk Compliance Learning and Data Privacy Advisory Services. 

Refinitiv's [[FinTech]] data, analytics, trading, and risk assessment tools include [[FXall]], [[Eikon|Eikon Messenger]], Auto Audit and the Elektron Data Platform creating 32,000 risk intelligence records every month from internal and third-party sources. Another, the [https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/world-check-kyc-screening World-Check Risk Intelligence database], compiles information from international financial watch lists, government records, and media searches to tackle [[Money Laundering]].

Although Thomson Reuters is now a minority shareholder in Refinitiv, it still supplies Reuters news and content to the company's 400,000 plus customers in more than 40,000 businesses around the world, supported by a network of at least 13,000 registered developers.

Refinitiv's Developer Portal includes data feeds, [[Software_development_kit|SDKs]] and [[Application_programming_interface|APIs]], documentation, sample code, learning materials and community Q &amp; A forums. These run alongside "developer days" in regional centres on topics including [[Machine_learning|machine learning]], cloud services and legislation such as [[General_Data_Protection_Regulation|GDPR]].

==Political allegiances==

Rasethaba was the leader of the [[Azanian People's Organisation]] (Azapo) in the (then) Northern Province of South Africa.&lt;ref name="businessday1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=94634 |title=Concerning passengers aboard the ANC train &amp;#124; Archive &amp;#124; BDlive |publisher=Businessday.co.za |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a committed "Azanian", or so many thought, until he joined the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). According to him, he did so because "he could see that was where the money was.".&lt;ref name="businessday1"/&gt; Originally a staunch supporter of [[Jacob Zuma]], during 2011 and 2012 Rasethaba followed the lead of [[Julius Malema]] and others in promoting [[Kgalema Motlanthe]] to replace Zuma as President of the ANC, but when it became evident, towards the end of 2012, that [[Julius Malema]] had lost all power and influence&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Erin. (13 January 2013) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/9798840/Julius-Malema-facing-bankruptcy-in-South-Africa.html Julius Malema 'facing bankruptcy' in South Africa].

News24.&lt;/ref&gt; Rasethaba performed yet another about-face to support Zuma once again, brokering an agreement for [[Fikile Mbalula]] to support Zuma over Motlanthe at the ANC's 2012 Manguang conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/mbalula-backs-zuma-1.1402435#.UV8XIxdwqkN |title=Mbalula Backs Zuma |publisher=IOL News|date=14 October 2012|accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasethaba was also alleged to be at the apex of a tender rigging triangle that had [[Julius Malema]] at one corner and Limpopo Premier [[Cassel Mathale]] at the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mg.co.za/article/2010-02-26-juliuss-web-of-influence Julius's web of influence | News | National | Mail &amp; Guardian].

Legalbrief (22 February 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rasethaba is an important proponent and beneficiary of black economic empowerment in SA. He is also a benefactor to the [[ANC]] and the ANC Youth League ([[ANCYL]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.news24.com/citypress/Politics/News/President-Malema-20110618 |title=President Malema? &amp;#124; City Press |publisher=M.news24.com |date=19 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Andrews''' (5 April 1835 – 9 November 1908) was a British entrepreneur and head of the Solomon Andrews and Son bus and tram-operating company, based in [[Cardiff]].

==Family==
Andrews was born in [[Trowbridge]], Wiltshire, the son of John Andrews and Charlotte. The fourth of six children, he was baptised on 5 June 1835 in St James's Church, Trowbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Parish Registers of the church of St. James, Trowbridge&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 1855, Solomon married Mary Asher (20 August 1832 – 18 January 1870), daughter of John and Mary Asher, in Trinity Church, Trowbridge. There were five children from the marriage but only two survived infancy:
* Mary Lillah Asher Andrews (24 June 1857) married John McRae June 1880 in Cardiff and she died 13 Mar 1929
*Francis Emile Andrews (29 September 1858 – 30 November 1943)

His second wife, whom he married on 15 June 1870 in Knighton Parish Church, was Mary Jane Udell (born 2 March 1849) of Wrexham.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire Times, 14 November 1908&lt;/ref&gt; There were six children from this marriage:
*Beatrice Andrews (6 April 1871)
*Herbert Fletcher Andrews (16 April 1873 – 8 June 1874)
*Florence Andrews
*May Andrews, married William Edgar Clogg
*Daisy Andrews
*Sydney Solomon Andrews (26 February 1885)

==Career==
By 1851 Andrews was living in [[Cardiff]], at 17 Tredegar Street, and working as a baker and confectioner.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiltshire archaeological and natural history magazine: Volume 36, Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society – 1910&lt;/ref&gt;  The house was owned by George and Charlotte Asher, George being a baker and confectioner, so Solomon was presumably learning the trade.

On 24 November 1856 he leased a shop and house at 51 James Street.

Andrews, November 1976. {{ISBN|0 900807 23 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; he obtained a licence to operate a horse-drawn cab from the new residential districts of Canton and Roath to [[Cardiff Docks]]. By 1865, he had eight cabs and he is thought to have been an omnibus proprietor by December 1866.

His business interests grew rapidly to include tramways, buses, draperies and collieries.

His son Francis Emile (1858–1943) joined the company and eventually became a partner, the business becoming known as ''Solomon Andrews and Son'',

==Transport==
===Buses===
[[File:Star Omnibus Company horse bus, 2010 Cobham bus rally.jpg|thumb|Star Omnibus Company horse bus at the 2010 Cobham bus rally]]
He was best known for the Andrews Star Omnibus Company and the [[Star Omnibus Company]] (London) which provided horse-drawn bus services in London. His company also ran buses in:
*[[Belfast]]
*[[Leicester]]
*[[Manchester]]
*[[Nottingham]]

===Trams===
*Cardiff
*[[Plymouth]]
*[[Portsmouth]] – [[Portsmouth Street Tramways Company]]
*[[Pwllheli]] –  [[Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway]]
*Barmouth Junction – [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]]

==Property==
===Arthog===
[[File:Mawddach Crescent - geograph.org.uk - 985246.jpg|thumb|Mawddach Crescent]]
[[File:St Mary's Terrace Arthog - geograph.org.uk - 392611.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Terrace, Arthog]]
[[File:Arthog - geograph.org.uk - 245796.jpg|thumb|Arthog Terrace]]  
In 1894 he purchased an area near [[Arthog]] consisting of several farms. He developed three terraces of houses, including St Mary's Terrace, Arthog Terrace, and Mawddach Crescent. 

Mawddach Crescent was a row of properties overlooking the [[River Mawddach|Mawddach estuary]]. The Crescent was connected to [[Morfa Mawddach railway station|Barmouth Junction railway station]] by the short-lived [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]] which he constructed. Andrews intended this to be the start of a purpose-built holiday resort but the surrounding land proved unsuitable for further construction. In 1941, during the [[Second World War]], the Crescent was commandeered by the [[Royal Marines]]. It was renamed Camp Iceland and used as a training facility.

St Mary's Terrace in Arthog was also served by the [[Barmouth Junction and Arthog Tramway]].

===Aberdovey===
Andrews purchased land here and started work by fencing off some of it. However, this provoked trouble locally as public rights of way were affected, so no development ever took place. The land was later sold to the local authority.

===Cardiff===
Andrews undertook the rebuilding of 10 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) in 1871. This building was intended to be a grocery and confectionery shop and the headquarters of the Solomon Andrews and Son firm.

In the 1870s the expansion of his omnibus business led to the acquisition of new sites for depots. A freehold site was purchased at Severn Road, Canton, in 1875, and a manager's house, bus shed, stables and workshops was constructed.

In 1875, he also undertook work on a leasehold site at Glebe Street, Penarth. In 1880 he built a tram car depot at the junction of Ferry Road and Clive Street, Grangetown. This was for the Cardiff District and Penarth Harbour Tramway Company which opened in 1881. 

Between 1881–83 Andrews built five houses and shops, five cottages and Windsor Hall in Holmesdale Street, and some houses in Earl Street. Andrews Terrace in Ferry Road, consisting of sixteen houses and a coffee tavern, was also constructed at around the same time.

In 1884 he constructed the Market Buildings in St Mary Street, Cardiff at a cost of some £12,000. Sadly this building was destroyed by fire in June 1885, and it had been replaced by September 1886,&lt;ref&gt;The Pictorial World, 9 December 1886&lt;/ref&gt; the new building being constructed with eight-inch-thick concrete flooring to prevent further fires.

In 1885 in James Street he began construction of Mercantile Buildings which survived until demolished in the 1970s during a road widening scheme.

In 1888 Andrews completed the Imperial Buildings on St Mary Street, Cardiff, which became known as Barry's Hotel. 

He also built two streets of housing which were named Mary Street and Solomon Street (later renamed Andrews Road), and was involved in the construction of warehouses on the southern side of Penarth Road, as well as between Crawshay Lane (now Curran Road) and Trade Street. Terraced houses were built from the corner of Blaenclydach Street south-westwards along Penart Road in 1891 to designs by the architect E.W.M. Corbett. 

The Atlas, or Hayes, Building was erected around 1893 and this survived until destroyed by fire in 1958. 

In 1894 Andrews constructed residential property from 75 to 113 Penarth Road, and the Andrews' Buildings on Queen Street to designs by the architect Edward Webb.

In 1895 the firm started building work in Penarth. Andrews' Buildings (Penarth), erected in 1896, consisted of five shops fronting Stanwell Road, a corner shop and two shops in Windsor Terrace. In 1897 the company built Lloyds Bank on the corner of Windsor Road and Albert Road to designs by the architect Edward Webb. This was followed by the Windsor Arcade, a row of shops on Windsor Road. 

Around 1900 Metropole Buildings, 3–7 The Hayes, Cardiff was erected. This building was badly damaged by an air raid in the Second World War, but was reconstructed in 1959. 

Numbers,11, 12, and 13 Bute Street (now Hayes Bridge Road) were rebuilt in 1902 to designs by the architect Lennox Robertson. Andrews also constructed Pembroke Buildings on Pembroke Terrace in the same year, using the architect E.W.M. Corbett.

===Pwllheli===
[[File:Promenâd Pwllheli Promenade - geograph.org.uk - 346014.jpg|thumb|Pwllheli Promenade]]
In [[Pwllheli]], Andrews was responsible for the development of the West End holiday resort, which included a promenade, housing, roads, a recreation ground, golf course, and the West End Hotel.  The stone required to build the West End was provided by a local quarry that he leased at Carreg-y-defaid. The company constructed the [[Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway]], which carried the stone and passengers.

The West End Hotel was constructed first, along with large houses numbered 1–4 The Parade. The hotel was probably completed by 1895 and the houses in 1896. The construction was mostly in concrete, with the joinery being provided by his workshops in Cardiff and delivered to Pwllheli by rail. 

Further building work was undertaken in 1897 when plans for nos 5–10 The Parade were approved by the council. Nos 11–16 followed quickly afterwards and all were completed by 1899.

Construction of housing and shops in Cardiff Road was undertaken between 1897 and 1901. A power station was erected next to the Assembly Rooms behind the West End Hotel, to provide electrical power for the West End Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;History of the Gas Industry in Pwllheli, W. N. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the scion of a wealthy ship owning family, but is best known for founding the [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]] [[easyJet]] and the Stelmar shipping line with start-up funds provided by his father, [[Loucas Haji-Ioannou]]. easyJet's foundation in 1995 marked the beginning of a series of ventures marketed under the "easy" brand, managed by easyGroup and chaired by Haji-Ioannou.

== Family and education ==
Stelios Haji-Ioannou is the second of three children by Loucas and Nedi Haji-Ioannou. He was born in [[Athens]] on 14 February 1967. He has an elder brother, [[Polys Haji-Ioannou|Polys]], and a younger sister, [[Clelia Haji-Ioannou|Clelia]].

== Early career ==
A self-labelled "serial entrepreneur", Stelios started working in 1988 for his father's already successful shipping business, [[Troodos Shipping Co]] Ltd. At 25, Stelios received £30 million from his father, that he used to set up his own shipping company, Stelmar Shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Morais|title=Proving Papa Wrong|date=19 June 2001|url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/19/096.html|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haji-Ioannou floated the company on the NYSE in 2001. In 2005, Stelmar Shipping was sold to the [[Overseas Shipholding Group|OSG Group]] for approximately $1.3 billion.

== Exonerated in shipping accident ==
{{Main article|MT Haven}}
In April 1991, a Troodos-owned VLCC [[oil tanker]] suffered a disaster that resulted in six deaths and spilt about 50,000 tons of crude oil into the sea - arguably the Mediterranean's worst-ever ecological disaster.&lt;ref name="Making it all look easy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making it all look easy|date=21 April 2002|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,687834,00.html|work=Guardian Unlimited|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanker, [[M/T Haven|M/T ''Haven'']], was an elderly vessel, formerly the ''Amoco Haven'', sister ship of the ill-starred [[Amoco Cadiz]] that had foundered in 1978. Haji-Ioannou was accused of poor maintenance and charged, in Italy, with manslaughter and also intimidating and attempting to bribe witnesses. Haji-Ioannou blamed the accident on an error by one of the surviving crew members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

He and his father were acquitted by the jury. Subsequent civil demands for compensation were also dismissed by the courts.&lt;ref name="Making it all look easy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Radio 4's On The Ropes|date=7 July 2002|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/07_july/07/ontheropes_stelios.shtml|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "easy" companies ==
{{main article|easyGroup}}
Haji-Ioannou started [[easyJet]] in 1995 when he was 28, running a service between Luton and Scotland. In 2000, easyJet PLC was partially floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. He and his family remain its largest single shareholders (34%) in the airline, capitalized at £6.8bn as of 20/08/15.

Haji-Ioannou conducts business via his private investment vehicle, the [[easyGroup]], which owns the 'easy' brand and licenses it to the various 'easy'-branded ventures, including the airline. Haji-Ioannou continues to extend his business interests, mainly in the field of travel and leisure by encouraging entrepreneurs to adopt the "easy" brand for their companies.

easyJet PLC is one of Europe's largest airlines with a fleet of over 240 jets (+150 on order) carrying over 70m passengers annually.

Other travel/leisure-related businesses include:

* [[easyCar]], which offers a peer2peer car sharing scheme as well as low cost car rental in 2,000 locations globally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J.F.O.|last=McAllister|title=Easy All Over Europe|date=23 July 2001|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000398,00.html|work =[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Birthday Honours 2006|June 2006]], Haji-Ioannou received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] from [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]] for "services to entrepreneurship".

== Fastjet ==
{{main article|Fastjet}}
In September 2011 it was reported that Haji-Ioannou was working on Fastjet, a new low-cost airline serving routes within Africa, as part of a joint venture with Lonrho plc. The airline started operations on 29 November 2012 with [[Airbus A319]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pan-african-low-cost-carrier-fastjet-launches-scheduled-flights-379587/|title=Pan-African low-cost carrier Fastjet launches scheduled flights|publisher=Flightglobal.com|date=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle with Ryanair ==
In 2009, Haji-Ioannou brought proceedings in London's High Court over [[Ryanair]] adverts which appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and on Ryanair's website in January and February. The adverts featured a picture of Haji-Ioannou in the style of [[Pinocchio]] and referred to him as "[[easyJet]]'s Mr Late Again". The case was eventually settled out of court, with Haji-Ioannou receiving an official apology from the airline and the sum of £50,100, which Haji-Ioannou announced he would donate to his philanthropic foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/07/15/easyjet-founder-stelios-wins-libel-payout-from-ryanair-over-pinocchio-ads-115875-22414818/|title=EasyJet founder Stelios wins libel payout from Ryanair|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EasyJet Disagreement ==
In 2010, Haji-Ioannou quit the board of EasyJet, in order to attempt to force the management of the company to abort their expansion plans.

In an interview with ''[[Management Today]]'', he said: 'EasyJet is seen as a huge success, which I'm happy about, because I own the brand. But easyJet is a publicly listed company. The share price has gone up and down as it's got bigger and things have happened – but overall, really it's gone sideways.'

He then went on to say: 'Basically, it's created no shareholder value for 10 years.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-sir-stelios-haji-ioannou-easyjet/article/1004499|website=Management Today|title=The MT interview: Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Stelios said he had become "increasingly concerned" at easyJet's expansion plans. He announced that he sold 200,000 easyJet shares in protest against plans to buy more planes, while his siblings have done the same with their shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9815704/Sir-Stelios-threatens-to-sell-family-stake-in-fresh-easyJet-row.html|website=Telegraph|title=Sir Stelios threatens to sell family stake in fresh easyJet row|date=2013-01-21|last1=Peacock|first1=Louisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residence ==
Haji-Ioannou has been a [[Monaco]] resident since his family left Athens when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hajiioannou, Stelios|url=http://www.hellenism.net/cgi-bin/display_celeb.html?c=92|work=Hellenism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and public life ==
Haji-Ioannou was a member of the [[New Enterprise Council]], a group set up to advise the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] on business policy. He stated at the time that this appointment did not reflect his political affiliations, adding "I agreed to be included in the group of entrepreneurs because I was assured it will be non-partisan. [There is] not much difference between Left and Right any more."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/parties-clash-in-corporate-credentials-battle Parties clash in corporate credentials battle] MarketWatch, 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2010, in a letter to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Haji-Ioannou joined 23 other UK business leaders, including [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'s [[Stuart Rose]] and [[Next (clothing)|Next's]] [[Simon Wolfson]], criticising the Labour government's plans to raise [[National Insurance]] contribution rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7541734/Business-supports-George-Osbornes-national-insurance-cut.html|title=Business supports George Osborne's national insurance cut|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Omar Baba in the BBC TV comedy ''[[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|Come Fly With Me]]'' is reportedly based on Haji-Ioannou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209821/Come-Fly-With-Me-fasten-your-seatbelts....html|title=Come Fly With Me: fasten your seatbelts|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation finances ten undergraduate scholarships annually for students taking a three-year course at his [[alma mater]], the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], and a further ten postgraduate awards at City University's Cass Business School (1-year course). It also gives a £50,000 cash prize to the winner of the Disabled Entrepreneur in the UK Award, run in conjunction with Leonard Cheshire Disability. Similar prizes are awarded for enterprises in Cyprus that help foster inter-communal relationships on the island and Greece where the Foundation hosts an award for young entrepreneurs.

Most recently the Foundation has joined the relief effort aimed at helping those in Greece and Cyprus worst affected by the current economic downturn. Its "Food from the Heart" initiative, based in Limassol, hands out free lunchtime snacks to registered recipients in Nicosia, Limassol and Athens. Further outlets to help cope with the refugees landing on Aegean islands are in the planning stage. (www.stelios.com)

== Biography ==
Fleischl grew up in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier,]] in New Zealand's North Island, and decided to become a chef at the age of 11. When she was 15, her father started writing letters to restaurants and hotels in Europe, asking for a position for her. The only reply was from London's [[Savoy Hotel]], so at the age of 17, in 1985, Fleischl flew to London and spent two years at the hotel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="restaurantnz.co.nz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.restaurantnz.co.nz/Story?Action=View&amp;Story_id=1898|title=Sue Fleischl inducted to the Restaurant Association Hall of Fame : Restaurant Association of New Zealand|website=www.restaurantnz.co.nz|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/ponsonbynews/docs/pnewsapril2012hires4web/48|title=APRIL'12 – PONSONBY NEWS|newspaper=Issuu|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to New Zealand briefly, then moved to [[Bangkok]] and then to [[Melbourne]]. She started her own catering company in Melbourne, called "Sue-Chef Catering".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4744">'''Systemically important payment systems''' ('''SIPS''') are [[payment system]]s which have the characteristic that a failure of these systems could potentially endanger the operation of the whole economy.  In general, these are the major payment clearing systems or [[real-time gross settlement]] systems of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems.  [[TARGET2]] is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments.  [[STEP2]], operated by the [[Euro Banking Association]] is a major pan-European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS.

In the event of a bank failure, adherence to the rules for the operation of SIPS should prevent a domino effect whereby payment obligations of the failing bank are effected against the solvent banks.  Clearly, this does not prevent the effects of a bank failure from spreading; however, it closes off one route.

==Operation of a SIPS==
In 2001, the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) issued the "Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss43.pdf?noframes=1|title=Core Principles Systemically Important Payment Systems|date=2008-01-01|accessdate=2008-12-30|publisher=[[Bank for International Settlements]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and these are summarised below. In certain banking circles, these have become known as the 10 Commandments.

In 2003 the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) further elaborated on how the principles should be applied in Euro retail payment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/retailpsoversightstandardsen.pdf|title=OVERSIGHT STANDARDS FOR EURO RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS|date=2003-05-01|accessdate=2008-12-30|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in response to the perceived increased risks of terrorist attacks, the ECB in 2006 published detailed oversight expectations for business continuity planning, greatly expanding on core principle number 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/businesscontinuitysips2006en.pdf|title=BUSINESS CONTINUITY OVERSIGHT EXPECTATIONS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT PAYMENT SYSTEMS |date=2006-06-09|accessdate=2017-12-06|publisher=[[European Central Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIS added an additional recommendation in relation to countries which use cheques.  It urged the operators of cheque clearing to have special regard to the fact that cheques may be dishonoured and returned some days after presentation, and this poses special risks. This is particularly relevant to countries such as Britain, Ireland, France, and US and should be regarded as the 11th commandment of payments.

BIS CPSS is currently preparing for the new global standards for not only payment systems but also securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories. The new standards (Principles for FMI) is now under market consultation and going to be published in 2012.

==Core principles==
{{see|CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures}}

A systemically important payment system (SIPS) should have:

# A well-founded legal basis
# Rules and procedures which enable participants to have a clear understanding of the system’s impact on each of the financial risks they incur through participation in it.
# Clearly defined procedures for the management of credit risks and liquidity risks, which specify the respective responsibilities of the system operator and the participants and which provide appropriate incentives to manage and contain those risks
# Prompt final settlement on the day of value, preferably during the day and at a minimum at the end of the day.
# Where multilateral netting takes place, it should, at a minimum be capable of ensuring the timely completion of daily settlements in the event of an inability to settle by the participant with the largest single settlement obligation
# Assets used for settlement should preferably be a claim on the central bank; where other assets are used, they should carry little or no credit risk and little or no liquidity risk  
# A high degree of security and operational reliability, and contingency arrangements for timely completion of daily processing
# Practical for its users and efficient for the economy
# Objective and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair and open access
# Governance arrangements which are effective, accountable and transparent
