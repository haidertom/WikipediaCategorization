'''A.I.R. Gallery''' (Artists in Residence) Is the first all female artists cooperative gallery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gardner-Huggett|first=Joanna|year=2012|title=Artemisia Challenges the Elders: How a Women Artists' Cooperative Created a Community for Feminism and Art Made by Women|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0055|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=33| issue =  2|pages=55–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 with the objective of providing a professional and permanent exhibition space for women artists during a time in which the works shown at commercial galleries in New York City were almost exclusively by male artists. A.I.R. is a not-for-profit, self-underwritten arts organization in which the New York artist members serve as the board of directors. The gallery was originally located in [[SoHo]] at 97 Wooster Street, and was located on 111 Front Street in the [[DUMBO, Brooklyn|DUMBO]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] until 2015. In May 2015, A.I.R. Gallery moved to its current location at 155 Plymouth St, Brooklyn, NY 11201.

A.I.R. is a non-profit organization that aims to show the diversity and artistic talent of women, to teach, to challenge stereotypes of female artists, and to subvert the historically male-dominated [[art museum|commercial gallery]] scene, with the overall hope to serve as an example for other artists who wish to realize their own art cooperative endeavors.

== History ==
[[Barbara Zucker]] and [[Susan Williams (artist)|Susan Williams]], two artists and friends, confronted the challenges of finding a dealer and decided to look for other women artists to start a co-op. [[Feminism]] at that time had barely penetrated the New York Art scene, a 1970 [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] protest drew attention to the less than 5 percent female representation. Directed by activist [[art critic]] [[Lucy Lippard]], the two, together with [[Dotty Attie]] and Mary Grigoriadis, visited 55 studios to select and invite women artists to form a co-op.

At a first meeting on March 17, 1972, in William’s loft, women artists met, among them Maude Boltz, [[Nancy Spero]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Howardena Pindell]], [[Ree Morton]], [[Harmony Hammond]], [[Cynthia Carlson]] and [[Sari Dienes]]. In the end, there was a highly eclectic mix of 20 artists (some of the approved declined joining the group, nervous of being in an all-female gallery).
For the artists themselves, their work and exhibition goals were all about quality. Still, having to deal with feminist politics was in the center, which meant fighting prejudices and fears that the showings would be considered second-rate. After the opening, the story goes, one man said grudgingly, “Okay you did it; you found 20 good women artists. But that’s it.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Carey Lovelace]], a.i.r. ways. From the Catalogue: “A.I.R. Gallery: The History Show, Sept. 16 – Dec. 12, 2008 at Tracy/Barry Gallery, Bobst Library, NYU and A.I.R. Gallery: The History Show, Oct. 2 – Nov. 29, 2008 and Nov. 6 to Nov. 29, 2008 at A.I.R. Gallery, Dumbo, NY”&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery was structured to be both an exhibition space for art by women and a radical, progressive, even subversive, not-for-profit institution.
Its cooperative nature and its democratic structure have meant that the members vote on all decisions and participate in monthly meetings to plan exhibitions, programs and the overall direction of the gallery. Each artist pays membership dues and thus has ownership over the organization itself and their own career.
In this way, the structure of A.I.R. differs from that of dealer-driven galleries. Incoming artists are chosen through a rigorous peer review process that includes reviewing the works of applicants, lengthy discussions and a studio visit by current members.&lt;ref&gt;Kat Griefen and Susan Bee, artists in residence: a short history. From the Catalogue: “A.I.R. Gallery: The History Show”&lt;/ref&gt;
Each artist has to curate her own show, which allows for experimentation and risks that are not always possible in commercial settings.&lt;ref name="fales"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the A.I.R. Gallery Archives ca. 1972-2006|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725041828/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/air.html|publisher=[[Fales Library and Special Collections]]|accessdate=16 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725041828/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/air.html|archivedate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group soon acknowledged the importance of building a heritage: collaborations and international group shows, in parts curated by their members, were established.
The fellowship program in its earliest years provided sponsorship on a case-by-case basis as funds were available.

Founded in 1972, A.I.R. is the first non-profit, artist-run gallery for women in the country. The announcement for the gallery’s first exhibition elaborates our founding concept best, stating, “A.I.R. does not sell art; it changes attitudes about art by women. A.I.R. offers women artists a space to show work as innovative, transitory and free of market trends as the artists’ conceptions demands.” Based on the feminist principles of economic cooperation and decision by consensus, A.I.R. continues to offer an alternative venue for women that protects the creative process and the individual voice of the artist.

== Name ==
The name “AIR” arose when, in a first meeting, artist member [[Howardena Pindell]] suggested “Jane Eyre”. From that came “air” – then, “A.I.R.” This was also a reference to the “Artist in Residence” Certification given by the city to allow artists to live in otherwise illegal Soho commercial spaces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carey Lovelace]], a.i.r. ways. From the Catalogue: “A.I.R. Gallery: The History Show”&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
Monday-Night Program Series 1972-1981; Current Issue Series 1982-1987 (both programs included general-audience panels on criticism, the market, public art as well as ‘how-to’s – for example ‘tax night’, and so on); Exhibition Programs: Solo Shows of Gallery Artists; Sponsored Solo Shows for Fellowship Artists; Group Shows of National Artists; Group Shows designed to include a broader community of women artists such as the "Generations" invitational series and juried Biennial Exhibitions; Lectures/Symposia/Panels; Fellowship Program; Internship Program

The Fellowship Program, founded in 1993, is open to all self-identified women artists who have never had a solo show in NYC, or who have not had a solo show in NYC in the last ten years, outside of an educational or not-for-profit venue. The Fellowship Program is structured to give the Fellows the opportunity to develop their work in preparation for a solo show, to build relationships with other artists and arts professionals, and acquire skills necessary to maintain a not-for-profit gallery or arts organization. The Fellows leave the program with a series of naturally forged relationships, experiences, and essential skill sets that are necessary to continue their careers as visual artists.

== Reception ==
A.I.R. Gallery has played a widely recognized role in the art world since the institution’s founding. In 1978, notable feminist painter Sylvia Sleigh commemorated the 21 current members (including Sleigh herself) of A.I.R. through her painting ''A.I.R. Group Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Ann Lee. “Sleigh, Sylvia.” ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'', Oxford University Press, 2018. ''www.oxfordreference.com'', &lt;/ref&gt; In the essay “The Enemies of Women’s Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed,” Art Historian Meredith Brown praises how A.I.R. “created a wide-ranging network of individuals and organizations that collectively rallied to counter the patriarchy of the art establishment”&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Emily D. 2012 Essay Prize: Meredith A. Brown. 8 Jan. 2012, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.aaa.si.edu/publications/essay-prize/2012-essay-prize-meredith-brown.01/acref-9780191807671-e-1231&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Art Historian Lenore Malen similarly acknowledges the influence of A.I.R. stating “New York City where I moved in 73 I saw how the women's collectives: A.I.R., Soho 20, and others were shaping the feminist art movement”&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism Forum''. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/04/forum.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 17 Oct. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. While many acknowledge the influence of A.I.R. on feminist art, the gallery has received some criticism in its use of government funding. In her article “The Balance Sheet: A.I.R. and Government Funding, Meredith Brown argues that “A.I.R. began to rely on financial support from sources whose bureaucratic complexities necessitated the gallery shift its organizational structure, if not compromise its feminist principles”&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism Forum''. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/04/forum.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 17 Oct. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first, self-renovated location for the inaugural A.I.R. exhibition was 97 Wooster Street, which opened on September 16, 1972. After occupying a gallery space at 63 Crosby Street from 1981–1994, A.I.R. Gallery was located at 40 Wooster Street from 1994–2002, at 511 West 25th Street from 2002–2008 and opened a new space at 111 Front Street # 228, Dumbo - Brooklyn, New York, starting with The History Show on October 2, 2008.

Although Nasar notes that Nash did not consider himself a [[homosexual]], she describes his arrest for [[indecent exposure]] and firing from RAND amid the suspicion that he was, then considered grounds for revoking one's [[security clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Beautiful Mind'', pp. 185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ends with Nash being awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1994. The book is a detailed description of many aspects of Nash's life, including the nature of his mathematical genius, and a close examination of his personality and motivations.

==Reception==

[[File:Essays Percy Bysshe Shelley 1840 2 vols.jpg|thumb|1840 title page of ''Essays. Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments'' by Edward Moxon, London.]][[File:A Defense of Poetry.jpg|thumb|1891 title page of ''A Defense of Poetry'' by Ginn and Co., Boston]]
"'''A Defence of Poetry'''" is an essay by the English poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], written in 1821 and first published posthumously in 1840 in ''Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments'' by Edward Moxon in London.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy, Mark. "Defence of Poetry" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. 25 August 2004. The Literary Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt; It contains Shelley's famous claim that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world".

==Background==

The essay was written in response to his friend [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s article "[[The Four Ages of Poetry]]", which had been published in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Charles W., ed. ''English Essays: From Sir Philip Sidney to Macaulay. With Introductions and Notes. The Harvard Classics''. Edited by Charles W. Eliot. New York: P.F. Collier and Son, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote to the publishers [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] (who were also his own publishers):  &lt;br&gt;
:I am enchanted with your ''Literary Miscellany'', although the last article has excited my polemical faculties so violently that the moment I get rid of my ophthalmia, I mean to set about an answer to it.... It is very clever, but I think, very false.

To Peacock, Shelley wrote:
:Your anathemas against poetry itself excited me to a sacred rage. . . . I had the greatest possible desire to break a lance with you ... in honour of my mistress Urania.

''A Defence of Poetry'' was eventually published, with some edits by [[John Hunt (publisher)|John Hunt]], posthumously by Shelley's wife [[Mary Shelley]] in 1840 in ''Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments''.

==Editorial introductions==

Shelley sought to show that poets make morality and establish the legal norms in a civil society thus creating the groundwork for the other branches in a community.

In ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'', Volume 5, Critical Essays, Robert M. Hutchins and Mortimer J. Adler wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Robert M., and Mortimer J. Adler, eds. ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'', Volume 5, Critical Essays. Toronto: Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1963, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

::In A Defence of Poetry, [Shelley] attempts to prove that poets are philosophers; that they are the creators and protectors of moral and civil laws; and that if it were not for poets, scientists could not have developed either their theories or their inventions.

Poets introduce and maintain morality. The mores so created are codified into laws. The social function or utility of poets is that they create and maintain the norms and mores of a society. In ''English Romantic Writers'', David Perkins wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, David, ed. ''English Romantic Writers,'' 2nd edition. Toronto: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1995, p. 1131. {{ISBN|0-15-501688-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

::...Shelley was mainly concerned to explain the moral (and thus the social) function of poetry.  In doing so, he produced one of the most penetrating general discussions on poetry that we have.

==Major themes==

Shelley’s argument for poetry in his critical essay is written within the context of [[Romanticism]]. In 1858, William Stigant, a poet, essayist, and translator, wrote in his essay "Sir Philip Sidney"&lt;ref&gt;Stigant, William. "Sir Philip Sidney", ''Cambridge Essays'', 4, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; that Shelley's "beautifully written ''Defence of Poetry''" is a work which "analyses the very inner essence of poetry and the reason of its existence, – its development from, and operation on, the mind of man". Shelley writes in ''Defence'' that while "ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created," and leads to a moral civil life, poetry acts in a way that "awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought".

In ''A Defence of Poetry'', Shelley argued that the invention of language reveals a human impulse to reproduce the rhythmic and ordered, so that harmony and unity are delighted in wherever they are found and incorporated, instinctively, into creative activities: "Every man in the infancy of art, observes an order which approximates more or less closely to that from which highest delight results..." This "faculty of approximation" enables the observer to experience the beautiful, by establishing a "relation between the highest pleasure and its causes". Those who possess this faculty "in excess are poets" and their task is to communicate the "pleasure" of their experiences to the community. Shelley does not claim language is poetry on the grounds that language is the medium of poetry; rather he recognises in the creation of language an adherence to the poetic precepts of order, harmony, unity, and a desire to express delight in the beautiful. Aesthetic admiration of "the true and the beautiful" is provided with an important social aspect which extends beyond communication and precipitates self-awareness. Poetry and the various modes of art it incorporates are directly involved with the social activities of life. Shelley nominated unlikely figures such as [[Plato]] and Jesus in their excellent use of language to conceive the inconceivable.

For Shelley, "poets ... are not only the authors of language and of music, of the dance, and architecture, and statuary, and painting; they are the institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society..." Social and linguistic order are not the sole products of the rational faculty, as language is "arbitrarily produced by the imagination" and reveals "the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension" of a higher beauty and truth. Shelley's conclusive remark that "poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" suggests his awareness of "the profound ambiguity inherent in linguistic means, which he considers at once as an instrument of intellectual freedom and a vehicle for political and social subjugation".&lt;ref&gt;Liberto, Fabio. "The Politics of Language in P.B. Shelley." ''La questione romantica'' 2/1 (April, 2010), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article is about the ancient type of pottery. For the as yet unidentified ancient Egyptian city, see [[Amarna#Name]].''

An '''alabastron''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|r|ə|n|,_|-|ˌ|t|r|ɒ|n}} or '''alabastrum''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|t|r|ə|m}} ( plural: ''alabastra'' or ''alabastrons''; from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλάβαστρον)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)la/bastron|ἀλάβαστρον|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a small type of [[pottery]] or glass vessel used in the ancient world for holding oil, especially [[perfume]] or [[massage#Oil|massage oils]]. They originated around the 11th century BC in [[ancient Egypt]] as containers carved from [[alabaster]] &amp;ndash; hence the name &amp;ndash; but spread via [[ancient Greece]] to other parts of the classical world.

Most types of alabastron have a narrow body with a rounded end, a narrow neck and a broad, splayed mouth. They were often left without handles, but some types were equipped with ear-shaped projections or [[Lug (knob)|lug]]s into which holes were punched. Strings were then put through these holes for easy mobility.

The design of the first Egyptian alabastra was inspired by the [[palm tree]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} with a columnar shape, a palm capital and a stand. Later designs were made from [[glass]] decorated with various patterns, such as [[scallop]]s, festoons or abstract patterns of rings or zigzags.

Around the 7th century BC, alabastra spread to Greece and became an important element of [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|ancient Greek pottery]]. There were three distinct types of Greek alabastron:{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

* A basic [[Corinth]]ian bulbous shape standing about {{convert|3|-|4|in}} tall; a popular design found throughout Greece.
* A long and pointed version commonly seen in eastern Greek, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], and Italo-[[Corinth]]ian pottery.
* An [[Attica|Attic]] type about {{convert|4|-|8|in|cm}} long with a rounded base and lugs for carrying purposes.

Alabastra also appeared in many other places in the ancient world, notably [[Assyria]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 26:7&lt;/ref&gt; all having presumably been inspired by or exported from Greece or Egypt.

Within a hundred years after arriving in the area,{{Which|date=February 2012}} Greek artisans were producing elaborately decorated silver alabastra, long and narrow and {{convert|12|-|16|cm|sp=us}} in height.  The decoration usually involved dividing the body of the vase into four horizontal zones by ornamental bands around it.

[[Image:Peones.gif|frame|An example of a rendered [[animation]]]]
'''Rendering''' in [[visual art]] and [[technical drawing]] means the process of formulating,  adding [[color]], [[shading]], and [[texture (visual arts)|texturing]] of an image. It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with [[illustrating]]. However, it may be used for mere [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] of existing [[data]] regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. 

The alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as [[photography]] or [[image scanning]]. Both rendered and captured images can be [[Mixed_media|mixed]], [[image editing|edited]], or both.

==Rendering style==
'''Artistic rendering''' is the application of [[style (visual arts)|visual art style]]s to rendering. For [[photorealistic]] rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen [[art medium]] and level of [[abstraction]] in [[abstract art]].  In [[computer graphics]], interpretive rendering  styles are known as [[non-photorealistic rendering]] styles, but may be used to simplify [[technical illustration]]s. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as [[Hyperrealism (visual arts)|hyperrealistic]] rendering styles.

'''Astronomical art''' is the aspect of [[Space art]] devoted to visualizing the wonders of [[outer space]]. A major emphasis of such art is the space environment as a new frontier for Humanity. Many other works portray alien worlds, extremes of matter such as [[black hole]]s, and concepts arising from inspiration derived from [[astronomy]].

Astronomical art was largely pioneered in the 1940s and 50s by the abilities of [[Chesley Bonestell]] to solve formidable perspective problems, paint with the eye of a master [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte artist]] to create a realistic visual impression, and to seek out the greatest experts in the fields which fascinated him. His work helped inspire many in the post war era to think about space travel, which seemed fantastic before the [[V-2 rocket]]. To this day numerous artists assist in bringing ideas into presentable form in the space community, both in portraying the latest ideas on how to leave Earth and in showing wonders awaiting us out there.

Astronomical Art is the most recent of several art movements which have explored the inspirational ideas emerging from ongoing exploration of Earth, ([[Hudson River school]], or [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]]) the distant past, (ancient history and prehistoric animal art) and finally the steadily revealed universe. Most Astronomical artists use traditional painting methods or digital equivalents in a way which brings the viewer to the frontiers of human knowledge gathered in the exploration of space. Such works usually portray things in the familiar visual language of realism extrapolated to exotic environments whose details reflect ongoing knowledge and educated guesswork. An example of the process of creating astronomical art would be studying and visiting desert environments to experience something of what it might be like on Mars, and painting based on such experience. Another would be to hear of something likely to be amazing to watch close up, then seeking out published articles or experts in the field. Usually there is an artistic effort to emphasize the favorable visual elements just as a photographer composes a picture. The best astronomical art shares with the viewer what it is that catches the artists imagination about the subject portrayed.

Science Fiction magazines such as ''[[Fantasy and Science Fiction]], [[Amazing Stories|Amazing]], Astounding'' (later renamed ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]''), and ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' served as a major outlet for the work of space and particularly astronomical artists in the 1950s. The several picture essay magazines of the time such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Collier's]]'', and ''Coronet''   were other major outlets for such art. Today astronomical art can be seen in magazines such as ''[[Sky and Telescope]]'', ''[[The Planetary Report]]'' and occasionally in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Individual web sites are by far the best place to see such work today. The [[NASA fine arts program]] has been an ongoing effort to hire artists to create works generally specific to a particular space project. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070430134639/http://www1.jsc.nasa.gov/er/seh/spaceart.html This page] is primarily devoted to what has traditionally been the most successful aspect of this program, the documenting of historical events in recognizable form by professional artists. The NASA Fine Arts Program operated in the era of seemingly unlimited progress at the time of the first head of that program, James Dean, although even then pictorial realism seemed a subset rather than a dominating visual influence.

The works which document space flight situations such as those referenced above are similar in concept to government efforts during World War II to send artists to battle zones to document things as they saw it, much of which appeared in contemporary ''Life'' magazines.

Another close parallel to Astronomical art is Dinosaur art. Both art schools explore unreachable realms with the intent to bring a sense of reality to them. The 'Grand Masters' of that field such as [[Charles R. Knight]] and [[Zdeněk Burian]] worked with experts in the field, using the best available information to create a realistic vision of something we can never behold with our own eyes.  Ideally, as with Astronomical art, such a work tries to show what is known about the subject, with some educated guesswork to fill in the unknown and unknowable. We see more recent works by a healthy number of great dinosaur artists which reflect the growth in knowledge in body stances and likely feathers, etc. just as we see alien landscapes now painted which reveal the gathered knowledge instead of the craggy fantasies and the 'blue sky' Mars of yesteryear. Most of today's widely published space and astronomical artists have belonged since 1983 to the [[International Association of Astronomical Artists]][http://www.iaaa.org/].

'''Badea Cârțan''' (roughly: ''Brother Cârțan'' &amp;ndash; the common nickname of '''Gheorghe Cârțan'''; 24 January 1849 &amp;ndash; 7 August 1911) was a self-taught [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] shepherd who fought for the independence of the Romanians of [[Transylvania]] (then under [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] rule inside [[Austria-Hungary]]), distributing [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] books that he secretly brought from [[Romania]] to their villages. In all he [[Smuggling|smuggled]] some 200,000 books for pupils, priests, teachers and peasants; he used several routes to pass through the [[Făgăraş Mountains]].

He was born in [[Cârțișoara]], present-day [[Sibiu County]], the second child of poor peasants (Nicolae and Ludovica) who were former [[Serfdom|serfs]], and he spent his childhood tending sheep at the edge of his village. In between his later brushes with fame, he would always return to this activity. He became the head of his family on 2 October 1865 with the death of his father.

Cârţan first crossed the mountains into the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] with his sheep and a friend at the age of 18, and it was at that time that his interest in Romanian national unity became powerful. In 1877 he enrolled as a volunteer in the [[Romanian War of Independence]], serving until 1881. In 1895 he travelled to [[Vác]] and [[Szeged]] to visit imprisoned Romanians, including the signatories of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]''. Badea Cârțan himself was arrested twice: once because he asked the [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]]-[[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] at [[Vienna]] for Transylvania's [[self-determination]], and once because he asked the authorities for permission to sell Romanian books.

Cârțan made a journey on foot to [[Rome]], and when he arrived at the city's edge after 45 days, said, "''Bine te-am găsit, maica Roma''" ("Pleased to meet you, mother Rome"). He wished to see [[Trajan's Column]] with his own eyes, as well as other evidences of the Latin [[Origin of the Romanians|origin of the Romanian people]]. After pouring Romanian soil and wheat at the column's base, he wrapped himself in a peasant's coat (''cojoc'') and fell asleep at the column's base. The next day he was awakened by a policeman who shouted in amazement, "A [[Dacians|Dacian]] has fallen off the column!", as Cârţan was dressed just like the Dacians carved into the column; the event was reported in Roman newspapers and [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], Romanian representative in Italy, showed him around the city and introduced him to its important personalities. This January-February 1896 trip was but one of three visits to Rome; on his last, in October 1899, on the occasion of a meeting of the International Congress of [[Orientalism|Orientalists]], he laid a wreath at the column's base.

Cârțan also visited [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Egypt]] and [[Jerusalem]].


He was buried in [[Sinaia]], on soil belonging to independent Romania (Transylvania still being seven years away from its post-[[World War I]] [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|union with Romania]]); on the stone cross atop his grave is inscribed the phrase: "''Aici doarme Badea Cârțan visând întregirea neamului său''" ("Here lies Badea Cârțan dreaming of the unity of his people").

'''The Barnstormers Theatre''' is located in [[Tamworth, New Hampshire]], and is the oldest ongoing professional summer theatre in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.newhampshire.com/blogs/granite_state_stuff/archive/2008/06/03/The-Barnstormers-Theatre-announces-its-78th-season.aspx "Granite State Stuff: The Barnstormers Theatre Announces its 78th Season" New Hampshire.com]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded in 1931 by [[Francis Cleveland]], the son of twenty-second president [[Grover Cleveland]].  It is one of the only professional theatres in the United States that performs eight shows in eight consecutive weeks every summer.

== History ==
In 1931 Francis and Alice Cleveland founded the theatre company, along with their friend, Ed Goodnow.  During the summer they would lead a company of resident actors around the region, performing different plays each night.  In some cases they would literally storm barns, arriving in the afternoon to set up their scenery and lights in time for an evening performance.

After [[World War II]] the acting company purchased Kimball's Store on Main Street, across from the Tamworth Inn, and transformed the building into a theatre.  Since then the theatre's acting company has kept the rigorous schedule of rehearsing one play by day, and performing another by night, from the end of June to the beginning of September.  Francis Cleveland acted as Artistic Director until his death in 1995.

== The theatre ==
  
In 1998 The Barnstormers Theatre was renovated and winterized.  It now seats 282 patrons, is heated and air conditioned, and hosts touring performances as well as producing summer theatre.  Many of The Barnstormers' performances are classic comedies, murder mysteries, and musicals from the British and American stage.  In 2006 the Barnstormers celebrated its 75th anniversary.

A '''burial tree''' or '''burial scaffold''' is a tree or simple structure used for supporting [[corpse]]s or [[coffin]]s. They were once common among the [[Bali]]nese, the [[Naga people]], certain [[Aboriginal Australians]], and some [[North American First Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603976/tree-burial&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America First Nations==
===Burial tree===

A number of Native Americans used a burial tree as the last resting place for a dead relative, either as the general rule (along with a scaffold) or as an alternative to a grave.&lt;ref name=Wood1987&gt;Wood, W. Raymond and Thomas D. Thiessen (1987): ''Early Fur Trade on the Northern Plains. Canadian Traders Among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians, 1738-1818''. Norman and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=Bowers1991&gt;Bowers, Alfred W.(1991): ''Mandan Social and Ceremonial Organization''. Moscow.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}}

The corpse was wrapped up carefully in a [[Buffalo robe|robe]] or blankets and either placed in a fork of the tree&lt;ref name=Lowie1983&gt;Lowie, Robert H. (1983): ''The Crow Indians''. Lincoln and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} or tied to a heavy branch.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000&gt;Doyle, Susan B. (2000): ''Journeys to the Land of Gold. Emigrant Diaries from the Bozeman Trail, 1863-1866''. Helena.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} Both grown persons and small children were laid to rest in this way.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83 and 385}} A burial tree could carry more than one dead.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} Maximilian zu Wied saw burial trees with red painted trunk and branches among the Assiniboine Indians.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1927&gt;Bushnell Jr., D. I. (1927): ''Burials of the Algonquian, Siouan and Caddoan Tribes West of the Mississippi''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 83. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45-46}} It seems any tree was proper. [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|Cottonwood]]&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} is mentioned by travelers on the great plains, as well as [[pine]]&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83}} and cedar.&lt;ref name=Unrau1979&gt;Unrau, William E. (1990): ''Tending the Talking Wire. A Buck Soldier's View of Indian Country, 1863-1866''. Salt Lake City.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}} The dead could be placed from around six feet up in the tree to close to the top.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|112}} Some of the belongings of the deceased were often placed near the corpse.

===Scaffold===

A burial scaffold was usually made of four upright poles or branches, forked at the top. This foundation carried a sort of bier, where the dead body was laid to rest out of reach of wolves. The preferred location was on a hill.&lt;ref name=Doyle2000/&gt;{{rp|83}} Relatives would often place some of the belongings of the dead on the platform or around the scaffold.&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}}

[[File:Funeral scaffold of a Sioux chief 0044v.jpg|thumb|Funeral scaffold of a Sioux chief 0044v. Something like a travois basket is placed over the muffled up body. The [[Cheyenne|Cheyennes]] used now and then the same method of protecting the corpse.]]
The poles reached "a mans height above ground" (six to eight feet).&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=Darwin2004&gt;Darwin, Charles B.: "1,000 Miles From Home on the Wild Prairie". Charles B. Darwin's 1849 Nebraska Diary. ''Nebraska History.'' Vol. 85, No. 2 (Summer 2004), pp. 58-114.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}}&lt;ref name=Diaries&gt;Templeton, George M.: ''Diaries, 1866-1868''. (Typescript). The Newberry Library, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} An extraordinary high scaffold carried the corpse of a [[Dakota people|Sisseton Sioux]] an estimated 18 feet above the ground.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1927/&gt;{{rp|23}} One scaffold described had poles painted black and red in horizontal stripes.&lt;ref name=Libby1920&gt;Libby, Orin G. (1920): ''The Arikara Narrative''. Bismarck.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} An 1849 Nebraska traveler saw a scaffold made of [[Tipi|lodge poles]] rested against each other at the top and with two biers half way down.&lt;ref name=Darwin2004/&gt;{{rp|102}}

An [[Ojibwe]] man would get his arms and other personal effects with him on the scaffold along with food, eating utensils and [[tobacco]].&lt;ref name=Wood1987/&gt;{{rp|87}} This practice may have been used only as a temporarily solution when death occurred far from the common burial ground with graves and markers. Birch bark served as an option to a body wrapping of skin among the Ojibwe.&lt;ref name=Densmore1929&gt;Densmore, Frances (1929): ''Chippewa Customs''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 86.  Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}}

In the 18th century, the [[Choctaw]] placed the dead on a scaffold as a first step in a burial process. Months later, bone pickers stripped the flesh from the bones. The skeleton was then cleaned and piece by piece put in a sort of small coffin and lastly placed in the Indian city's special bone house.&lt;ref name=Bushnell1920&gt;Bushnell Jr., D. I. (1920): ''Native Cemeteries and Forms of Burial East of the Mississippi''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 71. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94}}

The personal effects of an Indian woman were laid with her in an open pine box (likely made by a carpenter) situated on a scaffold put up near [[Fort Laramie]] in 1866. The heads and tails of her two ponies were fastened to respectively the eastern and the western poles.&lt;ref name=Diaries/&gt;{{rp|21}}

Among the [[Crow Nation|Crow]], the dead was wrapped in a robe and placed on the bier with the feet to the east. Much later, the bones could be collected and placed in a rock gap.&lt;ref name=Lowie1983/&gt;{{rp|67}}

The [[Mandan]] Indians positioned the dead body on the scaffold with the feet to the southeast, so the spirit was directed to the old Mandan country around [[Heart River (North Dakota)|Heart River]], [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|99}} With the scaffold rotten and on the ground, the bones were wrapped in a hide and buried in the refuse at the Mandan village or in a riverbank.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|101}} The skull would be placed among other clan skulls arranged in circles on the ground near the scaffolds.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|100}} Newborns, who died unnamed, were not considered members of the society and hence placed in trees (or buried) away from the common burial ground outside the village.&lt;ref name=Bowers1991/&gt;{{rp|98}}

===Reasons for burials in trees and on scaffolds===

During winter, the [[Ponca]] Indians would often substitute a grave with a scaffold because the ground was frozen.&lt;ref name=Howard1965&gt;Howard, J.H (1965): ''The Ponca Tribe''. Smithsonian Institution. Bureau of American Ethnology. Bulletin 195. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} A Lakota summed up the reasons why a high scaffold outdid a grave, "(1) Animals or persons might walk over the graves; (2) the dead might lie in mud and water after rain or snow; (3) wolves might dig up the bodies and devour them."&lt;ref name=Dorsey1894&gt;Dorsey, J.O (1894): ''A Study of Siouan Cults''. Smithsonian Institution. 11th Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. 1889-'90. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|486}} With the dead placed on a scaffold or in a tree, the relatives could easily talk to the deceased.&lt;ref name=Denig1930&gt;Denig, E. T. (1930): ''The Assiniboine''. Smithsonian Institution. 46th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. 1928-'29. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|571}}

BAC was founded by amateur British colonial painters.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Okell" /&gt;  This included Kenneth Martin Ward, Professor of Physics at [[University of Yangon|Rangoon University]]; Martin Jones, Railways Commissioner who drew for the ''Rangoon Times'', and E.G.N.

==History==
[[File:Shwedagon-Pano.jpg|thumb|The Burma Art Club participated in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]]]

===Early years===
Ward became BAC's first president with architect [[Tha Tun]] acting as Secretary. Hla Aung and Mya May arranged for the teachers and students to stay at their residence. They also allowed Ward to teach art at the Boys Buddhist School, which was owned by them. Daw Mya May became known as "the mother of Myanmar artists".&lt;ref name="Zin" /&gt; BAC offered several courses such as still-life and portrait painting, as well as outdoor and indoor paintings on weekends. While the Burmese painters affiliated with the club accepted [[Depictions of nudity|realistically painted nudes]] as [[art]], very few of them attempted to paint nudity themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyunt, (snippet view), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The club was known to concentrate on system and method, earning it the nickname of "Labyrinth of Technique" amongst those in the art circle.&lt;ref name="thavibu" /&gt;

In 1920, the school expanded its classes, Ward himself taught oil painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thavibu.com/articles/ATC30.htm|title=Old Myanmar Paintings in the Collection of U Win|publisher=Thavibu|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ba Nyan, developer of the "Rangoon School",&lt;ref name="burmalibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199705/msg00643.html|title=Art|date=16 May 1997|work=burmalibrary.org|publisher=Burma Issues|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an art instructor in basic design.&lt;ref name="magicartartgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magicartartgallery.com/arthistory/?v=detail&amp;id1=23&amp;rec=P-122|title=Ba Nyan Artwork  ''The Bridge''|work=magicartartgallery.com|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that decade, club member painters, Ba Nyan and Ba Zaw, were able study in London at the Royal College of Art.&lt;ref name="Barron &amp; Okell" /&gt; Also in the 1920s, the founding members introduced students to British [[cartoon]] art.&lt;ref name="Law-Yone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkwormbooks.com/reviews/burmese-painting-law-yone/|title=Burmese Painting: A Linear and Lateral History|last=Law-Yone|first=Wendy|publisher=Britain-Burma Society|accessdate=17 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810235223/http://www.silkwormbooks.com/reviews/burmese-painting-law-yone/|archivedate=10 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Ba Nyan's return to Burma, he brought back a bold style of oil painting while Ba Zaw returned with a stylized form of transparent watercolor painting.&lt;ref name="Barron, p. 14"&gt;Barron, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Though art instruction continued at the club until World War II, some painters such as Ba Nyan began a new form instruction at their homes, that of master-apprentice training.&lt;ref name="Barron, p. 14"/&gt; The school was important in launching the careers of talented young artists such as Ba Nyan. In 1939, Ba Nyan himself became principal of the Art School.&lt;ref name=Yliopisto&gt;{{cite book |pages=74–76 |chapter=U Ba Nyan and the Burma Art Club |title=Jyväskylä studies in the arts, Issues 46-47 |author=Jyväskylä (Finland) Yliopisto |publisher=Yliopisto |year=1995 |ISBN=951-34-0442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, during the Japanese occupation, Ba Nyan led a group of artists that opened the school's successor,  the [[Burmese Academy of Art]], becoming the principal of the academy with Ba Kyi and [[San Win]] as instructors. Two years later, an English Army art club and the Burma Art Club participated together in the Japanese Post-War Art Exhibition (Services Art Exhibition) at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]].&lt;ref name="thavibu" /&gt;

==Notable alumni==
Many young Burmese artists learned to draw and paint from the British artists. Those who went on to become famous national artists include Ba Gyan, Hein Sunn, Saya Mya, Ba Zaw, and Ohn Lwin.&lt;ref name="Zaw" /&gt; Ba Gale ("Shwetalay"), was the club’s most famous alumnus. His first published cartoon appeared in the Yangon University annual in 1915,&lt;ref name="Pwint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no455/t001.htm|title=Myanmar’s first online cartoon website launched|last=Pwint|first=Zon Pann|date=26 January – 1 February 2009|work=Myanmar Times &amp; Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604185158/http://www.mmtimes.com/no455/t001.htm#|archive-date=4 June 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was a college student there. In the same year, Ba Gale's work was published in the ''Rangoon Times'', becoming the first newspaper to publish a cartoon by a Burmese artist.&lt;ref name="Zaw" /&gt; In March 1917, the very first issue of ''Thuriya'' ("The Sun"), a paper run by young nationalists, carried a Ba Gale cartoon.&lt;ref name="Pwint" /&gt;

'''''Carousel''''' is an [[internet marketing|online advertisement]] launched in April 2009 by [[Philips]] to promote [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] [[LCD television]]s. The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an [[Armored car (valuables)|armoured van]] heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding ''Carousel'' was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by  [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]]. It was directed by [[Adam Berg (director)|Adam Berg]], with production contracted to [[London]]-based [[production company]] [[Stinkdigital]]. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]]. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]'s ''[[Evolution (advertisement)|Evolution]]'' in 2007. Scenes from ''Carousel'' were used in the [[music video]] for [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[50 Cent]]'s [[single (music)|single]] "[[Ok, You're Right]]".

==Sequence==
After a credit sequence, ''Carousel'' opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked [[police car]]. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a [[station wagon]]. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|number 219]]) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning.

===Background and filming===
In January 2009, Philips announced its new [[Philips Cinema 21:9 TV|Philips Cinema 21:9]] line of [[LCD television]]s, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a [[Movie theater|cinema]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;"Philips premieres the ultimate home cinematic viewing experience with the Cinema 21:9 LCD TV", [[Philips]] ([[Press release]]), January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and [[advertising agency]] [[Tribal DDB]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a request to create an [[advertising campaign]] based around an educational website&lt;ref name="Boards3"&gt;Clarke, Christine; "[http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html Nobody Move] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916011605/http://www.boardsmag.com/articles/magazine/20090601/adamberg.html |date=September 16, 2011 }}", ''[[Boards (magazine)|Boards]]'', June 1, 2009.

Several hospitals in [[Prague]] were looked at, but with a recent outbreak of [[influenza]] in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] capital, most were unavailable.&lt;ref name="Boards5"/&gt; To speed up the location scouting, [[director of photography]] Fredrik Backar and [[post-production|post supervisor]] Richard Lyons accompanied the [[reconnaissance|recce]] teams.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt; Eventually, the team discovered an old [[communism|Communist]] university&lt;ref name="pdf"/&gt; which had been converted into a sports college, and gained permission to dress the location as a hospital.&lt;ref name="Boards5"/&gt;

At certain points during ''Carousel'', viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot.&lt;ref name="Redrum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in ''Carousel''. In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum.&lt;ref name="Boards3"/&gt;

The [[soundtrack]] to ''Carousel'' was composed by [[Michael Fakesch]]. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match.&lt;ref name="Cannes"/&gt; Other features of the microsite included an [[Ambilight]] feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

[[The Other Guys]] features a similar scene, except it shows the antics of the protagonists at a bar.

The 2013 launch trailer for the video-game [[Payday 2]] is almost definitely based on "Carousel".&lt;ref&gt;Payday 2 Launch Trailer http://www.ibtimes.com/payday-2-launch-trailer-cinematic-footage-released-celebrate-games-august-13-release-steam-1383143&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening credits scene of the 2016 movie Deadpool is based on this ad according to the blu-ray audio commentary.

'''''Cupid Making His Bow''''' (c. 1533–1535) is a painting by the Italian late [[Renaissance]] artist [[Parmigianino]]. It is housed in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]],  [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

==History==
The work appears in the inventory of Francesco Baiardo in [[Parma]], who was a friend and patron of  Parmigianino. Late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] writes that Baiardo had commissioned the '' Cupido che fabbrica di sua mano un arco''.&lt;ref name=DiGiam&gt;{{cite book|first=Mario |last=Di Giampaolo |author2=Elisabetta Fadda|title=Parmigianino|publisher= Keybook|location=[[Sant'Arcangelo di Romagna]]|year=2002|isbn=88-18-02236-9|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was inherited by  Marcantonio Cavalca and later went to  Antonio Pérez, secretary of state of [[Philip II of Spain]], who brought it with him to [[Spain]]. In 1579 Pérez fell in disgrace, and was forced to sell the painting to an envoy of emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was however blocked by the Spanish crown, and could be acquired and arrive to [[Prague]], together with [[Correggio]]'s ''[[Jupiter and Io]] '' and ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', in 1603. It was transferred to Vienna's Schatzkammer in 1631.&lt;ref name=DiGiam/&gt;

A preparatory drawing for Cupid's head is in the [[Cabinet des Dessins]] of the [[Louvre]] (n. 1662). The work was frequently copied and used as a model by numerous artists. There are copies by [[Joseph Heintz the Elder]] and [[Rubens]] in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=DiGiam/&gt;

While teaching at the Ruhr University, Galloway lectured extensively throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including regular visits to the [[Iran-America Society]] in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkenstaedt, Thomas. Anglistenspiegel. Augsburg: [s.n.], 1977. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he first met [[Farah Pahlavi]], [[Shahbanu|Empress consort of Iran]], whose staff was preparing to open the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Empress’ coronation. Galloway was hired as chief curator and with his staff assembled what is widely considered the most important collection of Western art outside of the Western world, including pieces by [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Andy Warhol]], exhibited alongside works by Iranian artists such as [[Parviz Tanavoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Dehghan, Saeed Kamali. “Former queen of Iran on assembling Tehran's art collection.” The Guardian. 1 August 2012: Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kim. “Picasso is hiding in Iran.” Los Angeles Times. 19 September 2007: Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months before the [[Iranian Revolution]], Galloway left Tehran for [[Wuppertal]], Germany, to resume his professorship in [[Bochum]].

The '''Decadent Movement''' was a late 19th-century [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[literary movement|literary]] movement, centered in [[Western Europe]], that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist [[Félicien Rops]]'s body of work and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novel ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement.

The concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher who suggested that the decline (''[[decadence|décadence]]'') of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/ccgrd_l.htm|title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline|last=Montesqieu|first=Charles-Louis de Secondat|publisher=The Free Press, New York.  Collier-Macmillan, London.|others=Translated by David Lowenthal|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Latin scholar [[Désiré Nisard]] turned toward French literature, he compared [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure.  The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Jane|date=|year=2013|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Perfume Clouds: Olfaction, Memory, and Desire in Arthur Symon's London Nights (1895)|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|page=|pages=62–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Decadent Movement ===
The first major development in French decadence would come when writers [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal "progress."&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0947757813|title=An anthology of French symbolist &amp; decadent writing|publisher=Atlas Press|year=1994|isbn=0947757813|page=12|author=Remy de Gourmont|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of [[Les Fleurs du mal|''Les Fleurs du Mal'']] and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term ''decadence'' to  include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism|last=Calinescu|first=Matei|publisher=Duke University|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 ''Les Fleurs du Mal,'' Gautier at first rejects the application of the term  decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautier|first=Theophile|year=1868|others=Collection authored by Charles Baudelaire|title=Charles Baudelaire|url=|journal=Les Fleurs du Mal|volume=|pages=|via=WikiSource (France)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was Belgian, [[Félicien Rops]] was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement.  A friend of Baudelaire,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Censorship Effect: Baudelaire, Flaubert, and the Formation of French Modernism|last=Olmsted|first=William|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=9780190238636|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself.  Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror.  He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendahl, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barrès, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello|last=Huneker|first=James|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=0404105254|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Kindle Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imaginatio|last=Classen|first=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0415180740|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle|last=Adams|first=Jad|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2008|isbn=1845116844|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry "requires a strong stomach."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Baudelaire: A Study|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=Eklin Matthews|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as ''Decadents.'' He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by [[Gothic novel]]s and the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Many were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], others with [[Aestheticism]].&lt;ref name="Stephan1974"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRoNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|title=Paul Verlaine and the Decadence, 1882-90|first=Philip|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1974|isbn=978-0-7190-0562-6|location=|page=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Stephan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/symbolist/texts/decadence_chronology.html A Chronology], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir1995"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOb26cxGBfMC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Decadence and the Making of Modernism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87023-992-2|page=16|author=David Weir|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pursuit of these authors, according to [[Arthur Symons]], was "a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life," and their achievement, as he saw it, was "to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/sponsor/balvenie/arthur-symons.1.html|title=The Decadent Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|date=1893|website=Harpers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1884 decadent novel ''[[À rebours|À Rebours]] (''English, ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain''), [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure.  He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], Theodore Hannon, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].  His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with "insidious delight" as they used a "secret language" to explore "twisted and precious ideas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only did ''Against Nature'' define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art.  The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jan Luyken]], and [[Odilon Redon]].  None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement.  Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world.  It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valazza|first=Nicolas|year=2010|others=Edited by Amaleena Damle and Aurelie L'Hostis|title=The Flower and the Monster: On Huysmans' Painters|url=|journal=The Beautiful and the Monstrous: Essays in French Literature, Thought and Culture|series=Modern French Identities|volume=|page=96|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine ''Le Décadent'' in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way.  This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and ''Le Décadent,'' even including some who had been published in its pages.  Rival writer [[Jean Moréas]] published his [[Symbolist Manifesto]], largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage.  Moréas and [[Gustave Kahn]], among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915|last=Somigli|first=Luca|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2003|isbn=1442657731|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju.  After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of ''Le Décadent'' publishing works falsely attributed to [[Arthur Rimbaud]], however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations.  Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque.  Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in ''Le Décadent'' include [[Albert Aurier]], [[Rachilde]], Pierre Vareilles, [[Miguel Hernández|Miguel Fernandez]], [[Jean Lorrain]], and [[Laurent Tailhade|Laurent Tailhaide]].  Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) or  Baudelaire's ''Les Fleur du Mal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiocleo.com/librarie/baudelaire/essay.html ''Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement''] by [[Paul Bourget]], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when ''Le Décadent'' closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave [[Octave Mirbeau|Mirbeau]], but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1997|isbn=9780226224817|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty.  In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of [[fin de siècle]], or end-of-the-century gloom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as [[David Weir (academic)|David Weir]], regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Weir1995" /&gt;

=== Distinction from Symbolism ===
[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]], as rebellions against realism.  He defined this common, decadent thread as, "an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity."  He referred to all such literature as, "a new and beautiful and interesting disease."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an "interlude, half a mock interlude" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Symbolist Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=E. P. Dutton|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature.  They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist.  Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Only a year later, however, [[Jean Moréas]] wrote his [[Symbolist Manifesto]] to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and ''Le Décadent''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to  blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism.  In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to [[Félicien Rops]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and Fernand Khnopff as "Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Decadent Tales|last=Romer|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=0199569274|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called "dissidents" for remaining in the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Philip|year=1972|title=Naturalist Influences on Symbolist Poetry, 1882-86.|url=|journal=The French Review|volume=46|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's [[Stanford University]] course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildedecadence.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-differences-between-symbolism-and-decadence/|title=The Differences between Symbolism and Decadence|date=2014-03-03|website=Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Nature ====
Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different.  Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in "Flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54372|title=Flowers|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ ''Against Nature'', for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Language and Imagery ====
Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend.  In the words of symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|year=1956|others=Translated by Bradford Cook|title=from Crisis in Poetry|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0076/mallarme.PDF|journal=Mallarmé: Selected Prose Poems, Essays &amp; Letters|volume=|pages=|via=Scan from an un-cited anthology on Amerhert's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutablesound.com/home/?p=2165|title=Symbolist Manifesto|last=Moréas|first=Jean|date=1886|website=Mutable Sound|others=Translated by C. Liszt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images.  Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]] being poisoned by a book like a drug.  Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: "The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Reality, Illusion, and Truth ====
Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society.  Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths.  In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.

In contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth.  They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing.  If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment.  The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (book)|''The'' ''Temptation of Saint Anthony'']], decadent [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror.  Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: "But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bugge|first=Peter|year=2006|title=Naked Masks: Arthur Breisky or How to Be a Czech Decadent|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/123|journal=Word and Sense: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Theory and Criticism in Czech Studies|volume=|pages=|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Word and Sense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Art ====
Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter.  According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to "esoteric primordial truths" that cannot ever be directly approached.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:
# "Art never expresses anything but itself."
# "All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals."
# "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life"
After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: "Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Wilde_1889.html|title=The Decay of Lying|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Collapse of the Decadent Movement ===
In France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents.  Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's ''Le Décadent'' for a time.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Others kept a foot in each camp.  Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for ''Le Décadent'' and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of ''Le Décadent''&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt; even though her own one-act drama ''The Crystal Spider'' is almost certainly a symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiebuzinska|first=Christine|year=1994|title=Behind the Mirror: Madame Rachilde's "The Crystal Spider"|url=|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=24|pages=28–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether.  Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider ''Against Nature'' as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them.  He left decadence for anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Decadent Movement beyond France ===
While the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly.  Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat [[Transgressive fiction|trangressive]] spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Harvard University|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Frankel|editor-first=Nicholas|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ruth|year=2015|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Always Leave Them Wanting More: Oscar Wilde's Salmoe and the Failed Cicrulations of Desire|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia'''

Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know.  They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie.  They were poor and hungry for something better.  The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable.  It was that melancholy that drove their art.  These Bohemian decadent writers included [[Karel Hlaváček]], Arnošt Procházka, [[Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic]], and Louisa Zikova.  One Czech writer, [[Arthur Breisky]], embraced the full spirit of ''Le Décadent'' with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure.  From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a [[dandy]], and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pynsent|first=Robert|year=1973|title=A Czech Dandy: An Introduction to Arthur Breisky|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britain'''
[[File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG|thumb|upright|Aubrey Beardsley, ''[[The Peacock Skirt]]'', illustration for [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', 1892]]

Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]], poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], and illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]], as well as other artists and writers associated with ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Others, such as [[Walter Pater]], resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decadent Republic of Letters: Taste, Politics, and Cosmopolitan Community from Baudelaire to Beardsley|last=Potolsky|first=Matthew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2012|isbn=0812244494|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/october/rachilde-wilde-discovery-10-21-2014.html|title=Rebellious French cross-dresser played an overlooked role in shaping Oscar Wilde's legacy, Stanford scholar says|last=Beacock|first=Ian|date=21 October 2014|website=Stanford News|others=Scholarship by Petra Dierkes-Thrun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose.

'''Russia'''

[[File:Evfimia Nosova (Ryabushinskaya) by N.Feofilaktov (1913, priv.coll).jpg|thumb|Portrait of {{ill|Euphemia Pavlova Nosova|ru|Носова, Евфимия Павловна}} by {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}]]
The Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine.  The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure.  Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death.  Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement.  The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Valery Bryusov]], and [[Zinaida Gippius]].  As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bristol|first=Evelyn|year=1980|title=Idealism and Decadence in Russian Symbolist Poetry|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=39|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury.  They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were [[Konstantin Somov]], {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}, and Nikolay Feofilaktov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowlt|first=John E.|year=1982|title=Through the Glass Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=17|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spain'''

Some art historians consider [[Francisco de Goya]] one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.
Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] with works like [[Los Pazos de Ulloa]] where terror and decadent topics appear. [[El monstruo]] (The Monster), written by [[Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent]] belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the [[Fin de Siglo Movement]] with the authors of the [[Generación del 98]] being part-decadent: [[Ramón María del Valle-Inclán]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Pío Baroja]] are the most essential figures of this period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn= 9781139000222 |location=|pages= 138|quote=|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-the-spanish-novel/decadence-and-innovation-in-fin-de-siglo-spain/DBB78766FF30C8855E20D9F9A59286B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''United States'''

Few prominent writers or artists in the [[United States]] were connected with the Decadent Movement.  Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of [[fin de siècle]] France.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes of Decadence: Literature and Place at the Fin de Siècle|last=Murray|first=Alex|publisher=Cambridge|year=2016|isbn=1107169666|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Francis Saltus Saltus]] was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation.  He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry.  At the time, mostly before Baju's ''Le Décadent'', this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine|last=Putzel|first=Max|publisher=University of Missouri|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Francis, writer [[Edgar Saltus]] had more success.  He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life.  For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decadent Culture in the United States: Art and Literature Against the American Grain, 1890 - 1926|last=Weir|first=David|publisher=State University of New York|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York.  He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place.  Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Critical studies ==
German doctor and social critic [[Max Nordau]] wrote a lengthy book entitled ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892).  It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms.  His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan.  What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of "degeneration," a neuro-pathology  that resulted in these behaviors.  It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. A.|first=|year=1895|title=Max Nordau's Degeneration|url=|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Italian art and literature critic [[Mario Praz]] completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as ''The Romantic Agony'' (1933).  The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way.  His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries.  The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mumford Jones|first=Howard|year=1936|title=Reviewed Work: The Romantic Agony. by Mario Praz, Angus Davidson|url=|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eisenhower dollar''' is a one-dollar coin issued by the [[United States Mint]] from 1971 to 1978; it was the first [[dollar coin (United States)|coin of that denomination]] issued by the Mint since the [[Peace dollar]] series ended in 1935. The coin depicts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], with both sides designed by [[Frank Gasparro]].

In 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel [[cladding (metalworking)|clad]] coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President [[Richard Nixon]], who had served as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.

Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around [[Nevada]] casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of American independence]]. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among coin collectors.

==Background==
{{further information|Peace dollar#Striking of 1964-D dollars|Coinage Act of 1965#Coin shortage}}
The silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The [[Peace dollar]], the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]]. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2842–2846}}

On August 3, 1964, [[88th United States Congress|Congress]] passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where "hard money" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=461}} The law had been passed at the urging of the [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Mike Mansfield]] (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=78}} Despite the efforts of Mint Director [[Eva Adams]] and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the [[Denver Mint]] began striking 1964-D Peace dollars{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=86}}—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 13, 1964}}

A public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965,{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=87–88}} only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] inserted a provision in the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=98–101}} That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=36}}

==Inception==
[[File:1964 Peace dollar.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint]]
In 1969, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] Mint Director [[Mary Brooks]] sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the [[Kennedy half dollar]], but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], [[Wright Patman]], who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, [[Lyndon Johnson]], to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=37}}

On March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative [[Florence Dwyer]], like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative [[Leonor Sullivan]], who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as "equal time" to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}} A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman [[Robert N. Giaimo]] to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The [[Joint Commission on the Coinage]], drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring&lt;!-- I can show it is in the Northern Hemisphere spring as the article was published on June 15 and Eisenhower died on March 28, so it had to be.  However, the source does not date the meeting closer than that.  IAR --&gt; 1969. It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|June 15, 1969}}

On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 4, 1969}} On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman [[H. R. Gross]] objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: "You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal."{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 7, 1969}} Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator [[Peter Dominick]], calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from [[Mamie Eisenhower]], recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 15, 1969}}{{sfn|''The Bulletin''|October 15, 1969}} Idaho Senator [[James A. McClure|James McClure]] stated, "It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin." On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative [[Robert R. Casey]] introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}} Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, "We came in peace for all mankind," to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.{{sfn|Ike Group|p=57}}

In March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|March 8, 1970}} The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as "a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get." {{sfn|''Spokane Daily Chronicle''|March 6, 1970}}The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=29}}

Although the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970,{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review''|March 20, 1970}} it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a [[conference committee]] and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as [[91st United States Congress|Congress]] had adjourned, not signing the bill would [[pocket veto]] it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}}{{sfn|Gilkes}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 17, 1970}}

==Design==
[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|left|The [[Apollo 11]] mission insignia served as the basis of the Eisenhower dollar's reverse.]]
For Mint Chief Engraver [[Frank Gasparro]], the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the [[Washington quarter]].{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}}

Before the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]], which numismatic historian and coin dealer [[Q. David Bowers]] finds reminiscent of [[pattern coin]]s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing, based on the [[mission patch]] conceived by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing "a stroke of genius," allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]], ''Eagle'') swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

The use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=34}} Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was "too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle,{{sfn|Ike Group|p=58}} described the final version as "pleasant looking."{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

Bowers deems the bust of Eisenhower "well modeled" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), "meant that the public would like the design."{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}} Numismatic author David Lange opines that "the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint."{{sfn|Lange}} Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and [[Lincoln cent#Lincoln Memorial design (1959–2008)|Lincoln Memorial reverse]] for the cent, "the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers."{{sfn|Lange}} Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}

==Release==
[[File:Eisenhower design.png|thumb|right|The Eisenhower dollar's design as released by the Treasury in January 1971 (probably from photographs of the galvano)]]
Two prototype dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}} However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins have been certified as prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikegroup.info/chapter34/chapter34.pdf THE LYDSTON AND CHATHAM 1971-S PROTOTYPE IKES]&lt;/ref&gt;  Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier [[reducing lathe]] to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief.{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=6–7}} Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2860, 2864}} The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the [[San Francisco Mint]]) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to [[David Eisenhower]] (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.{{sfn|''The Press-Courier''|April 1, 1971}}

[[File:Brown Ike.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1974-S "brown Ike", partially open to show the coin and holder]]
On January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced [[proof coinage|proof pieces]], with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} [[United States Mint coin sets|Mint sets]] of the circulating coinage for 1971 did not include the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}}

The first proof strikes, at San Francisco, took place in July.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} The proof pieces were sold in a plastic holder inside a brown box with a gold eagle seal; the uncirculated silver pieces were encased in pliofilm inside a blue envelope. These were dubbed "brown Ikes" and "blue Ikes" and are still known by those terms.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} On July 27, 1971, President Nixon presented the first piece to be struck to Mamie Eisenhower at a White House ceremony.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|July 28, 1971}} Sales of the 40% silver pieces were ended on October 8; the first proof coins were mailed to collectors on October 14, President Eisenhower's birthday.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

The circulation version of the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever attempted by the Mint,{{sfn|Morgan}} was released through banks on November 1, 1971. Many were obtained by collectors; there was sufficient demand that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to search through rolls in search of better specimens. An oil film was found on a large number of specimens; this was removed by collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}{{sfn|''Youngstown Vindicator''|November 4, 1971}}

From the start, the coin failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's large size, its weight, and the lack of potential uses for it.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=40}} Even so, it was successful in replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos.{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} According to numismatist Randy Camper, about 70% of Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}}&lt;!-- Essay by Camper in volume --&gt; Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, they converted few machines to take the pieces.{{sfn|Herbert}} Lange recalled, "The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them."{{sfn|Lange}}

==Production==
===Early years (1971–1974)===
[[File:1973-S Blue Ike.jpg|thumb|right|1973-S "blue Ike": envelope, pliofilm coin holder, and printed insert]]
The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what ''CoinAge'' magazine termed "near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint", the piece did not circulate.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}}  In a 1974 article for ''CoinAge'', numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, "the circulation value of the coin has been nil".{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2870}} Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 24, 1971}} More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} In May 1972, Treasury Secretary [[John Connally]], testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as "just unconscionable", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|May 11, 1972}}

The 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco. Sales dropped considerably, to just under 2.2 million specimens in uncirculated and 1.8 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2874}} The part-silver 1972-S Eisenhower dollars were available for sale by mail order, with the ordering period from May 1 to July 15 for the proof coins and August 1 to October 16 for the uncirculated version.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

With ample supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no need to order any in 1973, and none were struck for circulation.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 2, 1973}} The 1973 and 1973-D were the first Eisenhower dollars struck for inclusion in mint sets, and were, in theory, only available that way. Many 1973 and 1973-D are known in circulated condition, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were in fact released into circulation.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2877, 2880}} John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which stated that all 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were melted.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The 1973-S was struck for inclusion in base-metal proof sets, as well as for the regular "blue Ikes" and "brown Ikes". Sales of the part-silver pieces dipped to a total of just under 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for circulation in 1974, was included in mint sets and proof sets, and was available in proof and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=464}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=344, 349}} Congress ordered that some of the money from the sale of 1974-S silver pieces be used to support [[Eisenhower College]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Coin collectors felt that this set a bad precedent, but about $9 million was paid to the college between 1974 and 1978;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} yet, despite the infusion of money, the college closed its doors in 1982.{{sfn|Lange|p=24}}

The United States had issued commemorative coins between 1892 and 1954, as a means for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=581–582}}

The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the "Bicentennial"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in all would be struck in silver clad for sale to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=371}}{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=502}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=422}}

The reverse designs for the three Bicentennial coins were determined by a design competition open to the public. This competition closed in January 1974, and in March, a design submitted by 22-year-old art student Dennis R. Williams was selected for the dollar. Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the [[Liberty Bell]] superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=424}} Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=472}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|pp=424–425}} Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism in the numismatic community as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the [[Franklin half dollar]]).{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.{{sfn|Ganz|1976|pp=66–68}}

The Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=10}} The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=503}} The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=232–233}}{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=42}} The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2897}} Over 220 million were struck.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=233}} The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2854}} sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=542}}

One proof Bicentennial coin in silver clad and lacking a mint mark, similar to the dollar in the prototype set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the [[Woodward &amp; Lothrop]] department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for ''[[Coin World]]'', spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2901}}

===Final years and replacement (1977–1978)===
{{main article|Susan B. Anthony dollar}}

By 1975, the Treasury was concerned about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}} That report found that "the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight".{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=42}} In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, [[William E. Simon]], proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar.{{sfn|Ganz October 1979|p=44}} According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar simply would not circulate in the United States.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2954}}

The Mint struck pattern pieces of the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=46}}

As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, approximately 50 million per year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2914–2927}}

The new Treasury Secretary, [[Michael Blumenthal]], supported Gasparro's design in testimony before Congress; Wisconsin Senator [[William Proxmire]] dubbed Blumenthal's position a "cop-out".{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2929}} Proxmire refused to introduce the bill, which would have left the choice of design up to Blumenthal or his successor, instead introducing his own legislation to commemorate early women's rights leader [[Susan B. Anthony]].{{sfn|Ganz July 1979|pp=49, 52}} Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported [[women's lib]]. Ohio Representative [[Mary Rose Oakar]] also introduced legislation for a [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through [[95th United States Congress|Congress]] and was signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the "Susan B. Agony" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2929–2930}} Mint Director [[Stella Hackel Sims]] stated, "people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they'll become accustomed to the Susan".{{sfn|Logan October 1979|p=101}} Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2930}}

Collected by date and mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare, and a complete set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or "bag marks" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2858}} A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine [[coin grading|MS-67]] condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, "as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear."{{sfn|Reach}}

Some of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the "Friendly Eagle Pattern".{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the [[American Numismatic Association]]'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula.{{sfn|1972 varieties}} The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia—it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=7}} The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776–1976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Hicks|p=644}}

Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the [[serif]]s at the foot of the "R" in "LIBERTY" missing; this is dubbed the "peg leg" variety.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=182–184}}

In 1974 and again in 1977, the [[Denver Mint]] struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2890, 2917}} The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for "brown Ike" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated "blue Ikes", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}

Bowers notes that the [[Morgan dollar]] (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2857}} Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,

{{quote |
It stands today as the greatest achievement in clad coinage in U.S. history. It was the most technically challenging coin ever attempted&amp;nbsp; ... Researching the Eisenhower Dollar is vital for numismatic historians who want to understand what the post-silver era was like. The Eisenhower Dollar was a noble failure. In this respect, it truly is a perfect collectible coin.{{sfn|Morgan}}

'''Frederic Richard "Dickie" Sullivan'''&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 2.  Although Sullivan was sometimes credited as "Frederick" or "Fred", his birthname, as shown on his birth certificate was "Frederic Richard Sullivan".  See General Record Office index of births for the third quarter of 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes credited as "Frederick"; 18 July 1872 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1937), was an English-born American [[film director]] and actor of the [[silent film|silent era]]. He directed 34 films between 1913 and 1923. He also appeared in 29 films between 1913 and 1935.  He also acted on stage.  He was a nephew of the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].

==Early life==
Sullivan was born in [[Pimlico]] in London, England, the son of [[Fred Sullivan]] and Charlotte Louisa Lacy (1841–1885). His uncle was composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].  He had seven brothers and sisters: Amy Sophie (1863–1947), Florence Louise (1865–1891), Edith Mary (1866–1877), [[Herbert Sullivan|Herbert "Bertie" Thomas]] (1868–1928), Maud "Cissie" Helen (1870–1940), George Arthur (1874–1919) and William Lacy (1877–1902). Sullivan's father died in 1877, leaving his pregnant mother with seven children under the age of 14.  After his father's death, Sullivan's uncle Arthur visited the family often and became guardian to all of the children. In 1881, Charlotte married Captain Benjamin Hutchinson, a man 13 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883, at the urging of Charlotte's brother, William Lacy, the family emigrated to [[Los Angeles, California]], in the United States, except for Sullivan's eldest brother, Bertie, who stayed with their uncle Arthur in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlotte died in January 1885, barely a year after the move to the U.S. Sullivan's stepfather, Hutchinson, unable to cope with this loss and his responsibilities, soon returned to England, leaving the six surviving children (Edith had died) to be brought up mostly by their uncle William, with the financial support of their uncle Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, the family went on a sightseeing trip of the American West with their visiting uncle Arthur, who continued to support the family until his death in 1900 and in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 14-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career, marriage and children==
Sullivan directed at least 34 films, during the [[silent film|silent era]], between [[1913 in film|1913]] and [[1923 in film|1923]]. He also acted in at least 29 films between 1913 and [[1935 in film|1935]], including the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', and he appeared on stage, including in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, from 1905 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=100612 "Frederick Sullivan"] at the IBDB database, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan married Kate Webb in 1902, and the couple had two daughters, Helen Mary (1906–1966) and Sheila (born 1919). Kate died in 1921, and Sullivan died in [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/genealogy/fred_r.pdf Genealogy record for Frederic Richard Sullivan], 1998, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DalserfHogback.jpg|thumb|300px|A hogback in [[Dalserf]] Churchyard, Scotland. The stone was found on the site in 1897.]]
'''Hogbacks''' are [[rock (geology)|stone]] carved [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] [[sculpture]]s from 10th- to 12th-century [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. Singular hogbacks were found in [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]]. Hogbacks fell out of fashion by the beginning of the 11th century. Their function is generally accepted as [[Grave (burial)|grave]] markers.

==Geography and description==
Hogbacks take the form of recumbent monuments, generally with a curved ('hogbacked') ridge, often also with outwardly curved sides. This shape, and the fact that they are frequently decorated with 'shingles' on either side of the central ridge, show that they are stylised 'houses' for the dead. The 'house' is of a Scandinavian type. One theory is that hogbacks originated among the [[Danish people|Danish]] settlers who occupied [[northern England]] in the 870s after the fall of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. However, there is not sufficient research to prove or disprove this.

It has been suggested that the monument-type was invented about 920. There are particular concentrations of hogbacks in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cumbria]], and Govan on the Clyde- the former being their likely area of origin. Individual examples are found over a much wider area, however, from [[Derbyshire]] to Central [[Scotland]].  The presence of hogbacks in Scotland is likely due to the Forth-Clyde route, which connected York, England to Dublin. Most hogback sites in Scotland are along maritime routes.

English hogback sites do not follow this same trajectory. There are stray examples as far afield as the [[Northern Isles]], [[Orkney]] and [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;In the churchyard of [[Lanivet]] is a rare example of a hogback grave dating from Viking times.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] has a single example at [[Castledermot]], [[County Kildare]], which is similar to two hogbacks in [[Ingleby Arncliffe]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=J. T. |title=The Castledermot Hogback |journal=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland |volume=101 |issue=2 |date=1971 |pages=154–158 |JSTOR=25549768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wales also has a single example at Llanddewi Aberarth Church.

The most numerous collections are the ones preserved in St Thomas's church of [[Brompton, Hambleton|Brompton]], [[Yorkshire]]. Discovered in 1867 following the restoration of the church, six were taken to [[Durham Cathedral]] Library leaving four whole ones and fragments of others at Brompton. They are characterized by carvings of bears hugging the slabs with strapwork in their mouths. Elsewhere five are in the [[Govan Old Parish Church|parish kirk]] of [[Govan]], once a rural parish, but now part of [[Glasgow]]. There is a fine example in the visitor centre on [[Inchcolm]] island in the [[Firth of Forth]].

==Typology==
There are two main types of Hogbacks. One is the Brompton type, which is characterized by massive end beasts. The other type is the warrior's tomb, which looks more like a house. It does not have massive end beasts.&lt;ref name=Bailey &gt;Bailey, R. N. (1980). ''Viking Age Sculpture in Northern England'', London: Collins Archaeology {{ISBN|0-00-216228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the two main groups of hogback styles are smaller subsets. The scroll type hogback is a subset of the warrior's tomb type. It is characterized by scroll motifs on the horizontal band below the tegulation.&lt;ref name=Lang &gt;Lang, James T. "Hogback monuments in Scotland." In Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 105, 1972, pp. 206-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hogbacks at Govan==
Govan sits on the south bank of the Clyde River. It has the four largest known hogbacks. There are five hogbacks at Govan Parish Church. The earliest has been dated to the mid-tenth century. It has two rows of tegulation with concave, contoured lines. It has a band of interlace beneath the rows of shingles. The interlace pattern is not the same on either side. It is not continuous on either side. This is the only hogback at Govan with stopped-plait interlacing. The stopped plait on this hogback is characterized by a series of small, separated elements with pellet fillers. It also has a running ring-knot interlace with frets. On the other side, the sections of four-cord plait are stylistically reduced to a contoured diagonal bar crossed with a bar and four small pellets flanking it.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

The later four hogbacks at Govan are dated to the end of the 10th century. The longest hogback at Govan does not have the decorative motifs that its earlier brother has. It is covered in rows of shingles, but they are not contoured. It is wider with a shallower roof pitch. The third hogback is massive. It has a full-bodied, 3-dimensional end-beast with legs. This single animal straddles the monument from one end to the other. The fourth hogback is also characterized by a single end-beast. Its head faces outward, an uncommon feature in hogbacks. The animal's four bent legs point toward its head. The roof ridges resemble a spine and the rows of tegulation are like scales. The fifth hogback has two end-beasts, one at either end. The beasts' faces and bodies are shown in profile with jaws gaping open, their legs intersecting along the base. This is the only known hogback with end-beasts in this position.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

'''Inbal Dance Theater''' ({{lang-he|תאטרון מחול ענבל}}, ''Teatron Makhol Inbal'') is Israel's first and oldest modern dance company. In August 2014, Barak Marshall, former house choreographer of the Batsheva Dance Company and son of [[Margalit Oved]], the company's star dancer and artistic director from 1994-1996, was appointed as the new artistic director of both the company and the Inbal World Arts Centre.

==History==
[[Image:Inbal 1956.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the Inbal Dance Theater troupe, 1956]]

The company was founded in 1949 by [[Israel Prize]] recipient [[Sara Levi-Tanai]]. Under the mentorship of [[Jerome Robbins]]—who staged many of the company’s largest works—Inbal toured internationally to critical acclaim performing in prestigious venues such as the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], the [[Théâtre de la Ville|Sarah Bernhardt Theatre]] in [[Paris]], [[London]]'s [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], Her Majesty’s Theatre in Australia and La Scala de Milano.  Most of the company's early works were built around [[Margalit Oved]], the principal dancer for the first 15 years. About Margalit [[Martha Graham]] wrote, "She never comes on the stage for me to see her that tears do not come to my eyes. She has a quality which is very, very, very special in the world...It is special wherever a great being dominated by a passion comes to the stage.”

The Inbal troupe appeared on American television on November 22, 1959 on [[NBC]]'s [[Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]. Inbal's dancers participated in [[George Stevens]]' epic 1965 film "[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]" starring [[Max Von Sydow]]. In 1979, the company performed "A Legend in the Sands." The music was written by [[Yoni Rechter]], who also composed the music for "Jaffa is Sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/1.558260 Yoni Rechter, still profound after all these years, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company received numerous awards including Best Choreography at the 1962 Les Halles International Choreography Competition in Paris.

The company rehearses and performs at the Inbal Theatre which is located on the campus of the [[Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater|Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theatre]] in [[Neve Tzedek]], [[Tel Aviv]].

'''James Martin Fenton''' [[FRSL]] [[FRSA]] (born 25 April 1949, [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]) is an English poet, journalist and literary critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669373/James-Fenton-21st-century-renaissance-man.html |title=James Fenton: 21st century renaissance man |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2013-11-29 |location=London |first=David |last=Jenkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]].

==Life and career==
Born in Lincoln, Fenton grew up in [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], the son of Canon [[John Fenton (priest)|John Fenton]], a noted [[Biblical criticism|biblical scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/4177274/Canon-John-Fenton.html |title=Canon John Fenton |work=Telegraph |date= 8 January 2009|accessdate=2013-11-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the [[Durham Choristers School]], [[Repton School|Repton]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1970.&lt;ref Name="CW"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/james-fenton |title=Professor James Fenton |website=British Council Literature |publisher=[[British Council]] |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton acquired at school an enthusiasm for the work of [[W. H. Auden|W.H. Auden]]. At Oxford [[John Fuller (poet)|John Fuller]], who happened to be writing ''A Reader's Guide to W.H. Auden'' at the time, further encouraged that enthusiasm. Auden became possibly the greatest single influence on Fenton's own work.

In his first year at university Fenton won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for his [[sonnet]] sequence ''Our Western Furniture''.&lt;ref Name="CW"/&gt; Later published by Fuller's Sycamore Press, it largely concerns the cultural collision in the 19th century between the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. It displays in embryo many of the characteristics that define Fenton's later work: technical mastery combined with a fascination with issues that arise from the Western interaction with other cultures. ''Our Western Furniture'' was followed by ''Exempla'', notable for its frequent use of unfamiliar words, as well as commonplace words employed in an unfamiliar manner.

Whilst studying at Oxford, Fenton became a close friend of [[Christopher Hitchens]], whose memoir ''[[Hitch-22]]'' is dedicated to Fenton and has a chapter on their friendship. Hitchens praised Fenton's extraordinary talent, stating that he too believed him to be the greatest poet of his generation. He also expounded on Fenton's modesty, describing him as infinitely more mature than himself and [[Martin Amis]]. Fenton and Hitchens shared a house together in their third year, and continued to be close friends until Hitchens's death. Fenton read his poem 'For Andrew Wood' at the ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' Hitchens memorial service.

His first collection, ''Terminal Moraine'' (1972) won a [[Eric Gregory Award|Gregory Award]].&lt;ref Name="CW" /&gt; With the proceeds he traveled to [[East Asia]], where he wrote of the U.S. withdrawal from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and the end of the [[Lon Nol]] regime in [[Cambodia]] which presaged the rise of [[Pol Pot]]. ''The Memory of War'' (1982) ensured his reputation as one of the greatest war poets of his time.&lt;ref Name="CW"/&gt;

Fenton returned to London in 1976. He was political correspondent of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', where he worked alongside Christopher Hitchens, [[Julian Barnes]] and Martin Amis.&lt;ref Name="CW" /&gt; He became the Assistant Literary Editor in 1971, and Editorial Assistant in 1972.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt; Earlier in his journalistic career, like Hitchens, he had written for ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', the weekly paper of the British [[trotskyist]] group then known as the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|International Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campion |first=Peter |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=2157 |title=James Fenton |publisher=The Poetry Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenton  was an occasional [[war reporter]] in Vietnam during the late phase of the [[Vietnam War]] which ended in 1975. His experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia from summer 1973 form a part of ''All the Wrong Places'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiabythebook.thingsasian.com/2008/06/16/all-the-wrong-places-adrift-in-the-politics-of-the-pacific-rim-by-james-fenton-atlantic-monthly-press/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220633/http://asiabythebook.thingsasian.com/2008/06/16/all-the-wrong-places-adrift-in-the-politics-of-the-pacific-rim-by-james-fenton-atlantic-monthly-press/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-04 |title=All the Wrong Places: Adrift in the Politics of the Pacific Rim by James Fenton (Atlantic Monthly Press) « Asia by the Book |publisher=Asiabythebook.thingsasian.com |date=2008-06-16 |accessdate=2013-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Korte Represented Reporters: Images of War Correspondents in Memoirs and ... 2009 - Page 17 "The poet James Fenton, for instance, was an occasional war reporter in Vietnam during the late phase of the war.

Am I wrong, or is All the Wrong Places also Fenton's journey to the end of the revolutionary socialist night"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 Fenton accompanied his friend [[Redmond O'Hanlon]] to Borneo. A description of the voyage can be found in the book ''Into the Heart of Borneo''.

Fenton won the [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] in 1984 for ''Children in Exile: Poems 1968-1984''. He was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry in 1994, a post he held till 1999.&lt;ref name=jf/&gt; He was awarded the [[Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry]] in 2007. The American composer [[Charles Wuorinen]] set several of his poems to music, and Fenton served as librettist for Wuorinen's opera ''Haroun and the Sea of Stories'' (2001), based on [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel.

He has said, "The writing of a poem is like a child throwing stones into a mineshaft. You compose first, then you listen for the reverberation." In response to criticisms of his comparatively slim 'Selected Poems' (2006), Fenton warned against the notion of poets churning out poetry in a regular, automated fashion.

Fenton has been a frequent contributor to ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesfenton |title=James Fenton |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= 11 June 2008|accessdate=2013-11-29 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nybooks.com/contributors/james-fenton-2/|title=James Fenton|publisher=New York Review of Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also writes the head column in the editorials of each Friday's "[[Evening Standard]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/columnistarchive/James%20Fenton-columnist-1245-archive.do |title=James Fenton - London Evening Standard |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905054255/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/columnistarchive/James%20Fenton-columnist-1245-archive.do |archivedate= 5 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he appeared in a list of the "100 most influential gay and lesbian people in Britain" published by ''The Independent on Sunday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |title=Gay Power: The pink list - This Britain - UK - The Independent |publisher=News.independent.co.uk |date=2006-07-02 |accessdate=2013-11-29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107115957/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article1153578.ece |archivedate=7 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenton's partner is [[Darryl Pinckney]], the prize-winning novelist, playwright and essayist perhaps best known for the novel ''High Cotton'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Jenkins 12:17AM GMT 18 Nov 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3669373/James-Fenton-21st-century-renaissance-man.html |title=James Fenton: 21st century renaissance man |publisher=Telegraph |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre influence===
Fenton has been influenced in his writing by musical theatre, as evidenced in 'Here Come the Drum Majorettes' from ''Out of Danger'':

&lt;poem&gt;"Gleb meet Glubb.
Glubb meet Glob.
God that's glum, that glib Glob dig.
'Dig that bog!'
'Frag that frog.'
Stap that chap, he snuck that sig.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Neil Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (2002) p. 185–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

He was the original English librettist for the musical of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' but [[Cameron Mackintosh]], finding his lyrics uninvolving, replaced him with [[Herbert Kretzmer]]; Kretzmer has credited him with creating the general structure of the adaptation.&lt;ref name="Tims"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tims|first1=Anna|title=How we made Les Misérables|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/feb/18/how-we-made-les-miserables|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless received credit for "additional lyrics" and considerable royalties.&lt;ref name="Poet who banks on Les Miserables"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Hayden|title=Poet who banks on Les Miserables|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12700449.Poet_who_banks_on_Les_Miserables/|website=The Herald|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalo Dungar''' or '''Black Hill''' is the highest point in [[Kutch]], [[Gujarat]], India, at 462 m.  It is located at 97 km from District headquarters of [[Bhuj]] and 25 km from nearest town [[Khavda]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=34&amp;webpartid=42]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://bichhubooti.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/the-jackals-and-legend-of-kalo-dungar/ The Jackals and Legend of Kalo Dungar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZRLGZNZEoEC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=kalo+dungar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DczQTZLaIc7irAep9anCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kalo%20dungar&amp;f=false KALO DUNGAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is probably the only place in Kachchh from where a panoramic view of the [[Great Rann of Kutch]] is possible. Since it is located very near to the Pakistan border, there is an Army post at the top; beyond here, only military personnel are allowed.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

The Kalo Dungar is also famous for a 400-year-old [[Dattatreya]] temple. Legend says that when Dattatreya walked on the earth, he stopped at the Black Hills and found a band of starving jackals. Being a god, he offered them his body to eat and as they ate, his body continually regenerated itself. Because of this, for the last four centuries, the priest at the temple has prepared a batch of [[prasad]], cooked rice, that is fed to the jackals after the evening [[aarti]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

Another, legend has it that there was once a holy man named Lakkh Guru residing at Kala Dungar and worshiping the Lord Dattatreya. He used to feed wild jackals. There came a day when he found he had no food, so cutting-off a part of his body he offered it to the jackals, saying, “Le ang!’ (Take body part). Over the centuries, this got corrupted to ‘Long’.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

A strange phenomenon was observed at Kalo Dungar, when some visitors noticed that their vehicles were hurtling down the hill at speeds over 80 km/h even with the ignition switched off.  The team of experts from the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), and Institute of Seismological Research, [[Gandhinagar]] and [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]] studied the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-26/ahmedabad/28256947_1_gsdma-rann-utsav-phenomenon Experts set to probe mystery roll-down at Kalo Dungar] TIMES OF INDIA, DEC 26,2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is concluded that the vehicle hurtle down fast due to the more gradient of the slope.&lt;ref name="Kaushik 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kaushik | first=Himanshu | title=Nothing magnetic about Kala Dungar | website=The Times of India | date=20 October 2011 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Nothing-magnetic-about-Kala-Dungar/articleshow/10421349.cms | accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Secretary-General''' is the head of the [[United Nations Secretariat|Secretariat]], one of the principal divisions of the [[United Nations]]. Many of the individuals who have served as the world body's top office have written memoirs, either before, during or after their terms of office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9594">Some of these '''horn techniques''' are not unique to the [[French horn|horn]], but are applicable to most or all wind instruments.''

== Stopped horn ==
This is the act of fully closing off the bell of the instrument with either the right hand or a special [[Mute (music)#Stop (stopping)|stopping mute]]. This results in producing a somewhat nasal sound. When required, in the sheet music the usual notation is a '+' above the note followed by a 'o' above notes that are to be played open. For longer stopped passages, the word  indicating a stopped horn is written out.

The pitch lowers gradually when the hand is placed in the bell and slowly moved inward.  When the bell is completely covered (stopped), the pitch falls to a half-step above the next lower [[Harmonic series (music)|partial]] (harmonic). For example, playing a middle C (F-horn, open) and gradually covering the bell into stopped horn, the pitch will lower a major 3rd to A{{music|flat}} (or 1/2 step above G, the next lower partial). However, playing a 3rd space C (F-horn, open) and repeating the stopped horn, the pitch will lower a half-step to a B-natural (or 1/2 step above B{{music|flat}}, the next lower partial).  The hand horn technique developed in the classical period, with music pieces requiring the use of covering the bell to various degrees to lower the pitch accordingly. [[Mozart]]'s [[Horn Concertos (Mozart)|four Horn Concertos]], [[Concert Rondo]] and Morceau de Concert were written with this technique in mind, as was the music both [[Beethoven]] and [[Brahms]] wrote for the horn. 

Some modern composers have incorrectly notated that the horn is to bend an open pitch upward to a stopped pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Norman del Mar, Anatomy of the Orchestra p244&lt;/ref&gt; This is impossible. The horn pitch can only be bent downward into a stopped pitch. It is believed that players play the next harmonic higher without realising and this has given rise to this erroneous belief.

There is also an effect that is occasionally called for, usually in French music, called "echo horn", "hand mute" or "''sons d'écho''" (see [[Paul Dukas|Dukas]]'s ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'') which is like stopped horn, but different in that the bell is not closed as tightly.  The player closes the hand enough so that the pitch drops 1/2 step, but, especially in the middle register, this is not closed as tightly as for stopped horn. Consequently, when playing echo horn, the player fingers one half step higher.

Also, the hand can be partially inserted into the bell in such a fashion as to lower the pitch of the horn one [[quarter tone]], an [[extended technique]] used in some modern compositions today.

== Handhorn technique ==
Before the advent of the valve horn, a player would increase the number of playable notes beyond the normal [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] by changing the position of his/her hand in the [[bell (wind instrument)|bell]]. It is possible to use a combination of stopping, hand-muting (3/4 stopping), and half-stopping (to correct notes that would otherwise be out of tune) to play almost every note of a mid-range [[chromatic scale]] on one fingering. Most modern pieces for hand-horn tend to spend more time in the higher ranges, as there are more notes that can be played naturally (without altering hand position and maintaining pure tone) above the 8th note of any harmonic series. The most well known natural hornist virtuoso who was in the classical period was [[Giovanni Punto]], which is said to have been able to play 'anything' on his natural horn

== Transposition ==
Many older pieces for horn were written for a horn not keyed in F as is standard today. As a result, a requirement for modern orchestra hornists is to be able to read music directly in these keys. This is most commonly done by [[transposition (music)|transposing]] the music on the fly into F. A reliable way to transpose is to liken the written notes (which rarely deviate from written C, D, E, F, G, and occasionally A) to their counterparts in the scale the F horn will be playing in.

Commonly seen transpositions include:

* '''B{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''A''' — up a [[major third]]
* '''G''' — up a [[major second]]
* '''E''' — down a [[minor second]]
* '''E{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major second]] (used for horn on pitches with multiple sharps until Richard Strauss)
* '''D''' — down a [[minor third]]
* '''C''' — down a [[perfect fourth]]
* '''B{{music|flat}} basso''' — down a [[perfect fifth]]

Some less common transpositions include:
* '''A{{music|flat}} alto''' — up a [[minor third]] (used in Schubert`s 4th symphony, 2nd movement)
* '''F{{music|sharp}}''' — up a [[minor second]]
* '''D{{music|flat}}''' — down a [[major third]] (used in some works by [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]])
* '''B''' — down a [[tritone]] (used by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]])


It has been speculated that one of the reasons Brahms wrote for horn in the awkward key of B(♮) was to encourage the horn players to use the natural horn; he did not like the sound of the new valved horns and wrote all his horn parts playable for natural horn, same as [[Carl Maria von Weber]] did.

Sometimes it is unclear as to whether a piece should be transposed up or down (i.e. B{{music|flat}} alto versus B{{music|flat}} basso when only B{{music|flat}} is written). Various factors can be taken into account when choosing e.g. which direction keeps the music in the horn's normal range. Also the history of the composer can be used. For Haydn symphonies which include trumpet parts, the lower transposition for the horns is usually correct; otherwise, the high transposition is usually correct. Sometimes multiple pitches were used to get a greater number of available tones. This is especially true for works in minor keys to be able to play the minor third (e.g. [[Symphony_No._40_(Mozart)|Mozart Symphony Nr. 40]])

== Double and triple tonguing ==
Normal tonguing consists of interrupting the air stream by tapping the back of the front teeth with the tongue as said in the syllables 'da', 'ta', 'doo', or 'too'. Double tonguing consists of alternating between the 'ta' and the 'ka' sounds or between the 'da' and 'ga' sounds.  The tongue makes the same movement as if the player is repeatedly saying 'kitty' or 'ticket.'  Triple tonguing is most used for patterns of three notes and is made with the syllables 'ta-ta-ka', 'ta-ka-ta', or 'da-ga-da.'

== Lip trill ==

A lip trill is a rapid oscillation between neighboring harmonics - used primarily for whole-step trills from second-line G up approximately an octave.  Lip trills are possible both lower and higher, but much lower than E and the harmonics are too far apart for a whole step, and much higher and harmonics are too narrow. Many books give fingering charts for lip trills, but the double horn gives further options. In his book "The Horn", Barry Tuckwell also gives a fingering chart of possible 'faux' 1/2 step lip trills.

== Multiphonics ==
[[Multiphonics]] is the act of producing more than one pitch simultaneously on the horn. To do this, one note is produced as normal while another is sung. One of its earliest uses occurs in the [[Concertino for Horn and Orchestra (Weber)|Concertino for Horn and Orchestra]] by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (Norman del Mar believed these chords to be impossible to play &lt;ref&gt;Norman Del Mar, Anatomy of the orchestra p260&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another kind of multiphonics can be achieved by simultaneously playing two neighbouring notes of the harmonic series.

== Circular breathing ==
Information on this subject can be found at the article on [[circular breathing]].

== Quick valve water emptying ==
Horns tend to fill with water. It may appear that all of the valve tubes will require disassembling. By holding the horn so the bell is up in the air, holding down the third valve and flipping the first and second while rotating the horn back to the normal position, all of the water in the valves is now in the third valve tubings.

== Fake high C ==
On some horns, depending on the type of valves fitted, a high F' (concert pitch) can sound out while pressing the first valve of the F side down halfway.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Fake high D ==
A high D can be obtained by pulling out completely the first tuning slide of the F-horn.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Slide lubrication ==
Normally expensive slide greases are used to lubricate the slides. Sometimes petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) is used in lieu. This is not a recommended practice since the rotary valve oil can dissolve and wash the jelly into the valves. Anhydrous lanolin is considered a better alternative.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Ernő Zórád Prize ==
Honoring a comic creator's outstanding yearly achievement. The prize was first awarded at the 100th anniversary of Ernő Zórád's birth with the contribution of the artist's family.
* 2011: Attila Futaki

== Kepregeny.net Audience Polls ==
Every year since 2006, Kepregeny.net gives place to the annual audience polls to record comic book fans' opinion on the preceding year's crop. These polls cover many topics, not only Hungarian comics, but also translated materials, journalists, etc. In the first two years the polls were held on the portal's forum, in 2008 it moved to its opening page.&lt;br/&gt;
Note: the year given in each poll refers to the year the comics were published (in contrary to the Alfabéta prize, where the year refers to date the prize was given.)

'''''Man of Sorrows''''' is a small  [[Early Netherlandish]] oil on wood panel painting completed c. 1485-1495. It is attributed to [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] and in the tradition of the devotional images of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which typically show Christ before his crucifixion, naked above the waist, bearing the wounds of his [[passion of Jesus|Passion]]. The panel has an unusually complex and suffocating spatial design, and depicts the [[mocking of Jesus]], and his [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|grieving mother]].&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire; Rosen, 348&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is steeped in both complex iconography and deep pathos. Christ is in obvious pain and holds his wounds up for the viewer. He looks out while  white robed weeping angels bear the [[Arma Christi]] -objects associated with his crucifixion and death- float around him. The attending saints include Mary and the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalene]].

''Man of Sorrows'' has been described as "one of the most moving...in Early Netherlandish art", and is usually considered a highly emotive and sorrowful work, especially in its description of Christ's  pitiful, almost defeated expression and blood-run face.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about the lost right hand panel; it may have contained another religious scene or a [[donor portrait]].&lt;ref name="R150" /&gt; It is housed in the [[Museum Catharijneconvent]], [[Utrecht]].

==Devotional type==
[[File:Israhel van Meckenem the Younger - Man in sorrow - WGA14734.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Israhel van Meckenem the Younger]], ''Vera icon'', engraving, c. 1490. [[Staatliche Museen, Berlin]]]]
The panel is in the tradition of the iconic devotional image of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", which developed in Europe from the 13th century, and was especially popular in Northern Europe. The phrase, in the passages of [[Isaiah 53]] (''[[Servant songs]]'') in the [[Hebrew Bible]], translates into English as "Man of Sorrows" ("vir dolorum" in the [[Vulgate]]):
&lt;small&gt;

3) He is despised and rejected of men, a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.  

4) Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 

5) But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.

6) All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=53&amp;version=48 |title=21st Century King James Version |work=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

In such works the viewer is asked to stand before the wounded and maimed, half naked body of Christ, and contemplate and contemplate and take responsibility for his sufferings.&lt;ref name="d69"&gt;Decker (2008), 69&lt;/ref&gt; Geertgen's depiction differs from previous iconographical depictions in that Christ's head is raised, and he looks directly at the viewer.&lt;ref name="d63"&gt;Decker (2008), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Geertgen Man van smarten (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|Detail with angel overcome by grief]]
Christ stands in his tomb, a stone [[sarcophagus]].&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; His entire body is lacerated and deformed by wounds sustained during his [[Flagellation of Christ|flogging]].&lt;ref name="d61"&gt;Decker (2008), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he not clearly dead, as in earlier depictions. His eyes stare directly at the viewer, a device identified by the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] as referring to the biblical text "Behold what I have suffered for you; what have you suffered for me".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1953), 124&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture was earlier identified by art historian [[Alois Riegl]] as evoking an "external unity" where Christ's gaze becomes one with the viewer's world.&lt;ref name="R153"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 153&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Wouter Slob writes that Christ's expression "confronts the contemporary viewer with the consequences of ''His'' sinning; the blood, splashing from the panel, flows because of his guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Slob, 40&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite Christ's apparent agony, his animated, half-standing, half-kneeling pose in his sarcophagus seems to reference his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. He may be equally descending into or our the tomb.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

To his left, [[Mary Magdalene]] kneels in prayer. Her arms rest on the sarcophagus, her eyes are downcast, her plaintive expression is a study of grief. At the foot of the cross, Jesus' [[Mary, mother of Jesus|mother, Mary]], laments with arms folded, as large drops of tears pour down her face.&lt;ref name="S29" /&gt; She is supported by [[John the Evangelist]] with only his head and hands visible, wiping his tears with the back of his hand.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A motif borrowed from [[Robert Campin]]'s ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]''. See Barasch, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Angels dressed in white robes, their eyes swollen with tears, carry the remaining [[Arma Christi]], including the lance, [[Holy Sponge]] and the [[Nail (relic)|three nails from the cross]].&lt;ref name="b22"&gt;Bara, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
===Mourners===
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Detail of [[Mary Magdalene]]]]
A number of saints and angels are openly weeping, imbuing the Passion with very human qualities, and expressive of emotional turmoil.&lt;ref name="b26"&gt;Barasch, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the employment of tears is reflective of Geertgen's tendency towards emotionalism, but may also have been to intended to invoke [[contrition]], forcing the viewer to view Christ's sufferings individual terms, and reflect on their own [[original sin|culpability]]. Church theology of the time encouraged compassion for Christ's suffering, while emphasising that mankind was the source of his torments. According to art historian John Decker, medieval "sermons and devotional tracts encouraged the faithful to study the broken body of Christ, to tally his wounds, and to bear always in mind that humankind's various sins caused each injury."&lt;ref name="d68"&gt;Decker (2008), 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The scene allowed viewers "opportunities to interact empathetically with sacred history"; and encouraged [[contrition]] and [[penitence]],&lt;ref name="d65"&gt;Decker (2008), 65&lt;/ref&gt; an approach reflected in works by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], later adopted by Geertgen.&lt;ref name="d59-63"&gt;Decker (2008), 59-63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans - Man of Sorrows - WGA08517 Detail2.jpg|400px|thumb|Detail showing [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], with a tear on her cheek]]
The use of tears to denote grief was probably derived from Rogier, who fascinated by tears, refined a subtle formula for the depiction of crying,&lt;ref name="b22" /&gt; as can be seen especially his Madrid ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' of c. 1435.&lt;ref name="b27"&gt;Barasch, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary has a large tear pouring down her cheek, which art historian Moshe Barasch describes as "painted with subtle shadows to give it material substance, with reflections and a highlight to make it transparent and shiny", and compares its rendering to that of jewelry or glass.&lt;ref name="b26" /&gt;

In some instances the tears are implied by a hand gesture rather than actually shown. This is again influenced by Rogier's ''Descent'', but originates from Campin's ''Entombment'', where a figure is implied to be crying by the fact that he wipes his face with the back of his hand, a technique Rogier borrowed and perfected some 20 years later.&lt;ref name="b23"&gt;Barasch, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crucifixion===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Deposition (detail) - WGA25578.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Detail from [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The panel shows Christs tortured body at his resting place on [[Calvary]], still carrying the torment of his [[True Cross|wooden cross]], his knees buckling from its weight.&lt;ref name="R152"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 152&lt;/ref&gt; The painting contains many symbols of his Passion.&lt;ref name="d59"&gt;Decker (2008), 59&lt;/ref&gt; He wears the [[Crown of Thorns]]; its spikes spill blood across his face. His arms are heavily lacerated by what appear to be [[Scourging of Jesus|whip marks]], and he weakly raises his right hand to display the deep [[Five Holy Wounds|wound]] to his side, where according to [[Bible|scripture]], he was pierced by a [[Holy Lance|lance]] after his death on the cross.&lt;ref name="R150"/&gt; In 1927, Panofsky identified the panel in the tradition of iconic devotional depictions (''[[andachtsbilder]]'') of the "[[Man of Sorrows]]", noting especially its focus on the sacrificial aspect of the Passion and the its unflinching, yet emotive depiction of physical suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 248&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some respects the work is unsophisticated; composed mainly from simplified geometric forms, while there is not much differentiation in the oval, idealised faces of the female figures. The clothes of any of the figures are not especially detailed; their volume and texture only suggested by the heavy folds.&lt;ref name="R152" /&gt; However, it is highly regarded for its complex and innovative composition, with many of the elements presented at oblique angles. It is very tightly cropped, for the era it was produced, cutting off the Magdalene and Evangelist would have been considered daring.&lt;ref name="R150"&gt;Ridderbos et al (2005), 150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
[[File:Triptych-with-the-entombment-of-christ-1822 (detail).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Robert Campin]], ''[[Seilern Triptych|Entombment]]'', c. 1410-15. [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London]] 
The work is attributed to Geertgen tot Sint Jans mainly for its typically simplified geometric shapes, and similarity to his ''The Lamentation of Christ''; a painting in which the faces and expressions of Mary and John bear striking similarity to the present work. The attribution was accepted by both Friedländer and Panofsky. Especially Panofsky was enthusiastic about the panel, but Friedländer did not hold it in high regard. He praised the description of the Virgin, especially her face and hands, and described the depiction of the Magdalene as "realistic...with such carefully observed shadows" and "among the masters best work". However he found the figure of Christ to be "traditional", and wrote that the "absence of spatial elaboration overall is felt to be all the more vexing". Overall the image, he believed, lacked depth of field and compositional balance.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

Panofsky, although he generally admired Friedländer's analysis, disagreed strongly, and in a 1927 treatise on Netherlandish depictions of the "Man of Sorrows" wrote, "As, however, all the seemingly haphazard composition lines lead with compelling force to the face of the Savior, which, lifted out of the image, focuses its large, tearful eye on us, the sum of all the sorrows which he suffers, and all of the mourning that is suffered for him, now appears to besiege us."&lt;ref name="R153" /&gt;

==Provenance==
Nothing is record of the panel's commission or early owners.&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;  Given the remnants of hinges on its frame, the work probably formed the left hand side of a diptych of which the opposite panel is now lost, possibly split up during the 18th century when composite works of this era were out of fashion and were broken up to be sold as individual easel pictures. The ''Man of Sorrows'' is thought to have been created as part of a series of small paintings for the [[Haarlem]] [[Janskerk (Haarlem)|Commandery of the Knights of St John]], a group of works that explore a range of human emotions.&lt;ref name="S29"&gt;Smith, 129&lt;/ref&gt; That group of paintings originally hung in the organisation's Church of St. John in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref name="d61" /&gt;

'''''Margaret Mee and the Moonflower''''' ({{lang-pt|Margaret Mee e a Flor da Lua}}) is a 2012 Brazilian [[documentary film]] directed by Malu De Martino, about the work and legacy of British botanical artist [[Margaret Mee]], who moved to Brazil in the 1950s, produced over 400 illustrations about Brazilian flora and, used her art as a tool to defend the environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adorocinema.com/filmes/filme-213510/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16779">A '''miniature book''' is a very small book. Standards for what may be termed a miniature rather than just a small book have changed through time. Today, most collectors consider a book to be miniature only if it is 3 inches or smaller in height, width, and thickness, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbs.org/|title=What is a miniature book?|last=|first=|date=|website=MIniature Book Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many collectors consider nineteenth-century and earlier books of 4 inches to fit in the category of miniatures.

==History==
Miniature books stretch back far in history; many collections contain [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform tablets]] stretching back thousands of years, and exquisite medieval [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]]. Printers began testing the limits of size not long after the technology of printing began, and around 200 miniature books were printed in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.oxy.edu/special-collections/minibooks/throughtheyears.htm|title=Miniature Books Through the Years|website=sites.oxy.edu|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exquisite specimens from the 17th century abound. In the 19th century, technological innovations in printing enabled the creation of smaller and smaller type.  Fine and popular additions alike grew in number throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/minibooks.htm|title=Miniature Books|last=|first=|date=2012-10-22|work=American Antiquarian Society|access-date=2018-04-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some miniature books are objects of high craft, bound in fine [[Morocco|Moroccan]] leather, with [[Gilding|gilt]] decoration and excellent examples of [[woodcuts]], etchings, and [[watermarks]], others are cheap, disposable, sometimes highly functional items not expected to survive. Today, miniature books are produced both as fine works of craft and as commercial products found in chain bookstores.

Some popular types of miniature books from various periods include [[Bible|Bibles]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedias]], [[Dictionary|dictionaries]], [[Bilingual dictionary|Bilingual dictionaries,]] [[Short story|short stories]], [[Poetry|verse]], famous speeches, [[Propaganda|political propaganda]], [[Guide book|travel guides]], [[Almanac|almanacs]], children's stories, and the miniaturization of well-known books such as ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'', ''[[The Art of War]]'', and [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories.

=== "Smallest Book in the World" ===
Many books have claim to the title of smallest book in the world at the time of their publication. The title can apply to a variety of accomplishments: smallest overall size, smallest book with [[movable type]], smallest printed book, smallest book legible to the naked eye, and so on.

750: ''Hyakumantō darani'' or ‘One Million Pagoda Dharani.' Also one of the earliest known printed texts, these 2-3/8" tall Buddhist charms were printed, rolled into a scroll, placed in miniature white pagodas, and distributed to Buddhist temples. A million were printed at the command of Japanese [[Empress Shotoku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkQdDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=oldest+buddhist+printed+million+copies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=prAWVYNX_V&amp;sig=0qYFt2ojnuJTY2-9NQP-e9U4kGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY27W61LraAhVRNd8KHXZhDkUQ6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=oldest%20buddhist%20printed%20million%20copies&amp;f=false|title=The Paper Trail: An Unexpected History of a Revolutionary Invention|last=Monro|first=Alexander|date=2017-02-21|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780307456694|location=|pages=132|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MIniature Books as charms, talismans, and amulets ===
In 2007, archaeologists found a miniature Bible (Glasgow: David Bryce &amp; Son, 1901) tucked into a child's boot hidden in a chimney cavity in an English cottage attic. Shoes were placed in such locations as early as the fourteenth-century as anti-witchcraft devices known as "spirit traps."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|title=World's Smallest Bible Found in a Boot|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|date=February 9, 2007|website=Discovery News|archive-url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1786490/posts|archive-date=February 17, 2007|dead-url=|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing, Printing, and Binding in Miniature ==
The creation of a miniature book requires exceptional skill in all aspects of book production, because elements such as bindings, pages, and type, illustrations, and subject matter all need to be approached with a new set of problems in mind. For instance, the pages of a miniature book do not fall open as do those of larger books, because the pages are not heavy enough. Bindings require exceptionally thin materials, and creating type that is readable and beautiful requires great skill. Many printers have created miniature books to test their own technical limits or to show off their skill. Many books have claimed the sought-after title of "smallest book in the world," which is now held by experiments in nanoprinting.

A challenge for museum architecture is the differing purposes of the building.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The museum collection must be preserved, but it also needs to be made accessible to the public. Climate control may be very important for the objects in the collection.

==History==
An early example of architecture for a purpose-built museum is the [[Museum of the History of Science]] building in [[Oxford]], [[England]], originally built to house the [[Ashmolean Museum]].

In the 20th century, museums have been combined with war memorials to serve multiple purposes. The [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]], for example, is a place of commemoration as well as for collection and display. It contains a museum, an archive and a shrine. It was designed by [[Emil Sodersten]] and [[John Crust]] in a contemporary [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style reminiscent of [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]] with detailing influenced by [[Art Deco]].

The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City, USA (opened in 1959), by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is an important architectural landmark and icon of the 20th century. Another classic 20th century example of iconic museum architecture is the titanium-covered [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] in Spain by [[Frank Gehry]] (opened in 1997). Gehry has undertaken many major museum architecture projects, including the [[Experience Music Project]] in Seattle, USA, the [[Weisman Art Museum]] in Minneapolis, USA, the [[Vitra Design Museum]] and [[MARTa Museum]] in Germany, and the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, Canada.

Successful examples of modern architecture being married with existing museum buildings include the [[Louvre Pyramid]] by [[I. M. Pei]] in Paris, France (1989), and more recently the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] by [[Norman Foster]] at the [[British Museum]], London, England (2000).

[[David Chipperfield]] designed many notable museums, including the award-winning [[River and Rowing Museum]] in Henley-on-Thames, England, in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.architectural-review.com/home/ar-archive/ar-1997-january-david-chipperfields-river-and-rowing-museum/8611738.article | title=AR 1997 January — David Chipperfield's River and Rowing Museum | last=Richards | first=Ivor | journal=[[The Architectural Review]] | date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This won in 1999 the [[RIBA]] ''Architecture in Arts and Leisure Award'' and the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] Trust/[[British Sky Broadcasting]] ''Best Building Award (England)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/74906CDF-4437-45C1-8470-4208CCD7901B/0/David_Chipperfield_CV.pdf | title=David Chipperfield | website=www.wakefield.gov.uk | publisher=[[Wakefield Council]] | location=UK | accessdate=October 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipperfield also designed the [[Figge Art Museum]] in Davenport, Iowa, USA (2005), the [[Museum of Modern Literature]] in Marbach, Germany (2006), and the reconstructed [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin, Germany (2009).

Museum architecture sometimes involves the [[Adaptive reuse|conversion]] of old buildings that have outlived their usefulness but that are still of historic interest. A notable example is the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] or the conversion of the [[Bankside Power Station]] designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]] into the [[Tate Modern]] in 2000, based on design by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | title=Tate Modern | publisher=[[Carillion]] PLC | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928130817/http://www.carillionplc.com/sectors/sectors_leisure_tate.asp | archivedate=September 28, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2483168510674278477 | title=Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern | publisher=[[Google Video]] | year=2008 | accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Netherlands Architecture Institute''' (NAI) is a cultural institute for architecture and urban development, comprising a museum, an archive plus library, and a platform for lectures and debates. The NAI was established in 1988 and has been based in [[Rotterdam]] since 1993.

The NAI is a private organisation with a government brief, which is to manage the collection of archives that document the history of Dutch architecture. Moreover, as a sector institute for architecture it is also tasked with supporting the professional field. The building also houses a bookshop and a cafe.

==History==
The idea of establishing a national architecture museum came about in 1912 when the Amsterdam architects’ association Architectura et Amicitia was obliged to rent an extra room in Hotel Parkzicht in Amsterdam to store its archive of drawings and models. Architect [[J.H.W. Leliman]] was a key advocate of an architecture museum. A committee comprising J. Ingenohl, J.H. de Groot and W.A.E. van der Pluym as members was set up to look into the possibilities of such a museum. In 1915, A et A members suggested storing the collection at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam, and housing it in an independent museum at a later date. These ideas did not come to fruition, however.

In the 1980s, three cultural institutes collaborated to form the NAI. These were the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB), the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM) and Stichting Wonen foundation. Following this, a controversy ensued between Amsterdam and Rotterdam as to where an architecture museum/institute would have to be based. Minister Brinkman opted for Rotterdam. Previous plans to set up the NAI in the vacant library at Botersloot were abandoned. The NAI found temporary accommodation in a building at Westersingel before the construction of a new building started.

==The building==
In 1988, a competition was held among six architects to find an architect for a new building. These were: [[Jo Coenen]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Benthem Crouwel Architekten]], [[Wim Quist]], [[Luigi Snozzi]] and [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]]. Koolhaas’s design was the favourite among the specialist press and was also favoured by Riek Bakker, the director of Rotterdam’s Department of Urban Development. However, the NAI awarded Jo Coenen the commission, the decisive factors being the blending of the design into the surroundings and the references to the history of architecture.

After an intensive period of renovation, the NAI opened its doors on 1 July 2011. The most salient part of the renovation was moving the entrance to the pond level. The restaurant was extended. An exhibition room and additional space for educational activities were also added. At the site of the original entrance is now the DoeDek, a hands-on area where visitors can experiment with Lego, large blocks and cut-outs. As the original building’s architect, Jo Coenen was also responsible for its renovation.

==Sonneveld House Museum==
Sonneveld House Museum is a house built in the [[Nieuwe Bouwen]] style, the Dutch branch of the International School of Modernism. It was furnished with furniture and materials made by W.H. Gispen, B. van der Leck and others. The house was designed in 1933 by architects’ firm Brinkman and Van der Vlugt for the Sonneveld family. Albertus Sonneveld was one of the directors of the Van Nelle factory.

The Rotterdam Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht (a foundation for the enhancement of popular health, welfare and culture in the city) bought the museum house in 1977. A form of collaboration has existed between Volkskracht and the NAI since February 1999. The house was restored and opened to the public in 2001. The restoration work was done by architects’ firm Molenaar &amp; Van Winden, with the NAI taking on the refurnishing work.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The collection==
Private individuals started collecting architectural archives as early as the end of the nineteenth century. One of these was the Architecture Museum Foundation (SAM). In the 1970s, the government became interested in these archives, setting up the Netherlands Architecture Documentation Centre (NDB) as part of the Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, the Netherlands Department for Conservation. When the archives were transferred to the NDB, they officially became state property. The NAI’s archive collection is still a national collection.

The libraries of the Academie van Bouwkunst Amsterdam (Amsterdam Academy of Architecture), the Bond van Nederlandse Architecten BNA (the Royal Institute of Dutch Architects) and Stichting Wonen, a consumer organisation for information on sustainable living, were added to the NDB’s collection. The collection now houses some 18 kilometres of archive material. It also contains over 500 archives and collections of Dutch architects, organisations and educational institutes in the field of architecture and urban development, and comprises drawings, sketches, models, documentation, correspondence and photos. The internationally focused library contains about 60,000 volumes.

The NAI houses the Stichting BONAS foundation, (Stichting Bibliografieën en Oeuvrelijsten Nederlandse Architecten en Stedebouwkundigen, which translates as Bibliographies and Lists of Works of Dutch Architects and Urban Designers). Working on the basis of archive and literature study, this organisation reconstructs the work of Dutch designers from 1790 to the present and publishes it in book form.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Exhibitions==
The NAI organises exhibitions about the designed environment: about architecture, urban development, design and spatial planning. These are some of the exhibitions that were held in recent years: Polders (2005), China Contemporary (2006), Wijdeveld: plan the impossible (2006), From Cuypers to Coenen (2007), Le Corbusier (2007), Shape our country (2009), Disputed City (2010) and Architecture of Consequence (2011). In addition to temporary exhibitions there are two (semi)permanent exhibitions: Stad van Nederland (Dutchville) and De Schatkamer (Treasury). Dutchville is about how the city is perceived and about its beautiful and slightly less appealing aspects. Opened in September 2011, the Treasury displays masterpieces from the collection in an exhibition space designed by Rem Koolhaas, which was opened in September 2011.

==Platform==
To promote its innovation agenda ‘Architecture of Consequence’, the NAI organises platform activities such as lectures and debates both in the Netherlands and abroad. What role can architecture play in solving social problems? This concerns topics such as food production, the social climate, renewable energy, alternative use of space, social cohesion and value creation. A ‘matchmaking’ programme brings together expertise on these subjects so as to find approaches to spatial tasks such as environmental issues or housing shortages. Studying and discussing these tasks puts them onto local and international agendas. The matchmaking programme focuses primarily on India and China.

==Education==
The NAI offers programmes for primary and secondary education. It also works with various universities and universities of applied sciences on enhancing various subjects, study assignments, excursions and guided tours. Everyone can work hands-on on the DoeDek using large building blocks, Lego and cut-outs. Classes for children, supervised by architects and scientists, are to be held from February 2012.

== UAR (Urban Augmented Reality) ==
The NAI introduced UAR on 30 June 2010. UAR is an acronym for Urban Augmented Reality. It is a free-of-charge 3D architecture application that uses Augmented reality. This means that a layer of information has been added to reality. In UAR, the existing, built environment is supplemented by a historical, a future or an alternative layer using 3D models. UAR shows us what is not there, what the city used to look like, by showing us buildings that have since disappeared. The city as it could have been, using models and drawings to display alternative designs that never made it. And the city as it will become, using artist’s impressions of future projects. The collections of various institutes and heritage organisations including the NAI’s own collection are used for this. UAR users can also add information to the application themselves. At present, UAR covers the cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Breda, Haarlem and Gouda.

==NAiM | Bureau Europa==
On 2 September 2006, the NAI opened an annexe in Maastricht, in the Wiebengahal, which adjoins the Bonnefanten Museum, in the Céramique district. As of April 2009, this NAiM/Bureau Europa acquired independent status. Since 2013 the new name is Bureau Europa.

==NAI Publishers==
NAI Publishers originated from the NAI’s publication department but has been an independent company for 15 years now. The company specialises in publishing books on architecture, urban development, spatial planning, visual arts, photography and design. NAI Publishers’ bookshop was located in the NAI building. July 2012 NAI Publishers merged with 010 Publishers, a similar publisher, on a new location in Rotterdam. The name of the merger is nai010 publishers.

==Merger==
State Secretary [[Halbe Zijlstra]] designated the NAI as one of the organisations that were going to form the new institute for the Creative Industry on 1 January 2013. That date the NAI merged with Stichting Premsela, the Netherlands Institute for Design and Fashion (Design sector institute) and Virtueel Platform (E-culture knowledge institute). The name of the merger is ''[[Het Nieuwe Instituut]]'', The New Institute.

==Board of Management and Supervisory Board==
The last management of the NAI comprised Ole Bouman (general director) and Peter Haasbroek (business director). The members of the Supervisory Board were: Hans Andersson (chairman), Karin Laglas (treasurer), [[Jeanne van Heeswijk]], Leon Ramakers, Dirk Sijmons, Nathalie de Vries and Joop van der Leeuw.

The '''People's Prize''' ({{lang-ko|인민상}}) is a [[North Korea]]n arts and sciences award. It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the [[Cabinet of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ScalapinoLee1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A. Scalapino|author2=Chong-Sik Lee|title=Communism in Korea: The society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2M_yhsWc6gC&amp;pg=PA1395|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02274-4|page=1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean cinema]].

The works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, [[Korean revolutionary opera]], [[acupuncture]] and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.

==History==
The People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.&lt;ref name="Weiser2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chests Full of Brass: A DPRK Political History in Orders, Medals, Prizes, and Titles | last = Weiser | first = Martin  | work = Sino-NK | date = 8 January 2016 | access-date = 16 April 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2016/01/08/chests-full-of-brass-a-dprk-political-history-in-orders-medals-prizes-and-titles/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North Korean feature film ''[[My Hometown (film)|My Hometown]]'' (1949) was directed by [[Kang Hongshik]]. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. [[Kim Il-sung]] praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}''.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}} The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an "excellent textbook" for the workers party.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}}

Some of the works, which did not become recognized as "Immortal classics", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' (1968) directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]], and overseen by [[Kim Jong-il]] himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were ''[[A Flowering Village]]'' and ''[[A Family of Workers]]'' (1971). In the case of the ''A Family of Workers'', Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the [[On the Art of the Cinema#Seed theory|seed theory]].&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Schönherr|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGBog0seMFQC&amp;pg=PA47|date=13 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9052-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K.

In 1965 the [[Chongryon]] established [[Korea University (Japan)|Chosun University]]'s teaching staff in Japan received the prize.&lt;ref name="Chongryon"/&gt;

Many of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. ''[[Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas]]'' is regarded as classic of literature of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.&lt;ref name="KCNA_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200602/news02/04.htm |title=Reminiscences of Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, True Textbook of Life |author= |date=2 February 2006 |website=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hearst 1906 Wizard of Ooze.jpg|right|thumb|Cartoonist W. A. Rogers in 1906 sees the political uses of Oz: he depicts [[William Randolph Hearst]] as Scarecrow stuck in his own Ooze in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'']]

'''Political interpretations of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''''' include treatments of the [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|modern fairy tale]] (written by [[L. Frank Baum]] and first published in 1900) as an [[allegory]] or [[metaphor]] for the political, economic, and social events of America in the 1890s. Scholars have examined four quite different versions of Oz: the novel of 1900,&lt;ref name="ritter1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=Gretchen |date=August 1997 |title=Silver slippers and a golden cap: L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and historical memory in American politics |journal=[[Journal of American Studies]] |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=171–203 |jstor=27556260 |doi=10.1017/s0021875897005628}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|Broadway play of 1901]],&lt;ref name="swartz2000"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Oz Before the Rainbow]]: L. Frank Baum's "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" on Stage and Screen to 1939 |last=Swartz |first=Mark Evan |year=2000 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-6477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Hollywood film of 1939]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historical Dictionary of the Great Depression, 1929–1940 |last=Olson |first=James |year=2001 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=0-313-30618-4 |pages=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of Oz books|numerous follow-up Oz novels]] written after 1900 by Baum and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Annotated Wizard of Oz |editor1-last=Hearn |editor1-first=Michael Patrick |year=2000 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |isbn=0-393-04992-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political interpretations focus on the first three, and emphasize the close relationship between the visual images and the story line to the political interests of the day. Biographers report that Baum had been a political activist in the 1890s with a special interest in the money question of gold and silver, and the illustrator William Wallace Denslow was a full-time editorial cartoonist for a major daily newspaper. For the 1901 Broadway production Baum inserted explicit references to prominent political characters such as President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

==Monetary policy==
In a 1964 article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Littlefield |first1= Henry |year= 1964 |title= The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 16 |issue= 1 |pages= 47–58 |url= http://www.shsu.edu/his_rtc/2014_FALL/Wizard_of_Oz_Littlefield.pdf|accessdate= 2016-05-20 |doi= 10.2307/2710826}}&lt;/ref&gt; educator and historian [[Henry Littlefield]] outlined an allegory in the book of the [[Free silver|late 19th-century debate regarding monetary policy]]. According to this view, for instance, the Yellow Brick Road represents the [[gold standard]], and the [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]] ([[Ruby slippers|ruby]] in the 1939 film version) represent the [[Silverite]] sixteen to one silver ratio (dancing down the road). The City of Oz earns its name from the abbreviation  of ounces "Oz" in which gold and silver are measured.

The thesis achieved considerable popular interest and elaboration by many scholars in history, economics and other fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sanders |first1= Mitch |date= July 1991 |title= Setting the Standards on the Road to Oz |journal= [[The Numismatist]] |pages= 1042–1050 |publisher= [[American Numismatic Association]] |url= http://www.money.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Online_Numismatist&amp;Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=13804 |accessdate= 2011-10-28 |archivedate= 14 June 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110614152049/http://www.money.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Online_Numismatist&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=13804 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that thesis has been challenged.&lt;ref name= hansen2002/&gt;&lt;ref name= parker1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name= gjovaag&gt;{{Cite web| title= The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Frequently Asked Questions: About The Oz Books|url= http://thewizardofoz.info/wiki/About_the_Oz_Books|accessdate= 29 September 2017 |last= Gjovaag |first= Eric |year= 2006 |work= The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly the 1901 musical version of ''Oz'' written by Baum, was for an adult audience and had numerous explicit references to contemporary politics,&lt;ref name= swartz2000 /&gt; though in these references Baum seems just to have been "playing for laughs".&lt;ref name= dighe2002&gt;{{Cite book |title= The historian's Wizard of Oz: reading L.

"You wouldn't be as badly off as [[John D. Rockefeller]]", the Scarecrow responds, "He'd lose six thousand dollars a minute if that happened."&lt;ref name= swartz2000 /&gt;

Littlefield's knowledge of the 1890s was thin, and he made numerous errors, but since his article was published, scholars in history,&lt;ref name= parker1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Parker |first1= David B. |year= 1994 |title= The Rise and Fall of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as a 'Parable on Populism' |journal= Journal of the Georgia Association of Historians | volume= 15 |pages= 49–63 |url= http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm |accessdate= 2011-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; political science,&lt;ref name= ritter1997 /&gt; and economics&lt;ref name= hansen2002&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hansen |first1= Bradley A. |year= 2002 |title= The Fable of the Allegory: The Wizard of Oz in Economics |journal= Journal of Economic Education |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |url= http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/pdffiles/summer02/bhansen.pdf |accessdate= 2011-10-28 |jstor= 1183440||archivedate=3 April 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030403044106/http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/pdffiles/summer02/bhansen.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; have asserted that the images and characters used by Baum closely resemble political images that were well known in the 1890s. Quentin Taylor, for example, claimed that many of the events and characters of the book resemble the actual political personalities, events and ideas of the 1890s.&lt;ref name= taylor2004 /&gt; [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]—naïve, young and simple—represents the American people. She is [[Everyman]], led astray and seeking the way back home.&lt;ref name= taylor2004 /&gt; Moreover, following the road of gold leads eventually only to the Emerald City, which may symbolize the fraudulent world of [[Fiat money|greenback paper money]] that only pretends to have value.&lt;ref name= taylor2004 /&gt; It is ruled by a scheming politician (the Wizard) who uses publicity devices and tricks to fool the people (and even the Good Witches) into believing he is benevolent, wise, and powerful when really he is a selfish, evil humbug. He sends Dorothy into severe danger hoping she will rid him of his enemy the Wicked Witch of the West. He is powerless and, as he admits to Dorothy, "I'm a very bad Wizard".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first1= L. Frank| last1= Baum| first2= William Wallace| last2= Denslow| editor-first2= Michael Patrick| editor-last2= Hearn| editor-first1= William Wallace| editor-last1= Denslow| first3= Michael Patrick| last3= Hearn| title= The Annotated Wizard of Oz: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz| year= 2000| page= 271| publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn= 9780393049923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh Rockoff suggested in 1990 that the novel was an allegory about the demonetization of silver in 1873, whereby “the cyclone that carried Dorothy to the Land of Oz represents the economic and political upheaval, the yellow brick road stands for the gold standard, and the silver shoes Dorothy inherits from the Wicked Witch of the East represents the pro-silver movement. When Dorothy is taken to the Emerald Palace before her audience with the Wizard she is led through seven passages and up three flights of stairs, a subtle reference to the [ [[Coinage Act of 1873]] ] which started the class conflict in America.”&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Rockoff, “The ‘Wizard of Oz’ as a Monetary Allegory,” ''Journal of Political Economy'' 98.4 (1990), as summarized by William L. Silber in ''The Story of Silver: How the White Metal Shapes America and the Modern World'' (Princeton University Press, 2019), 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social groups==
Historian Quentin Taylor sees additional metaphors, including: 
*The Scarecrow as a representation of [[Agriculture in the United States|American farmers]] and [[American farm discontent|their troubles in the late 19th century]]
*The Tin Man representing the industrial workers, especially those of [[Iron and steel industry in the United States|American steel industries]]
*The Cowardly Lion as a metaphor for [[William Jennings Bryan]]
Taylor also claimed a sort of iconography for the cyclone: it was used in the 1890s as a metaphor for a political revolution that would transform the drab country into a land of color and unlimited prosperity. It was also used by editorial cartoonists of the 1890s to represent political upheaval.&lt;ref name= taylor2004 /&gt;

Other putative allegorical devices of the book include the Wicked Witch of the West as a figure for the actual [[American West]]; if this is true, then the [[Winged Monkeys]] could represent another western danger: [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells Dorothy, "Once we were a free people, living happily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. ... This was many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this land."&lt;ref name= dighe2002 /&gt;

In fact, Baum proposed in two editorials he wrote in December 1890 for his newspaper, the ''Saturday Pioneer'', the total genocidal slaughter of all remaining indigenous peoples. "The Whites," Baum wrote, "by law of conquest, by justice of civilization, are masters of the American continent, and the best safety of the frontier settlements will be secured by the total annihilation of the few remaining Indians.

However this may have been [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] or a rhetorical question, as he also wrote "An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that "when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre."&lt;ref&gt;[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/second/en213/term1/l_frank_baum.pdf Frank Baum’s Editorials on the Sioux Nation]&lt;/ref&gt;. The beginning of his Saturday Pioneer editorial also seems sympathetic to Sitting Bull "He was an Indian with a white man's spirit of hatred and revenge for those who had wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe gradually driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within his breast and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/second/en213/term1/l_frank_baum.pdf Frank Baum’s Editorials on the Sioux Nation]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Alternative allegory==
Other writers have used the same evidence to lead to precisely opposite allegorical interpretations.&lt;ref name= parker1994 /&gt;

Apart from intentional symbolism, scholars have speculated on the sources of Baum's ideas and imagery. The "man behind the curtain" could be a reference to automated store window displays of the sort famous at Christmas season in big city department stores; many people watching the fancy clockwork motions of animals and mannequins thought there must be an operator behind the curtain pulling the levers to make them move (Baum was the editor of the trade magazine read by window dressers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/rep.1988.21.1.99p02045 | last1 = Culver | first1 = Stuart | year = 1988 | title = What Manikins Want: The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and The Art of Decorating Dry Goods Windows and Interiors | journal = Representations | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 97–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional allegories have been developed, without claims that they were originally intended by Baum. The text has been treated as a [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]] allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Algeo |first1= John |editor1-first= Susan R. |editor1-last= Gannon |editor2-first= Ruth Anne |editor2-last= Thompson | chapter= Oz and Kansas: A Theosophical Quest |title= Proceedings of the Thirteenth Annual Conference of the Children's Literature Association |chapterurl= http://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/1584 |accessdate= 2011-10-28 |year= 1988 |publisher= University of Missouri |location= Kansas City |pages= 135–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, W. Geoffrey Seeley recast the story as an exercise in treachery, suggesting the supposed "Good Witch [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]]" used an innocent, ignorant patsy (Dorothy) to overthrow both her own sister witch (Witch of the West) and the Wizard of Oz, leaving herself as undisputed master of all four corners of Oz: North, East, West and South (and presumably the Emerald City). She even showed her truest "Machiavellian brilliance" by allowing the story to be entitled after the weakest of her three opponents. Glinda could have told Dorothy that the "silver slippers would easily do the job [of returning Dorothy to her beloved home] but decided that a destabilizing force such as Dorothy might be just the thing to shake up her other rival [The Wizard of Oz]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Geo-Politics of Oz; Now It Can Be Told!

Only Dorothy's ''silver'' slippers can take her home to Kansas," meaning that by Dorothy not realizing that she had the silver slippers the whole time, Dorothy, or "the westerners", never realized they already had a viable currency of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Gold: From Greek Myth to Computer Chips |last= Kassinger |first= Ruth |year= 2003 | publisher= 21st Century |isbn= 0-7613-2110-1 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8ETuR1SNqkC&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=%22dorothy%27s+silver+slippers%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NZ7wTKrKGoL68Aa55ZnsDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dorothy%27s%20silver%20slippers%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1560">'''"Pomperipossa in Monismania"''' (also called '''Pomperipossa in the World Of Money''') is a satirical story written by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book author [[Astrid Lindgren]] in response to the 102% [[marginal tax rate]] that she incurred in 1976. It was published starting on 3 March 1976 in the Stockholm evening tabloid ''[[Expressen]]'' and created a major debate about the Swedish tax system.

The marginal tax rate above 100%, dubbed the 'Pomperipossa effect', was due to tax legislation that required self-employed individuals to pay both regular income tax and employer's fees.

The story, a satirical allegory about a writer of children's books in a distant country, led to a stormy tax debate and is often attributed as a decisive factor in the defeat of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], for the first time in 40 years, in [[Swedish_general_election,_1976|the elections later the same year]]. Lindgren, however, continued to support the party for all her life.

'''Premio Ruido''' (Spanish for "''Noise Prize''") was set up in October 2015 as a yearly single-category award for the best music album produced in Spain. The first ceremony to present the award took place in January 2016, after the nominees had been announced in November of the previous year.

In terms of the process followed and rules, Premio Ruido bears a close similarity to the Mercury Prize in the UK, and the intention is to recognise artistic quality over sales success, in contrast to previously existing awards. However, whilst the Mercury Prize is awarded by a mixed panel that includes both musicians and figures of the music industry, as well as members of the media and journalists, and was established by the [[British Phonographic Industry]], Premio Ruido was established by [[Periodistas Asociados de Música]] (the Spanish Association of Music Journalists) and it is their members who take part in the selection. The company Virtual Contenidos SL manages and produces the annual awards, while PAM's Board of Directors conducts and ratifies the voting process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premioruido.es/bases]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the initial stage, PAM members vote for their favourite national records launched that year. This is so as to draw a stylistically  diverse shortlist of twelve nominated albums. A recording is deemed "''national''" if at least half of the artists taking part are Spanish nationals or else have permanent residency in Spain. At the final stage, the associates vote for just one of the nominees. The winning artist is presented with a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://premioruido.es/bases]&lt;/ref&gt;

El [[Niño de Elche]] was the inaugural winner with the album "''Voces del extremo''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/01/27/actualidad/1453855057_109224.html | title = La voz extrema de Niño de Elche conquista el primer Premio Ruido de la crítica| access-date = 17 May 2016| publisher = El País}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overview of recent developments in '''public art practices in Korea''' (1999–2005) [[Public art]] practices from the last 5 years or so in [[Korea]] can be narrowed down to three major issues. The first issue is the dispute over the Art Decoration Law for buildings, which is the national cultural policy that mandates acquisition of public sculptures. The second is proliferation of gigantic-scale public art projects led by local governments. The third issue is new genre public art works that pursue activist ideals and social engagement. In this article, the Flying City and Oasis Project’s practices will be mainly discussed based on receiving major attention from the mass media and art field. These three issues not only reflect changes in Korean society but also make up characteristics of Korean public art practices.

==Public artwork sites in public spaces ==

Public sculpture sites in public spaces take up the majority of Korean public art practices in terms of number. The proliferation and popularity of public sculptures originated from the establishment of the Art Decoration Law for buildings when the Korean government was hosting the [[Olympic Games]] in 1988. The law mandates that an owner of a new building must earmark 0.7% of the construction cost to artworks for public view. The increasing level of urban population and the buildings constructed due to urban development resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of public sculptures. However, questions have been raised over the artistic quality over these works, especially because most of the public sculptures remain in [[modernism|modernist]] style, which was the mainstream at the time the law was first established. Disregarding communication with the public audience, these sculptures function merely as decoration of the spaces. Furthermore, only a handful of artists were repeatedly commissioned and even subcontracted to foundries resulting in more problems in the production and dissemination of public sculptures.

As such, these shortcomings stirred up more heated disputes coinciding with elevated levels of interest in public art, and led to the birth of the [[Public Art Council]] established in 2002 that opposes the current policies. The Public Art Council raised questions on the extent that current public art practices have provided artistic satisfaction to the public, who the actual audience is, and how relevant the works are to the lives of residents near the art sites. These issues concerning public good were the foundation of the argument by the Public Art Council demanding to raise the quality of public art. Furthermore, it suggested to the government an alternative policy to create a fund drawn from the building owners’ mandated expense when a new building is built by the Art Decoration Law for Buildings. Then the governing body of the fund would allocate money from the fund for operation in selection of artists, maintenance and conservation of the art works. Now the [[Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] is seriously considering the suggestion to establish a new law. In light of the fact that Koreans spend 11.5 billion [[Korean won]] a year for Public Art (1997 Survey by Korean Culture and Tourism Policy Institute), the Public Art Association expects that a new policy can provide a larger number of artists with new jobs and other career benefits.

==Local government-led public art projects==

When civilian government came into power in Korea in the 1990s it introduced the Local Government Act. This made it possible for regional governments to act more freely and independently from the central government. This was followed by speedy development in small local cities. From its establishment local governments understood the importance of cultural projects in promoting the images of their regions and therefore commenced public art projects even though most of these projects turned out to be sculpture gardens. Recently, the direction of local government-led cultural projects has slightly changed towards large-scale public art projects coinciding with nationwide interest in concerns for the environment. The [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]] City Government took the initiative in supporting the Supplementary Space Stone &amp; Water and Saving Our Anyang River Network to co-organize the Anyang River Project, FLOW, which is interconnected with the city’s urban development project, environmental improvement project, and beautification plan. At the event, murals were placed along various locations around the Anyang River as the center, photograph exhibitions were posted on billboards, and art objects were presented. In addition, the Anyang city government started a 21 billion Korean won (20 million US dollars) scaled multiyear plan to turn the whole city into an art park. The Anyang Public Art Project has been established in November 2005 as the first annual project.

The [[Seoul]] Metropolitan Government also kicked off a project in 2002 that restored the [[Chunggye River]], located between City hall and [[Shindab]], which was formerly covered over with a concrete-covered freeway overpass. The freeway was razed and the project was completed on October 1, 2005 after spending 1.5 trillion Korean won (1.4 billion US dollars) by the city government. This project is one of the steps of the city’s long term project to promote a higher quality of life for Seoul residents and to provide better [[environmentally friendly]] urban development planning. The inauguration events included performance, concerts, and an exhibition with 50 murals and installations along the river.

==New genre public art==

It was from around the year 2000 when new genre public art first appeared, emphasizing the site of public art and the collaborative working process with the residents of local communities, building on the foundation of the direct relationship between the local environment and the artwork. As this genre emerged it performed distinct activities in the [[Korean art]] field. Korea’s new genre of public art has shown aggressive tendencies in its social engagement. Two major artist groups - the urban research group Flying City, and the Oasis Project, are typical examples of art involving these social philosophies in art practices.

First, the urban research group Flying City was formed with Jeon Yongseok, Jang Jongkwan, and Kim Gisoo. They have conducted research on the impact that rapid industrialization has had on the city of Seoul since right after the [[Korean War]]. The area along the Chunggye River in particular, is the heart of post-war industrialization as well as the most historical site where they carried out series of public art projects.

Among them, Mental Map (2001–2003) was an investigation of the influence on the unconscious level. Here, the Flying City interviewed the residents in the area and asked them to create a psychological map in addition to drawing future maps of the area in which they would like to live. The Chunggye River is also the area that supported the very foundation of the development of Seoul’s industrialization due to its concentration of hardware stores, garment shops, and electronic appliance stores. It is even said that there is no brand of goods in the world that has not been copied and sold along Chunggye-river. People have also been known to say that a space satellite could be assembled because one could collect and buy all the necessary parts sold in this area.

Flying City recently organized the Chunggye Mini Expo Project that introduced machine parts manufacturing stores in the area. In this project they studied the co-relationships between and among stores and then created a diagram to visualize their studies. They also turned the stores into temporary exhibition spaces by displaying actual mockups they created to sell and writing anecdotes about the mockups on their show windows encouraging the audience to visit the stores.

Kyongju Park, who is participating in the exhibition, Publicly Speaking, traveled to six major cities of Korea staging a migrant workers election campaign performance that urged a change of perspectives in the ways people regard 350,000 [[migrant worker]]s. At the same time, she surveyed Koreans on their reaction to the situation of migrant workers running for government. She also set up an [[Internet Broadcasting|internet broadcasting]] company for migrant workers.

Jihye Kim’s work at her exhibition, Invitation to Pyunghwa New City, presents the story of [[Pyongtaek]] city residents threatened with eviction from their homes due to the expansion plans of the Humphrey US military base. This area in Pyongtaek was once known as Daechoo-ri before the base moved in. Together with the town residents who have been living in the area from its time as Daechoo-ri, the artist organized a gathering and sang a Daechoo [[Boy Scout]]s anthem to call attention to the era when boys in the city were able to play ball games at the playgrounds which were the former sites that are currently occupied by the U.S. military base.

==The Oasis Group==
Oasis is the name of an artists’ group created by Kim Kang and Kim Younhoan as well as the name of a squat project. The group introduced the concept of “[[squatting]]” to Korea and worked actively with the mission of rejuvenating abandoned or decommissioned buildings. They have been trying to occupy the Korean Federation of Art Organizations (KFAO) building since winter 2004. This building was about 90% complete when construction was suspended and was left unfinished for the past 7 years despite the fact that the KFAO received combined grants of 22 billion Korean won (21.5 million US dollars) from both the ministry of Culture and Tourism and the [[Korean Culture and Art Foundation]] (KCAF).

The Oasis Group started to occupy the building by cleaning the site and playing on it, only to be stopped by an army of policemen. Later on, Oasis put on an advertisement announcing that office spaces in the 25 storey-high KFAO building were available for rent on the market and made a call for applicants. Oasis and 400 applicants to the office spaces then organized continuous concerts, exhibitions and performance demonstrations in front of the building requesting permission to use the vacant spaces as studios. Their request resulted in huge media coverage on the lack of accountability in KFAO’s mismanagement of the building as well as the two government cultural agencies that never followed up on the grants they provided to the KFAO.

KFAO sued the Oasis Group in court and Kim Younhoan and Byunghwan Lee from the group were fined 500,000 Korean won. Even during the trial process the group organized one-person performances and demonstrations in front of the office of the MCT. Later many art professionals participated in the art demonstrations. The number of participants and the level of attention and interest in this issue grew to unprecedented levels, more than any other project organized by an artist group. The group’s activities differentiated themselves by the complexity and diversity in their programming as well as their administrational efficiency during the office space distribution performance. The level of organization and efficiency has been compared to standards executed by larger-scaled NGOs.

However, the Oasis group actually occupied the building for only a few days. More attention should be given to the many art related rallies and cultural demonstrations against the KCAF and MCT that were organized by this group. This has shown their focus on their activities as cultural activism that urged reforms of cultural administration practices. .

==Characteristics==

The criticism by public art associations on the mismanagement of the Art Decoration Law for buildings, the Oasis group and their criticism of the funding administration practices by the MCT and KCAF, Jihye Kim’s Daechoo-ri Project dealing with the right-of-residence issue between the US military base and the native residents, and Kyongju Park’s performances on migrant workers eligibility in running for election to government posts, can all be considered as cultural activist work dealing with societal and political issues. They also have in common in their approach to their works sophistication in the level of organization and highly skilled administration and networking abilities.

In terms of members, the majority of these groups participated in the Minjung art movement in the 1980s when democratization of Korea began. For that reason, many people tend to associate the current public art practices with [[Minjung art]]. Minjung Art can be categorized as an activist movement committed to exposing the misdeeds committed by dictatorial regimes in power at the time. The work of Minjung Art eventually helped bring into motion changes in Korean social conditions. Arousal of public opinion, for example, seems to be one of their common approaches to successful execution of their projects.

Oasis employed this approach through organizing performances lasting over a month and accompanied by the introduction of an activist measure called squatting. Public art associations held numerous roundtables and symposia on the Art Decoration law to bring attention to the controversy over whether the true ownership of public art pieces lies between owner of the building or the residents of the building and its surrounding areas. Although public art associations must resolve the controversy that their methods could violate the rights of private ownership, their controversy indicates that civil society has come into Korea.

The demand of reform in administrative practices against the government’s funding agencies shows that such movements only come from the premise based on the political climate in which the government is forced to remain tuned to public opinion. One of the attributes of Korean public art practices can be stated as the majority of artists who are succeeding the socially engaging spirit of Minjung are now taking contemporary approaches focusing on finding resolutions for current social issues as the country’s political climate changes.

[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Soria Moria Castle|Soria Moria]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]:  a hero glimpses the end of his quest.]]
{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

[[File:Jucundus pushkin.jpg|thumb|Roman portraiture is characterized by its "[[wikt:warts and all|warts and all]]" realism; bust of [[Lucius Caecilius Iucundus]], a cast in the [[Pushkin Museum]]; the original in bronze was found in [[Pompeii]], and is now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]

'''Roman portraiture''' was one of the most significant periods in the development of [[portrait]] art. Originating from [[ancient Rome]], it continued for almost five centuries. Roman portraiture is characterised by unusual realism and the desire to convey images of nature in the high quality style often seen in [[ancient Roman art]]. Some busts even seem to show clinical signs.&lt;ref&gt;Engmann B: Neurologic diseases in ancient Roman sculpture busts. Neurol Clin Pract December 2013 vol.3 no.6:539-541. doi: 10.1212/CPJ.0b013e3182a78f02&lt;/ref&gt; Several images and statues made in marble and bronze have survived in small numbers. [[Roman funerary art]] includes many portraits such as [[married couple funerary reliefs]], which were most often made for wealthy [[freedmen]] rather than the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] elite. 

Portrait sculpture from the Republican era tends to be somewhat more modest, realistic, and natural compared to early Imperial works. A typical work might be one like the standing figure "A Roman Patrician with Busts of His Ancestors" (c. 30 B.C.).&lt;ref&gt;Janson, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

By the imperial age, though they were often realistic depictions of human anatomy, portrait sculpture of Roman emperors were often used for propaganda purposes and included ideological messages in the pose, accoutrements, or costume of the figure. Since most emperors from Augustus on were deified, some images are somewhat idealized. The Romans also depicted warriors and heroic adventures, in the spirit of the Greeks who came before them.

==Ideology==
===Religious functions and origins===
[[File:Old man vatican pushkin01.jpg|thumb|upright|Veristic portrait bust of an old man, head covered ''([[capite velato]])'', either a priest or ''[[paterfamilias]]'' (marble, mid-1st century BC)]]
The origin of the realism of Roman portraits may be, according to some scholars, because they evolved from wax [[death mask]]s. These death masks were taken from bodies and kept in a home altar. Besides wax, masks were made from bronze, marble and terracotta. The molds for the masks were made directly from the deceased, giving historians an accurate representation of typically Roman features.

===Politics===
In the days of the Republic, full-size statues of political officials and military commanders were often erected in public places. Such an honor was provided by the decision of the Senate, usually in commemoration of victories, triumphs and political achievements. These portraits were usually accompanied by a dedicatory inscription. If the person commemorated with a portrait was found to have committed a crime, the portrait would be destroyed.

===Social and psychological aspect===
Development of the Roman portrait was associated with increased interest in the individual, with the expansion of the [[social circle]] portrayed. At the heart of the artistic structure of many Roman portraits is the clear and rigorous transfer of unique features of the model, while still keeping the general style very similar. Unlike the ancient Greek portraits that strived for idealization (the Greeks believed that a good man must be beautiful), Roman portrait sculpture was far more natural and is still considered one of the most realistic samples of the genre in the history of art.

===''Big Bird's Egg Catch''===
'''''Big Bird's Egg Catch''''' (originally ''Grover's Egg Catch''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/archives/arc00084.htm|title = DP Royal Archives - Coke Wins: The True Story|website = www.digitpress.com|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 1983 video game for the [[Atari 2600]] developed by [[Atari]] and [[Children's Computer Workshop]].&lt;ref name="Big Bird"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Bird's Egg Catch|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/atari2600/584585-big-birds-egg-catch/data|website=GameFAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Big Bird's Egg Catch'', the player controls [[Big Bird]] as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. "[[Turkey in the Straw]]", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo.

Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40499">{{short description|The evolutionary effects of sexual selection on humans}}
'''Sexual selection in humans''' concerns the concept of [[sexual selection]], introduced by [[Charles Darwin]] as an element of his theory of [[natural selection]],&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it affects [[human]]s. The role of sexual selection in [[human evolution]] has not been firmly established although [[neoteny]] has been cited as being caused by human sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidbrin.com/neoteny1.html Neoteny and Two-Way Sexual Selection in Human Evolution: A Paleo-Anthropological Speculation on the Origins of Secondary-Sexual Traits, Male Nurturing and the Child as a Sexual Image]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the human brain is itself a product of sexual selection, i.e. it has developed as a sexual ornamentation to be used in courtship rather than for survival itself,&lt;ref&gt;[https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind Sexual Selection and the Mind]&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has developed in ways outlined by [[Ronald Fisher]] in the [[Fisherian runaway]] model.&lt;ref name="fisher30"&gt;Fisher, R.A. (1930) [[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]. {{ISBN|0-19-850440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pers00"&gt;Edwards, A.W.F. (2000) Perspectives: Anecdotal, Historial and Critical Commentaries on Genetics. The Genetics Society of America (154) 1419:1426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ander94"&gt;Andersson, M.

Comptes Rendus Biologies (333) 134:144&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher also stated that the development of sexual selection was "more favourable" in humans.&lt;ref name="Fisher 1915"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = R. A. | year = 1915 | title = The evolution of sexual preference | url = | journal = Eugenic Review | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 184–92 |pmc=2987134 | pmid=21259607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General hypotheses==
Some hypotheses about the evolution of the human brain argue that it is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs (a quarter to a fifth of the energy and oxygen consumed by a human).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schillaci, M. A. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual selection and the evolution of brain size in primates | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = e62 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000062 | pmid=17183693 | pmc=1762360| bibcode=2006PLoSO...1...62S }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual selection's role in human evolution cannot be definitively established, as features may result from an equilibrium among competing selective pressures, some involving sexual selection, others [[natural selection]], and others [[pleiotropy]]. In the words of [[Richard Dawkins]]:
: "When you notice a characteristic of an animal and ask what its Darwinian survival value is, you may be asking the wrong question. It could be that the characteristic you have picked out is not the one that matters.  It may have "come along for the ride", dragged along in evolution by some other characteristic to which it is pleiotropically linked."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins (2009).

[[Charles Darwin]] described [[sexual selection]] as depending on "the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species, solely in respect of reproduction".&lt;ref name=DarwinDescent256&gt;{{cite book | author = Darwin, Charles | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=269&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=side | title = The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex | location = London | publisher = John Murray | year = 1871 | volume = 1 | edition = 1st | page = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Darwin noted that sexual selection is of two kinds and concluded that both kinds had operated on humans:&lt;ref name=DarwinDescent402&gt;{{cite book | author = Darwin, Charles | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=419&amp;itemID=F937.2&amp;viewtype=sidee | title = The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex | location = London | publisher = John Murray | year = 1871 | volume = 2 | edition = 1st | page = 402}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between the individuals of the same sex, generally the male sex, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of the same sex, in order to excite or charm those of the opposite sex, generally the females, which no longer remain passive, but select the more agreeable partners."&lt;ref name=DarwinDescent398&gt;{{cite book | author = Darwin, Charles | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=269&amp;itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=side | title = The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex | location = London | publisher = John Murray | year = 1871 | volume = 1 | edition = 1st | page = 398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Darwin conjectured that the male beard, as well as the [[Hair#Human hairlessness|hairlessness of humans]] compared to nearly all other mammals, were results of sexual selection. He reasoned that since the bodies of females are more nearly hairless, the loss of fur was due to sexual selection of females at a remote prehistoric time when males had overwhelming selective power, and that it nonetheless affected males due to genetic correlation between the sexes. He also hypothesized that contrasts in sexual selection acting along with natural selection were significant factors in the geographical differentiation in human appearance of some isolated groups, as he did not believe that [[natural selection]] alone provided a satisfactory answer. Although not explicit, his observation that in [[Khoisan]] women "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner" (known as [[steatopygia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex | author = Charles Darwin | year = 1882 | location = London | publisher = John Murray | page = 578 | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F955&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies sexual selection for this characteristic. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', Darwin viewed many physical traits which vary around the world as being so trivial to survival&lt;ref name="Darwin1882"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Darwin|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ffQRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA605&amp;vq=%22The+races+of+man+differ+from+each+other%22&amp;dq=darwin+descent+of+man+%22The+races+of+man+differ+from+each+other%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20races%20of%20man%20differ%20from%20each%20other%22&amp;f=false|year=1882|publisher=AMS Press|pages=605|quote="The races of man differ from each other, and from their nearest allies, in certain characters which are of no service to them in their daily habits of life, and which it is extremely probable would have been modified through sexual selection"}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he concluded some input from sexual selection was required to account for their presence. He noted that variation in these features among the various peoples of the world meant human mate-choice criteria would also have to be quite different if the focus was similar, and he himself doubted that, citing&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. (1936) [1888]. ''The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex''. reprint of 2nd ed., The Modern Library, New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; reports indicating that ideals of beauty did not, in fact, vary in this way around the world.

==Sexual dimorphism==
{{main article|Sexual dimorphism}}
{{Further information|Sex differences in humans}}

Men are generally hairier than women, and Darwin was of the opinion that hairlessness was related to sexual selection; however, several other explanations have been advanced to explain [[Hair#Human hairlessness|human hairlessness]], a leading one is loss of body hair to facilitate sweating.&lt;ref name=Jablonski06&gt;Jablonski, N. G. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EYi9S3VtIGsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13 Skin: a natural history].'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. p. PP13.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea closely relates to that of the suggested need for increased [[photoprotection]] and is part of the most-commonly-accepted scientific explanation for the evolution of pigmentary traits.&lt;ref name="pmid 20445093"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jablonski | first1 = N. G. | last2 = Chaplin | first2 = G.

Indicating that a trait is under sexual selection can be difficult to prove through correlational methods, as characters may result from different selective pressures, some involving sexual selection, others natural selection, and some may be accidental and due to [[pleiotropy]]. For example, monogamous primates are known to typically exhibit little sexual dimorphism such as particularly large males armed with huge canines; however, powerful big-toothed males can provide protection against predators and may be bigger for that reason, rather than in order to win confrontations over females. Males and females differing in size can specialize in, and more fully exploit, different food resources while avoiding competing with each other; furthermore, body size can be useful in avoiding predators and may also be of assistance in securing a mate. This is further complicated by the consideration that with larger body size, the skeleton of mammals becomes much more robust and massive (relatively speaking).&lt;ref&gt;''Evolution and Human Behavior: Darwinian Perspectives on Human Nature'', by John Cartwright.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bearing these caveats in mind, levels of sexual dimorphism are generally seen as a marker of sexual selection. Studies have shown the earliest [[homininae]] were highly dimorphic and that this tendency lessened over the course of human evolution, suggesting humans have become more monogamous. In contrast, [[gorilla]]s living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: [[homininae]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Human Evolution'', by Roger Lewin, Robert Foley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual anatomy===
{{See also|Secondary sex characteristic}}

The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of [[human body|human anatomical]] features. These include rounded breasts, [[facial hair]], [[pubic hair]] and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactating human females are filled with fatty tissue and not milk. Thus it has been suggested the rounded female breasts are signals of fertility.&lt;ref name="nakedwoman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Naked Woman|last=Morris |first=Desmond |authorlink=Desmond Morris|chapter=Breasts|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wa9zntiEKeAC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=naked+woman+morris+protuberant&amp;source=web&amp;ots=p3aS52XX3F&amp;sig=Z0cBhKIhr-n65ORiPWS64yW-D40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |year=2007 |isbn= 978-0-312-33853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins has speculated that the loss of the [[baculum|penis bone]] in humans, when it is present in other primates, may be due to sexual selection by females looking for a clear sign of good health in prospective mates. Since a human erection relies on a [[hydraulic]] pumping system, erection failure is a sensitive early warning of certain kinds of physical and mental ill health.&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006 p.158 endnote"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |origyear=First published 1976 |edition=30th anniversary |year=2006 |page=158 endnote |quote=It is not implausible that, with natural selection refining their diagnostic skills, females could glean all sorts of clues about a male's health, and the robustness of his ability to cope with stress, from the tone and bearing of his penis. |title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' has a thicker penis than the other [[Hominidae|great apes]], though it is no longer than the [[chimpanzee]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dixson, A. F. | year = 2009 | title = Sexual selection and the origins of human mating systems | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 61–65 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VRTniKE2liYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780191569739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested the [[Human penis size#Evolution|evolution of the human penis towards larger size]] was the result of female choice rather than [[sperm competition]], which generally favors large [[testicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G.F. (1998), "How mate choice shaped human nature: A review of sexual selection and human evolution" in ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, penis size may have been subject to natural selection, rather than sexual selection, due to a larger penis' efficiency in displacing the sperm of rival males during [[sexual intercourse]]. A model study showed displacement of semen was directly proportional to the depth of [[pelvic thrusting]], as an efficient semen displacement device.&lt;ref&gt;In a [http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep021223.pdf theoretical paper] published in the journal [http://www.scientificamerican.com/topic.cfm?id=evolutionary-psychology ''Evolutionary Psychology''] in 2004, Gallup and coauthor, Rebecca Burch, conjecture that, "A longer penis would not only have been an advantage for leaving semen in a less-accessible part of the vagina, but by filling and expanding the vagina, it also would aid and abet the displacement of semen left by other males as a means of maximizing the likelihood of paternity." – [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=secrets-of-the-phallus "Secrets of the Phallus: Why Is the Penis Shaped Like That?"], ScientificAmerican.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection preferences and biological drivers ==
There are a variety of factors that drive sexual selection in humans. Current available research indicates that selection preferences are biologically driven,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grammer|first=Karl|last2=Fink|first2=Bernhard|last3=Møller|first3=Anders P.|last4=Thornhill|first4=Randy|date=2003-08-01|title=Darwinian aesthetics: sexual selection and the biology of beauty|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=78|issue=3|pages=385–407|doi=10.1017/s1464793102006085|issn=1469-185X}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, by the display of [[Phenotypic trait|phenotypic traits]] that can be both consciously and unconsciously evaluated by the opposite sex to determine the health and [[fertility]] of a potential mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Gillian|last2=Chan|first2=Janelle|last3=Zebrowitz|first3=Leslie A.|last4=Simmons|first4=Leigh W.|date=2003-08-07|title=Does sexual dimorphism in human faces signal health?|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/Suppl_1/S93|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=270|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S93–S95|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0023|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1698019|pmid=12952647}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can be affected, however, by social factors, including in cultures where [[arranged marriage]] is practiced, or [[psychosocial]] factors, such as valuing certain cultural traits of a mate, including a persons [[social status]], or what is perceived to be an ideal partner in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Michael E.|last2=Pound|first2=Nicholas|last3=Dunn|first3=James|last4=Hopkins|first4=Sian|last5=Kang|first5=Jinsheng|date=2013-01-02|title=Body Shape Preferences: Associations with Rater Body Shape and Sociosexuality|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=1|pages=e52532|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052532|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3534680|pmid=23300976|bibcode=2013PLoSO...852532P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selection preferences in females ===
Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and height.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=D. R.|last2=Jones|first2=B. C.|last3=Law Smith|first3=M. J.|last4=Moore|first4=F. R.|last5=DeBruine|first5=L. M.|last6=Cornwell|first6=R. E.|last7=Hillier|first7=S. G.|last8=Perrett|first8=D.

In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of [[masculinity]], it was established that women had a general masculinity preferences for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the [[menstrual cycle]] than in the non-fertile phase.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both [[fertility]] and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study did not exclude males with [[Femininity|feminine]] traits from being selected, however, as feminine traits in men indicate a higher probability of long-term relationship commitment,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and may be one of several [[survival strategies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategies for Animal Survival 2  (Animal Studies Series)|url=https://www.kanopystreaming.com/product/strategies-animal-survival-2|publisher=Chip Taylor Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also backs up the idea of using [[phenotypic trait]]s as a means of assessing a potential mates [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] for [[reproduction]] as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/3604|title=Influence of female 2D:4D ratio on attractiveness of male vocal and facial masculinity|date=2009|author=Shaw, Fionna|publisher=|type=Dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor affecting the selection process is the environment which the person inhabits. In biological terms, certain environmental conditions may bring about demands for or the disregarding of certain traits. One such example is a preference for males whose facial structure indicates certain hormonal ratios, such as [[testosterone]]-[[cortisol]] levels (sex and stress hormones). Research shows that, for example, in countries with varying [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) levels, females have different preferences for sex-stress hormone ratios, as expressed in the male's face. A Royal Society research showed a significant correlation between a measure of societal development and preferences for indication of higher testosterone levels, as manifested in facial features, and the interaction between preferences for testosterone and cortisol."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=F.

=== Selection preferences in males ===
Like their female counterparts, males also use visual information about a potential mate, as well as voice, body shape, and an assortment of other factors in selecting a partner. Research shows that males tend to prefer feminine women's faces and voices as opposed to women with masculine features in these categories.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Jillian J.

=== Common preferences in either sex ===
Sexual selection preferences are general terms by which the [[mating]] and reproductive process are understood.

==Phenotype==

Sexual selection has continued to be suggested as a possible explanation for geographical variation in appearance within the human species; in modern [[hypotheses]], marriage practices are proposed as the main determinant of sexual selection. John Manning&lt;ref name="manning2009"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Finger Ratio | author = Manning, John | isbn = 978-0-571-21540-9 | year = 2009 | publisher = Faber &amp; Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that where [[polygyny]] is common, men face intense competition for wives and are more likely to be completely unsuccessful in reproducing, and the result is strong selection of males for traits which are adaptive for successful reproduction. He proposes a link to skin color through selection of males for testosterone-mediated traits which confer an ability to successfully compete for females. He suggests testosterone makes the human immune system less competent to resist [[pathogen]]s. In this view the antimicrobial properties of [[melanin]] help mitigate the susceptibility to disease that polygyny induces by increasing testosteronization. According to this argument, the anti-infective qualities of melanin were more important than protection from [[ultraviolet light]] in the evolution of the darkest skin types. Manning asserts that skin color is more correlated with the occurrence of polygyny – explicable by it having an antimicrobial function – than the latitudinal gradient in intensity of ultraviolet radiation, and he points to the lack of very dark skin at equatorial latitudes of the [[New World]] and the relatively light skin of Khoisan people in Africa.&lt;ref name="manning2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2001.2331| pmid = 11419954| year = 2001| last1 = MacKintosh | first1 = J.| title = The antimicrobial properties of melanocytes, melanosomes and melanin and the evolution of black skin.| volume = 211| issue = 2| pages = 101–113| journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research seems to contradict Manning's explanation about [[skin color]]. In 1978, [[NASA]] launched the [[Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer]], which was able to measure the [[ultraviolet radiation]] reaching Earth's surface. Jablonski and Chaplin took the spectrometer's global ultraviolet measurements and compared them with published data on skin color in indigenous populations from more than 50 countries. There was an unmistakable correlation: The weaker the ultraviolet light, the fairer the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 1 February 2001 | author = Kirchweger, Gina | title = The Biology of . . .

Anthropologist [[Peter Frost (anthropologist)|Peter Frost]] has proposed that sexual selection was responsible for the evolution of [[Pigmentation|pigmentary]] traits of women in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern European]] populations.

==Geoffrey Miller hypothesis==
[[File:Homo habilis - forensic facial reconstruction.png|thumb|upright|''Homo habilis'' - Forensic facial reconstruction]]

[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]], drawing on some of Darwin's largely neglected ideas about human behavior, has hypothesized that many human behaviors not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as [[humor]], [[music]], [[visual art]], some forms of altruism, verbal creativity or the fact that most humans have a far greater [[vocabulary]] than that which is required for survival,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Miller, The Mating Mind, p.111; published 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Miller (2000) has proposed that this apparent redundancy is due to individuals using vocabulary to demonstrate their intelligence, and consequently their "fitness", to potential mates. This has been tested experimentally, and it appears that males do make greater use of lower-frequency (more unusual) words when in a romantic mindset compared to a non-romantic mindset, suggesting that vocabulary is likely to be used as a sexual display (Rosenberg &amp; Tunney, 2008). All these qualities are considered courtship adaptations that have been favored through sexual selection.&lt;ref name=Klasios&gt;{{cite web| last=Klasios, J. |date=2013 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/17/4/428/ |title=Cognitive traits as sexually selected fitness indicators |work=Review of General Psychology | volume=17  |pages=428–442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller is critical of theories that imply that human culture arose as accidents or by-products of human evolution. He believes that human culture arose through sexual selection for creative traits. In that view, many human artifacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the extended phenotype, for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits.&lt;ref name="Miller G 2000"&gt;Miller G. (2000). ''The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature'', London, Heineman, {{ISBN|0-434-00741-2}} (also Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-49516-1}}).&lt;/ref&gt; During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when ''[[Homo habilis]]'' first began using [[stone tools]]. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of [[Archaic humans|archaic ''Homo sapiens'']]. Miller argues that the rapid increases in brain size would have occurred by a [[positive feedback]] loop resulting in a [[Fisherian runaway]] selection for larger brains. [[Tor Nørretranders]], in ''The Generous Man'' conjectures how intelligence, musicality, artistic and social skills, and language might have evolved as an example of the [[handicap principle]], analogously with the [[peacock]]'s tail, the standard example of that principle. Another hypothesis&lt;ref name=Rozsa&gt;{{cite web| last=Rozsa L |date=2008 |url=http://www.zoologia.hu/list/clever.pdf |title=The rise of non-adaptive intelligence in humans under pathogen pressure. |work=Medical Hypotheses| volume=70 |pages=685–690 |accessdate=8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that human intelligence is a courtship indicator of health and resistance against [[parasitism|parasites]] and [[pathogen]]s which are deleterious to human cognitive capabilities.&lt;ref name="olness"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olness | title = Effects on brain development leading to cognitive impairment: a worldwide epidemic | url = | journal = J Dev Behav Pediatr | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 120–130 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200304000-00009 | pmid=12692458 | date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing arguments==
The role of sexual selection in human evolution has been considered controversial from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871). Among his vocal critics were some of Darwin's supporters, such as [[Alfred Wallace]], who argued that animals and birds do not [[mate choice|choose mates]] based on their beauty or fine [[plumage]]s, and that the artistic faculties in humans belong to their [[spirituality|spiritual]] nature and therefore cannot be connected to natural selection, which only affects the animal nature.&lt;ref name="Fisher 1915a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = R. A. | year = 1915 | title = The evolution of sexual preference | url = | journal = Eugenic Review | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 184–92 |pmc=2987134 | pmid=21259607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was accused of looking to the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral codes of the 19th century [[Victorian era|Victorian society]]. [[Joan Roughgarden]], citing elements of sexual behavior in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual-selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social.&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden, Joan (2004). ''Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender and Sexuality in Nature and People''. Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Jordania]] suggested in 2011 that in explaining such human morphological and behavioral characteristics as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin and proponents of sexual selection neglect another important evolutionary force, [[intimidation]] of predators and competitors with the ritualized forms of [[warning display]], which uses the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioral features as sexual selection. According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection. Jordania proposed an [[aposematism|aposematic]] model of human evolution, where most of the human morphological and behavioral features that had been considered by Darwin as the result of sexual selection, via female choice, are explained by the aposematic (intimidating) display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jordania, Joseph | title = Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution | publisher = Logos | year = 2011 | pages = 186–196| title-link = Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the orchestra originated as of 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Orquesta Nacional de Espana OCNE |url=http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/green/green/home.nsf/ArtistDetails/Orquesta%20Nacional%20de%20Espana%20OCNE |publisher=Askonas Holt |date= |accessdate=24 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008114159/http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/green/green/home.nsf/ArtistDetails/Orquesta%20Nacional%20de%20Espana%20OCNE |archivedate=October 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was legally founded in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Luis Mario Fraile  | title=Orquestas en España| url=http://www.lafactoriadelritmo.com/fact2/orquest.shtml| publisher= | date= | accessdate=24 August 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the merging of Pérez Casas' ''Filarmónica'' and the ''Orquesta Sinfónica'' of [[Enrique Fernández Arbós]]. 

The first official concert of the newly founded orchestra was in March 1941 at the [[Theatre of María Guerrero|Teatro María Guerrero]] in Madrid conducted by eminent Portuguese conductor Pedro de Freitas Branco (1896-1963). The principal conductors of these first years of the orchestra were [[Ernesto Halffter]], José María Franco, [[Enrique Jordá]], [[Eduard Toldrà]] and [[Jesús Arámbarri]], until the designation of the first principal conductor of the orchestra, [[Bartolomé Pérez Casas]]. After his death the new principal conductor was [[Ataúlfo Argenta]], who was in the orchestra from 1945 as the keyboard instruments player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Luis Mario Fraile  | title=Orquestas en España| url=http://www.lafactoriadelritmo.com/fact2/orquest.shtml| publisher= | date= | accessdate=24 August 2009|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WLANL - legalizefreedom - Banket van de officieren van de Cluveniersdoelen, 1627.jpg|thumb|290px|''The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627'']]
'''''The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627''''' refers to a ''[[schutterstuk]]'' painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the St. Adrian (or St. Hadrian) [[civic guard of Haarlem]]. Today it is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]].

== Description ==
Unlike other schutterstukken with each sash being the color of the "rot" or civic guard district, in this painting all officers are wearing the colors of the Dutch flag - ''[[oranje-blanje-bleu]]''. However, one can see some small differences in the flag bearers, with [[Adriaen Matham]] on the left holding a hat with blue feather and wearing mostly blue in his sash, on his left the ensign [[Loth Schout]] wearing a white jacket, and standing on the right by the window, the ensign [[Pieter Ramp]] wearing a jacket with lovely cut sleeves featuring orange brocade and an orange feather in his hat.

At the time Hals made his painting, Haarlem had three civic guard districts divided among the various "rot-masters". Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash sitting at the table on the left and looking at Adriaen Matham is Willem Claesz Voogt, heading the table.

The men featured are from left to right Ensign Adriaen Matham, Ensign [[Loth Schout]], Colonel [[Willem Claesz Voogt]], Fiscaal [[Johan Damius]], Captain [[Johan Schatter]] (seated in front), Captain [[Gilles de Wildt]] (seated behind the table with knife in hand), Servant [[Willem Ruychaver]] (standing behind him holding a pitcher), Captain [[Willem Warmont]] (seated in front), Ensign [[Pieter Ramp]], Lieutenant [[Outgert Ariss Akersloot]] (offering a dish to Fiscaal Damius), Lieutenant [[Claes van Napels]] (standing with white plume), and Lieutenant [[Matthys Haeswindius]] (seated at the foot of the table). The dog in the lower left is the only known dog in Hals' oeuvre.

They have also contributed to the {{nowrap|[[post-punk]]}} and [[new wave music|new wave]] movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including [[reggae]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[ska]] and [[rockabilly]]. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Joe Strummer]], lead guitarist and lead vocalist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]], bassist [[Paul Simonon]], and drummer [[Topper Headon|Nicky "Topper" Headon]]. Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.

The Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their self-titled debut album, ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'', in 1977. Their third album, ''[[London Calling]]'', released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. In 1982, they reached new heights of success with the release of ''[[Combat Rock]]'', which spawned the US top 10 hit "[[Rock the Casbah]]", helping the album to achieve a 2× Platinum certification there. Their final album, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'', was released in 1985.&lt;ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies"&gt;{{cite news

==History==

===Origins: 1974–76===
Before the Clash's founding, the band's future members were active in different parts of the London music scene. 

[[Joe Strummer|John Graham Mellor]] sang and played rhythm guitar in the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] act [[The 101ers]], which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, "Woody" Mellor, in favour of "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a [[Busking|busker]] in the [[London Underground]]. 

[[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] played guitar in [[protopunk]] band [[London SS]], which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS were managed by [[Bernard Rhodes]], a sometime associate of impresario [[Malcolm McLaren]] and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the [[Sex Pistols]]. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols [[Glen Matlock]] and [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], who would assist them as they tried out potential new members.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=130–132}} Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were [[Paul Simonon]], who tried out as a vocalist,{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} and drummer [[Terry Chimes]]. [[Topper Headon|Nicky Headon]] drummed with the band for a week, then quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=56}}&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Mikal|title=The Fury and the Power of the Clash|journal=Rolling Stone|date=3 March 2011|issue=1125|pages=60–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones's manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: "You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it was going to be like from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous."{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=151}} At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=72}} Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, [[Keith Levene]] on guitar and "whoever we could find really to play the drums" were rehearsing.&lt;ref name="bass player"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=79}}

The band was still searching for a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who "seemed to be, like, nineteen or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=103}} Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=192, 193}} Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act for one of his band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."&lt;ref name="joestrummer.us2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&amp;p=2&amp;aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&amp;c=1&amp;CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&amp;XUZHs|title=Interview|year=2000|publisher=Joe Strummer Resource|work=Record Collector|accessdate=5 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005220200/http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&amp;p=2&amp;aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&amp;c=1&amp;CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&amp;XUZHs|archivedate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, looked him in the eye and then began playing "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mudkiss.com/keithleveneinterview.htm |title=keithleveneinterview – MUDKISS FANZINE |publisher=Mudkiss.com |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes gave him 48 hours to decide whether he wanted to join the new band that would "rival the Pistols." Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed.&lt;ref&gt;According to band biographer Marcus Gray (2005), "Bernie phoned him a day ahead of schedule, and demanded an answer there and then" (p. 127). In ''Westway to the World'', Jones confirms the 48-hour deadline, while Strummer says it was he who made the call after just 24 (11:34–11:40). Jones elsewhere gave a different account, according to which Strummer was originally given 24 hours to decide, and Rhodes called after just eight ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 194).&lt;/ref&gt; Simonon later remarked, "Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together."&lt;ref name="bass player" /&gt; Strummer introduced the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band did not last long (he subsequently joined [[999 (band)|999]]), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as "one of the best drummers" in their circle—became the band's regular drummer.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=17:16–17:22}} 

In ''Westway to the World'', Jones also says, "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us."&lt;ref&gt;According to Gray (2005), Rhodes asked Chimes to rejoin (pp.&amp;nbsp;133–34).&lt;/ref&gt; Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice".{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=103}} Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives.&lt;ref name="MTV-Rockumentary"&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Topping|2004|p=12}} He later explained the name's origin: "It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it."&lt;ref name="MTV-Rockumentary" /&gt;

===Early gigs and the growing scene: 1976===
After rehearsing with Strummer for less than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, supporting the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in [[Sheffield]]. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]]—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play in front of an audience again for another five weeks.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=143}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, [[John Lydon]] (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=196}}

The night after their debut, the band members along with most of the Sex Pistols and much of the rest of London's "inner circle" of punks showed up at [[Dingwalls]] club to attend a concert by New York's leading punk rock band, the [[Ramones]]. Afterward "came the first example of the rivalry-induced squabbling that was to dog the punk scene and undermine any attempts to promote a spirit of unity among the bands involved."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}} Simonon got into a scuffle with [[Jean-Jacques Burnel|J.J. Burnel]], the bass player of [[the Stranglers]]. A slightly older band, the Stranglers were publicly identified with the punk scene, but were not part of the "inner circle" centred on the Sex Pistols.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}}

With Rhodes insisting that the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed intensely over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: "We were almost Stalinist in the way that you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=14:57–15:08}} Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would give me the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=326}} Sometimes they would meet in the office over their [[Camden Town|Camden]] rehearsal studio to collaborate directly.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=144}} According to a later description of Strummer's, "Bernie [Rhodes] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSavage1992|Savage 1992]], p. 232. Jones's later take on the matter: "Bernie had a hand in everything. Not the lyrics—he didn't help with the lyrics. He didn't tell us not to write love songs, as the myth goes—that's kind of simplified version of it. He told us to write what we knew about" ([[#CITEREFRobb2006|Robb 2006]], p. 197).&lt;/ref&gt;

Strummer took the lead vocals on the majority of songs; in some cases he and Jones shared the lead. Once the band began recording, Jones would rarely have a solo lead on more than one song per album, though he would be responsible for two of the group's biggest hits. On 13 August, the Clash—sporting a paint-spattered "[[Jackson Pollock]]" look—played before a small, invitation-only audience in their Camden studio.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=195–197}} Among those in attendance was ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' critic [[Giovanni Dadamo]]. His review described the band as a "runaway train&amp;nbsp;... so powerful, they're the first new group to come along who can really scare the Sex Pistols shitless".{{sfn|Strongman|2008|p=133}}

On 29 August, the Clash and Manchester's [[Buzzcocks]] opened for the Sex Pistols at [[The Screen on the Green]] —the Clash's first public performance since 4 July. The triple bill is seen as pivotal to the British punk scene's crystallisation into a movement,{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=212–215}} though ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]'' reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, "The Clash are the sort of garage band that should be speedily returned to the garage, preferably with the motor still running".{{sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}} Strummer later credited Murray's comments with inspiring the band's composition [[Garageland (song)|"Garageland"]].{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=24:23–24:43}}

In early September, Levene was fired from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling interest in the band owed to his supposedly extravagant use of [[Amphetamine|speed]], a charge Levene has denied.{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=215–216}}{{sfn|Savage|1992|p=220}} Levene and Lydon would form [[Public Image Ltd.]] in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly for the first time without Levene at another seminal concert: the [[100 Club Punk Special]], sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Subway Sect]].{{sfn|Gray|2005|pp=164–166}}{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=216–223}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the turn of the year, punk had become a major media phenomenon in the UK. On 25 January 1977, the Clash signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] for £100,000, a remarkable amount for a band that had played a total of about thirty gigs and almost none as a headliner.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=216}} As Clash historian Marcus Gray describes, the "band members found themselves having to justify [the deal] to both the music press and to fans who picked up on the critics' muttered asides about the Clash having 'sold out' to the establishment."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=217}} [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]], founder of the leading London punk periodical, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', let loose with what he would later call his "big quote": "Punk died the day the Clash signed to CBS."{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=218}} As one band associate described it, the deal "was later used as a classic example of the kind of contract that no group should ever sign—the group had to pay for their own tours, recordings, remixes, artwork, expenses&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Roadent, quoted in [[#CITEREFStrongman2008|Strongman 2008]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mickey Foote, who worked as a technician at their concerts, was hired to produce the Clash's debut album, and Terry Chimes was drafted back for the recording. The band's first single, "[[White Riot]]", was released in March 1977 and reached number 34. The album, ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'', came out the following month. Filled with fiery punk tracks, it also presaged the many eclectic turns the band would take with its cover of the reggae song "[[Police and Thieves]]". "[A]midst the Sex Pistols' inertia in the first half of 1977, the Clash found themselves as the flag-wavers of the punk rock consciousness", according to music journalist and former punk musician [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]].{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=325}} Though the album charted well in the UK, climbing to number 12, CBS refused to give it a US release, believing that its raw, barely produced sound would make it unsalable in that market.{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=61}} A North American version of the album with a modified track listing was released in 1979, after the UK original became the best-selling import album of the year in the United States.&lt;ref name="RS198004-The_Clash"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Henke| first = James| date = 3 April 1980| title = There'll Be Dancing In The Streets: The Clash|work=Rolling Stone | pages = 38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimes, whose career aspirations owed little to the punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?"{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=18:09–18:16}} As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as "[[Tory]] Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think we counted 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=30:30–30:41}}  Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed "Topper" by Simonon, who felt he resembled the [[Topper (comic book)|''Topper'' comic book]] character [[Mickey the Monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGray2005|Gray 2005]], p. 244. Gray misspells the character's name as Micky.&lt;/ref&gt; An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, "I really wanted to join the Clash. I want to give them even more energy than they've got—if that's possible";{{sfn|Coon|1977}} interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=38:07–38:11, 38:33–38:35}} In any event, Strummer later observed, "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=38:35–38:44}}

In May, the band set out on the White Riot Tour, headlining a punk package that included the Buzzcocks, Subway Sect, [[the Slits]] and [[the Prefects]].{{sfn|Robb|2006|pp=329–339}} The day after a Newcastle gig, Strummer and Headon were arrested for stealing pillowcases from their hotel room.{{sfn|Robb|2006|p=338}} That same month, CBS released "[[Remote Control (The Clash song)|Remote Control]]" as the debut LP's second single, defying the wishes of the band, who saw it as one of the album's weakest tracks.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=201–202}} Headon's first recording with the band was the single "[[Complete Control]]", which addressed the band's anger at their record label's behaviour. It was co-produced by famed reggae artist [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], though Foote was summoned to "ground things" a bit and the result was pure punk rock. Released in September 1977—''[[NME]]'' noted how CBS allowed the group to "bait their masters"—it rose to number 28 on the British chart and has gone on to be cited as one of punk's greatest singles.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=203–204}}&lt;ref name=RS500Songs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/page/4 |title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time |accessdate=22 November 2007 |date=9 December 2004 |publisher=RollingStone |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071120033613/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/500songs/page/4 |archivedate = 20 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1978, the band came out with the single "[[Clash City Rockers]]". June saw the release of "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]", which surprised fans with its ska rhythm and arrangement.

Before the Clash began recording their second album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound than its predecessor in order to reach American audiences. [[Sandy Pearlman]], known for his work with [[Blue Öyster Cult]], was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, "[R]ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. It was just so nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album&amp;nbsp;... it ruined any spontaneity."{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=42:43–42:56}} Strummer agreed that "it wasn't our easiest session."{{sfn|Ferraz|2001}} Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' received largely positive reviews upon its November release.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=291–292}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marcus |first=Greil |authorlink=Greil Marcus |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclash/albums/album/248769/review/5940574/give_em_enough_rope |title=The Clash: Give 'Em Enough Rope |accessdate=29 March 2008 |date=25 January 1979 | work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080318055407/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclash/albums/album/248769/review/5940574/give_em_enough_rope |archivedate = 18 March 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|chart]]. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking "[[Tommy Gun (song)|Tommy Gun]]", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and [[The Innocents (UK punk band)|the Innocents]]. The series of concerts—there were more than thirty, from Edinburgh to Portsmouth—was promoted as the Sort It Out Tour. The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Roman (3 March 1979). "Surprisingly Few Clashes Noted As the Clash Tours the Nation". ''Billboard'': 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August and September 1979, the Clash recorded ''[[London Calling]]''. Produced by [[Guy Stevens]], a former [[A&amp;R]] executive who had worked with [[Mott the Hoople]] and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], the double album was a mix of punk rock, reggae, ska, rockabilly, traditional rock and roll and other elements possessed of an energy that had hardly flagged since the band's early days and more polished production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its final track, a relatively straightforward rock and roll number sung by Mick Jones called "[[Train in Vain]]", was included at the last minute and thus did not appear in the track listing on the cover. It became their first US Top 40 hit, peaking at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' chart. In the UK, where "Train in Vain" was not released as a single, ''London Calling'''s [[London Calling (song)|title track]], stately in beat but unmistakably punk in message and tone, rose to number 11—the highest position any Clash single reached in the UK before the band's break-up.

Released in December, ''London Calling'' hit number 9 on the British chart; in the United States, where it was issued in January 1980, it reached number 27. The cover of the album, based on the cover of [[Elvis Presley]]'s self-titled [[Elvis Presley (album)|1956 debut LP]], became one of the best known in the history of rock.&lt;ref name=BBC2010/&gt; Its image, by photographer [[Pennie Smith]], of Simonon smashing his bass guitar was later cited as the "best rock 'n roll photograph of all time" by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Battersby, Matilda| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/london-calling-top-uk-artists-pay-tribute-to-the-clashs-war-artist-2000876.html| title = London Calling: Tracey Emin and friends pay tribute to the Clash's 'official war artist'|date=16 June 2010| accessdate =17 June 2010|work=The Independent |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=503}} During this period, the Clash began to be regularly billed as "The Only Band That Matters".

Around the turn of the year, the band members attended a special private screening of a new film, ''[[Rude Boy (film)|Rude Boy]]''; part fiction, part [[rockumentary]], it tells the story of a Clash fan who leaves his job in a [[Soho]] sex shop to become a roadie for the group. The movie—named after the [[rude boy]] subculture—includes footage of the band on tour, at a London [[Rock Against Racism]] concert, and in the studio recording ''Give 'Em Enough Rope.'' The band was so disenchanted with it that they had [[Better Badges]] make buttons that declared "I don't want RUDE BOY Clash Film".&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGray2005|Gray 2005]], p.334. For image of button, see {{cite web|url=http://pinstand.com/pins/clash.html#0067|title=The Clash Pins|accessdate=10 August 2011|publisher=WWWhatsup Online Pinstand}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 1980, it premiered at the [[30th Berlin International Film Festival]],{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=334}} where it won an honourable mention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1980/03_preistr_ger_1980/03_Preistraeger_1980.html|title=Prizes &amp; Honours (1980)|accessdate=11 August 2011|publisher=Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlinprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clash had planned to record and release a single every month in 1980. CBS balked at this idea, and the band came out with only one single—an original reggae tune, "[[Bankrobber]]", in August—before the December release of the 3-LP, 36-song ''[[Sandinista!]]'' The album again reflected a broad range of musical styles, including extended [[dub music|dubs]] and the first forays into [[Hip hop music|rap]] by a major rock band. Produced by the band members with the participation of Jamaican reggae artist [[Mikey Dread]], ''Sandinista!'' was their most controversial album to date, both politically and musically.&lt;ref&gt;Jaffee, Larry (1987). ''The Politics of Rock'' (Popular Music and Society), pp. 19–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical opinion was divided, often within individual reviews. ''[[Trouser Press]]'''s [[Ira Robbins]] described half the album as "great", half as "nonsense" and worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=clash| title = Clash| accessdate =4 September 2008| publisher=Trouser Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Rolling Stone Album Guide|New Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', [[Dave Marsh]] argued, "''Sandinista!'' is nonsensically cluttered. Or rather ''seems'' nonsensically cluttered. One of the Clash's principal concerns&amp;nbsp;... is to avoid being stereotyped."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Dave. "The Clash". In Dave Marsh and John Swenson, eds. (1983), ''The New Rolling Stone Record Guide'' (Random House/Rolling Stone Press), pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; The album fared well in America, charting at number 24.&lt;ref name="rockhall-The_Clash"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash| title = The Clash| accessdate =19 November 2007| date = 10 March 2003| work=Induction| publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the band came out with a single, "[[This Is Radio Clash]]", that further demonstrated their ability to mix diverse influences such as dub and hip hop. They set to work on their fifth album in September, originally planning it as a 2-LP set with the title ''Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg''. Jones produced one cut, but the other members were dissatisfied. Production duties were handed to [[Glyn Johns]], and the album was reconceived as a single LP, and released as ''[[Combat Rock]]'' in May 1982. Though filled with offbeat songs, experiments with [[sound collage]], and a spoken word vocal by [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], it contained two "radio friendly" tracks. The leadoff single in the US was "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]", released in June 1982. Another Jones feature in a rock and roll style similar to "Train in Vain", it received heavy airplay on [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] stations. The follow-up, "[[Rock the Casbah]]", put lyrics addressing the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music to a bouncy dance rhythm. (The singles were released in the opposite order in the UK, where they were both preceded by "[[Know Your Rights]]".) The music for "Rock the Casbah" was composed by Headon, who performed not only the percussion but also the piano and bass heard on the recorded version.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=380}} It was the band's biggest US hit ever, charting at number 8, and the video was put into heavy rotation by MTV. The album itself was the band's most successful, hitting number 2 in the UK and number 7 in the US.

===Disintegration and break up: 1982–86===
After ''Combat Rock'', the Clash began to disintegrate. Headon was asked to leave the band just before the album's release because heroin addiction was damaging his health and drumming.{{sfn|Letts|2001|loc=1:07:11–1:08:09, 1:08:59–1:09:54.}}&lt;ref name=Cromelin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cromelin |first=Richard |date=31 January 1988 |title=Strummer on Man, God, Law and the Clash |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.strummernews.com/latimes88.html |accessdate=19 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203022/http://strummernews.com/latimes88.html |archivedate=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chimes was brought back to drum for the next few months. The loss of Headon, well-liked by the others, exposed growing friction within the band. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for [[the Who]] on a leg of their final tour in the US, including a show at New York's [[Shea Stadium]].

Though the Clash continued to tour, tension continued to increase. In early 1983, Chimes left the band after the Combat Rock Tour because of in-fighting and turmoil. He was replaced by Pete Howard for the [[US Festival]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], which the Clash co-headlined, along with [[David Bowie]] and [[Van Halen]]. The band argued with the event's promoters over inflated ticket prices, threatening to pull out unless a large donation was made to a local charity. The group ultimately performed on 28 May, the festival's New Music Day, which drew a crowd of 140,000. After the show, members of the band brawled with security staff.{{sfn|Gray|2005|p=398}} This was Jones' last appearance with the group: in September 1983, he was fired. Shortly thereafter, he became a founding member of [[General Public]], but left that band as they were recording their first album.

[[Nick Sheppard]], formerly of the [[Bristol]]-based band [[The Cortinas (punk band)|the Cortinas]], and [[Vince White]] were recruited as the Clash's new guitarists. Howard continued as the drummer. The reconstituted band played its first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and launched into the self-financed Out of Control Tour, travelling widely over the winter and into early summer. At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new album would be released early in the new year.

The recording sessions for ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' were chaotic, with manager Bernard Rhodes and Strummer working in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]]. Most of the music was played by studio musicians, with Sheppard and later White flying in to provide guitar parts. Struggling with Rhodes for control of the band, Strummer returned home. The band went on a busking tour of public spaces in cities throughout the UK, playing acoustic versions of their hits and popular cover tunes.

After a concert in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], Strummer went to Spain to clear his mind. While he was abroad, the first single from ''Cut the Crap'', the mournful "[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]", was released to mostly negative reviews. "CBS had paid an advance for it so they had to put it out", Strummer later explained. "I just went, 'Well fuck this', and fucked off to the mountains of Spain to sit sobbing under a palm tree, while Bernie had to deliver a record."&lt;ref name="joestrummer.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&amp;p=2&amp;aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&amp;c=1&amp;CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&amp;XUZHs |title=Interview |work=Record Collector |year=2000 |accessdate=5 December 2008 |publisher=Joe Strummer Resource |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005220200/http://www.joestrummer.us/?n9P81fmSnwwFUbhFAMuAAxe6bb31IUP&amp;p=2&amp;aOHDhtT57WPxn9Z7bWGQa3BBQbFVu17LfZSa&amp;c=1&amp;CxeQAdg5hVrrDtzOUCasLrnVGV7&amp;XUZHs |archivedate=5 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critic Dave Marsh later championed "This Is England" as one of the top 1001 rock singles of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Dave (1989). ''The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made'' (Penguin), pp. 77–80. {{ISBN|0-14-012108-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The single has also received retroactive praise from [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] and others.

"This Is England", much like the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been drastically re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album,&lt;ref name=Cromelin/&gt; although he did profess that "I really like 'This Is England' and [album track] 'North and South' is a vibe."&lt;ref name="joestrummer.us"/&gt; In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had been a lot of intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut up and let someone else have a go at it."{{sfn|Johnstone|2006|p=104}}

This period of disintegration which feature interviews with members of the Clash is the subject matter of Danny Garcia's book and film, ''The Rise and Fall of the Clash''.&lt;ref name="The Rise and Fall of The Clash"&gt; author= Danny Garcia publisher= Thin Man Press, London. ASIN 956247326.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations, reunions and Strummer's death: 1986–present===
After the break-up, Strummer contacted Jones in an effort to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, [[Big Audio Dynamite]] (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, ''[[No.&amp;nbsp;10, Upping St.]]'', which he also co-produced.&lt;ref name="joestrummer.us"/&gt; With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called [[Havana 3am]]. Headon recorded a [[Waking Up (Topper Headon album)|solo album]], before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.

On 2 March 1991, a reissue of "Should I Stay or Should I Go" gave the Clash its first and only number 1 UK single. That same year, Strummer reportedly cried when he learned that "Rock the Casbah" had been adopted as a slogan by US bomber pilots in the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/strummer.html|title=Revolution Rock: Documentary Pays Tribute to Clash Frontman Joe Strummer|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 February 2008|accessdate=13 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313094918/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/strummer.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Strummer, Jones and Simonon cooperated in compiling of the live album ''[[From Here to Eternity: Live|From Here to Eternity]]'' and video documentary ''[[The Clash: Westway to the World|Westway to the World]]''. On 7 November 2002, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] announced that the Clash would be inducted the following March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Simonon did not want to participate because he believed that playing at the high-priced event would not have been in the spirit of the Clash. Strummer's sudden death from a congenital heart defect on 22 December 2002 ended any possibility of a full reunion. In March 2003, the Hall of Fame induction took place; the band members inducted were Strummer, Jones, Simonon, Chimes and Headon.&lt;ref name="rockhall-The_Clash" /&gt;

In early 2008, [[Carbon/Silicon]], a new band founded by Mick Jones and his former London SS bandmate [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]], entered into a six-week residency at London's Inn on the Green. On opening night, 11 January, Headon joined the band for the Clash's "Train in Vain". An encore followed with Headon playing drums on "Should I Stay or Should I Go". This was the first time since 1982 that Headon and Jones had performed together on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2012, Strummer's daughters, Jazz and Lola, gave a rare interview to discuss the upcoming tenth anniversary of their father's passing, his legacy and the possibility of a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. But I think if Dad hadn't died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lena Corner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/28/joe-strummer-daughters-jazz-lola |title=Our dad, Joe Strummer, remembered &amp;#124; Life and style |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=1 September 2013 |location=London |date=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2013 in the UK (and a day later in the US), the Clash released ''[[Sound System (album)|Sound System]]'', a twelve-disc box set featuring their studio albums completely re-mastered on eight discs with an additional three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both [[Don Letts]] and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' fanzine as well as a brand new edition curated and designed by Paul Simonon and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and an exclusive Clash poster. Both Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project including the re-masters. The box set came in a package shaped as an 80s [[ghetto blaster]]. The box set was accompanied by ''[[5 Album Studio Set]]'', which contains only the first five studio albums (excluding ''[[Cut the Crap]]''), and ''[[The Clash Hits Back]]'', a 33-track, two-CD best of collection sequenced to copy the set played by the band at the Brixton Fair Deal (now the Academy) on 19 July 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Hann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/21/the-clash-box-set-remastered-albums-rarities |title=The Clash to release new box set of remastered albums and rarities &amp;#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=1 September 2013 |location=London |date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sound-System-The-Clash/dp/B008U3NU38/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369126674&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+clash+sound+system |title=Sound System: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date=25 May 2013 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3 September 2013 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it likely would have never happened. Jones said "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance was going to happen anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way for the rest of the time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the ''Sound System'' box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." Jones said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Greene |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-clashs-mick-jones-this-is-it-for-me-20130830 |title=Mick Jones on Clash Box Set &amp;#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-08-30 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2013 the three surviving members of the classic lineup (Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and Topper Headon) reunited again for an exclusive BBC Radio 6 Music show to promote their legacy and the release of ''Sound System''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomusik.it/10713/i-clash-si-riuniscono-per-una-notte-alla-bbc-radio/ |title=I Clash si riuniscono per una notte alla BBC Radio &amp;#124; Radiomusik musica e programmi radio live |publisher=Radiomusik.it |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2013 interview with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion and in fact new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought would be the next Mescaleros album. Jones said "We wrote a batch – we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was he was going to go into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd come in all night and we'd all work all night." Jones said months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/story/mick-jones-secret-strummer-tunes-could-have-sparked-the-clash-s-comeback_3892188 |title=The Clash – Mick Jones: 'Secret Joe Strummer Tunes Could Have Sparked The Clash's Comeback'|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The Clash's music was often charged with [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideological sentiments.&lt;ref name="mtv_artist_clash"&gt;{{cite web

The Clash are credited with pioneering the advocacy of radical politics in punk rock, and were dubbed the "Thinking Man's Yobs" by ''NME''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McCarthy, Jackie|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/1999-12-22/music/white-riot.php|title=White Riot|date=22 December 1999|work=Seattle Weekly|accessdate=26 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many early punk bands, the Clash protested against monarchy and aristocracy; however, unlike many of their peers, they rejected nihilism.&lt;ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" /&gt; Instead, they found solidarity with a number of contemporary liberation movements and were involved with such groups as the [[Anti-Nazi League]]. On 30 April 1978, the Clash played the [[Rock Against Racism]] concert in London's [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]] for a crowd of 50–100,000 people;{{sfn|Gray|2005|pp=277–278}} Strummer wore a T-shirt identifying two left-wing revolutionary groups: the words "Brigade {{sic}} Rosse"—Italy's [[Brigate Rosse|Red Brigades]]—appeared alongside the insignia of West Germany's [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;ref name="Hazan-Rude_Boy"&gt;{{cite video

 | quote  = The moment that best exemplifies the Clash&amp;nbsp;... took place in August 1977, at a music festival in Liege, Belgium. The band was playing before 20,000 people and had been under fire from a crowd that was throwing bottles at the stage. But that wasn't what bothered lead singer Joe Strummer. What enraged him was a 10-foot-high barbed-wire fence strung between concrete posts and forming a barrier between the group and the audience&amp;nbsp;... [He] jumped from the stage and attacked the fence, trying to pull it down&amp;nbsp;... The Clash were the only performers at the show who tried to do anything about the obstacle. They were more willing to run the risk of the crowd than to tolerate barbed wire that was meant to fend off that crowd. This is more or less what the Clash were about: fighting the good fight that few others would fight.&lt;ref name="Gilmore"/&gt;

Their politics were made explicit in the lyrics of such early recordings as "White Riot", which encouraged disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; "[[Career Opportunities (song)|Career Opportunities]]", which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routinised jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and "London's Burning", about the bleakness and boredom of life in the inner city.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (2004), pp. 145–146, 158–159, 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Caroline Coon]], who was associated with the punk scene, argued that "[t]hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as we went into [[Thatcherism]]".{{sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=190}} The scope of the band's political interests widened on later recordings.

The title of ''Sandinista!'' celebrated the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|left-wing rebels]] who had recently overthrown Nicaraguan despot [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]], and the album was filled with songs driven by other political issues extending far beyond British shores: "[[Washington Bullets (song)|Washington Bullets]]" addressed covert military operations around the globe, while "The Call-Up" was a meditation on US draft policies.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (2004), pp. 355–356&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|Press|1996|p=72}} ''Combat Rock''{{'}}s "[[Straight to Hell (song)|Straight to Hell]]" is described by scholars [[Simon Reynolds]] and Joy Press as an "around-the-world-at-war-in-five-verses guided tour of hell-zones where boy-soldiers had languished."{{sfn|Reynolds|Press|1996|p=72}}

The band's political sentiments were reflected in their resistance to the music industry's usual profit motivations; even at their peak, tickets to shows and souvenirs were reasonably priced.&lt;ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" /&gt; The group insisted that CBS sell their double and triple album sets ''London Calling'' and ''Sandinista!'' for the price of a single album each (then £5), succeeding with the former and compromising with the latter by agreeing to sell it for £5.99 and forfeit all their performance royalties on its first 200,000 sales.&lt;ref&gt;Gray (2004), p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; These "VFM" (value for money) principles meant that they were constantly in debt to CBS, and only started to break even around 1982.&lt;ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies" /&gt;

[[Jake Burns]] of [[Stiff Little Fingers]], the first major punk band from Northern Ireland, explained the record's impact:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he big watershed was the Clash album—that was go out, cut your hair, stop mucking about time, y'know. Up to that point we'd still been singing about bowling down California highways. I mean, it meant nothing to me. Although the Damned and the Pistols were great, they were only exciting musically; lyrically, I couldn't really make out a lot if it&amp;nbsp;... [T]o realise that [the Clash] were actually singing about their own lives in West London was like a bolt out of the blue.{{sfn|Strongman|2008|pp=188–189}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Clash also inspired many musicians who were only loosely associated, if at all, with punk. The band's embrace of ska, reggae and England's Jamaican subculture helped provide the impetus for the [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] movement that emerged amid the fallout of the punk explosion.{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|p=298}} Other musicians who began performing while the Clash were active and acknowledged their debt to the band include [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Aztec Camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gray, Chris| title = Fans Mourn Passing of the Political Man of Punk|work=The Independent |location=UK| date = 24 December 2002| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/fans-mourn-passing-of-the-political-man-of-punk-611922.html|accessdate=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U2]]'s [[the Edge]] has compared the Clash's inspirational effect to that of the [[Ramones]]—both gave young rock musicians at large the "sense that the door of possibility had swung open."&lt;ref&gt;Stockman, Steve (2005). ''Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2'' (Relevant Media Group), p. 10. {{ISBN|0-9760357-5-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote, "The Clash, more than any other group, kick-started a thousand garage bands across Ireland and the UK&amp;nbsp;... [S]eeing them perform was a life-changing experience."&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com-30_the_clash"/&gt; [[Bono]] has described the Clash as "the greatest rock band. They wrote the rule book for U2."{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|p=262}}

In later years, the Clash's influence can be heard in American political punk bands such as [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Anti-Flag]], [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], [[Green Day]], and [[Rise Against]] as well as in the political hard rock of early [[Manic Street Preachers]].{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|pp=192, 251, 257, 298, 318–319}} California's Rancid, in particular, are known as "incurable Clash zealots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kot, Greg| title = Rancid: ''Indestructible''| work=Rolling Stone| date = 4 September 2003| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rancid/albums/album/298299/review/6067899/indestructible|accessdate=28 August 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080601214212/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rancid/albums/album/298299/review/6067899/indestructible |archivedate = 1 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title track of the band's album ''[[Indestructible (Rancid album)|Indestructible]]'' proclaims, "I'll keep listening to that great Joe Strummer!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Milner, Greg| title = Punk Survivors Keep Up the Fight| work=Spin| date = 25 September 2003| url =http://www.spin.com/reviews/rancid-indestructible-hellcatt|accessdate=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer Antonio Ambrosio, The Clash's involvement with Jamaican musical and production styles has inspired similar cross-cultural efforts by bands such as [[Bad Brains]], [[Massive Attack]], [[311 (band)|311]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[No Doubt]].{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|p=257}} [[Jakob Dylan]] of [[the Wallflowers]] lists ''London Calling'' as the record that "changed his life".&lt;ref name=JS-Times/&gt; Bands identified with the [[post-punk revival|garage rock revival]] of the late 1990s and 2000s such as Sweden's [[the Hives]], Australia's [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]], Britain's [[the Libertines]], and America's [[the White Stripes]] and [[the Strokes]] evince the Clash's influence.{{sfn|D'Ambrosio|2004|pp=262–263}} Among the many latter-day British acts identified as having been inspired by the Clash are [[Babyshambles]], [[the Futureheads]], [[The Charlatans (English band)|the Charlatans]] and [[Arctic Monkeys]].&lt;ref name=SL&gt;{{cite web| title =Ten Modern Bands Inspired by The Clash| publisher =ShortList.com| url =http://80.244.189.116/ShortList.aspx?Id=146&amp;sec=1| accessdate =28 August 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before [[M.I.A.

In June 2009 Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band opened their concert in Hyde Park, London, with 'London Calling'. The concert was later released on DVD as ''[[London Calling: Live in Hyde Park|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: London Calling – Live in Hyde Park]]''. [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Little Steven]], [[Dave Grohl]] and [[Elvis Costello]] performed the same song at the [[Grammys]] in 2003 as a tribute to [[Joe Strummer]] who died the year before.

'''''The Concert''''' ({{circa}} 1664) is a painting by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] which depicts a man and two women performing music. It belonged to the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in [[Boston]], but was [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft|stolen in 1990]] and remains missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/18/the-500-million-gardner-museum-heist-have-you-seen-these-paintings/ |title=The $500 Million Gardner Museum Heist: Have You Seen These Paintings?|date=March 18, 2013| publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; On account of this circumstance, it has been the subject of a large number of popular allusions.

== Description ==
The picture measures 28.5 by 25.5 inches (72.5 by 64.7 centimetres) and shows three musicians: a young woman sitting at a [[harpsichord]], a man playing the [[lute]], and a woman who is singing. The harpsichord's upturned lid is decorated with an Arcadian landscape; its bright coloring stands in contrast to the two paintings hanging on the wall to the right and left. A [[viola da gamba]] can be seen lying on the floor. The musicians are identified by their clothing and surroundings as members of the upper [[bourgeoisie]]. The male lute player, for instance, wears a shoulder belt and a sword. And for all its restraint, the black and white marble flooring is luxurious and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Montias, Vermeer and His Milieu, Princeton University 1991, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ev1xavyduGYC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=%22The+Concert%22+Vermeer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinqbbkjsbaAhXECMAKHQXDAEUQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Concert%22%20Vermeer&amp;f=false p.192]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the two paintings in the background, the one on the right is ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' by [[Dirck Van Baburen]], which belonged to Vermeer's mother-in-law, [[Maria Thins]]. The work also appears in his ''[[Lady Seated at a Virginal]]'', probably painted some six years after ''The Concert''. The painting on the left is a wild [[pastoral]] landscape. The musical theme in Dutch painting in Vermeer's time often connoted [[love]] and seduction, but in this case the feeling is more ambiguous. Although the presence of Van Baburen's sexually exuberant picture suggests such an interpretation, its function may be to provide a contrast with the actual domestic situation. In the same way, the peaceful scenes depicted on the harpsichord contrast with the wild landscape painting on the wall.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/cat_about/concert.html|title=Understanding The Concert by Johannes Vermeer|first=Jonathan|last=Janson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Whereabouts unknown ==
Although ''The Concert'' has been dated stylistically to the mid-1660s, it is first documented only in 1780.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It was then acquired by [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] in an 1892 auction in Paris for $5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70044970&amp;trkid=2361637|title=Netflix - Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently displayed in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]]. On the night of March 18, 1990, thieves disguised as policemen [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft|stole 13 works out of the museum]], including ''The Concert''. To this day the painting has not resurfaced; it is thought to be the most valuable work currently unrecovered, with a value estimated at over $200,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/stolen/index.html Stolen], a documentary about the theft of ''The Concert'', from the PBS website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even before this episode, the theft of this painting was made the subject of a 1964 episode of ''[[List of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes|The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' called "Ten Minutes from Now".&lt;ref&gt;Noted under Trivia at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394090/reference IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/The_Alfred_Hitchcock_Hour_-_Ten_Minutes_from_Now The Hitchcock Zone]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the real theft, the stolen painting has figured in various TV and animated series as well as two novels:  ''An Object of Beauty'' by [[Steve Martin]] (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Published by Hachette UK,, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OePFrddBuYEC&amp;pg=PT97&amp;lpg=PT97&amp;dq=%22An+Object+of+Beauty%27%27%22++%22Vermeer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Smlb5wTIPH&amp;sig=UW5GsuK2gy2wRpwCxF2upmEkG0g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLtPyk0cTaAhUQW8AKHT2_AX4Q6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22An%20Object%20of%20Beauty''%22%20%20%22Vermeer%22&amp;f=false chapter 33]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Medusa Plot|''The Medusa Plot'']] by [[Gordon Korman]] (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Published by Scholastic Inc, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rpiA8vnv0JIC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=%22The+Medusa+Plot%22++%22Vermeer%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y_ML-ZlPyB&amp;sig=zJoHW2zLfaevdqTfY2WwEB0QL3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiymMbx08TaAhVnKsAKHQcuDCcQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Medusa%20Plot%22%20%20%22Vermeer%22&amp;f=false p.132]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tracy Chevalier]]’s historical novel ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (novel)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' (1999), Vermeer paints ''The Concert'' at the same time that he is painting ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'', and the episode is also repeated in [[Girl with a Pearl Earring (novel)|the 2003 film]] made from it.

'''''The Freewoman''''' was a feminist weekly published between 23 November 1911 and 10 October 1912 and edited by [[Dora Marsden]] and [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freewoman: A Weekly Feminist Review|url=http://www.modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=FreewomanCollection|work=The Modernist Journals Project|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Freewoman'' published articles on women's waged work, housework, motherhood, the [[suffrage movement]], and literature, its notoriety and influence rested on its frank discussions of sexuality, morality, and marriage.  ''The Freewoman'' urged tolerance for male homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Cohler, Deborah. Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth Century Britain. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010. p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; advocated for [[free love]], and encouraged women to remain unmarried.

''The Freewoman'''s editorial stance distinguished it sharply from the attitude of [[suffragists]] like [[Millicent Fawcett]], who was so disturbed at the journal's approach to sexuality that she tore the first issue into little pieces.

In March 1912 Gawthorpe resigned due to poor health and disagreements with Marsden. In September 1912, [[W H Smith]] refused to carry ''The Freewoman'' and in October 1912, the journal folded.

Although its circulation probably never exceeded 200, it had a significant influence in [[Modernist]] circles. Among its contributors were [[Rebecca West]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Edward Carpenter]], and [[Guy Aldred]].

In June 1913 Marsden started ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' which was more concerned with literary modernism than feminism and was funded by [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]]. In 1914, ''The New Freewoman'' became [[The Egoist (periodical)|''The Egoist'']].

==Creation of ''The Freewoman''==
''The Freewoman'' was a feminist journal/newspaper in publication during the early twentieth century in Britain. [[Dora Marsden]] founded ''The Freewoman'' in November 1911, but the paper was also co-edited by [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism: Dora Marsden, Votes for Women and The Freewoman|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|pages=632|doi=10.1080/09612020200200341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being edited by both women, Marsden initially used Gawthorpe for her name and influence in the feminist society to give the paper creditability and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|pages=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was rooted in more radical feminist ideals that stretched beyond strictly suffrage. Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers. After the first issue of ''The Freewoman'', the female readers, many of whom grew up during the Victorian era of feminism, thought the views presented did not reflect the ideals of the feminism they had grown to understand. One of their main objectives was the papers very obvious discussions and references to sex. 
In the paper’s first issue it stated that it sought to represent the feminist movement through intellectual thought by actual feminists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|journal=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It touched on the idea of marriage, motherhood, sexuality, women’s rights, and the domestic man. Its radical approach on these ideas seemed misplaced for the twentieth century, however its influence amongst the feminist and sexual radicals was greater than its small circulation implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman Journal in Early Twentieth-century England|journal=Women's History Review|year=1995|volume=4|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1080/09612029500200074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Freewoman'' ideals==
According to many of the female readers, ''The Freewoman'' expressed beliefs more radical than most feminists during the early twentieth century. In the paper’s first issue it discussed the definition of marriage. To ''The Freewoman'' marriage did not only mean men and women, nor did it mean that a couple had to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the women who were raised during the Victorian era, this concept of marriage did not register with them. Marriage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and even in the current day, meant a man and woman and usually resulted in children. However, with the job opportunities and improved possibility of economic and social independence from the years preceding and during the war, women were able to forge a new identity separate from the confines of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As feminism began to grow throughout the twentieth century the paper began to put a new label on these radical and forward thinking feminists: The New Woman.

''The Freewoman'' began to redefine and transform feminism from being solely related to suffrage and the suffrage movement, but to show feminism in its purest form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=Philosophical vacuity and political ineptitude’: The Freewoman’s critique of the suffrage movement|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|page=614|doi=10.1080/09612020200200340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to say that feminists needed to strive for more than just the right to vote. Marsden’s rather liberal and forward thinking opinion on the definition of feminism is what caused future debates amongst other prominent feminists of the time. The New Woman was to be a politically, socially and economically independent woman. ''The Freewoman'' did not reject the domestic life that most women during the twentieth century lived, but rather used the domestic life of a woman as a tool to show women that they could take an active role in protecting their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the paper’s third publication it discussed the idea of the domestic man. It raised the idea that a man can do the work of a woman in the domestic sphere. The goal was to “work towards the evolution of the New Housekeeping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rationale hinged on the argument that the house and its inner workings were no different from that of a restaurant or even a milliner’s shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also suggested the idea of communal cooking and man and wife dividing up the household duties that would allow women to work outside of the domestic life. This idea of the domestic man also supported the idea of the homosexual family. With a man being able to do the domestic work, it presented the idea that man and man could live as a couple. To say that this openly happened is not likely, however ''The Freewoman'' implied and even supported this life style choice. The paper again showed its liberal and progressive beliefs with its idea of the domestic man.

The Freewoman stated that: "It is high time for a reversal of the servile notion of government from above. Free government proceeds from the individual outwards, not from the sum total inwards. It is for this reason that, considering the trend of Syndicalism, we are of the opinion that it is likely to make a far more intimate appeal to the nation than Socialism ever has. Its aims are the same: the means of production and exchange to be the property of the community as a whole, but under Syndicalism the control of conditions of work are to be in the hands of those who perform it."&lt;ref&gt;The Servile State, From the Freewoman, Reproduced in The Syndiacalist, London June 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big Debate==
With the papers candid nature of expressing many of its beliefs, there were bound to be arguments. One of it biggest criticisms and continuous debates with some readers came from its stance on the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=617}}&lt;/ref&gt; It openly challenged the ideals of the movement and its organization. Despite being co-edited, these views were mainly the opinions of Marsden and not Gawthorpe. With the paper’s belief that feminism was more than just the right to vote, its views on the suffrage movement were unlike most feminists in Britain during the twentieth century. During this era women were fighting for the right to vote and to be regarded as political equals amongst men. Not all feminists believed in complete female independence from the strongholds of the normative female life. ''The Freewoman'' wanted to stray away from this concept of feminism. It wanted women to not only be politically equal, but economically and socially self-sufficient as well. It rooted its beliefs in complete female independence from the norms of society.

==The Closing Years==
The publication of ''The Freewoman'' did not last long. Its final paper was published in 1912, but was later revived in May 1913 with the new title ''The New Freewoman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the attempts to revive the paper and inspire more readers, the paper finally ended publication in 1914. Its publication did not reach a large market, mostly due to its views on feminism and the suffrage movement. The paper, but more specifically Dora Marsden’s beliefs and opinions were far too liberal and progressive for its early twentieth century audience. The audience was still rather conservative in their views. It would not be until the years of the Great War that women began to take small strides in some of the ideals that ''The Freewoman'' expressed. Despite having an extremely small circulation, the paper’s strong beliefs and opinions were widely known and debated against and provided the impetus for future feminist activists.

'''''The Hay Wain''''' is a painting by [[John Constable]], finished in 1821, which depicts a rural scene on the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] between the English counties of [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]]. It hangs in the [[National Gallery]] in London and is regarded as "Constable's most famous image"&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2006/constable/stour_river.shtm|title=Early Six-Foot Stour River Paintings|work=Constable's Great Landscapes: The Six-Foot Paintings|publisher=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest and most popular [[English art|English paintings]].&lt;ref name =vote/&gt;

Painted in oils on canvas, the work depicts as its central feature three horses pulling what in fact appears to be a wood [[wain]] or large farm cart across the river. [[Willy Lott's Cottage]], also the subject of an eponymous painting by Constable, is visible on the far left. The scene takes place near [[Flatford Mill]] in Suffolk, though since the Stour forms the border of two counties, the left bank is in Suffolk and the landscape on the right bank is in Essex.

''The Hay Wain'' is one of a series of paintings by Constable called the "six-footers", large-scale canvasses which he painted for the annual [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|summer exhibitions]] at the [[Royal Academy]]. As with all of the paintings in this series Constable produced a full-scale oil sketch for the work; this is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. Constable originally exhibited the finished work with the title ''Landscape: Noon'', suggesting that he envisaged it as belonging to the classical landscape tradition of representing the cycles of nature.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt;

==History==

Flatford Mill was owned by Constable's father. The house on the left side of the painting belonged to a neighbor, Willy Lott, a [[tenant farmer]], who was said to have been born in the house and never to have left it for more than four days in his lifetime. [[Willy Lott's Cottage]] has survived to this day practically unaltered, but none of the trees in the painting exist today.

Although ''The Hay Wain'' is revered today as one of the greatest British paintings, when it was originally exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1821 (under the title ''Landscape: Noon''), it failed to find a buyer. 

[[File:Flatford Mill, site of the HayWain.JPG|thumb|left|The site where ''The Hay Wain'' was painted, now a tourist destination, in 2010.]]
It was considerably better received in France where it was praised by [[Théodore Géricault]]. The painting caused a sensation when it was exhibited with other works by Constable at the 1824 [[Paris Salon]] (it has been suggested that the inclusion of Constable's paintings in the exhibition was a tribute to Géricault, who died early that year). In that exhibition, ''The Hay Wain'' was singled out for a gold medal awarded by [[Charles X of France]], a cast of which is incorporated into the picture's frame. The works by Constable in the exhibition inspired a new generation of French painters, including [[Eugène Delacroix]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Sold at the exhibition with three other Constables to the dealer John Arrowsmith, ''The Hay Wain'' was brought back to England by another dealer, D. T. White; he sold it to a Mr. Young who resided in [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. It was there that the painting came to the attention of the collector Henry Vaughan and the painter [[Charles Robert Leslie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=865555|title=The Haywain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the death of his friend Mr. Young, Vaughan bought the painting from the former's estate; in 1886 he presented it to the National Gallery in London, where it still hangs today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/john-constable-the-hay-wain/*/key-facts|title=The Haywain – facts|publisher=The National Gallery|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904004453/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/john-constable-the-hay-wain/*/key-facts|archivedate=4 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his will Vaughan bequeathed the full-scale oil sketch for ''The Hay Wain'', made with a [[palette knife]], to the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/constable-7.shtml|title=The Haywain|publisher=oldandsold.com|accessdate=26 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825010038/http://www.oldandsold.com/articles29/constable-7.shtml|archivedate=25 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hay Wain'' was voted the second most popular painting in any British gallery, second only to [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]]'s ''[[The Fighting Temeraire|Fighting Temeraire]]'', in a [[Greatest Painting in Britain Vote|2005 poll]] organised by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme.&lt;ref name=vote&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4214824.stm|title=Turner wins 'great painting' vote | work=BBC News | date=5 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June 2013 a protester, reported to be connected with [[Fathers 4 Justice]], glued a photograph of a young boy to the painting while it was on display at the National Gallery. The work was not permanently damaged.&lt;ref name=protest&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23099594|title=Constable's The Hay Wain attacked at the National Gallery | work=BBC News | date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the reason for the wagon stopping at the ford was to allow the river water to cool the horses' legs and to soak the wheels. In hot dry weather, the wooden wheels would shrink away from their metal rims. Wetting the wheels reduced the shrinkage and kept the outer metal band in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=RJhFDZl1APMC&amp;pg=PA79|title=Art Explained: The world's greatest paintings explored and explained|first=Robert|last=Cumming|authorlink=Robert Cumming (art historian)|date=1 May 2008|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |accessdate=27 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rev. William Keble Martin''' (9 July 1877, [[Radley]] – 26 November 1969, [[Woodbury, Devon|Woodbury]]) was a [[Church of England]] [[Anglican_ministry#Priests|priest]], [[botany|botanist]] and [[botanical illustrator]], known for his ''Concise British Flora in Colour''.

The ''Concise British Flora'' was published in May 1965 when the author was 88. The book was the result of 60 years' meticulous fieldwork and exquisite painting skills, and became an immediate best-seller. He completed over 1,400 paintings in colour and many black-and-white drawings before the book was finally published.
[[File:Keble Martin Chapel, Dartmoor - geograph.org.uk - 381510.jpg|thumb|Keble Martin "Chapel", by the [[Walla Brook|Western Walla Brook]], [[Dartmoor]]]]

==Life and work==
[[File:St Blaise, Haccombe - geograph.org.uk - 825022.jpg|thumb|St Blaise, [[Haccombe]], Reverend Martin held the position of Archpriest here from 1921 to 1934. ]]
Keble Martin was the grandson of Dr [[George Moberly]], headmaster of [[Winchester College|Winchester]]  and later [[Bishop of Salisbury]]. He was brother to architect Arthur Campbell Martin CVO FRIBA (1875-1963) and was also connected to [[John Keble]] of the [[Oxford Movement]]. His father was appointed as the Rector of [[Dartington]], near Totnes, when William was 14 years old.

He  was educated at [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], and went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1896 to read Greek Philosophy and Botany. He trained for the church at [[Cuddesdon Theological College]]. After ordination, he worked in industrial parishes in the north and Midlands (one of these was [[Wath-upon-Dearne]], the subject of his first book) and, in the First World War, as a [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] in France. In 1921 he was offered the benefice of [[Haccombe]] and [[Coffinswell]] in [[Devon]] and in 1934 became the incumbent of [[St Michael and All Angels, Great Torrington|St Michael and All Angels]], [[Great Torrington]]. (He was the [[Archpriest]] of Haccombe and Rector of Coffinswell.) Keble Martin saw a vision of a new church in a dream, and his brother architect transformed the dream into reality - now a listed building, St Luke the Evangelist Church at [[Milber]], [[Newton Abbot]] is remarkable for its exceptional interior space and extraordinary plan with three angled naves, linked by arcades with granite columns, which converge on the central altar. The exterior walls are white render with a pyramidal copper-clad roof on a squat square tower. Keble Martin retired in 1949 at the age of 72, but continued to work in the church.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] in 1928, and later edited with G. T. Fraser the first volume of a comprehensive ''Flora of Devon'' (1939). In June 1966 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from [[Exeter University]]. Four of his designs for an issue of wild flower stamps were accepted by the [[Royal Mail]] and issued in April 1967. He published his autobiography, ''Over the Hills'', shortly before he died in 1969 at the age of 92 at [[Woodbury, Devon|Woodbury]].

==Family life==
William Keble Martin married twice: in 1909 Violet Chaworth-Musters (d. 1963) and then in 1965 Florence Lewis. His children were three daughters and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1968) Over the Hills&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5552">'''Wisdom literature''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]] common in the [[ancient Near East]]. It consists of statements by [[sage (philosophy)|sages]] and [[Wisdom|wise]] men that offer teachings about divinity and [[virtue]]. Although this genre uses techniques of traditional oral story-telling, it was disseminated in written form.

The literary genre of [[mirrors for princes]], which has a long history in [[Islamic literature|Islamic]] and Western [[Renaissance literature]], is a secular cognate of wisdom literature. In [[Classical Antiquity]], the [[didactic]] poetry of [[Hesiod]], particularly his ''[[Works and Days]],'' was regarded as a source of knowledge similar to the wisdom literature of [[Egypt]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Israel]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Ancient Egyptian literature==
{{Main article|Ancient Egyptian philosophy}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
In [[ancient Egyptian literature]], wisdom literature belonged to the ''[[sebayt]]'' ("teaching") genre which flourished during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] and became [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical during the [[New Kingdom]]. Notable works of this genre include the ''[[Instructions of Kagemni]]'', ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'', the ''[[Instructions of Amenemhat]]'', and the ''[[Loyalist Teaching]]''.

==Biblical wisdom literature and Jewish texts==
The most famous examples of wisdom literature are found in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James L. Crenshaw|Crenshaw, James L.]] ''"The Wisdom Literature"'', in Knight, Douglas A. and Tucker, Gene M. (eds), ''The Hebrew Bible and Its Modern Interpreters'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Bernhard W.|authorlink=Bernhard Anderson|title=The Living World of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2sOAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Longmans|pages=570ff|chapter=The Beginning of Widom – Israels Wisdom literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sapiential Books ===
&lt;!--"Sapiential Books" redirects here--&gt;
The term "Sapiential Books" or "Books of Wisdom" is used in [[biblical studies]] to refer to a subset of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the [[Septuagint]] translation. There are seven of these books, namely the books of [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], the [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), the [[Book of Wisdom]] and [[Sirach]] (Ecclesiasticus). Not all the Psalms are usually regarded as belonging to the Wisdom tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Estes, D. J., ''Handbook on the Wisdom Books and Psalms'' ([[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids, MI]]: [[Baker Publishing Group]], 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4ARZdgdyAMC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 141].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Judaism]], the Books of Wisdom other than the Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach are regarded as part of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' or "Writings". In [[Christianity]], Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes are included in the [[Old Testament]] by all traditions, while Wisdom, and Sirach are regarded in some traditions as [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] works which are placed in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] within the Anglican and Protestant [[Bible translations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{wwbible|Old Testament, 355–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sapiential Books are in the broad tradition of wisdom literature that was found widely in the [[Ancient Near East]], including many religions other than Judaism.

==== Septuagint ====
{{Further|Chokhmah}}
The Greek noun ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|σοφῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|sophíā}}) is the translation of "wisdom" in the Greek [[Septuagint]] for [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] ''Ḥokmot'' ({{rtl-lang|he|[[wikt:חכמות|חכמות]]}}, {{transl|he|khakhamút}}). Wisdom is a central topic in the "Sapiential" Books, i.e., [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Song of Songs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Book of Wisdom]], [[Wisdom of Sirach]], and to some extent [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] (the last three are [[Biblical Apocrypha|Apocryphal]] / [[Deuterocanonical books]] of the [[Old Testament]]).

Women have been active participants in the development of [[radio]] (initially called "[[wireless]]") communications since its beginning. The age of [[radio communication]] began with the development of [[wireless telegraphy]] around 1900, in which [[Morse code]] could be transmitted over large distances using simple [[spark gap]] or [[carbon arc]] transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter "s" - across the Atlantic from [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

==Women as wireless operators==
Women had worked as [[telegraph]] operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047165/1901-02-02/ed-1/seq-1/ "Marconi's System Finally a Success"], ''Honolulu Republican'', February 2, 1901, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for [[Western Union]], began work as a wireless operator for [[Lee de Forest]]'s station "NY", located at 42 Broadway in [[New York City]].  She was later employed as a wireless operator at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, Louise R., "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications." ''The A.W.A. Review,'' Volume 4, 1989, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early female shipboard operators==
One of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations.  While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well.  The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the [[Cunard]] liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the [[Hague]] Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to [[Emperor Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]].
Medora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, [[Iowa]], in 1886 at the age of fourteen.  In 1897, she moved to [[Chicago]] and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary for Medora O. Newell, ''Long Beach Independent'', Long Beach, CA, January 1, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Medora Olive Newell.jpg|thumb|right|Medora Olive Newell, Early Wireless Telegrapher. Source: ''Chicago Daily Tribune, '', February 13, 1907.]]
Newell’s first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as ''Telegraph Age'' reported in 1909, “Miss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.”&lt;ref&gt;''Telegraph Age'', June 1, 1909, p. 396.&lt;/ref&gt; On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with  members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899.  The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship’s wireless operator was unable to send the message.  Newell, who, according to ''Telegraph Age'', “had a good working knowledge of wireless,” took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting.  The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jepsen, ''My Sisters Telegraphic'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Wireless Ship Act of 1910]] required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], who was employed as a wireless operator for the [[United Wireless Telegraph Company]] aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911.&lt;ref name="feminine"&gt;{{cite magazine | title=The Feminine Wireless Amateur | work= The Electrical Experimenter| date=October 1916 | pages= 396–7, 452 | url=https://archive.org/details/electricalexperi04gern/page/396/mode/1up | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl.  She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'.&lt;ref&gt;(January 3, 1911).  [http://oceanlinersblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/St.-Petersburg-Evening-Independent-3-jan-1911.png Girl Wireless Operator]. Publisher: St. Petersburg (Florida) Evening Independent&lt;/ref&gt;  She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity.  After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;(1992)[https://books.google.com/books?id=wdg8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=graynella+packer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=graynella%20packer&amp;f=false Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Oklahoma State Bar].

[[File:Graynella packer.jpg|thumb|right|Graynella Packer, Wireless Operator, 1910. Source: ''The Electrical Experimenter'', October 1916.]]
The [[Radio Act of 1912]] required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time.  The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912.&lt;ref name="operators"&gt;{{cite web | title= YL Amateur Radio Operators: 'Their Struggles and Achievements' | author= Elizabeth (VE7TLK/VA7TK)|work=qsl.net|date=2008| url= http://www.qsl.net/ylradio/archives/YLstor/images/YLSlideShow7.pdf | accessdate= 2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabelle Kelso was a native of [[Seattle, Washington]], and had been previously employed as a stenographer.  After passing a [[U.S. Navy Department]] examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that "he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position."&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Kelso of Seattle, Only Woman to Hold License as Wireless Operator," ''Atlanta Constitution'', July 7, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"May Flash Law On Wireless Girl," ''Oakland Tribune'', Oakland, California, July 25, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women as radio amateurs==
[[Amateur radio]] became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called "YLs," were Mrs. M.J. Glass of [[San Jose, California]], who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in [[New York City]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, "The Feminine Touch in Telecommunications," p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, [[Ontario]], who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;

The [[Radio Act of 1912]] also required radio amateurs to be licensed. [[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]] (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= California Death Index, 1940 - 1997 |  work= Ancestry.com | url= http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi | accessdate= 2012-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in [[San Rafael, California]], she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO.
[[File:gladys kathleen parkin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gladys Kathleen Parkin]], 1916. Source: ''The [[Electrical Experimenter]]'', October 1916.]]

Parkin was quoted in an article titled "The Feminine Wireless Amateur," which appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Electrical Experimenter'':

"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy."&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt; Use of the term "YL" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the [[American Radio Relay League]] in 1920.

==World War I and women as radio operators==
[[File:ww1 wireless women.jpg|thumb|right|Naval reservists training as wireless operators, 1916. Source: ''The Electrical Experimenter'', October 1916.]]
As the U.S. prepared to enter [[World War I]], the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war.  The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, [[Brooklyn]], where young women were trained to become wireless operators.&lt;ref name="feminine"/&gt;

In January 1917, the [[National League for Women's Service]] (NLWS) was created from the Woman’s Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Shanna|title=National League for Woman’s Service: Minute Women of Washington|url=http://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/whc/milestones/aftersuffrage/minutewomen/nlws/|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National League of Women's Services|url=http://brooklynology.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/post/2010/07/29/National-League-of-Womens-Services.aspx|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was "Wireless and Telegraphy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Ida Clyde|author-link=Ida Clyde Clarke|title=American Women and the World War|date=1918|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York; London|url=http://www.gwpda.org/wwi-www/Clarke/Clarke14.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the US entered the war in April 1917, the NLWS established  training program for female wireless operators at [[Hunter College]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WOMEN GET INTO WIRELESS SERVICE; Hunter College to Graduate Two Girls Who Are Expert Operators.CLASS DOES MEN'S WORK 100 Students Taking the Course Will Be Qualified to AidIn War Work.

==Women as broadcast radio engineers==
[[File:Violet McKenzie with wireless.png|thumb|right|[[Florence Violet McKenzie]] working with the wireless radio c1922]]
By 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE.  Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as "The Story Lady," and gave the police report over the air.

In 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air.  However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP.&lt;ref name="operators"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Remembering the Ladies-- A Salute to the Women of Early Radio | author= Donna L.
