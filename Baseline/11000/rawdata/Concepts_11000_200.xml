The '''2003 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl''' was played on December 25, 2003, in [[Honolulu]] and matched the hometown [[2003 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii Warriors]] with the [[2003 Houston Cougars football team|Houston Cougars]]. This was the second [[Hawaii Bowl]], and the first time Hawaii and Houston played each other. The game was sponsored by [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]].

==Game summary==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2018}}
Houston scored first with a 34-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Kevin Kolb]] to wide receiver [[Chad McCullar]]. David Bell kicked a 21-yard field goal to increase Houston's lead to 10-0. Hawaii got its first points of the game at the end of the first quarter on a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, [[Timmy Chang]] found wide receiver [[Clifton Herbert]] for a 49-yard touchdown pass to make the score 10-10.

Running back [[Jackie Battle]] scored on a 2-yard touchdown run for Houston, as they increased their lead to 17-10. David Bell later kicked a field goal to increase the lead to 20-10. A Hawaii field goal before half time cut the lead to 20-13.

In the third quarter, running back [[Michael Brewster Jr.]] ran in for a touchdown tying the game at 20. Timmy Chang then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jason Rivers (American football)|Jason Rivers]], and Hawaii claimed its first lead of the game at 27-20. Jackie Battle scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and the score was 27-27. Jason Rivers caught a 4-yard touchdown pass to give Hawaii a 34-27 lead. In the fourth quarter, wide receiver [[Vincent Marshall]] caught an 81-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 34. The game headed into overtime.

In overtime, Timmy Chang found [[Britton Komine]] for an 11-yard touchdown and a 41-34 Hawaii lead. Houston answered with an Anthony Evans touchdown run. After one overtime period the score was 41-41. On Houston's next possession, Jackie Battle got the handoff, and rushed 4&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The score was now 48-41 Houston. Jason Rivers tied it for Hawaii, by catching a 19-yard touchdown pass. In the third overtime period, Michael Brewster ran in for an 8-yard touchdown. The [[two-point conversion]] attempt failed leaving the score 54-48 Hawaii, and giving Houston a chance to win. Houston couldn't score, and that ended up being the final margin.

The game is also memorable for a fight between both teams that occurred after the game was over. Players from each team got into shouting matches and punches were thrown. Play-by-play announcer Dave Barnett called the ending sad and surprising.

In the Indian religious and philosophical traditions, all knowledge is traced back to the Gods and to the [[Rishis]] who saw the [[vedas]]. Thus, the advaita guru-paramparā (''Lineage of Gurus in Non-dualism'') begins with the '''Daiva-paramparā''', followed by the '''Ṛṣi-paramparā''', which includes the vedic seers [[Vasistha|Vaśiṣṭha]], his son [[Śakti Maharṣi|Śakti]], his son [[Parāśara]], his son [[Vyāsa]], (the famous redactor of the [[vedas]], he is also traditionally identified with [[Bādarāyaṇa]], the composer of the [[Brahma Sutra|Brahmasūtras]]), and Vyāsa's son [[Śuka]]. After Śuka, we turn to the '''Mānava-paramparā''', which brings us to historical times and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/advaita-parampara.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guru Parampara Sloka==
{{Advaita}}
For Advaita Guru Paramparā (Lineage of Gurus of Advaita), the following well known [[Sanskrit]] [[śloka]] among [[Smartism|Smārtas]] provides the list of the early teachers of the [[Advaita Vedānta]].,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vidya-ashramvidyaorder.org/index.V.html | Under Page: BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ABOUT SANKARA AND GAUDAPAD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book: Shri Gowdapadacharya &amp; Shri Kavale Math (A Commemoration volume). P. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another famous sloka of Advaita Guru parampara which is as follows:-

Sada Shiva Samarambham
 
Sankaracharya Madhyamam
 
Asmat aacharya Paryantham
 
Vande Guru Paramparaa
 
Thus, starting from the Great Lord Shiva, through Sankaracharya and my aacharya, the guru parampara eternally flows….

==List of Gurus in Parampara==
The above advaita guru paramparā verse salute the prominent gurus of advaita, starting from [[Nārāyaṇa]]/[[Shiva]] through [[Adi Sankara]] and his disciples, up to the Acharyas of today. The paramparā thus lists

*[[Narayana]]

{{African American topics sidebar}}
[[African Americans]] and [[Jewish Americans]] have interacted throughout much of the history of the [[United States]]. This relationship has included widely publicized cooperation and conflict, and—since the 1970s—has been an area of significant academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webb, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forman, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was strategic and significant, culminating in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. 

The relationship has also been marred by conflict and controversy related to such topics as the [[Black Power movement]], [[Zionism]], [[affirmative action]], and the role of a small number of American Jews, among a large number of other Americans and others, in the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

==Early 20th century==
During the colonial era, Jewish immigrants to [[British America]] were generally merchants from London. They settled in cities such as [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and [[Savannah, Georgia]], generally becoming part of local societies. They were [[slaveholder]]s when that was the local practice.

With major immigration of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Germany, followed by waves from [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews and blacks had a greater variety of encounters, and these were markedly different in northern cities and southern areas, many of which were still dominated by agriculture. Jewish immigrants entered northern and midwestern cities in the same period when blacks were migrating in the hundreds of thousands from the rural South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. 
{{quote|In the early 1900s, Jewish newspapers drew parallels between the Black movement out of the South and the Jews' escape from Egypt, pointing out that both Blacks and Jews lived in ghettos, and calling anti-Black riots in the South "pogroms". Stressing the similarities rather than the differences between the Jewish and Black experience in America, Jewish leaders emphasized the idea that both groups would benefit the more America moved toward a society of merit, free of religious, ethnic and racial restrictions.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/itvs/fromswastikatojimcrow/relations.html |title=From Swastika to Jim Crow: Black-Jewish Relations |publisher=[[ITVS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021002001116/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/fromswastikatojimcrow/relations.html |archivedate=October 2, 2002 |accessdate=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|The [[American Jewish Committee]], the [[American Jewish Congress]], and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] were central to the campaign against racial prejudice. Jews made substantial financial contributions to many civil rights organizations, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], the [[National Urban League|Urban League]], the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]. About 50 percent of the civil rights attorneys in the South during the 1960s were Jews, as were over 50 percent of the Whites who went to Mississippi in 1964 to challenge [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]].&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;}}

[[Marcus Garvey]] (1887–1940) was an early promoter of [[pan-Africanism]] and [[Marcus Garvey#Africa|African redemption]], and led the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]]. His push to celebrate Africa as the original homeland of African Americans, led many Jews to compare Garvey to leaders of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name="Hill, Robert A. pp. 40–53"&gt;Hill, Robert A., "Black Zionism: Marcus Garvey and the Jewish Question", in Franklin, pp. 40–53&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this was that Garvey wanted World War I peace negotiators to turn over former German colonies in southwest Africa to blacks. In that period stressing self-determination for former colonies, Zionists were promoting a "return of Jews" after 2,000 years to the historic homeland of Israel.&lt;ref name="Hill, Robert A. pp. 40–53"/&gt; At the same time, Garvey regularly criticized Jews in his columns in his newspaper ''[[Negro World]],'' for allegedly trying to destroy the black population of America.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S., 1999, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely publicized [[lynching]] of [[Leo Frank]], a Jew, in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1915 by a mob of Southerners caused many Jews to "become acutely conscious of the similarities and differences between themselves and blacks." Some had an increased sense of solidarity with blacks, as the trial exposed widespread anti-Semitism in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Diner, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial also pitted Jews against blacks because Frank's defense attorneys suggested black janitor [[Leo Frank#Jim Conley|Jim Conley]] was guilty of the murder of the white girl. They called him a "dirty, filthy, black, drunken, lying, nigger."&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, Jeffrey (2000). ''Black–Jewish Relations on Trial: Leo Frank and Jim Conley in the New South'' Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2000, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians since the late 20th century have concluded that Jim Conley did murder Phagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lindemann|first=Albert S.|title=The Jew Accused: Three Anti-Semitic Affairs (Dreyfus, Beilis, Frank) 1894-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCugGyqkYBQC&amp;pg=PA254|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44761-4}}, page 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1963, p. 435&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, Jewish daily and weekly publications frequently reported on violence against blacks, and often compared the anti-black violence in the South to the pogroms endured by Jews in the [[Russian Empire]]. They were inspired by principles of justice, and by a desire to change racist policies in United States.&lt;ref&gt;Diner, Hasia R. "Drawn Together by Self-Interest", in Franklin, pp. 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first few decades of the 20th century, the leaders of American Jewry expended time, influence and their economic resources for black endeavors, supporting civil rights, philanthropy, social service, and organizing. Historian [[Hasia Diner]] notes that "they made sure that their actions were well publicized" as part of an effort to demonstrate increasing Jewish political clout.&lt;ref&gt;Diner, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Julius Rosenwald]] was a Jewish philanthropist who donated a large part of his fortune to supporting education of blacks in the South by providing matching funds for construction of schools in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul, ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jews played a major role in the NAACP in its early decades. Jews involved in the NAACP included [[Joel Elias Spingarn]] (the first chairman), [[Arthur B. Spingarn]], and founder [[Henry Moskowitz (civil rights leader)|Henry Moskowitz]]. More recently, [[Jack Greenberg (lawyer)|Jack Greenberg]] was a leader in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopkeeper and landlord relationships==
Following the Civil War, Jewish shop-owners and landlords engaged in business with black customers and tenants, often filling a need where white business owners would not venture. This was true in most regions of the South, where Jews were often merchants in its small cities, as well as northern urban cities such as New York, where they settled in high numbers. Jewish shop-owners tended to be more civil than other whites to black customers, treating them with more dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Harry, "Negro and Jew: an Encounter in America", in Adams, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks often had more immediate contact with Jews than with other whites.&lt;ref name="Cannato, p. 355"&gt;Cannato, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, black historian [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] interpreted the role of Jews in the South as successors to the slave-barons:
{{quote|The Jew is the heir of the slave-baron in Dougherty [County, Georgia]; and as we ride westward, by wide stretching cornfields and stubby orchards of peach and pear, we see on all sides within the circle of dark forest a Land of Canaan.

Black novelist [[James Baldwin]] (1924–1987) grew up in [[Harlem]] in the years between the world wars. He wrote,
{{quote|[I]n Harlem.... our ... landlords were Jews, and we hated them. We hated them because they were terrible landlords and did not take care of the buildings. The grocery store owner was a Jew... The butcher was a Jew and, yes, we certainly paid more for bad cuts of meat than other New York citizens, and we very often carried insults home along with our meats... and the pawnbroker was a Jew—perhaps we hated him most of all.&lt;ref name="Cannato, p. 355"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Baldwin, quoted by Andrew Hacker, in Adams, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baldwin wrote other accounts of Jews that were more sympathetic.
{{quote|The first white man I ever saw was the Jewish manager who arrived to collect the rent, and he collected the rent because he did not own the building. I never, in fact, saw any of the people who owned any of the buildings in which we scrubbed and suffered for so long, until I was a grown man and famous. None of them were Jews. And I was not stupid: the grocer and the druggist were Jews, for example, and they were very very nice to me, and to us... I knew a murderer when I saw one, and the people who were trying to kill me were not Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baldwin|first1=James|title=Open Letter to the Born Again|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/159718/open-letter-born-again|website=The Nation|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] suggested that some black anti-Semitism arose from the tensions of landlord-tenant relations: 
{{quote|When we were working in Chicago, we had numerous rent strikes on the West Side, and it was unfortunately true that, in most instances, the persons we had to conduct these strikes against were Jewish landlords... We were living in a slum apartment owned by a Jew and a number of others, and we had to have a rent strike. We were paying $94 for four run-down, shabby rooms, and .... we discovered that whites ... were paying only $78 a month. We were paying 20 percent tax.

The Negro ends up paying a color tax, and this has happened in instances where Negroes actually confronted Jews as the landlord or the storekeeper. The irrational statements that have been made are the result of these confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;King, Martin Luther, Jr., ''A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr.'', James Washington (Ed.), HarperCollins, 1990, p. 669&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Entertainment==
[[File:Jolson black.jpg|thumb|right|[[Al Jolson]] in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927).]]
Jewish producers in the United States entertainment industry produced many works on black subjects in the [[Cinema of the United States|film industry]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and the music industry. Many portrayals of blacks were sympathetic, but historian Michael Rogin has discussed how some of the treatments could be considered exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rogin, "Black sacrifice, Jewish redemption", in Franklin, pp. 87–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogin also analyzes the instances when Jewish actors, such as [[Al Jolson]], portrayed blacks in [[blackface]]. He suggests that these were deliberately racist portrayals but adds that they were also expressions of the culture at the time. Blacks could not appear in leading roles in either the theatre or in movies: "Jewish blackface neither signified a distinctive Jewish racism nor produced a distinctive black anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Rogin|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Rogin|title=Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ll0muUld_I8C|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92105-4}}, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews often interpreted black culture in film, music, and plays. Historian Jeffrey Melnick argues that Jewish artists such as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[George Gershwin]] (composer of ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'') created the myth that they were the proper interpreters of Black culture, "elbowing out 'real' Black Americans in the process." Despite evidence from Black musicians and critics that Jews in the music business played an important role in paving the way for mainstream acceptance of Black culture, Melnick concludes that, "while both Jews and African-Americans contributed to the rhetoric of musical affinity, the fruits of this labor belonged exclusively to the former."&lt;ref&gt;Melnick discussed in Forman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Right to Sing the Blues: African Americans, Jews, and American Popular Song'' by Jeffrey Paul Melnick (2001), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black academic [[Harold Cruse]] viewed the arts scene as a white-dominated misrepresentation of [[African American culture|black culture]], epitomized by works like George Gershwin's folk opera, ''Porgy and Bess''.&lt;ref&gt;Cruse, Harold, (2002). ''The Essential Harold Cruse: A Reader,'' Palgreve Macmillan, pp. 61–63, 197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, Jeffrey (2004) "Harold Cruse's Worst Nightmare: Rethinking Porgy and Bess," in ''Harold Cruse's The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual Reconsidered'', Routledge, pp. 95–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some blacks have criticized Jewish movie producers for portraying blacks in a racist manner. In 1990, at an NAACP convention in Los Angeles, Legrand Clegg, founder of the Coalition Against Black Exploitation, a pressure group that lobbied against negative screen images of African Americans, alleged: {{quote|[T]he century-old problem of Jewish racism in Hollywood denies blacks access to positions of power in the industry and portrays blacks in a derogatory manner: "If Jewish leaders can complain of black anti-Semitism, our leaders should certainly raise the issue of the century-old problem of Jewish racism in Hollywood.... No Jewish people ever attacked or killed black people. But we're concerned with Jewish producers who degrade the black image. It's a genuine concern. And when we bring it up, our statements are distorted and we're dragged through the press as anti-Semites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jewish power: inside the American Jewish establishment|first=J.

Professor [[Leonard Jeffries]] echoed those comments in a 1991 speech at the Empire State Plaza Black Arts &amp; Cultural Festival in [[Albany, New York]]. Jeffries said that Jews controlled the film industry, using it to paint a negative stereotype of blacks.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/LenJeffries/OurSacredMission.html|title="Our Sacred Mission", speech at the Empire State Black Arts and Cultural Festival in Albany, New York, July 20, 1991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927100739/http://www.nbufront.org/html/MastersMuseums/LenJeffries/OurSacredMission.html|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Michael Eric Dyson Reader'' By Michael Eric Dyson; p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights movement==
{{See also|civil rights movement#American Jewish community and the Civil Rights Movement|l1=American Jewish community and the Civil Rights Movement}}
Cooperation between Jewish and African-American organizations peaked after [[World War II]]—sometimes called the "golden age" of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of each group joined in an effective movement for racial equality in the United States, and Jews funded and led some national civil rights organizations.&lt;ref name="Dollinger, pp. 4–5"&gt;Dollinger, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; This era of cooperation culminated in the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which outlawed racial or religious discrimination in schools and other public facilities, and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which prohibited discriminatory voting practices and authorized the government to oversee and review state practices.

According to historian Greenberg, "It is significant that&amp;nbsp;... a disproportionate number of white civil rights activists were [Jewish] as well. Jewish agencies engaged with their African American counterparts in a more sustained and fundamental way than did other white groups largely because their constituents and their understanding of Jewish values and Jewish self-interest pushed them in that direction."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of Jewish participation in the civil rights movement often correlated with their branch of Judaism: [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]] participated more frequently than did [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. Many Reform Jews were guided by values reflected in the Reform branch's [[Pittsburgh Platform]], which urged Jews to "participate in the great task of modern times, to solve, on the basis of justice and righteousness, the problems presented by the contrasts and evils of the present organization of society."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious leaders such as rabbis and Baptist ministers from black churches often played key roles in the civil rights movement, including [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], who marched with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] during the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]]. Sixteen Jewish leaders were arrested while heeding a call from King to march in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], in June 1964. It was the occasion of the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history, which took place at the Monson Motor Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, Taylor, 1999, ''Pillar of fire: America in the King Years, 1963–65'', Simon and Schuster, 1999, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Schneier]], President of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, wrote ''Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Jewish Community'' (1999), recounting the historic relationship between African and Jewish Americans as a way to encourage a return to strong ties following years of animosity that reached its apex during the [[Crown Heights riot]] in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schneier|first=Rabbi Marc|title=Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Jewish Community|year=1999|publisher=Jewish Lights|isbn=1580232736|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqKt95e45WkC&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Jews often supported [[desegregation]] in their communities and schools, even at the risk of diluting their close-knit Jewish communities, which often were a critical component of Jewish life.&lt;ref name="Forman, p. 21"&gt;Forman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Jewish civil rights activists===
[[File:AndrewGoodman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Andrew Goodman]]]]
The summer of 1964 was designated the [[Freedom Summer]], and many northern Jews traveled south to participate in a concentrated voter registration effort. Two Jewish activists, [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]], and one black activist, [[James Chaney]], were murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], as a result of their participation. Their deaths were considered martyrdom by some, and temporarily strengthened black-Jewish relations.

Martin Luther King, Jr., said in 1965,
{{quote|How could there be anti-Semitism among Negroes when our Jewish friends have demonstrated their commitment to the principle of tolerance and brotherhood not only in the form of sizable contributions, but in many other tangible ways, and often at great personal sacrifice. Can we ever express our appreciation to the rabbis who chose to give moral witness with us in St. Augustine during our recent protest against segregation in that unhappy city? Need I remind anyone of the awful beating suffered by Rabbi Arthur Lelyveld of Cleveland when he joined the civil rights workers there in Hattiesburg, Mississippi? And who can ever forget the sacrifice of two Jewish lives, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, in the swamps of Mississippi? It would be impossible to record the contribution that the Jewish people have made toward the Negro's struggle for freedom—it has been so great.&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Writings (1986), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Questioning the "golden age"===
Some recent scholarship suggests that the "golden age" (1955–1966) of the black–Jewish relationship was not as ideal as it is often portrayed.

Philosopher and activist [[Cornel West]] asserts that there was no golden age in which "blacks and Jews were free of tension and friction". West says that this period of black–Jewish cooperation is often downplayed by blacks and romanticized by Jews: "It is downplayed by blacks because they focus on the astonishingly rapid entry of most Jews into the middle and upper middle classes during this brief period—an entry that has spawned... resentment from a quickly growing black impoverished class. Jews, on the other hand, tend to romanticize this period because their present status as upper middle dogs and some top dogs in American society unsettles their historic self-image as progressives with a compassion for the underdog."&lt;ref&gt;West, Cornel (2001). ''Race Matters''. Beacon Press, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz]] points out that the number of northern Jews that went to the southern states numbered only a few hundred, and that the "relationship was frequently out of touch, periodically at odds, with both sides failing to understand each other's point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Kaye/Kantrowitz, Melanie (2007). ''The colors of Jews: racial politics and radical diasporism''. Indiana University Press, 2007. pp. 33, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Andrew Hacker]] wrote: "It is more than a little revealing that whites who travelled south in 1964 referred to their sojourn as their 'Mississippi summer'. It is as if all the efforts of the local blacks for voter registration and the desegregation of public facilities had not even existed until white help arrived... Of course, this was done with benign intentions, as if to say 'we have come in answer to your calls for assistance'. The problem was... the condescending tone... For Jewish liberals, the great memory of that summer has been the deaths of [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]] and—almost as an afterthought—[[James Chaney]]. Indeed, Chaney's name tends to be listed last, as if the life he lost was worth only [[Three-Fifths Compromise|three fifths]] of the others."&lt;ref name="Hacker, in Adams, p. 22"&gt;Hacker, in Adams, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Jews in the civil rights movement===
The vast majority of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] activism by American Jews was undertaken by Jews from the northern states. Jews from the southern states engaged in virtually no organized activity on behalf of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Cheryl, "The Southern Jewish Community and the Struggle for Civil Rights", in Franklin, pp. 123–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb, p. xiii"&gt;Webb, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of participation was puzzling to some northern Jews, due to the "inability of the northern Jewish leaders to see that Jews ... were not generally victims in the South and that the racial [[caste]] system in the south situated Jews favorably in the Southern mind, or 'whitened' them."&lt;ref name="Forman, p. 21"/&gt; However, there were some southern Jews who participated in civil rights activity as individuals.&lt;ref name="Webb, p. xiii"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, Mark K. ''The quiet voices: southern rabbis and Black civil rights, 1880s to 1990s''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent decades have shown a greater trend for southern Jews to speak out on civil rights issues, as shown by the 1987 marches in [[Forsyth County, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Webb, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black power movement==
Starting in 1966, the collaboration between Jews and blacks started to unravel. Jews were increasingly transitioning to middle-class and upper-class status, distancing themselves from blacks. At the same time, many black leaders, including some from the [[Black Power]] movement, became outspoken in their demands for greater equality, often criticizing Jews along with other white targets.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p. 13"&gt;Greenberg, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) voted to exclude whites from its leadership, a decision that resulted in the expulsion of several Jewish leaders.&lt;ref name="Dollinger, pp. 4–5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Clayborne. "Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights movement: the case of SNCC", in ''Bridges and Boundaries'' (Salzman, Ed), pp. 36–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, black academic [[Harold Cruse]] attacked Jewish activism in his 1967 volume 'The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual' in which he argued that Jews had become a problem for blacks precisely because they had so identified with the Black struggle. Cruse insisted that Jewish involvement in interracial politics impeded the emergence of "Afro-American ethnic consciousness". For Cruse, as well as for other black activists, the role of American Jews as political mediator between Blacks and whites was "fraught with serious dangers to all concerned" and must be "terminated by Negroes themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black Hebrew Israelites==
[[File:ISUPK Passover 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Black Hebrew Israelites|Hebrew Israelite]] group [[Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge|ISUPK]], Passover, Harlem, 2012.]]

[[Black Hebrew Israelites]] are groups of people, mostly of [[Black people|Black American]] ancestry situated mainly in the [[Americas]] who claim to be descendants of the ancient [[Israelites]].&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Stephen C., 2009, ''African American Religious Cultures'', ABC-CLIO, pp. 111–116, esp. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of mainstream [[Judaism]]. They are generally not accepted as Jews by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews, nor are they accepted by the greater Jewish community, due to their degree of divergence from mainstream Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Maurianne (Ed). (1999), ''Strangers &amp; Neighbors: Relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States''. See Part II: "African-Americans as the Chosen People", especially pp. 84–101&lt;/ref&gt;

(1999), ''Strangers &amp; Neighbors: Relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States''. See Part II: "African-Americans as the Chosen People", especially pp. 84–101&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites, other groups identify themselves as Black Hebrews, and other groups identify themselves as Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Jochannan, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/blackjews.html|title=The Black Jewish or Hebrew Israelite Community|accessdate=December 15, 2007|last=Ben Levy|first=Sholomo|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Johannes P.

==Nation of Islam==
[[Elijah Muhammad]], the founder of the [[Nation of Islam]], claimed that blacks—not whites or Europeanized Jews—are the [[chosen people]].&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad , Elijah, 1973, ''The Fall of America'', BooksGuide, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The Nation of Islam's current leader, [[Louis Farrakhan]], has also claimed that African Americans are the chosen people. In a 1985 speech, Farrakhan said "I have a problem with Jews ... because I am declaring to the world that they are not the chosen people of God. ... You, the black people of America and the Western Hemisphere [are]."&lt;ref&gt;Chireau, Yvonne Patricia, ''Black Zion: African American Religious Encounters with Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor movement==
[[File:NAACP leaders with poster NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Herbert Hill (labor director)|Herbert Hill]] (second from right), labor director of [[NAACP]], with [[Thurgood Marshall]] (second from left)]]
The [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement]] was another area of the relationship that flourished before WWII, but ended in conflict afterwards. In the early 20th century, one important area of cooperation was attempts to increase minority representation in the leadership of the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW). In 1943, Jews and blacks joined to request the creation of a new department within the UAW dedicated to minorities, but that request was refused by UAW leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Sevenson, Marshall F. "African-Americans and Jews in Organized labor", in Franklin, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate post-World War II period, the [[Jewish Labor Committee]] (JLC), which was founded in February 1934 to oppose the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany, formed approximately two dozen local committees to combat racial intolerance in the U.S and Canada. The JLC, which had local offices in a number of communities in North America, helped found the [[United Farm Workers]] and campaigned for the passage of California's ''Fair Employment Practices Act,''  and provided staffing and support for the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] led by [[Martin Luther King Jr]], [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.jewishlabor.org/JLC_Basic_History.pdf ''70 Years Strong: The Jewish Labor Committee Story''], Jewish Labor Committee, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in early 1962, allegations were made by NAACP labor director [[Herbert Hill (labor director)|Herbert Hill]] that since the 1940s, the JLC had also defended the anti-black discriminatory practices of unions in both the garment and building industries.&lt;ref name="Hill pp. 10, 265"&gt;Hill, Herbert "Black-Jewish Conflict in the Labor Context", in Franklin, pp. 10, 265–279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Herbert (1998), "Black-Jewish conflict in the Labor Context", in Adams, pp. 597–599&lt;/ref&gt; Hill claimed that the JLC changed "a black white conflict into a Black-Jewish conflict".&lt;ref name="Hill pp. 10, 265"/&gt; He said the JLC defended the Jewish leaders of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU) against charges of anti-black racial discrimination, distorted government reports about discrimination, failed to tell union members the truth, and when union members complained, the JLC labeled them antisemites.&lt;ref name="autogenerated272"&gt;Hill, Herbert "Black-Jewish Conflict in the Labor Context", in Franklin, pp. 272–283&lt;/ref&gt; ILGWU leaders denounced Black members for demanding equal treatment and access to leadership positions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated272"/&gt;

The [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968]] also signaled the decline of black-Jewish relations: the Jewish president of the [[United Federation of Teachers]], [[Albert Shanker]], made statements that were seen by some as straining black-Jewish relations by accusing black teachers of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Herbert "Black-Jewish Conflict in the Labor Context", in Franklin, pp. 294–286{{check|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Zionism==
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|After his retirement, professional boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] publicly opposed [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/MAGAZINE-muhammad-ali-s-complicated-relationship-with-the-jews-1.5391231|title=Muhammad Ali's Complicated Relationship With the Jews|date=June 4, 2016|work=[[Haaretz]]|access-date=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After [[Israel]] took over the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], some American blacks supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Dollinger, pp. 4–5" /&gt; Some, such as [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Malcolm X]], also criticized the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]].&lt;ref name=Ali/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marable |first=Manning |authorlink=Manning Marable |title=[[Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention]] |location=New York |publisher=Viking |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-670-02220-5 |pages=367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the war, the editor of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]'s (SNCC) newsletter wrote an article criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, "[[Zionism|Zionists]] conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres". This article led to conflict between Jews and the SNCC, but black SNCC leaders treated the war as a "test of their willingness to demonstrate SNCC's break from its civil rights past".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Clayborne, (1984) "Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights movement: the Case of SNCC", in Adams, p. 583&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concerns of blacks continued, and in 1993, black philosopher [[Cornel West]] wrote in [[Race Matters]]: "Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinians in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked group interest, and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation."&lt;ref&gt;West, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; 

The support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of them as people of color—[[Andrew Hacker]] writes: "The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;Hacker; in Adams, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Luther King Jr. criticized this position at the 68th Annual Rabbinical Assembly for Conservative Judaism, "On the Middle East crisis, we have had various responses. The responses of the so-called young militants does not represent the position of the vast majority of Negroes. There are some who are color consumed and see a kind of mystique in being colored, and anything non-colored is condemned. We do not follow that course in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and certainly most of the organizations in the civil rights movement do not follow that course."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gendlergrapevine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Conversation-with-Martin-Luther-King.pdf |title=Conversation with Martin Luther King |journal=Conservative Judaism |volume=22 |issue=3 |year=1968 |publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly |accessdate=July 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affirmative action==
Many blacks have supported government and business [[affirmative action]], while many Jews have not, preferring merit-based systems. Historians believe that this difference contributed to the decline of the black-Jewish alliance in the 1970s, when blacks began seeking ways to build on the civil rights legislation of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Dollinger, pp. 4–5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forman, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As blacks continued to face widespread discrimination and struggled to make progress in society, they began to develop an increasing militancy. Greenberg believes that this increased resentment and fear among Jews.&lt;ref name="Greenberg, p. 13"/&gt;

Herbert Hill's survey of affirmative-action lawsuits found that Jewish organizations have generally opposed affirmative-action programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Herbert. "Black-Jewish Conflict in the Labor Context", in Franklin, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; A widely publicized example of the black-Jewish conflict arose in the 1978 affirmative action case of ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]],'' when black and Jewish organizations took opposing sides in the case of a white student who sued for admission, claiming that he was unfairly excluded by affirmative action programs.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, pp, 13, 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-Semitism among African Americans==
Some leaders of the black community have publicly made anti-Semitic comments, expressing anti-Semitic opinions held by a wider circle of some blacks, accusing Jews of over-aggressiveness in business relations, loyalty to Israel (rather than loyalty to the United States), alleged participation in the slave trade, and economic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Robert (1997), ''The Farrakhan Phenomenon: Race, Reaction, and the Paranoid Style in American'', Georgetown University Press, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts attribute black anti-Semitism to resentment or envy "directed at another underdog who has 'made it' in American society".&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Black activist [[Sufi Abdul Hamid]] led boycotts in 1935 during the Great Depression against certain [[Harlem]] merchants and establishments (often owned by Jewish proprietors) which he claimed discriminated against blacks. Some Jews accused him of anti-Semitism for these activities.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, Winston C., "Keeping them 'In the same boat together'?" in Franklin, pp. 208–236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Thadeus, "Sufi Abdul Hamid" in ''Harlem Renaissance lives from the African American National Biography'', Henry Louis Gates (Ed.), 2009, pp. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 presidential candidate [[Jesse Jackson]] and former United Nations ambassador [[Andrew Young]] made anti-Semitic comments, which were widely publicized. These remarks were thought to have extended the era of African-American and Jewish distrust into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Dollinger, pp. 4–5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/jackson.htm |title=Jesse Jackson's 'Hymietown' Remark – 1984 |first=Larry J. |last=Sabato |work=[[The Washington Post]] |year=1998 |publisher=[[Washington Post Company|WPC]] |location=[[Washington, DC|Washington DC]] |issn=0190-8286 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 in Brooklyn, a black mob involved in the [[Crown Heights riot]] killed Yankel Rosenbaum, an Orthodox Jew, after a car driven by Jews hit and killed a black girl in the neighborhood. Some commentators believed that the unrest was related to anti-Semitism. The two ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other in this neighborhood, and the Orthodox Jewish community has been expanding.&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, anti-Semitism became widespread in the black communities on college campuses, where new historical studies revealed more data on Jewish participation in the slave trade, with some commentators claiming that they had dominated it.&lt;ref&gt;"African American Antisemitism in the 1999s" in ''Encyclopedia of American Jewish history, Volume 1'' (Stephen Harlan Norwood, Eunice G. Pollack, Eds) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. [[Leonard Jeffries]] of the [[City College of New York]] was a proponent of this idea, but his conclusions have been disputed by major African-American historians of the slave trade, including [[David Brion Davis]].

According to surveys begun in 1964 by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], a Jewish organization, [[African Americans]] are significantly more likely than [[white Americans]] to hold antisemitic beliefs. There is a strong correlation between higher education levels and the rejection of anti-Semitic stereotypes for all races. Black Americans of all education levels are significantly more likely than whites of the same education level to be anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League Survey [http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 survey, blacks (34%) were nearly four times as likely as whites (9%) to have answers that identified them as being of the most anti-Semitic category (those agreeing with at least 6 of 11 statements that were potentially or clearly antisemitic). Among blacks with no college education, 43% responded as the most anti-Semitic group (vs. 18% for the general population). This percentage fell to 27% among blacks with some college education, and 18% among blacks with a four-year college degree (vs. 5% for the general population).&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League Survey [http://www.adl.org/antisemitism_survey/survey_print.asp].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation of Islam===
[[File:Louis Farrakhan, smiling.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Louis Farrakhan]], leader of the [[Nation of Islam]], has made several remarks that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and others consider anti-Semitic]]
{{see also|Nation of Islam and antisemitism}}
The [[Nation of Islam]], a black religious and political group, expressed several anti-Semitic pronouncements in the late 20th century. The group's founder, [[Elijah Muhammad]], targeted whites in general, and he also asserted that whites—as well as Jews—are devils, implicated in the history of racism against blacks. But he did not consider Jews to be any more corrupt or oppressive than other whites.&lt;ref&gt;Chireau, Yvonne Patricia, ''Black Zion: African American religious encounters with Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Nation of Islam spokesman [[Khalid Abdul Muhammad]] called Jews "bloodsuckers" in a public speech, leading to widespread public condemnation. The Nation of Islam's current leader, [[Louis Farrakhan]], has made several remarks that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and others consider anti-Semitic. He is alleged to have referred to Judaism as a "dirty religion" and to have called [[Adolf Hitler]] a "very great man"; Farrakhan denied these claims&lt;ref name="noi.org"&gt;[http://www.noi.org/statements/rift/Wanniski12-22-1997.htm Minister Farrakhan rebuts fraudulent "Judaism is a Gutter Religion" canard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polyconomics.com/memos/mm-971222.htm Letter from Louis Farrakhan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Black Zion: African American Religious Encounters with Judaism'', Yvonne Patricia Chireau, Nathaniel Deutsch, 2000, pp. 91–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Mark. "Nation of Islam", in ''Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, Volume 2'', p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; but a tape obtained by ''[[The New York Times]]'' supports the claim that he did and that he praised Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shipp|first=E.

==Role of Jews in the slave trade==

{{main article|Jewish views on slavery}}
During the 1990s, much of the Jewish-black conflict centered on allegations of anti-Semitism made against studies of Jewish involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and allegations that they were over-represented as prominent figures in it. Professor [[Leonard Jeffries]] said in a 1991 speech that "rich Jews" financed the slave trade, citing the role of Jews in slave-trading centers such as [[Rhode Island]], [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="speech"/&gt; His comments drew widespread outrage and calls for his dismissal from his position.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson, Michael, ''The Michael Eric Dyson Reader'', p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries cited as a source ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' (1991), published by the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref name="austen"&gt;Austen, Ralph A., "The Uncomfortable Relationship: African Enslavement in the Common History of Blacks and Jews", in ''Strangers &amp; Neighbors: Relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States'' (M. Adams, Ed), pp.132-135&lt;/ref&gt; That book alleges that Jews played a major role in the African slave trade, and it generated considerable controversy.&lt;ref name="austen"/&gt; Other scholarly works were published which rebutted its charges.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include ''Jews and the American Slave Trade'' by Saul S. Friedman &lt;!-- Needs publisher, date, more explanation --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars of slavery such as [[David Brion Davis]] concluded that Jews had little major or continuing impact on the history of New World slavery.&lt;ref name="Davis 1984 89"&gt;{{citation |last=Davis |first=David Brion |year=1984 |title=Slavery and Human Progress |location=New York |publisher=Oxford Univ.

''William and Mary Quarterly Review,'' Volume LVII, Number 1, Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]] of [[Wellesley College]] included ''The Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews'' in the reading list for his classes, leading to charges of anti-Semitism against him in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Martin, [http://www.blacksandjews.com/TonyMartin.html "Incident at Wellesley College: Jewish Attack on Black Academics"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704190022/http://www.blacksandjews.com/TonyMartin.html |date=July 4, 2010 }}, www.blacksandjews.com, no date.

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] of [[Harvard University]] called the book "the bible of [[new antisemitism|new anti-Semitism]]" and added that "the book massively misinterprets the historical record, largely through a process of cunningly selective quotations of often reputable sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|authorlink1=Gilles Kepel|last2=Milner|first2=Susan|authorlink2=Susan Milner|title=Allah in the West: Islamic Movements in America and Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_-flY7-dLYC|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2753-2}}, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism among Jews==
The counterpoint to black anti-Semitism is Jewish anti-black racism.&lt;ref name="hacker"&gt;[[Andrew Hacker|Hacker, Andrew]] (1999) "Jewish Racism, Black anti-Semitism," in ''Strangers &amp; Neighbors: Relations between Blacks &amp; Jews in the United States,'' Maurianne Adams (Ed.). University of Massachusetts Press, 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Some black customers and tenants felt that Jewish shopkeepers and landlords treated them unfairly and were racist. Hacker quotes [[James Baldwin]]'s comments about Jewish shopkeepers in Harlem to support his racism claim.&lt;ref name="hacker"/&gt;

Hacker also quoted author [[Julius Lester]], who wrote: "Jews tend to be a little self-righteous about their liberal record, ... we realize that they were pitying us and wanted our gratitude, not the realization of the principles of justice and humanity... Blacks consider [Jews] paternalistic. Black people have destroyed the previous relationship which they had with the Jewish community, in which we were the victims of a kind of paternalism, which is only a benevolent racism."&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, in Adams, ed. (1999), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1992 essay "Blacks and Jews: The Uncivil War," historian [[Taylor Branch]] asserted that Jews had been "perpetrators of racial hate." He noted that 3,000 members of the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem]], founded in 1966 in Chicago, were denied citizenship as Jews when they moved ''en masse'' to Israel. The Americans claimed that they had the right of citizenship as Jews under the Israeli [[Law of Return]]. Under the law, the only people recognized as Jews are people who are [[Who is a Jew?|born Jews]] (having a Jewish mother or maternal grandmother), those with Jewish ancestry (having a Jewish father or grandfather), and people who convert to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], or [[Conservative Judaism]].{{efn|The law also provides certain rights to the spouse of a person recognized a Jew, the children and grandchildren of a person recognized as a Jew, and the spouses of the children and grandchildren of a person recognized as a Jew.}} 

Branch believed that the rejection of the Chicago group was based on [[Racism in Israel#Blacks|anti-Black sentiment among Israeli Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Forman, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branch, Taylor "Blacks and Jews: The Uncivil War", in ''Bridges and Boundaries: African Americans and American Jews'' (Salzman, Ed), 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Branch was criticized by Seth Forman, who said the claims seemed baseless. He said that Israel had airlifted thousands of black Ethiopian Jews to Israel in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Blacks in the Jewish Mind: A Crisis of Liberalism'', Seth Forman, NYU Press, 1998: p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; A group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated the 1966 case. They concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' rejection in Israel. They were considered a [[new religious movement|cult]] rather than a group of historic Jewish descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Shipler, David K. (January 30, 1981). "Israelis Urged To Act Over Black Hebrew Cult". ''The New York Times''. Retrieved May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Hasia Diner writes: "Never a relationship of equals, [many blacks] assert, Jews sat on the boards of black organizations and held power in black institutions but never allowed for the reverse. [Jews] gave money to civil rights organizations and demanded the right to make decisions by virtue of the power of their purses."&lt;ref&gt;Diner, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]], the '''antahkarana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: "the inner cause") refers to the totality of two levels of mind, namely the [[buddhi]], the intellect or higher mind, and the [[mana]]s, the middle levels of mind which (according to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]) exist as or include the [[mental body]]. Antahkarana has also been called the link between the middle and higher mind, the reincarnating part of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Lucis Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antahkarana-web.svg|thumb|Antahkarana for computer's radio waves protection]]

In Vedāntic literature, this {{IAST|antahkaraṇa}} (''internal organ'') is organised into four parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/yoga/antahkarana.html |title=Antahkarana - Yoga (definition) |publisher=En.mimi.hu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{IAST|[[Ahamkāra]]}} (''ego'') – identifies the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (''self'') with the body as 'I'
# [[Buddhi]] (''intellect'') – controls decision making
# [[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]] (''mind'') – controls ''sankalpa'' (will or resolution)
# [[Citta|Chitta]] (''memory'') – deals with remembering and forgetting

Another description says that "''antahkarana''" refers to the entire psychological process, including mind and emotions, are composing the mind levels, as described above, which are mentioned as a unit that functions with all parts working together as a whole. Furthermore, when considering that mind levels are bodies, they are: ''manomayakosha'' - related to manas - the part of mind related to five senses, and also craving for new and pleasant sensations and emotions, while buddhi (intellect, intelligence, capacity to reason), is related to vijnanamayakosha - the body of consciousness, knowledge, intuition and experience.

Antahkarana also refers to a symbol used in the [[Reiki]] healing method.

== Syllogisms ==
{{Main|Syllogism}}
A ''[[syllogism]]'' is a kind of [[logical argument]] in which one [[proposition]] (the conclusion) is [[Inference|inferred]] from two or more others (the ''[[premise]]s'') of a specific form. The classical example of a valid syllogism is:

::All humans are mortal. (major premise)
::Socrates is human. ([[minor premise]])
::Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (conclusion)

An example of an invalid syllogism is:

:: All teenage girls are ambitious.
:: Teenage girls study hard.
:: Therefore, girls study hard because they are ambitious.

Typically, a majority of test subjects in studies incorrectly identify this syllogism as one in which the conclusion follows from the premises.&lt;ref name="SternbergLeighton2004"/&gt;  It might be true ''in the real world'' that a) ''girls study'' and b) ''this is because they are ambitious''. However, this argument is a fallacy, because the conclusion is not supported by its premises. The validity of an argument is different from the truth of its conclusion: there are valid arguments for false conclusions and invalid arguments for true conclusions. Hence, it is an error to judge the validity of an argument from the plausibility of its conclusion. This is the reasoning error known as belief bias.&lt;ref name="SternbergLeighton2004"/&gt;

When a person gives a response that is determined by the believability of the conclusion rather than logical validity, this is referred to as belief bias only when syllogism are used. This phenomenon is so closely related to syllogistic reasoning that when it does occur, in areas such as [[Wason selection task|Wason's selection task]] or the [[THOG problem]], it is called "memory cueing" or the "effects of content".&lt;ref name="Human Reasoning: The Psychology of Deduction"/&gt;

== Dual-process theory of belief bias ==
Many researchers in thinking and reasoning have provided evidence for a dual-process cognitive approach to reasoning, judgement and decision making. They argue that these two systems (system 1 and system 2) engage in a constant battle for control over our brain to reason and make decisions. System 1 can be described as an automated system&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=Walter|last2=Shiffrin|first2=Richard M.|date=1977-01-01|title=Controlled and automatic human information processing: I.

It is important that note that the dual-process cognitive theory is different from the two minds hypothesis. A research done by Johnathan Evans in 2007 provided evidence for the view that System 1 which serves as a quick heuristic processor fights for control over System 2's slower analytical approach. In the experiment, participants were asked to evaluate syllogisms that have valid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; valid arguments with convincing conclusions; invalid arguments with unconvincing conclusions; invalid arguments with convincing conclusions. The results show that when the conclusion is believable, people blindly accept invalid conclusions more so than invalid arguments are accepted.

== Influencing factors of belief bias ==

=== Time ===
Various studies have proved that the time period of which a subject is allowed to think when evaluating arguments is related to the tendency for belief bias to take place. In a study done by Evans and Holmes in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Jonathan St B. T.|last2=Curtis-Holmes|first2=Jodie|date=2005-09-01|title=Rapid responding increases belief bias: Evidence for the dual-process theory of reasoning|journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning|volume=11|issue=4|pages=382–389|doi=10.1080/13546780542000005|issn=1354-6783}}&lt;/ref&gt; they recruited two different groups of people to answer a series of reasoning questions. One group of people were given only two seconds to answer the questions; whereas the other group of people were allowed to use as much time as they would like to answer the questions. The result obtained was that a higher percentage of incorrect answers were found in the time pressured group than the other; they concluded that this was a result of a shift in logical to belief-biased way of thinking.

=== Nature of content ===
The nature of the content presented can also affect belief bias of an individual as shown by a study done by Goel &amp; Vartanian in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goel|first=Vinod|last2=Vartanian|first2=Oshin|date=2011-01-01|title=Negative emotions can attenuate the influence of beliefs on logical reasoning|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=25|issue=1|pages=121–131|doi=10.1080/02699931003593942|pmid=21432659|issn=0269-9931}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, 34 participants were presented with a syllogism upon each trial. Each trial were either neutral or carried some degree of negative content. Negative content involved in the experiment were politically incorrect social norm violations, such as the statement “Some wars are not unjustified, Some wars involve raping of women, therefore, Some raping of women is not unjustified”. For syllogisms where the content was neutral, the results were consistent with studies of belief bias; however, for syllogisms with negative emotional content, participants were more likely to reason logically on invalid syllogisms with believable conclusions instead of automatically judging them to be valid. In other words, the effect of belief bias is reduced when the content presented is of negative emotion. According to Goel and Vartanian, this is a because negative emotions prompts us to reason in more careful and in more detail. This argument was supported by the observation that for questions with negative emotions, the reaction time taken was significantly longer than that of questions that a neutral.

=== Instructions given ===
In an experiment done by Evans, Newstead, Allen &amp; Pollard in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newstead|first=Stephen E.|last2=Pollard|first2=Paul|last3=Evans|first3=Jonathan St. B. T.|last4=Allen|first4=Julie L.|date=1992-12-01|title=The source of belief bias effects in syllogistic reasoning|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779290019E|journal=Cognition|volume=45|issue=3|pages=257–284|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90019-E}}&lt;/ref&gt; where subjects were given detailed instructions which lack specific reference to the notion of logical necessity when answering questions, it was shown that a larger proportion of answers actually rejected invalid arguments with convincing conclusions as opposed to when no further instructions were given when the subjects were asked to answer the questions. The results of the experiments reflects that when elaborated instructions were given to subjects to reason logically, the effects of belief bias is decreased.

== Research ==
In a series of experiments by Evans, Barston and Pollard (1983),&lt;ref name=EvansBarstonPollard1983 /&gt; participants were presented with evaluation task paradigms, containing two premises and a conclusion. The participants were asked to make an evaluation of logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. The subjects, however, exhibited a belief bias, evidenced by their tendency to reject valid arguments with unbelievable conclusions, and endorse invalid arguments with believable conclusions. Instead of following directions and assessing logical validity, the subjects based their assessments on personal beliefs.

Consequently, these results demonstrated a greater acceptance of more believable (80%), than unbelievable (33%) conclusions. Participants also illustrated evidence of logical competences  and the results determined an increase in acceptance of valid (73%) than invalid (41%). Additionally, there's a small difference between believable and valid (89%) in comparison to unbelievable and invalid (56%) (Evans, Barston &amp; Pollard, 1983; Morley, Evans &amp; Handley, 2004).&lt;ref name=EvansBarstonPollard1983&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = J.

It has been argued that using more realistic content in [[syllogisms]] can facilitate more normative performance from participants. It has been suggested that the use of more abstract, artificial content will also have a biasing effect on performance. Therefore, more research is required to understand fully how and why belief bias occurs and if there are certain mechanisms that are responsible for such things.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} There is also evidence of clear individual differences in normative responding that are predicted by the response times of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stupple|first=E.J.N. |author2=L.

A 1989 study by Markovits and Nantel gave participants four reasoning tasks. The results indicated “a significant belief-bias effect”  that existed “independently of the subjects' abstract reasoning ability.”&lt;ref name="Markovits &amp; Nantel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markovits|first1=H.|last2=Nantel|first2=G.|title=The belief-bias effect in the production and evaluation of logical conclusions.|date=January 1989|pmid=2913452|volume=17|issue=1|journal=Memory and Cognition|pages=11–7|doi=10.3758/bf03199552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by Donna Torrens examined differences in belief bias among individuals. Torrens found that “the extent of an individual's belief bias effect was unrelated to a number of measures of reasoning competence” but was, instead, related to that person's ability  “to generate alternative representations of premises: the more alternatives a person generated, the less likely they were to show a belief bias effect."&lt;ref name="Torrens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torrens|first1=Donna|title=Individual Differences and the Belief Bias Effect: Mental Models, Logical Necessity, and Abstract Reasoning|journal=Thinking and Reasoning|date=September 24, 2010|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1080/135467899394066|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study, Chad Dube and Caren M. Rotello of the [[University of Massachusetts]] and Evan Heit of the [[University of California, Merced]], showed that “the belief bias effect is simply a response bias effect.”&lt;ref name="Dube, Rotello, and Heit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dube|first1=Chad|last2=Rotello|first2=Caren|last3=Heit|first3=Evan|title=The Belief Bias Effect Is Aptly Named: A Reply to Klauer and Kellen (2011)|journal=Psychological Review|volume=118|issue=1|pages=155–163|url=http://wixtedlab.ucsd.edu/publications/Psych%20272/Dube_Rotello_Heit_2011.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016|doi=10.1037/a0021774|pmid=21244191|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study, Adrian P. Banks of the [[University of Surrey]] explained that “belief bias is caused by the believability of a conclusion in working memory which influences its activation level, determining its likelihood of retrieval and therefore its effect on the reasoning process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banks|first1=Adrian|title=The Influence of Activation Level on Belief Bias in Relational Reasoning|journal=Cognitive Science|date=September 4, 2009|doi=10.1111/cogs.12017|pmid=23294043|url=http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Banks-2013.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2016|volume=37|issue=3|pages=544–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michelle Colleen and Elizabeth Hilscher of the [[University of Toronto]] showed in 2014 that belief bias can be affected by the difficulty level and placement of the syllogism in question.&lt;ref name="Hilscher"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilscher|first1=Michelle|title=Attenuating Belief Bias Effects in Syllogistic Reasoning: The Role of Belief-Content Conflict|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/65668/6/Hilscher_Michelle_C_201406_PhD_thesis.pdf|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernoulli_numbers_graphs.svg|thumb|Graphs of modern Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''}} (circles) compared with Bernoulli numbers in older literature, {{math|''B''*}} (crosses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''Bernoulli numbers''' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are a [[sequence]] of [[rational number]]s which occur frequently in [[number theory]]. The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the adjacent table. For every even {{math|''n''}} other than 0, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is negative if {{math|''n''}} is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For every odd {{math|''n''}} other than 1, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} term is affected: 
*{{math|''B''{{su|p=−|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is the sign convention prescribed by [[NIST]] and most modern textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=278 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}}}} with {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} ({{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}) is sometimes used in the older literature.&lt;ref name="MW1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bernoulli Number|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliNumber.html|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation &lt;math&gt;B_n^{+{}}=(-1)^n B_n^{-{}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Bernoulli numbers are special values of the [[Bernoulli polynomial]]s &lt;math&gt;B_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;B^{-{}}_n=B_n(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^+_n=B_n(1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;

Since {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} for all odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}, and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write "{{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}" to mean {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This article does not follow this notation.

The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[tangent function|tangent]] and [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic tangent]] functions, in [[Faulhaber's formula]] for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]], and in expressions for certain values of the [[Riemann zeta function]].

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician [[Jacob Bernoulli]], after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician [[Takakazu Seki|Seki Kōwa]].  Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712&lt;ref name="selin 1997"&gt;Selin, H. (1997), p. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith mikami 1914"&gt;Smith, D. E. (1914), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  in his work ''Katsuyo Sampo''; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' of 1713.  [[Ada Lovelace]]'s [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|note G]] on the [[Analytical Engine]] from 1842 describes an [[algorithm]] for generating Bernoulli numbers with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s machine.&lt;ref&gt;''Note G'' in the Menabrea reference&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex [[computer program]].

==History==

=== Early history ===

The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.

[[File:Seki Kowa Katsuyo Sampo Bernoulli numbers.png|thumb|right|A page from Seki Takakazu's ''Katsuyo Sampo'' (1712), tabulating binomial coefficients and Bernoulli numbers]]

Methods to calculate the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first {{mvar|n}} positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity to consider this problem were [[Pythagoras]] (c. 572–497&amp;nbsp;BCE, Greece), [[Archimedes]] (287–212&amp;nbsp;BCE, Italy), [[Aryabhata]] (b. 476, India), [[Abu Bakr al-Karaji]] (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn [[al-Haytham]] (965–1039, Iraq).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress.  In the West [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560–1621) of England, [[Johann Faulhaber]] (1580–1635) of Germany, [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) all played important roles.

Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers.  Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 ''Academia Algebrae'', far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.

Blaise Pascal in 1654 proved [[Faulhaber's formula|''Pascal's identity'']] relating the sums of the {{math|''p''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, …, ''k''}}.

The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…}} which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers {{harv|Knuth|1993}}.

The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the {{mvar|c}}th powers for any positive integer {{math|''c''}} can be seen from his comment. He wrote:

:"With the help of this table, it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the tenth powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum 91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500."

Bernoulli's result was published posthumously in ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' in 1713.  [[Seki Kōwa]] independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712.&lt;ref name="selin 1997"/&gt;  However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.

Bernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of [[Abraham de Moivre]].

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth {{harv|Knuth|1993}} a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]] in 1834 {{harv|Jacobi|1834}}. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes (the nonstandard notation on the LHS is explained further on):

:''"Faulhaber never discovered the Bernoulli numbers; i.e., he never realized that a single sequence of constants'' {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,}} ''… would provide a uniform''

=== Reconstruction of "Summae Potestatum" ===

[[File:JakobBernoulliSummaePotestatum.png|thumb|right|upright=2.5|Jakob Bernoulli's "Summae Potestatum", 1713]]

The Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}(n)/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''C'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The expression {{math|''c''·''c''−1·''c''−2·''c''−3}} means {{math|''c''·(''c''−1)·(''c''−2)·(''c''−3)}} – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial powers]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The factorial notation {{math|''k''!}} as a shortcut for {{math|1 × 2 × … × ''k''}} was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in 1675 who used it as a long letter {{math|''S''}} for "summa" (sum). (The ''Mathematics Genealogy Project''&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/ Mathematics Genealogy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
shows Leibniz as the academic&lt;!--not doctoral--&gt; advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the ''Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeff560.tripod.com/calculus.html Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus]&lt;/ref&gt;) The letter {{math|''n''}} on the left hand side is not an index of [[summation]] but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as {{math|1, 2, …, ''n''}}. Putting things together, for positive {{math|''c''}}, today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \frac{n^{c+1}}{c+1}+\frac 1 2 n^c+\sum_{k=2}^c \frac{B_k}{k!} c^{\underline{k-1}}n^{c-k+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula suggests setting {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''k''−1}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} has for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} the value {{math|{{sfrac|1|''c'' + 1}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Thus Bernoulli's formula can be written
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^c = \sum_{k=0}^c \frac{B_k}{k!}c^{\underline{k-1}} n^{c-k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1/2}}, recapturing the value Bernoulli gave to the coefficient at that position.

Note that the formula for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n k^9&lt;/math&gt; in the first half contains an error at the last term: it must be &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {3}{20}n^2&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac {1}{12}n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definitions ==

Many characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers.  Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:

* a recursive equation,
* an explicit formula,
* a generating function.

For the proof of the [[Logical equivalence|equivalence]] of the three approaches see {{Harv|Ireland|Rosen|1990}} or {{Harv|Conway|Guy|1996}}.

=== Recursive definition ===

The Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas &lt;ref name="MW1"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{-{}}_k &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} \\ \sum_{k=0}^{m}\binom {m+1} k B^{+{}}_k &amp;= m+1 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m=0,1,2...&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|''δ''}} denotes the [[Kronecker delta]]. Solving for &lt;math&gt;B^{\mp{}}_m&lt;/math&gt; gives the recursive formulas
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_m^{-{}} &amp;= \delta_{m, 0} - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^{-{}}_k}{m - k + 1} \\
  B_m^+ &amp;= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{k} \frac{B^+_k}{m - k + 1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Explicit definition ===

In 1893 [[Louis Saalschütz]] listed  a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers {{Harv|Saalschütz|1893}}, usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B^{-{}}_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{v^m}{k + 1} \\
  B^+_m &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^m \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v \binom{k}{v} \frac{(v + 1)^m}{k + 1}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generating function ===

The exponential [[generating function]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{t}{e^t - 1}    &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} -1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^{-{}}_m t^m}{m!}\\
  \frac{t}{1 - e^{-t}} &amp;= \frac{t}{2} \left( \operatorname{coth} \frac{t}{2} +1 \right) &amp;= \sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{B^+_m t^m}{m!}. 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The (normal) generating function
: &lt;math&gt; z^{-1} \psi_1(z^{-1}) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} B^+_m z^m&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[asymptotic series]]. It contains the [[trigamma function]] {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function ==

[[File:BernoulliNumbersByZetaLowRes.png|thumb|right|The Bernoulli numbers as given by the Riemann zeta function.]]

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the [[Riemann zeta function]]:

:{{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=''n''}} = −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Here the argument of the zeta function is 0 or negative.

By means of the zeta [[Riemann zeta function#The functional equation|functional equation]] and the gamma [[Gamma function#General|reflection formula]] the following relation can be obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=279 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2n} = \frac {(-1)^{n+1}2(2n)!} {(2\pi)^{2n}} \zeta(2n) &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.

Now the argument of the zeta function is positive.

It then follows from {{math|''&amp;zeta;'' &amp;rarr; 1}} ({{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}) and [[Stirling formula|Stirling's formula]] that
: &lt;math&gt; |B_{2 n}| \sim 4 \sqrt{\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{ \pi e} \right)^{2n} &lt;/math&gt; for {{math|''n'' &amp;rarr; &amp;infin;}}.

== Efficient computation of Bernoulli numbers ==

In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} through {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}}, where {{mvar|p}} is a prime; for example to test whether [[Vandiver's conjecture]] holds for {{mvar|p}}, or even just to determine whether {{mvar|p}} is an [[irregular prime]]. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed {{harv|Buhler|Crandall|Ernvall|Metsankyla|2001}} which require only {{math|''O''(''p'' (log ''p'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} operations (see [[big-O notation|big {{mvar|O}} notation]]).

David Harvey {{harv|Harvey|2008}} describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} modulo {{mvar|p}} for many small primes {{mvar|p}}, and then reconstructing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} via the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. Harvey writes that the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] of this algorithm is {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; log(''n'')&lt;sup&gt;2 + ''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and claims that this [[implementation]] is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Harvey's implementation has been included in [[SageMath]] since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner {{harv|Kellner|2002}}&lt;!--A more specific citation would be preferable.--&gt; computed {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to full precision for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;}} in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk {{harv|Pavlyk|2008}} for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Mathematica]] in April 2008.

== Applications of the Bernoulli numbers ==

=== Asymptotic analysis ===
Arguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]. Assuming that {{mvar|f}} is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as &lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (9.67).&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a}^{b-1} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^-_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_-(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation assumes the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=−|b=1}} = −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. Using the convention {{math|1=''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} = +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} the formula becomes

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=a+1}^{b} f(k) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R_+(f,m).&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|1=''f''&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''}} (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a {{math|''f''}} is just {{math|''f''}}). Moreover, let {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;(−1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} denote an [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]],

: &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = f^{(-1)}(b) - f^{(-1)}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=a}^{b}f(k)= \sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B_k}{k!} (f^{(k-1)}(b)-f^{(k-1)}(a))+R(f,m). &lt;/math&gt;

This form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  \zeta(s) &amp; =\sum_{k=0}^m \frac{B^+_k}{k!} s^{\overline{k-1}} + R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{B_0}{0!}s^{\overline{-1}} + \frac{B^+_1}{1!} s^{\overline{0}} + \frac{B_2}{2!} s^{\overline{1}} +\cdots+R(s,m) \\
           &amp; = \frac{1}{s-1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12}s + \cdots + R(s,m).
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|rising factorial power]].&lt;ref&gt;''Concrete Mathematics'', (2.44) and (2.52)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of [[asymptotic expansion]]s. The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the [[digamma function]] {{math|''ψ''}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(z) \sim \ln z - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B^+_k}{k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sum of powers ===

{{main article|Faulhaber's formula}}

Bernoulli numbers feature prominently in the [[Closed-form expression|closed form]] expression of the sum of the {{math|''m''}}th powers of the first {{math|''n''}} positive integers. For {{math|''m'', ''n'' ≥ 0}} define

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^m = 1^m + 2^m + \cdots + n^m. &lt;/math&gt;

This expression can always be rewritten as a [[polynomial]] in {{math|''n''}} of degree {{math|''m'' + 1}}. The [[coefficient]]s of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by '''Bernoulli's formula''':
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B^+_k n^{m + 1 - k},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''m'' + 1|b=''k''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} denotes the [[binomial coefficient]].

For example, taking {{math|''m''}} to be 1 gives the [[triangular number]]s {{math|0, 1, 3, 6, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000217}}.

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{1}{2} (B_0 n^2 + 2 B^+_1 n^1) = \tfrac12 (n^2 + n).&lt;/math&gt;

Taking {{math|''m''}} to be 2 gives the [[square pyramidal number]]s {{math|0, 1, 5, 14, …}} {{OEIS2C|id=A000330}}.

: &lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{1}{3} (B_0 n^3 + 3 B^+_1 n^2 + 3 B_2 n^1) = \tfrac13 \left(n^3 + \tfrac32 n^2 + \tfrac12 n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Some authors use the alternate convention for Bernoulli numbers and state Bernoulli's formula in this way:
: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac{1}{m + 1} \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \binom{m + 1}{k} B^{-{}}_k n^{m + 1 - k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called [[Faulhaber's formula]] after [[Johann Faulhaber]] who also found remarkable ways to calculate [[sums of powers]].

Faulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a [[q-analog|{{mvar|q}}-analog]] {{harv|Guo|Zeng|2005}}.

===Taylor series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the [[Taylor series]] expansion of many [[trigonometric functions]] and [[hyperbolic function]]s.

;[[Tangent function|Tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\tan x &amp;= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1} 2^{2n} (2^{2n}-1) B_{2n} }{(2n)!}\; x^{2n-1},&amp; \left |x \right | &amp;&lt; \frac \pi 2 \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

;[[Hyperbolic tangent]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

===Laurent series===
The Bernoulli numbers appear in the following [[Laurent series]]:

[[Digamma function]]: &lt;math&gt; \psi(z)= \ln z- \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac {B_k^{+{}}} {k z^k} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arfken |first=George |date=1970 |title=Mathematical methods for physicists (2nd edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |page=463 |isbn=978-0120598519 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in topology ===

The [[Kervaire–Milnor's formula]] for the order of the cyclic group of diffeomorphism classes of [[exotic sphere|exotic {{math|(4''n'' − 1)}}-spheres]] which bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s involves Bernoulli numbers. Let {{math|''ES''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of such exotic spheres for {{Math|''n'' ≥ 2}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\textit{ES}_n = (2^{2n-2}-2^{4n-3}) \operatorname{Numerator}\left(\frac{B_{4n}}{4n} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|Hirzebruch signature theorem]] for the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem#L genus and the Hirzebruch signature theorem|{{mvar|L}} genus]] of a [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] [[Orientability|oriented]] [[closed manifold]] of [[dimension]] 4''n'' also involves Bernoulli numbers.

== Connections with combinatorial numbers ==

The connection of the Bernoulli number to various kinds of combinatorial numbers is based on the classical theory of finite differences and on the combinatorial interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental combinatorial principle, the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]].

=== Connection with Worpitzky numbers ===

The definition to proceed with was developed by Julius Worpitzky in 1883. Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function {{math|''n''!}} and the power function {{math|''k&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=\sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^{v+k} (v+1)^n \frac{k!}{v!(k-v)!} . &lt;/math&gt;

They can also be expressed through the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]

: &lt;math&gt; W_{n,k}=k! \left\{ {n+1\atop k+1} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion–exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the [[Harmonic progression (mathematics)|harmonic sequence]] 1,&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}},&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}},&amp;nbsp;…

: &lt;math&gt; B_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k \frac{W_{n,k}}{k+1}\ =\ \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{v=0}^k (-1)^v (v+1)^n {k \choose v}\ . &lt;/math&gt;

:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|3}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|3}} − {{sfrac|6|4}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|3}} − {{sfrac|60|4}} + {{sfrac|24|5}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|3}} − {{sfrac|390|4}} + {{sfrac|360|5}} − {{sfrac|120|6}}}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|3}} − {{sfrac|2100|4}} + {{sfrac|3360|5}} − {{sfrac|2520|6}} + {{sfrac|720|7}}}}

This representation has {{math|''B''{{su|p=+|b=1}} {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

Consider the sequence {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. From Worpitzky's numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A028246}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A163626}} applied to {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …}} is identical to the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]). This can be seen via the table:

The first row represents {{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Hence for the second fractional Euler numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} ({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|1|2}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|3|2}} + {{sfrac|2|4}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|7|2}} + {{sfrac|12|4}} − {{sfrac|6|8}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|15|2}} + {{sfrac|50|4}} − {{sfrac|60|8}} + {{sfrac|24|16}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|31|2}} + {{sfrac|180|4}} − {{sfrac|390|8}} + {{sfrac|360|16}} − {{sfrac|120|32}}}}
:{{math|1= ''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − {{sfrac|63|2}} + {{sfrac|602|4}} − {{sfrac|2100|8}} + {{sfrac|3360|16}} − {{sfrac|2520|32}} + {{sfrac|720|64}}}}

A second formula representing the Bernoulli numbers by the Worpitzky numbers is for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}

: &lt;math&gt; B_n=\frac n {2^{n+1}-2}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-2)^{-k}\, W_{n-1,k} . &lt;/math&gt;

The simplified second Worpitzky's representation of the second Bernoulli numbers is:

{{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}({{math|''n'' + 1}}) = {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' + 1|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2}}}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}}({{math|''n''}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A006519}}({{math|''n'' + 1}})

which links the second Bernoulli numbers to the second fractional Euler numbers. The beginning is:

:{{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|6}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|30}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|42}}, … {{=}} ({{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|3|14}}, {{sfrac|2|15}}, {{sfrac|5|62}}, {{sfrac|1|21}}, …) × (1, {{sfrac|1|2}}, 0, −{{sfrac|1|4}}, 0, {{sfrac|1|2}}, …)}}

The numerators of the first parentheses are {{OEIS2C|id=A111701}} (see [[Bernoulli number#Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind|Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind]]).

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the second kind ===

If {{math|''S''(''k'',''m'')}} denotes [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Comtet, Advanced combinatorics. The art of finite and infinite expansions, Revised and Enlarged Edition, D. Reidel Publ. Co., Dordrecht-Boston, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; then one has:

: &lt;math&gt;j^k=\sum_{m=0}^k {j^{\underline{m}}} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;
                                                              
where {{math|''j''&lt;sup&gt;{{underline|''m''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|falling factorial]].

If one defines the [[Bernoulli polynomials]] {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''j'')}} as:&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"&gt;H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_k(j)=k\sum_{m=0}^{k-1}\binom{j}{m+1}S(k-1,m)m!+B_k &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2,…}} are the Bernoulli numbers.

Then after the following property of [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \binom{j}{m}=\binom{j+1}{m+1}-\binom{j}{m+1} &lt;/math&gt;
 
one has,

:&lt;math&gt; j^k=\frac{B_{k+1}(j+1)-B_{k+1}(j)}{k+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

One also has following for Bernoulli polynomials,&lt;ref name="H. Rademacher, Analytic Number Theory 1973"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  B_k(j)=\sum_{n=0}^k \binom{k}{n} B_n j^{k-n}. &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''j''|b=''m'' + 1|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} is {{math|{{sfrac|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;|''m'' + 1}}}}.

Comparing the coefficient of {{mvar|j}} in the two expressions of Bernoulli polynomials, one has:

: &lt;math&gt; B_k=\sum_{m=0}^k (-1)^m \frac{m!}{m+1} S(k,m)&lt;/math&gt;

(resulting in {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) which is an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers and can be used to prove [[Von Staudt–Clausen theorem|Von-Staudt Clausen theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. W. Gould |title=Explicit formulas for Bernoulli numbers |journal=Amer. Math. Monthly |volume=79 |year=1972 |pages=44–51 |doi=10.2307/2978125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=T. M. Apostol |title=Introduction to Analytic Number Theory |publisher=Springer-Verlag |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=G. Boole |title=A treatise of the calculus of finite differences |edition=3rd |place=London |year=1880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind ===

The two main formulas relating the unsigned [[Stirling numbers of the first kind]] {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;[&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to the Bernoulli numbers (with {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}) are

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^{k} \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_k = \frac{1}{m+1}, &lt;/math&gt;

and the inversion of this sum (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}, {{math|''m'' ≥ 0}})

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{m!}\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \left[{m+1\atop k+1}\right] B_{n+k} = A_{n,m}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here the number {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the rational Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers, the first few of which are displayed in the following table.

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align=center"

|-
! 4 
| −{{sfrac|1|30}} || … || … || … || …
|}

The Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers satisfy a simple recurrence relation which can be exploited to iteratively compute the Bernoulli numbers. This leads to the algorithm shown in the section 'algorithmic description' above. See {{OEIS2C|id=A051714}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A051715}}.

An ''autosequence'' is a sequence which has its inverse binomial transform equal to the signed sequence. If the main diagonal is zeroes = {{OEIS2C|id=A000004}}, the autosequence is of the first kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A000045}}, the Fibonacci numbers. If the main diagonal is the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2, it is of the second kind. Example: {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}}/{{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, the second Bernoulli numbers (see {{OEIS2C|id=A190339}}). The Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to {{math|''2''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 1/{{OEIS2C|id=A000079}} leads to {{OEIS2C|id=A198631}} (''n'') / {{OEIS2C|id=A06519}} (''n'' + 1). Hence:

===Connection with Pascal’s triangle===

There are formulas connecting Pascal's triangle to Bernoulli numbers &lt;ref&gt;this formula was discovered (or perhaps rediscovered) by Giorgio Pietrocola. His demonstration is available in Italian language: {{cite web |url=http://www.maecla.it/Matematica/sommapotenze/teorema_1B.htm#teorema1b |title=Esplorando un antico sentiero: teoremi sulla somma di potenze di interi successivi (Corollario 2b)|last=Pietrocola |first=Giorgio |date=October 31, 2008 |website=Maecla |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_n=\frac{|A_n|}{(n+1)!}~~~&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;|A_n|&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of a n-by-n square matrix part of Pascal’s triangle whose elements are: &lt;math&gt;
a_{i, k} = \begin{cases} 
0 &amp; \text{if } k&gt;1+i \\
{i+1 \choose k-1} &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Example:

:&lt;math&gt; B^{+}_6 =\frac{\det\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp; 2&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 3&amp; 3&amp; 0&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 4&amp; 6&amp; 4&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 5&amp; 10&amp; 10&amp; 5&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 6&amp; 15&amp; 20&amp; 15&amp; 6\\
1&amp; 7&amp; 21&amp; 35&amp; 35&amp; 21
\end{pmatrix}}{7!}=\frac{120}{5040}=\frac 1 {42}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection with Eulerian numbers ===

There are formulas connecting [[Eulerian number]]s {{math|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟨&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;⟩&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}} to Bernoulli numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle &amp;= 2^{n+1} (2^{n+1}-1) \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1}, \\
\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \left \langle {n\atop m} \right \rangle \binom{n}{m}^{-1} &amp;= (n+1) B_n.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Both formulae are valid for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to {{sfrac|1|2}}. If {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is set to −{{sfrac|1|2}} they are valid only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} respectively.

==A binary tree representation==
The Stirling polynomials {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} are related to the Bernoulli numbers by {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''n''!''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}. S. C. Woon {{harv|Woon|1997}} described an algorithm to compute {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}} as a binary tree:

:[[File:SCWoonTree.png]]

Woon's recursive algorithm (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}) starts by assigning to the root node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [1,2]}}. Given a node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} of the tree, the left child of the node is {{math|''L''(''N'') {{=}} [−''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and the right child {{math|''R''(''N'') {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 2, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}. A node {{math|''N'' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} is written as {{math|±[''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given a node {{mvar|N}} the factorial of {{mvar|N}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; N! = a_1 \prod_{k=2}^{\operatorname{length}(N)} a_k!. &lt;/math&gt;

Restricted to the nodes {{mvar|N}} of a fixed tree-level {{mvar|n}} the sum of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''N''!}}}} is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, thus

:&lt;math&gt; B_n = \sum_\stackrel{N \text{ node of}}{\text{ tree-level } n} \frac{n!}{N!}. &lt;/math&gt;

For example:
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1!({{sfrac|1|2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2!(−{{sfrac|1|3!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!}})}}
:{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 3!({{sfrac|1|4!}} − {{sfrac|1|2!3!}} − {{sfrac|1|3!2!}} + {{sfrac|1|2!2!2!}})}}

==Integral representation and continuation==

The [[integral]]
: &lt;math&gt; b(s) = 2e^{s i \pi/2}\int_0^\infty \frac{st^s}{1-e^{2\pi t}} \frac{dt}{t} &lt;/math&gt;
has as special values {{math|''b''(2''n'') {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}.

For example, {{math|1=''b''(3) = {{sfrac|3|2}}''ζ''(3)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}} and {{math|1=''b''(5) = −{{sfrac|15|2}}''ζ''(5)''&amp;pi;''&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;''i''}}. Here, {{mvar|ζ}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]]. Leonhard Euler (''Opera Omnia'', Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p.&amp;nbsp;351) considered these numbers and calculated

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  p &amp;=  \frac{3}{2\pi^3}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{3^3}+\cdots \right) = 0.0581522\ldots \\
  q &amp;= \frac{15}{2\pi^5}\left(1+\frac{1}{2^5}+\frac{1}{3^5}+\cdots \right) = 0.0254132\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The relation to the Euler numbers and {{pi}}==

The [[Euler number]]s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the
asymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in magnitude approximately {{math|{{sfrac|2|π}}(4&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} times larger than the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In consequence:

: &lt;math&gt; \pi \sim 2 (2^{2n} - 4^{2n}) \frac{B_{2n}}{E_{2n}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This asymptotic equation reveals that {{pi}} lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact {{pi}} could be computed from these rational approximations.

Bernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd {{mvar|n}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} (with the exception {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}), it suffices to consider the case when {{mvar|n}} is even.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n-1}{k} \frac{n}{4^n-2^n}E_k &amp; n&amp;=2, 4, 6, \ldots \\
 E_{n} &amp;= \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k-1} \frac{2^k-4^k}{k} B_k &amp; n&amp;=2,4,6,\ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These conversion formulas express an [[inverse relation]] between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to {{pi}}. These numbers are defined for {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} as

:&lt;math&gt; S_n = 2 \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)^n \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty (4k+1)^{-n} \qquad k=0,-1,1,-2,2,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} by convention {{harv|Elkies|2003}}. The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers.  This was first proved by [[Leonhard Euler]] in a landmark paper {{harv|Euler|1735}} ''‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’'' (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are

: &lt;math&gt; S_n = 1,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{5}{24}, \frac{2}{15},\frac{61}{720},\frac{17}{315},\frac{277}{8064},\frac{62}{2835},\ldots  &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A099612}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A099617}})

These are the coefficients in the expansion of {{math|sec ''x'' + tan ''x''}}.

The Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as ''special views'' of these numbers, selected from the sequence {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and scaled for use in special applications.

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  B_{n} &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] \frac{n! }{2^n - 4^n}\, S_{n}\ , &amp; n&amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
  E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [ n \text{ even}] n! \, S_{n+1}  &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression [{{math|''n''}} even] has the value 1 if {{math|''n''}} is even and 0 otherwise ([[Iverson bracket]]).

These identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|2''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} when {{mvar|n}} is even. The {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are rational approximations to {{pi}} and two successive terms always enclose the true value of {{pi}}. Beginning with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the sequence starts ({{OEIS2C|id=A132049}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A132050}}):

: &lt;math&gt; 2, 4, 3, \frac{16}{5}, \frac{25}{8}, \frac{192}{61}, \frac{427}{136}, \frac{4352}{1385}, \frac{12465}{3968}, \frac{158720}{50521},\ldots \quad \longrightarrow \pi. &lt;/math&gt;

These rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.

Consider the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform for the sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A046978}} ({{math|''n'' + 2}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A016116}} ({{math|''n'' + 1}}):

From the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is −{{sfrac|1|2}} × {{OEIS2C|id=A163982}}.

==An algorithmic view: the Seidel triangle==

The sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; divide the factorial (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. In other words: the numbers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)!, sometimes called [[Alternating permutations|Euler zigzag numbers]], are integers.

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = 1,\,1,\,1,\,2,\,5,\,16,\,61,\,272,\,1385,\,7936,\,50521,\,353792,\ldots \quad n=0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots &lt;/math&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A000111}}). See ({{OEIS2C|id=A253671}}).

Thus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 B_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] \frac{n }{2^n-4^n}\, T_{n-1}\  &amp; n &amp;= 2, 3, \ldots \\
 E_n &amp;= (-1)^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor} [n\text{ even}] T_{n+1} &amp; n &amp;= 0, 1, \ldots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are given immediately by {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are obtained from {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.

What remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. However, already in 1877 [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]] {{harv|Seidel|1877}} published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

:[[File:SeidelAlgorithmForTn.png|frame|none|Seidel's algorithm for {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}]]

#Start by putting 1 in row 0 and let {{math|''k''}} denote the number of the row currently being filled
#If {{math|''k''}} is odd, then put the number on the left end of the row {{math|''k'' − 1}} in the first position of the row {{math|''k''}}, and fill the row from the left to the right, with every entry being the sum of the number to the left and the number to the upper
#At the end of the row duplicate the last number.
#If {{math|''k''}} is even, proceed similar in the other direction.

Seidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont {{harv|Dumont|1981}}) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.

Similar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz {{harv|Knuth|Buckholtz|1967}} gave a recurrence equation for the numbers {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and recommended this method for computing {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.

V. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in {{harv|Arnold|1991}} and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name [[boustrophedon transform]].

==A combinatorial view: alternating permutations==
{{main article|Alternating permutations}}

Around 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, [[Désiré André]] proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis {{harv|André|1879}} &amp; {{harv|André|1881}}. Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the [[trigonometric functions]]
{{math|tan ''x''}} and {{math|sec ''x''}} André made a startling discovery.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \tan x &amp;= x + \frac{2x^3}{3!} + \frac{16x^5}{5!} + \frac{272x^7}{7!} + \frac{7936x^9}{9!} + \cdots\\[6pt]
 \sec x &amp;= 1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{5x^4}{4!} + \frac{61x^6}{6!} + \frac{1385x^8}{8!} + \frac{50521x^{10}}{10!} + \cdots
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are the [[Euler number]]s of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of {{math|tan ''x'' + sec ''x''}} has as coefficients the rational numbers {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

: &lt;math&gt; \tan x + \sec x = 1 + x + \tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \tfrac{1}{3}x^3 + \tfrac{5}{24}x^4 + \tfrac{2}{15}x^5 + \tfrac{61}{720}x^6 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

André then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the [[alternating permutation]]s of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).

==Related sequences==

The arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: 
{{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|6}}}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, {{math|1=''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = −{{sfrac|1|30}}}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}. Via the second row of its inverse Akiyama–Tanigawa transform {{OEIS2C|id=A177427}}, they lead to Balmer series {{OEIS2C|id=A061037}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A061038}}.

The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to {{OEIS2C|id=A060819}} ({{math|''n'' + 4}}) / {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{mvar|n}}) leads to the Bernoulli numbers {{OEIS2C|id=A027641}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A164555}} / {{OEIS2C|id=A027642}}, or {{OEIS2C|id=A176327}} {{OEIS2C|id=A176289}} without {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, named intrinsic Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}.

Hence another link between the intrinsic Bernoulli numbers and the Balmer series via {{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n''}}).

{{OEIS2C|id=A145979}} ({{math|''n'' − 2}}) = 0, 2, 1, 6,… is a permutation of the non-negative numbers.

The terms of the first row are f(n) = {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}} + {{sfrac|1|''n'' + 2}}}}. 2, f(n) is an autosequence of the second kind. 3/2, f(n) leads by its inverse binomial transform to 3/2 &amp;minus;1/2 1/3 &amp;minus;1/4 1/5 ... = 1/2 + log 2.

Consider g(n) = 1/2 - 1 / (n+2) = 0, 1/6, 1/4, 3/10, 1/3. The Akiyama-Tanagiwa transforms gives:

0, g(n), is an autosequence of the second kind.

==Arithmetical properties of the Bernoulli numbers==

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} for integers {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} provided for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} the expression {{math|−''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}} is understood as the limiting value and the convention {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the [[Agoh–Giuga conjecture]] postulates that {{mvar|p}} is a prime number if and only if {{math|''pB''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is congruent to −1 modulo {{mvar|p}}. Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the [[ideal class group]]s of [[cyclotomic field]]s by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the [[Herbrand-Ribet theorem]], and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by [[Ankeny–Artin–Chowla congruence|Ankeny–Artin–Chowla]].

=== The Kummer theorems ===

The Bernoulli numbers are related to [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (FLT) by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]'s theorem {{harv|Kummer|1850}}, which says:

:If the odd prime {{mvar|p}} does not divide any of the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''p'' − 3&lt;/sub&gt;}} then {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}} has no solutions in nonzero integers.

Prime numbers with this property are called [[regular prime]]s. Another classical result of Kummer {{harv|Kummer|1851}} are the following [[Modular arithmetic#Congruence relation|congruences]].

{{main article|Kummer's congruence}}

:Let {{mvar|p}} be an odd prime and {{mvar|b}} an even number such that {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} does not divide {{mvar|b}}. Then for any non-negative integer {{mvar|k}}
:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{B_{k(p-1)+b}}{k(p-1)+b} \equiv \frac{B_{b}}{b} \pmod{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of these congruences goes by the name of {{math|''p''}}-adic continuity.

==={{math|''p''}}-adic continuity===

If {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are positive integers such that {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}} are not divisible by {{math|''p'' − 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≡ ''n'' mod ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''b'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; (''p'' − 1)}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;(1-p^{m-1})\frac{B_m}{m} \equiv (1-p^{n-1})\frac{B_n} n \pmod{p^b}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −''nζ''(1 − ''n'')}}, this can also be written

:&lt;math&gt;\left(1-p^{-u}\right)\zeta(u) \equiv \left(1-p^{-v}\right)\zeta(v) \pmod{p^b},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 − ''m''}} and {{math|''v'' {{=}} 1 − ''n''}}, so that {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}}. This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with {{math|1 − ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−''s''&lt;/sup&gt;}} taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the [[p-adic number|{{mvar|p}}-adic number]]s on odd negative integers congruent modulo {{math|''p'' − 1}} to a particular {{math|''a'' ≢ 1 mod (''p'' − 1)}}, and so can be extended to a continuous function {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'')}} for all {{mvar|p}}-adic integers {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the [[p-adic zeta function|{{mvar|p}}-adic zeta function]].

=== Ramanujan's congruences ===

The following relations, due to [[Ramanujan]], provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:

:&lt;math&gt;\binom{m+3}{m} B_m=\begin{cases}
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 0\pmod 6;\\
\frac{m+3}{3}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-2}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 2\pmod 6;\\
-\frac{m+3}{6}-\sum\limits_{j=1}^\frac{m-4}{6}\binom{m+3}{m-6j}B_{m-6j}, &amp; \text{if } m\equiv 4\pmod 6.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Von Staudt–Clausen theorem ===

{{main article|Von Staudt–Clausen theorem}}

The von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by [[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] {{harv|von Staudt|1840}} and [[Thomas Clausen (mathematician)|Thomas Clausen]] {{harv|Clausen|1840}} independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}},
: &lt;math&gt; B_{2n} + \sum_{(p-1)\,\mid\,2n} \frac1p&lt;/math&gt;
is an integer. The sum extends over all [[prime number|primes]] {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}.

A consequence of this is that the denominator of {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the product of all primes {{math|''p''}} for which {{math|''p'' − 1}} divides {{math|2''n''}}. In particular, these denominators are [[square-free]] and divisible by&amp;nbsp;6.

=== Why do the odd Bernoulli numbers vanish? ===
The sum

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_k(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^k - \frac{n^k} 2&lt;/math&gt;

can be evaluated for negative values of the index {{math|''n''}}. Doing so will show that it is an [[odd function]] for even values of {{math|''k''}}, which implies that the  sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''k'' + 1 − ''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 0 for {{math|''m''}} even and {{math|2''k'' + 1 − ''m'' &gt; 1}}; and that the term for {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is cancelled by the subtraction.  The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for ''n'' &gt; 1).

From the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}} the number {{math|2''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets

: &lt;math&gt; 2B_n =\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \frac{2}{m+1}m! \left\{{n+1\atop m+1} \right\} = 0\quad(n&gt;1 \text{ is odd})&lt;/math&gt;

as a ''sum of integers'', which is not trivial. Here a combinatorial fact comes to surface which explains the vanishing of the Bernoulli numbers at odd index. Let {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the number of surjective maps from {{math|{1, 2, …, ''n''}|}} to {{math|{1, 2, …, ''m''}|}}, then {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''!&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;{&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''m''|a=c}}&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;}}. The last equation can only hold if

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\text{odd }m=1}^{n-1} \frac 2 {m^2}S_{n,m}=\sum_{\text{even } m=2}^n \frac{2}{m^2} S_{n,m} \quad (n&gt;2 \text{ is even}). &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be proved by induction. The first two examples of this equation are

:{{math|1=''n'' = 4: 2 + 8 = 7 + 3}},
:{{math|1=''n'' = 6: 2 + 120 + 144 = 31 + 195 + 40}}.

Thus the Bernoulli numbers vanish at odd index because some non-obvious combinatorial identities are embodied in the Bernoulli numbers.

=== A restatement of the Riemann hypothesis ===

The connection between the Bernoulli numbers and the Riemann zeta function is strong enough to provide an alternate formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (RH) which uses only the Bernoulli number. In fact [[Marcel Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1916}} proved that the RH is equivalent to the following assertion:

:For every {{math|''ε'' &gt; {{sfrac|1|4}}}} there exists a constant {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}} (depending on {{math|''ε''}}) such that {{math|{{abs|''R''(''x'')}} &lt; ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''ε''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''ε''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|''x'' → ∞}}.

Here {{math|''R''(''x'')}} is the [[Riesz function]]

: &lt;math&gt; R(x) = 2 \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\frac{k^{\overline{k}} x^{k}}{(2\pi)^{2k}\left(\frac{B_{2k}}{2k}\right)}
= 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{k^{\overline{k}}x^k}{(2\pi)^{2k}\beta_{2k}}. &lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;{{overline|''k''}}&lt;/sup&gt;}} denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol#Alternate notations|rising factorial power]] in the notation of [[D. E. Knuth]]. The numbers {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}} occur frequently in the study of the zeta function and are significant  because {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a {{math|''p''}}-integer for primes {{math|''p''}} where {{math|''p'' − 1}} does not divide {{math|''n''}}.  The {{math|''β''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are called ''divided Bernoulli numbers''.

==&lt;span id="Generalized Bernoulli numbers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Generalized Bernoulli numbers==
The '''generalized Bernoulli numbers''' are certain [[algebraic number]]s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to [[Special values of L-functions|special values]] of [[Dirichlet L-function|Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-functions]] in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.

Let {{mvar|χ}} be a [[Dirichlet character]] modulo {{mvar|f}}. The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to {{mvar|χ}} are defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a=1}^f \chi(a) \frac{te^{at}}{e^{ft}-1} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty B_{k,\chi}\frac{t^k}{k!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from the exceptional {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, we have, for any Dirichlet character {{mvar|χ}}, that {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''χ''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} if {{math|''χ''(−1) ≠ (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}:

: &lt;math&gt;L(1-k,\chi)=-\frac{B_{k,\chi}}k,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''(''s'',''χ'')}} is the Dirichlet {{mvar|L}}-function of {{mvar|χ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neukirch|1999|loc=§VII.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assorted identities ===
{{unordered list
|1 = [[Umbral calculus]] gives a compact form of Bernoulli's formula by using an abstract symbol {{math|'''B'''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \frac 1 {m+1} ((\mathbf{B} + n)^{m+1} - B_{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the symbol {{math|'''B'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that appears during binomial expansion of the parenthesized term is to be replaced by the Bernoulli number {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}}). More suggestively and mnemonically, this may be written as a definite integral:

:&lt;math&gt;S_m(n) = \int_0^n (\mathbf{B}+x)^m\,dx &lt;/math&gt;

Many other Bernoulli identities can be written compactly with this symbol, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{B} + 1)^m  = B_m  &lt;/math&gt;

|2 = Let {{math|''n''}} be non-negative and even

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(n) = \frac{(-1)^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} B_n (2\pi)^n}{2(n!)}&lt;/math&gt;

|3 = The {{math|''n''}}th [[cumulant]] of the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[probability distribution]] on the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;0] is {{math|{{sfrac|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|''n''}}}}.

|4 = Let {{math|''n''? {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''n''!}}}} and {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the following {{math|(''n'' + 1) × (''n'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
B_n &amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
2? &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
n? &amp; (n-1)? &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
(n+1)? &amp; n? &amp; \cdots &amp; 2? &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix} \\[8pt]
&amp; = n! \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{2!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\frac{1}{n!} &amp; \frac{1}{(n-1)!} &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{(n+1)!} &amp; \frac{1}{n!} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{1}{2!} &amp; 0
\end{vmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the determinant is {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(1)}}, the [[Stirling polynomial]] at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}}.

|5 = For even-numbered Bernoulli numbers, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given by the {{math|(''p'' + 1) × (''p'' + 1)}} determinant:&lt;ref name="Malenfant 2011"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1103.1585 |author1=Jerome Malenfant |title=Finite, closed-form expressions for the partition function and for Euler, Bernoulli, and Stirling numbers |class=math.NT |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; B_{2p} = -\frac{(2p)!}{2^{2p} - 2} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\frac{1}{5!} &amp; \frac{1}{3!} &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

|6 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}. Then ([[Leonhard Euler]])

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}B_k B_{n-k}+B_{n-1}=-B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|7 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|von Ettingshausen|1827}}

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n+1}k (n+k+1)B_{n+k}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

|8 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}.  Then ([[Leopold Kronecker]] 1883)

: &lt;math&gt; B_n = - \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k} \binom{n+1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k j^n &lt;/math&gt;

|9 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} and {{math|''m'' ≥ 1}}.  Then {{harv|Carlitz|1968}}

: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^m \sum_{r=0}^m \binom{m}{r} B_{n+r}=(-1)^n \sum_{s=0}^n \binom{n}{s} B_{m+s} &lt;/math&gt;

|10 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}} and

: &lt;math&gt; H_n=\sum_{k=1}^n k^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

the [[harmonic number]]. Then (H. Miki 1978)

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k}\frac{B_k}{k} - \sum_{k=2}^{n-2} \binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}{n-k} B_k =H_n B_n&lt;/math&gt;

|11 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 4}}. [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] found (1997)

: &lt;math&gt; (n+2)\sum_{k=2}^{n-2}B_k B_{n-k}-2\sum_{l=2}^{n-2}\binom{n+2}{l} B_l B_{n-l}=n(n+1)B_n &lt;/math&gt;

|12 = ''Faber–[[Rahul Pandharipande|Pandharipande]]–[[Zagier]]–Gessel identity'': for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}},

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{2}\left(B_{n-1}(x)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{B_{k}(x)}{k}
\frac{B_{n-k}(x)}{n-k}\right) -\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\binom{n}{k}\frac{B_{n-k}}
{n-k} B_k(x) =H_{n-1}B_n(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Choosing {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} results in the Bernoulli number identity in one or another convention.

|13 = The next formula is true for {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, but only for {{math|''n'' ≥ 1}} if {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(0) {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}.

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{B_k}{n-k+2} = \frac{B_{n+1}}{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

|14 = Let {{math|''n'' ≥ 0}}. Then

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_k(1) = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; -1 + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \frac{2^{n-k+1}}{n-k+1}B_{k}(0) = \delta_{n,0} &lt;/math&gt;

Brown''' (1839–?) was an American educator and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]] who was one of the first to legally challenge [[racial segregation in the United States]] when she filed a lawsuit against a streetcar company in [[San Francisco]] in the 1860s after she was forcibly removed from a segregated streetcar.

==Family and early life==

[[File:Pioneers of Negro Origin cropped Cover.jpg|thumb|220px|Cover of Pioneers of Negro Origin in California, by Sue Bailey Thurman]]

Brown was born in [[Maryland]] in 1839, the daughter of James E Brown, who was born [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved,]] and Charlotte Brown, a free seamstress. The elder Charlotte Brown purchased her husband's freedom and in 1850 they were living as [[Free people of color]] in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, with several children, including Charlotte.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Elinson, [http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/San-Francisco-s-own-Rosa-Parks-2554060.php San Francisco's own Rosa Parks, San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1850 Census, Baltimore, Maryland, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; Some time between 1850 and 1860 they moved their family to San Francisco, which was booming as a result of the [[California Gold Rush]], and became a part of that city's burgeoning black middle class.&lt;ref&gt;1860 Census, San Francisco, California, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Sue Bailey.

==Streetcar incident==

[[File:Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Horse-drawn streetcar San Francisco 1860's]]

At 8PM on April 17, 1863, Charlotte Brown took a seat on a [[Horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] one block from her home on Filbert Street in San Francisco. She was on her way to see her doctor. The streetcar was owned by the Omnibus Railroad Company. When the streetcar conductor approached her and asked her to leave, Brown said she "had a right to ride" and had no intention of leaving the car.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In her courtroom testimony, she stated:

"The conductor went around and collected tickets and when he came to me I handed him my ticket and he refused to take it. It was one of the Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. I told him I had been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be."&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

The conductor, Thomas Dennison, asked her several times to leave, and each time she refused. Finally, when a white woman objected to her presence, he grabbed her by the arm and escorted her off the car.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uwKuLlDDT-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=african+american+women+confront+the+west&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_-4XNgI3OAhVD8WMKHTfsCtkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=african%20american%20women%20confront%20the%20west&amp;f=false African American Women Confront the West, 1600-2000, University of Oklahoma Press, 2008], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charlotte Brown vs. Omnibus Railroad==

[[File:Orville C. Pratt.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Judge Orville C. Pratt ruled in Brown's favor, calling streetcar segregation "a relic of barbarism"]]

Her father James E Brown hired attorney W. C. Burnett, and Charlotte Brown brought a lawsuit against the Omnibus Railroad Company for $200.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Elinson and Stan Yogi, [http://www.wherevertheresafight.com/excerpts/under_color_of_law_the_fight_for_racial_equality Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers, and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, Heyday Press, 2010, Chapter Four:Under Color of Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore, African American Women Confront the West, 1600-2000, University of Oklahoma Press, Aug 1, 2008, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Nov 21, 1863,&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans had just won the right to testify against whites that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine, Elinson, San Francisco's Own Rosa Parks, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Omnibus Railroad argued that its conductor's action was justified because racial segregation protected white women and children who might be fearful or 'repulsed' by riding in the same car as African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard and Moore p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Brown won her case, presided over by Judge Cowles, but the jury only awarded her twenty-five dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, June 26, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor, Dennison, was convicted in criminal court of assault and battery against Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's civil case was tied up in [[appeal]]s for the next two years. In one appeals trial, the jury awarded Brown only five cents, the price of the streetcar ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, November 14, 1863&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, just three days after the first trial, Brown was ejected from yet another streetcar and brought a second suit against Omnibus, this time for $3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Quintard Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=W-iKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Quintard+Taylor+In+Search+of+the+Racial+Frontier+Charlotte+Brown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp4t3xgo3OAhUD5GMKHVoWA5kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quintard%20Taylor%20In%20Search%20of%20the%20Racial%20Frontier%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West , W. W. Norton &amp; Company,  1999], p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in October, 1864, her case was tried in a higher court. In his judgment of October 5, 1864, Judge [[Orville C. Pratt]] of the 12th District Court upheld the earlier verdict in favor of Brown, ruling that excluding passengers from streetcars because of their race was illegal. He had no desire, he said in his ruling, to "perpetuate a relic of barbarism":

"It has been already quite too long tolerated by the dominant race to see with indifference the negro or mulatto treated as a brute, insulted, wronged, enslaved, made to wear a yoke, to tremble before white men, to serve him as a tool, to hold property and life at his will, to surrender to him his intellect and conscience, and to seal his lips and belie his thought through dread of the white man's power", Judge Pratt stated.&lt;ref&gt;lElaine Elinson and Stan Yogi, Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers, and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, Chapter Four, Heyday Press, 2010, Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 1865, a jury awarded Brown $500.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, In Search of the Racial Frontier, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; The Omnibus Railroad Company appealed the verdict but was refused another trial.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction==

[[File:Charlotte Brown Editorial Cartoon.jpg|350px|thumb|Racist editorial cartoon published in 1864 after Charlotte Brown won a lawsuit against a segregated San Francisco streetcar company]]

After the first trial, [[African-American newspapers|the black-owned newspaper]] the ''Pacific Appeal'' noted that the verdict in her favor "establishes the right, by law, of colored persons to ride in such conveyances".

"While the law recognizes and gives us the right to ride in such conveyances," the editorial continued, "there are a certain number of the employees of this Company, who, if a colored person attempts to cross the street while their car is passing, are seized with a sudden fit of Negrophobia, which is generally manifested by pulling their alarm bell violently, as if some danger was imminent, so afraid are they that some other of our respectable females might attempt to exercise the right that Miss Brown has just won. So long as we have law, justice and right on our side, we want no pity."&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Number 34, November 1863&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Pratt's 1864 ruling was derided in an editorial cartoon by a local white-owned newspaper that showed blacks and whites riding side by side. Using a racial epithet, it accused Pratt of being partial to African Americans, and questioned whether the light-skinned Brown was really black, or just filing suit for the monetary award.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, African-American Women Confront the West, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; A white editor of ''The Sacramento Daily Union'', on the other hand, said of Pratt's decision, "his argument is lucid, and his decision, we believe, chimes in with the sentiment of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Sacramento Daily Union, Volume 28, Number 4225, 5 October 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charlotte Brown case paved the way for other cases brought by San Francisco African Americans like William Bowen and [[Mary Ellen Pleasant]] that challenged the "whites-only" practices of the privately owned streetcars.&lt;ref&gt;Elinson, Elaine, "San Francisco's Own Rosa Parks" San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Lynn Marie, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Making_of_Mammy_Pleasant.html?id=S2YvRVIou3cC The Making of "Mammy Pleasant": A Black Entrepreneur in Nineteenth-century, University of Illinois Press], p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 streetcar segregation was officially outlawed on statewide streetcars by the California legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Degraaf and Taylor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qa_tAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Seeking+El+Dorado+Charlotte+Brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sQzcLJNKQk&amp;sig=G1MO6ZXUF1tpFakp-Fk-M0XP6RI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi15-X7hY3OAhVK3WMKHcWMDjsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Seeking%20El%20Dorado%20Charlotte%20Brown&amp;f=false Seeking El Dorado], African Americans in California, University of Washington Press, 2001, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

After Charlotte Brown won her case, Senator [[Charles Sumner]] invoked the case in [[United States Congress|Congress]] as setting an important precedent for racial equality when he argued in favor of integrating streetcars in [[Washington, D.C.|the nation's capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zTqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA544&amp;lpg=PA544&amp;dq=journal+of+the+civil+war+era+charlotte+brown&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jidsmI_QG8&amp;sig=nKTqk0UPyjMCYqMMUpp02jaRmg8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9s8aDh43OAhUBTGMKHSh1BPEQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=journal%20of%20the%20civil%20war%20era%20charlotte%20brown&amp;f=false Journal of the Civil War Era: Winter 2011 Issue], p 544&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Charlotte Brown opened a school for young children at 10 Scotland Street in San Francisco, offering "all the branches of primary education" as well as music and embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Pacific Appeal, Elevator, Number 14, 5 July 1867&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she married James Henry Riker,&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator,  January 27, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; another prominent African American activist of San Francisco, who had worked as a live-in personal servant to [[William Chapman Ralston]] and was employed as a steward at the [[Palace Hotel, San Francisco|Palace Hotel]] during their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Herald, Vol 11, Number 128, 30 April 1879&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, No. 15, 14 July 1865&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 4 April 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1870 Census, San Francisco, Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Voter Registration Lists 1870 and 1880, Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Riker, along with Brown's father, was one of the organizers of the 1865 California State Convention of Colored Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Elevator, June 16, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; The society pages of the black newspaper ''The Elevator'' printed an announcement in 1877 of a surprise party for a fellow steward at the Palace Hotel that was given by Charlotte and James H Riker in their residence on 1018 Powell Street in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Elevator, Number 52, 31 March 1877&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Charlotte Brown Riker's life after that time.

[[File:Rosa parks human rights museum memphis 2.jpg|thumb|left|Image of Rosa Parks from Memphis Civil Rights Museum]]

The Charlotte Brown lawsuit was one of the first of several actions that were brought by black activists in both [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Northern United States|Northern]] cities throughout the United States to protest exclusion and [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]] on public transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Elizabeth Jennings Graham|Elizabeth Jennings]] successfully filed suit against the Third Avenue Railway Company in [[New York City]] after she had been ejected from a streetcar there because of her skin color.&lt;ref&gt;Greider, Katharine, '[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/thecity/the-schoolteacher-on-the-streetcar.html?_r=0 'The Schoolteacher and the Streetcar,'' The New York Times, Nov 13, 2005'']&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia in 1865, a "Mrs. Derry" won a civil suit and $50 in damages after a streetcar conductor threw her off the bus and kicked her when she and a group of women were returning from tending to Civil War soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Giesburg, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sojourner Truth]], [[Ida B. Wells]], and [[Frances Harper|Frances Watkins Parker]] also lobbied actively for streetcar integration after being refused ridership on streetcars in Washington, D.C., Memphis, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saintssistersandsluts.com/10-women-who-refused-to-give-up-their-seats-before-rosa-parks/ Ten Women Who Refused to Give Up Their Seats Before Rosa Parks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though streetcars in the north were largely de-segregated by the end of the 19th century, segregation on public transportation [[Plessy v. Ferguson|became the official policy]] in many cities of the South.&lt;ref&gt;Blair L. M. Kelley. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Right_to_Ride.html?id=Rt8jwoFxsxEC Right to Ride: Streetcar Boycotts and African American Citizenship in the Era of Plessy v. Ferguson]. John Hope Franklin Series in African American History and Culture. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, women like [[Irene Morgan]] and [[Mary Louise Smith (civil rights activist)|Mary Louise Smith]] continued to battle segregation on public transportation. In 1954, [[Rosa Parks]] challenged the practice in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], launching a [[Montgomery bus boycott|citywide bus boycott]] and helping to start the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/rosa-parks&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''African American Women Confront the West'', scholars Quintard Taylor and Shirley Ann Wilson Moore analyze the Charlotte Brown case and other 19th-century streetcar desegregation lawsuits brought by black women as they relate historically to both race and gender. They noted that it was frequently women who filed these lawsuits because of prevailing ideas of public vs. private space, and white views of black gender roles:

"Activist black men were keenly aware of the power of black women to go, where they, as men, could not," they write. "Relying on the wedge of gender, black women's lawsuits against streetcar companies ultimately assured the right to travel of blacks generally ... the declaration of law was a general one that applied not simply to Charlotte Brown or to Mary Pleasant, but to all blacks as well."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Moore, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|Dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power}}
:''Individual nation articles should be consulted on specific national responses to corruption.''

In general, '''corruption''' is a form of [[dishonesty]] or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Corruption can be illegal (or legal in a [[kleptocracy]]){{dubious|date=July 2018}} and dishonest, but in recent years can also can involve legal miss-conduct in many other countries and can have global reach in many cases. See [http://thelawdictionary.org/corruption/ Black's Law Dictionary] for legal definition. See also: [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf worldbank.org] paper noting that corruption "may involve collusion between parties typically both from the public and private sectors, and may be legal in many countries"&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption may include many activities including [[bribery]] and [[embezzlement]], though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf |title=Report|website=siteresources.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political corruption]] occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most  commonplace in [[kleptocracies]], [[oligarchies]], [[narco-state]]s and [[mafia]] states.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime. Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term [[anti-corruption]].

Stephen D. Morris,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of politics, writes that [[Politics|politic]]al corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior&lt;ref&gt;Senior, I. (2006), Corruption – The World’s Big C., Institute of Economic Affairs, London&lt;/ref&gt; defines corruption as an action to (a) secretly provide (b) a good or a service to a third party (c) so that he or she can influence certain actions which (d) benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both (e) in which the corrupt agent has authority. [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]],&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|title=Legal Corruption|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro|year=2005|publisher=World Bank|format=PDF|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|author-link1=Daniel Kaufmann (economist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the World Bank, extends the concept to include 'legal corruption' in which power is abused within the confines of the law—as those with power often have the ability to make laws for their protection. The effect of corruption in infrastructure is to increase costs and construction time, lower the quality and decrease the benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Mariani|first2=Giacomo|last3=Sainati|first3=Tristano|last4=Greco|first4=Marco|date=2017-04-01|title=Corruption in public projects and megaprojects: There is an elephant in the room!|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786316301090|journal=International Journal of Project Management|volume=35|issue=3|pages=252–268|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2016.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research work on social corruption developed at [[The Unicist Research Institute]] defines that corruption allows individuals to profit from the environment through illegitimate actions while they disintegrate the system they are part of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Peter Belohlavek | title = Social Corruption and Corruption Inhibitors as a Complex Adaptive System | publisher =SSRN | date = June 2017 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.3066116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.

Increasingly, a number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf|title=Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petty corruption===
'''Petty corruption''' occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mishler v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1993/22397-1.html|website=Justia Law|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf|title=Report|website=supremecourt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other private and government sectors.

===Grand corruption===
'''Grand corruption''' is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/NGO/Grand_Corruption_definition_with_explanation_19_August_2016_002_1.pdf|title=Material on Grand corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, [[Executive (government)|executive]] and judiciary branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|title=Political And Judicial Checks On Corruption: Evidence From American State Governments|last=Alt|first=James|date=|website=Projects at Harvard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203043655/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic corruption===
'''Systemic corruption''' (or endemic corruption)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest|conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-931003-11-7 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty{{clarify|reason=change wording. Does this mean Western governments should NOT protect... in order that the undeveloped country develop its own? Or that it should stop corruption?|date=February 2015}} of western governments to protect against systematic corruption of underdeveloped governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Merle|editor1-first=Jean-Christophe|title=Global Challenges to Liberal Democracy|journal=Spheres of Global Justice|date=2013|volume=1|page=812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas|title=Severe Poverty as a Violation of Negative Duties|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|website=thomaspogge.com|accessdate=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211060650/http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/|archive-date=11 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption in different sectors==
Corruption can occur in any sector, whether they be public or private industry or even [[NGOs]] (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.

===Government/public sector===
{{anchor|Government/Public corruption}}

Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|year=2013|title=Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|format=PDF|website= World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/pubs/article/article.asp |title=SOS, Missouri – State Archives Publications |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf |format=PDF|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|website= Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

[[File:"Golden toilet" in ((Kaunas)), ((Lithuania)).png|thumb|250px|right|The Kaunas "golden toilet".]]

The '''[[Corruption in Lithuania#Kaunas golden toilet case|Kaunas golden toilet case]]''' was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor [[Andrius Kupčinskas]]) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500'000 [[litas]] (around 150'000 euros). It was to also require 5'000 LTL (1'500 EUR) in monthly maintenance costs.&lt;ref name="archive.org5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/auksinis-tualetas-per-menesi-atsieis-5-tukst-lt.d?id=59903123|title="Auksinis" tualetas per mėnesį atsieis 5 tūkst.

Despite the investment, the "golden toilet" remained closed for years due to the dysfunctionality and was a subject of a lengthy anti-corruption investigation into those who had created it and &lt;ref name="archive.org5"/&gt; the local municipality even considered demolishing the building at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|title=Alfa.lt – Kauno apskrities viršininko administracija kreipėsi į teismą dėl "auksinio" tualeto griovimo|date=18 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118124213/https://www.alfa.lt/straipsnis/10267128/kauno-apskrities-virsininko-administracija-kreipesi-i-teisma-del-auksinio-tualeto-griovimo|archivedate=18 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of public servants involved in the toilet's procurement received various prison sentences for recklessness, malfeasance, misuse of power and document falsifications in a 2012 court case, but were cleared of their corruption charges and received compensation, which pushed the total construction cost and subsequent related financial losses to 352'000 euros.

Various sources acclaim the [[People's Party (Spain)|Spanish People's Party]] – Partido Popular -, to be Europe's most corrupt party, with about yearly 45 billion euro worth of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lasemaineduroussillon.com/2017/09/22/plus-de-45-milliards-de-de-corruption-annuelle-rajoy-a-tete-parti-politique-plus-corrompu-deurope/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Police corruption====
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the thin blue line itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.

Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].

====Judicial corruption====
Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related [[judicial misconduct|misconduct of judges]], through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct.

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the [[constitutional economics]].

It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state.

===Corruption in the education system===
{{anchor|Educational system/Universities}}
Corruption in education is a worldwide phenomenon. Corruption in admissions to universities is traditionally considered as one of the most corrupt areas of the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat. (2013). Recruitment and Admissions: Fostering Transparency on the Path to Higher Education. In Transparency International: Global Corruption Report: Education (pp. 148–54). New York: Routledge, 536 p].&lt;/ref&gt; Recent attempts in some countries, such as Russia and Ukraine, to curb corruption in admissions through the abolition of university entrance examinations and introduction of standardized computer-graded tests have largely failed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/araratosipian/ Osipian, Ararat.

===Within labor unions===
The Teamsters ([[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]) is an example of how the civil [[RICO]] process can be used. For decades, the Teamsters have been substantially controlled by [[La Cosa Nostra]]. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI – Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524172413/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=2014-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in religion===
{{wikiquote|Corruption in religion}}
The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets [[Isaiah]] and [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] berate the rabbinical establishment of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Judea]] for failing to live up to the ideals of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaiah]] 1:2–31, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] 5:21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 23:13–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] accuses the [[Catholic Church]] of widespread corruption, including selling of [[w:Indulgence|indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]] advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including [[James W. Fifield Jr.]], to develop and promote a new [[hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the [[social Gospel]] and emphasize themes, such as [[individual salvation]], more congenial to [[free enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to "[[w:Merchandising|merchandise]]" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as [[w:James W. Fifield Jr.#Spiritual Mobilization|Spiritual Mobilization]], the prayer breakfast groups, and the [[w:Freedoms Foundation|Freedoms Foundation]], they had linked [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in philosophy===
19th century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] acknowledges that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguishes the corrupt "university" philosophers, whose "real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public"&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “On Philosophy in the Universities,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth.

::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], “Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real,” ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[criminology]], '''[[corporate crime]]''' refers to crimes committed either by a [[corporation]] (i.e., a [[business entity]] having a separate legal personality from the [[natural person]]s that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]] and [[corporate liability]]). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow [[insider trading]].

The country is regarded poorly and that corruption is wounding the economy badly despite the emerging oil industries wealth.&lt;ref name="trans257"/&gt;

The '''[[Mitterrand–Pasqua affair]]''', also known informally as '''[[Angolagate]]''', was an international [[political scandal]] over the secret and illegal sale and shipment of arms from the nations of [[Central Europe]] to the government of [[Angola]] by the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] in the 1990s. It led to arrests and judiciary actions in the 2000s, involved an illegal arms sale to Angola despite a [[United Nations|UN]] embargo, with business interests in [[France]] and elsewhere improperly obtaining a share of Angolan oil revenues. The scandal has subsequently been tied to several prominent figures in French politics.&lt;ref name=trans257/&gt;

==Methods==
In [[systemic corruption]] and [[grand corruption]], multiple methods of corruption are used concurrently with similar aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Handbook on Practical Anti-Corruption Measures For Prosecutors and Investigators |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/corruption/publications_handbook_prosecutors.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery===
{{main|Bribery}}
Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is the common form of corruption. The types of favours given are diverse and may include money, gifts, sexual favours, company shares, entertainment, employment and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.

===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===
{{main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.

Examples include the misdirection of company funds into "shadow companies" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams and other corrupt activity.

===Graft===
{{main|Graft (politics)}}
The political act of '''Graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies.

===Extortion and blackmail===
{{main|Extortion}}
While [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of violence or false imprisonment as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.

This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy.

===Influence peddling===
[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in return for payment.

===Networking===
{{main|Business networking}}
Networking can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse of discretion===
{{main|Abuse of discretion}}
[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port.

===Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism===
{{main|Nepotism}}
[[Cronyism|Favouritism]], [[nepotism]] and [[clientelism]] involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/government-ethics/resources/what-is-government-ethics/favoritism-cronyism-and-nepotism/|title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism|last=|first=|date=|work=Santa Clara|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Corruption and economic growth ==
Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. ''Journal of Comparative Economics, 29'', 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Causes of corruption ==
According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimant|first=Eugen|last2=Tosato|first2=Guglielmo|date=2017-01-01|title=Causes and Effects of Corruption: What Has Past Decade's Empirical Research Taught Us? a Survey|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=32|issue=2|language=en|pages=335–356|doi=10.1111/joes.12198|issn=1467-6419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preventing corruption ===
[[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Klitgaard|Klitgaard, Robert]] (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA&lt;/ref&gt; postulates that corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted:

Corrupt gain &gt; Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted

The degree of corruption will then be a function of the degree of [[monopoly]] and discretion in deciding who should get how much on the one hand and the degree to which this activity is accountable and transparent on the other hand. Still, these equations (which should be understood in a qualitative rather than a quantitative manner) seem to be lacking one aspect: a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption without any moral weakness or insufficient integrity. Also, low penalties in combination with a low probability of being caught will only lead to corruption if people tend to neglect ethics and moral commitment. The original R.Klitgaard equation has therefore been amended by C. Stephan&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, {{ISBN|978-3-86582-452-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; into:

According to Stephan, the moral dimension has an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. The intrinsic component refers to a mentality problem, the extrinsic component to external circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for "alternative" solutions.

According to the amended Klitgaard equation, limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|last=|first=|doi = 10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917|year = 2012|last1 = Olken|first1 = Benjamin A|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|hdl=1721.1/73081}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; have independently addressed the important role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians’ income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.

===Enhancing Civil Society Participation ===
Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. The implementation of the ALACs “Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” has led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the [[OECD]]. There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].

As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore "...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|format=PDF|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then "OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33–69|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a document&lt;ref name="partnerplatform"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F. April 2013, Existing practices on anti-corruption, Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services helpdesk request |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found:
* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.
* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.
* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.
* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.
* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.
* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm’s productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform" /&gt;

==Legal corruption==
Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, there is an evolving concept of legal corruption,&lt;ref name="Legal Corruption"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website= Economics and Politics, v23 |pages= 195–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=May 2014}} as developed by [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] and Pedro Vicente.  It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website=Economics and Politics, v23|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of legal corruption ===
In 1977 the USA had enacted the ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/|title=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|website=justice.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; "for the purpose of making it unlawful... to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business" and invited all OECD countries to follow suit. In 1997 a corresponding [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was signed by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf |title=Report |website= oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/2406452.pdf|title= Report |website=oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

17 years after the FCPA enacting, a Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on legal corruption in industrialized OECD countries&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drucksache 12/8468|website= Bonn Parliament records|date=September 8, 1994|pages= 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they reported that in most industrial countries even at that time (1994) foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices had been diverging to a large extent, ranging from simple legalization, through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extremes like in Germany where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.
Consequently, in order to support national export corporations the Parliamentary Financial Commission recommended to reject a related previous Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition leader which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US FCPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] "Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste."&lt;/ref&gt;
Only after the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] came into force, did Germany withdraw the legalization of foreign corruption in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study====
The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).&lt;ref name=study /&gt;

Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:
* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition
* They must be common in the industry
* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year
* Payments must be appropriate
* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).
In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.

Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.

France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered "rémunérations occult" and are associated with the following disadvantages:
* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.
* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the "rémunérations occult" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.
* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.

Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.

Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.

Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.

Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.

Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.

Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.

US: (rough résumé: "generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA")

UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient."

===="Specific" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====
Referring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,&lt;ref name=study /&gt; the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions&lt;ref&gt;the term "official" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no "officials". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQYc-dAIF0MC&amp;pg=PA109 für Rolf Keller"] Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: "Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u.&amp;nbsp;a. eine Person, die &gt;&gt;nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst."&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until March 19, 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/1952622.pdf|title=OECD: Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Britta Bannenberg, ''Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle'', page VII (Introduction): "Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können."&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf "Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German_Shadow_Economy.png|thumb|Development of the shadow economy in [[Germany|(West-) Germany 1975–2015]]. Original [[shadow economy]] data from Friedrich Schneider, University Linz.]]
Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS)&lt;ref name=blackaccounts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#67|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the formation of the [[European Single Market]] in the upcoming [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]].
Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International: [http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/ach_das_mit_der_prostitution "Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden."]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/20063/umfrage/entwicklung-des-umfangs-der-schattenwirtschaft-seit-1995|title= Schattenwirtschaft – Umfang in Deutschland bis 2015 – Statistik|website=Statista}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Siemens corruption case ===
In 2007, [[Siemens]] was convicted in the District Court of [[Darmstadt]] of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation [[Enel Green Power|Enel Power SpA]]. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through [[black money]] accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] that were established specifically for such purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? – hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. According to Bucerius Law School professors Frank Saliger and Karsten Gaede, for the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like national ones although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#62|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the judicial proceedings however it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.&lt;ref name=blackaccounts /&gt;

== Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought ==
Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. [[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers "shelter behind a wall" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.

''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d&lt;/ref&gt;''

The [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ [[wikt:κόσμος|κόσμος]])&lt;ref&gt;2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit "unspotted from the world."&lt;ref&gt;James 1:27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably "deal with the world,"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:31.&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends they adopt an attitude of "as if not" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it "as if it were not theirs to keep."&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 7:30.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to refuse to "conform to the present age"&lt;ref&gt;Romans 12:2.&lt;/ref&gt; and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.&lt;ref&gt;1 Peter 2:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because "friendship with the world is enmity with God."&lt;ref&gt;James 4:4.&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.&lt;ref&gt;1 John 2:15.&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of this world, Paul explains, "are coming to nothing"&lt;ref&gt;1 Cor 2:6.&lt;/ref&gt; While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:1.&lt;/ref&gt; the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 13:8.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are "in the world, but not of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, ''In the World But Not Of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (2000), See also John 15:19.&lt;/ref&gt; This disposition, Paul claims, shows us a way to escape "slavery to corruption" and experience the freedom and glory of being innocent "children of God".&lt;ref&gt;Roman 8:21.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23688">{{distinguish|Dark Enlightenment}}The '''Counter-Enlightenment''' was a term that some 20th-century commentators have used to describe multiple strains of thought that arose in the late-18th and early-19th centuries in opposition to the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. 

Though the first known use of the term in English was in 1949 and there were several uses of it,&lt;ref&gt;Listed by Henry Hardy in the second edition of Isaiah Berlin, ''Against the Current: Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. xxv, note 1.&lt;/ref&gt; including one by [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Counter-Enlightenment is usually associated with [[Isaiah Berlin]], who is often credited for re-inventing it. The starting point of discussion on this concept in English started with Isaiah Berlin's 1973 Essay, ''The Counter-Enlightenment''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62895765|title=Counter-enlightenments : from the eighteenth century to the present|last=1965-|first=Garrard, Graeme,|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0203645669|location=Abingdon [England]|oclc=62895765}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' He published widely about the Enlightenment and its challengers and did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterized as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]], and organic,&lt;ref&gt;Aspects noted by Darrin M. McMahon, "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77–112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  which he associated most closely with [[German Romanticism]].        

==Development and significant people==
[[File:Jmaistre.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre]] was one of the more prominent altar-and-throne counter-revolutionaries who vehemently opposed Enlightenment ideas.]]

=== '''Early Stages''' ===
Despite criticism of the Enlightenment has emerged as a widely discussed topic in twentieth-century thought, the term 'Counter-Enlightenment' was underdeveloped. It was first mentioned briefly in English in [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]]'s 1949 article "Art, Aristocracy and Reason" in ''[[Partisan Review]].'' He used the term again in his 1958 book on existentialism, ''Irrational Man,'' however, his comment on Enlightenment criticism was very limited&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. In Germany, the expression "Gegen-Aukflärung" has a longer history. It was probably coined by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in "Nachgelassene Fragmente" in 1877&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Werke: Kristische Gesamtausgabe|last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1877|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=478}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Lewis White Beck]] used this term in his ''Early German Philosophy'' (1969), a book about Counter-Enlightenment in Germany. Beck claims that there is a counter-movement arising in Germany in reaction to [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick II]]'s secular authoritarian state. On the other hand, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and his fellow philosophers believe that a more organic conception of social and political life, a more vitalistic view of nature, and an appreciation for beauty and the spiritual life of man have been neglected by the eighteenth century&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== '''Isaiah Berlin''' ===
[[Isaiah Berlin]] established this term's place in the [[history of ideas]]. He used it to refer to a movement that arose primarily in late 18th- and early 19th-century Germany against the [[rationalism]], [[universalism]] and [[empiricism]], which are commonly associated with the Enlightenment. Berlin's essay "The Counter-Enlightenment" was first published in 1973, and later reprinted in a  collection of his works, ''Against the Current'', in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/ac/counter-enlightenment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been more widely used since.

[[File:Johann Georg Hamann (1730 –1788).jpg|thumb|[[Isaiah Berlin]] traces the Counter-Enlightenment back to [[J. G. Hamann]] (shown).]]

Berlin argues that, while there were opponents of the Enlightenment outside of Germany (e.g. [[Joseph de Maistre]]) and before the 1770s (e.g. [[Giambattista Vico]]), Counter-Enlightenment thought did not start until the Germans 'rebelled against the dead hand of France in the realms of culture, art and philosophy, and avenged themselves by launching the great counter-attack against the Enlightenment.' This German reaction to the imperialistic universalism of the French Enlightenment and Revolution, which had been forced on them first by the francophile [[Frederick II of Prussia]], then by the armies of Revolutionary France and finally by [[Napoleon]], was crucial to the shift of consciousness that occurred in Europe at this time, leading eventually to [[Romanticism]]. The consequence of this revolt against the Enlightenment was [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. The opponents to the Enlightenment played a more crucial role than its proponents, some of whom were [[monists]], whose political, intellectual and ideological offspring have been [[terreur]] and [[totalitarianism]].

=== '''Darrin McMahon''' ===
In his book ''Enemies of the Enlightenment'' (2001), historian [[Darrin McMahon]] extends the Counter-Enlightenment back to pre-Revolutionary France and down to the level of '[[Grub Street]],' thereby marking a major advance on Berlin's intellectual and Germanocentric view. McMahon focuses on the early opponents to the Enlightenment in France, unearthing a long-forgotten '[[Grub Street]]' literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries aimed at the ''[[Philosophy|philosophes]]''. He delves into the obscure world of the 'low Counter-Enlightenment' that attacked the ''[[encyclopédistes]]'' and fought to prevent the dissemination of Enlightenment ideas in the second half of the century. Many people from earlier times attacked the Enlightenment for undermining religion and the social and political order. It later became a major theme of conservative criticism of the Enlightenment. After the French Revolution, it appeared to vindicate the warnings of the ''[[Antiphilosophy|anti-philosophes]]'' in the decades prior to 1789.

=== '''Graeme Garrard''' ===
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Graeme Garrard]] traces the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment to [[Rousseau]].]]

[[Cardiff University]] professor Graeme Garrard claims that historian [[William Everdell|William R. Everdell]] was the first to situate Rousseau as the "founder of the Counter-Enlightenment" in his 1971 dissertation and in his 1987 book, ''Christian Apologetics in France, 1730–1790: The Roots of Romantic Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Graeme | last = Garrard | quote = To my knowledge, the first explicit identification of Rousseau as "founder of the "Counter-Enlightenment" appears in William Everdell's study of Christian apologetics in eighteenth-century France. | title = Rousseau's Counter-Enlightenment: A Republican Critique of the ''Philosophes'' | publisher = State University of New York Press | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1996 article, "the Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity", in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' (Vol. 90, No. 2), [[Arthur M. Melzer]] corroborates Everdell's view in placing the origin of the Counter-Enlightenment in the religious writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau,]] further showing Rousseau as the man who fired the first shot in the war between the Enlightenment and its opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melzer|first=Arthur M.|date=1996|title=The Origin of the Counter-Enlightenment: Rousseau and the New Religion of Sincerity|url=www.jstor.org/stable/2082889|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=90|pages=344-360|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Graeme Garrard]] follows Melzer in his "Rousseau's Counter-Enlightenment" (2003). This contradicts Berlin's depiction of Rousseau as a ''[[philosophe]]'' (albeit an erratic one) who shared the basic beliefs of his Enlightenment contemporaries. But similar to McMahon, Garrard traces the beginning of Counter-Enlightenment thought back to France and prior to the German ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' movement of the 1770s. Garrard's book ''Counter-Enlightenments'' (2006) broadens the term even further, arguing against Berlin that there was no single 'movement' called 'The Counter-Enlightenment'. Rather, there have been many Counter-Enlightenments, from the middle of the 18th century to 20th-century Enlightenment among critical theorists, postmodernists and feminists. The Enlightenment has opponents on all points of its ideological compass, from the far left to the far right, and all points in between. Each of the Enlightenment's challengers depicted it as they saw it or wanted others to see it, resulting in a vast range of portraits, many of which are not only different but incompatible.

=== '''James Schmidt''' ===
The idea of Counter-Enlightenment has evolved in the following years. The historian James Schmidt questioned the idea of 'Enlightenment' and therefore of the existence of a movement opposing it. As the conception of 'Enlightenment' has become more complex and difficult to maintain, so has the idea of the 'Counter-Enlightenment'. Advances in Enlightenment scholarship in the last quarter-century have challenged the stereotypical view of the 18th century as an '[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]', leading Schmidt to speculate on whether the Enlightenment might not actually be a creation of its opponents, but the other way round. The fact that the term 'Enlightenment' was first used in 1894 in English to refer to a historical period supports the argument that it was a late construction projected back onto the 18th century.

==The French Revolution==
[[File:Edmund Burke by James Northcote.JPG|thumb|Political thinker [[Edmund Burke]] opposed the [[French Revolution]] in his ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''.]]

By the mid-1790s, the [[Reign of Terror]] during the French Revolution fueled a major reaction against the Enlightenment. Many leaders of the French Revolution and their supporters made [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], as well as [[Marquis de Condorcet]]'s ideas of reason, [[progress]], anti-clericalism, and emancipation central themes to their movement. It led to an unavoidable backlash to the Enlightenment as there were people oppose to the revolution. Many counter-revolutionary writers, such as [[Edmund Burke]], [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Augustin Barruel]], asserted an intrinsic link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. They blamed the Enlightenment for undermining traditional beliefs that sustained the [[ancien regime]]. As the Revolution became increasingly bloody, the idea of 'Enlightenment' was  discredited, too. Hence, the French Revolution and its aftermath have attributed to the development of Counter-Enlightenment thought.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}  

[[Edmund Burke]] was among the first of the Revolution's opponents to relate the ''philosophes'' to the instability in France in the 1790s. His ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) refers the Enlightenment as the principle cause of the French revolution. In Burke's opinion, the ''philosophes'' provided the revolutionary leaders with the theories on which their political schemes were based on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

[[Augustin Barruel]]'s Counter-Enlightenment ideas were well developed before the revolution. He worked as an editor for the anti-''philosophes'' literary journal, ''[[:fr:L'Année_littéraire|L'Année Littéraire]]''. Barruel argues in his ''[[Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism]]'' (1797) that the Revolution was the consequence of a conspiracy of ''philosophes'' and freemasons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} 

In ''Considerations on France'' (1797),  [[Joseph de Maistre]] interprets the Revolution as divine punishment for the sins of the Enlightenment. According to him, "the revolutionary storm is an overwhelming force of nature unleashed on Europe by God that mocked human pretensions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;."

==Romanticism==
In the 1770s, the '''[[Sturm und Drang]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' movement started in Germany. It questioned some key assumptions and implications of the ''[[Age of Enlightenment|Auflärung]]'' and the term '[[Romanticism]]' was first coined. Many early Romantic writers such as [[Chateaubriand]], [[Novalis|Federich von Hardenberg]] ([[Novalis|Novalis)]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] inherited the Counter-Revolutionary antipathy towards the philosophes. All three directly blamed the ''philosophes'' in France and the ''Aufklärer'' in Germany for devaluing beauty, spirit and history in favour of a view of man as a soulless machine and a view of the universe as a meaningless, disenchanted void lacking richness and beauty. One particular concern to early Romantic writers was the allegedly anti-religious nature of the Enlightenment since the ''philosophes'' and ''[[Aufklarer]]'' were generally [[deists]], opposed to [[revealed religion]]. Some historians, such as [[Johann Georg Hamann|Hamann]], nevertheless contend that this view of the Enlightenment as an age hostile to religion is common ground between these Romantic writers and many of their conservative Counter-Revolutionary predecessors. However, not many have commented on the Enlightenment, except for Chateaubriand, Novalis, and Coleridge, since the term itself did not exist at the time and most of their contemporaries ignored it&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

[[File:Goya - Caprichos (43) - Sleep of Reason.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'', c. 1797, 21.5 cm × 15 cm. One of the most famous prints of the ''[[Caprichos]]''.]]
The philosopher [[Jacques Barzun]] argues that Romanticism has its roots in the Enlightenment. It was not anti-rational, but rather balanced rationality against the competing claims of intuition and the sense of justice. This view is expressed in Goya's ''Sleep of Reason'', in which the nightmarish owl offers the dozing social critic of ''[[Los Caprichos]],'' a piece of drawing chalk. Even the rational critic is inspired by irrational dream-content under the gaze of the sharp-eyed lynx.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldandi.com/newhome/public/2004/february/bkpub1.asp Linda Simon, ''The Sleep of Reason'']&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall Brown makes much the same argument as Barzun in ''Romanticism and Enlightenment'', questioning the stark opposition between these two periods.

By the middle of the 19th century, the memory of the French Revolution was fading and so was the influence of Romanticism. In this optimistic age of science and industry, there were few critics of the Enlightenment, and few explicit defenders. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is a notable and highly influential exception. After an initial defence of the Enlightenment in his so-called 'middle period' (late-1870s to early 1880s), Nietzsche turned vehemently against it.

==Totalitarianism==
In the intellectual discourse of the mid-20th century, two concepts emerged simultaneously in the West: enlightenment and [[totalitarianism]]. After [[World War II]], the former re-emerged as a key organizing concept in social and political thought and the history of ideas. The Counter-Enlightenment literature blaming the 18th-century trust in reason for 20th-century [[totalitarianism]] also resurged along with it. The ''locus classicus'' of this view is [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), which traces the degeneration of the general concept of enlightenment from ancient Greece (epitomized by the cunning 'bourgeois' hero Odysseus) to 20th-century fascism. They mentioned little about Soviet [[communism]], only referring to it as a regressive totalitarianism that "clung all too desperately to the heritage of bourgeois philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Adorno &amp; Horkeimer, [[Dialectic of Enlightenment]], 1947, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;.

The authors take 'enlightenment' as their target including its 18th-century form – which we now call 'The Enlightenment'. They claim it is epitomized by the [[Marquis de Sade]]. However, there were philosophers rejecting Adorno and Horkheimer’s claim that Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roche, "Much Sense the Starkest Madness: de Sade’s Moral Scepticism." ''Angelaki'' Volume 15, Issue 1 April 2010, pages 45 – 59. Retrieved 12 December 2010. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a925285995~db=all~jumptype=rss].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many postmodern writers and feminists (e.g. Jane Flax) have made similar arguments. They regard ''the'' Enlightenment conception of reason as totalitarian, and as not having been enlightened enough since. For Adorno and Horkheimer, though it banishes myth it falls back into a further myth, that of individualism and formal (or mythic) equality under [[instrumental reason]].

[[Michel Foucault]], for example, argued that attitudes towards the "insane" during the late-18th and early 19th centuries show that supposedly enlightened notions of [[moral treatment|humane treatment]] were not universally adhered to, but instead, the [[Age of Reason]] had to construct an image of "Unreason" against which to take an opposing stand. Berlin himself, although no postmodernist, argues that the Enlightenment's legacy in the 20th century has been [[monism]] (which he claims favours political authoritarianism), whereas the legacy of the Counter-Enlightenment has been pluralism (associates with liberalism). These are two of the 'strange reversals' of modern intellectual history.

==Perversion of reason==
What seems to unite all of the Enlightenment's disparate critics from 18th-century religious opponents, counter-revolutionaries, to Romantics, to 20th-century conservatives, feminists, [[critical theorists]] and environmentalists is a rejection of what they consider to be the Enlightenment's perversion of [[reason]]: the distorted conceptions of reason associate with the Enlightenment in favour of a more restricted view of the nature, scope and limits of human rationality. Debates have occurred over the scope, meaning and application of reason, not over whether it is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, essential or inessential per se. Some charge that the Enlightenment inflated the power and scope of reason, while others claim that it narrowed it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6865">'''Differential adhesion hypothesis''' ('''DAH''') is a [[hypothesis]] that explains cellular movement during [[morphogenesis]] with thermodynamic principles. In DAH [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] are treated as liquids consisting of mobile cells whose varying degrees of surface adhesion cause them to reorganize spontaneously to minimize their interfacial [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]].&lt;ref name=Foty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foty|first=Ramsey A.|author2=Steinberg, Malcolm S.|title=The differential adhesion hypothesis: a direct evaluation|journal=Developmental Biology|date=1 February 2005|volume=278|issue=1|pages=255–263|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604008048|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, according to DAH, cells move to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength in order to maximize the bonding strength between cells and produce a more thermodynamically stable structure.&lt;ref name=Duguay&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duguay|first=Duke|author2=Foty, Ramsey A.|author3=Steinberg, Malcolm S.|title=Cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and tissue segregation: qualitative and quantitative determinants|journal=Developmental Biology|date=15 January 2003|volume=253|issue=2|pages=309–323|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160602000167|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/S0012-1606(02)00016-7|pmid=12645933}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the movement of cells during tissue formation, according to DAH, parodies the behavior of a mixture of liquids.&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Malcolm S.|title=Adhesion in Development: An Historical Overview|journal=Developmental Biology|date=15 December 1996|volume=180|issue=2|pages=377–388|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160696903127|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1006/dbio.1996.0312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally motivated by the problem of understanding cell sorting behavior in vertebrate embryos, DAH has subsequently been applied to explain several other morphogenic phenomena.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Malcolm S.|title=Differential adhesion in morphogenesis: a modern view|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|date=August 2007|volume=17|issue=4|pages=281–286|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X07001062|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2007.05.002|pmid=17624758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The origins of DAH can be traced back to a 1955 study by [[Philip L. Townes]] and [[Johannes Holtfreter]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt; In this study Townes and Holtfreter placed the three [[germ layer]]s of an amphibian into an alkaline solution, allowing them to dissociate into individual cells, and mixed these different types of cells together. Cells of different species were used to be able to visually observe and follow their movements. Cells of similar types migrated to their correct location and reaggregated to form germ layers in their developmentally correct positions. This experiment demonstrated that tissue organization can occur independent of the path taken, implying that it is mediated by forces that are persistently present and doesn't arise solely from the chronological sequence of developmental events preceding it.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

From these results Holtfreter developed his concept of [[selective affinity]], and hypothesized that well-timed changes to selective affinity of cells to one another throughout development guided morphogenesis.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Several hypotheses were introduced to explain these results including the "timing hypothesis" and the "differential surface contraction hypothesis".&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; In 1964 [[Malcolm Steinberg]] introduced the "differential adhesion hypothesis" which uses thermodynamic principles to describe and explain patterns of cell sorting and arrangement observed.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Overview==
According to DAH, cellular movement and [[Cell sorting|assortment]] is governed by the spontaneous rearrangement of cells—in much the same way as a liquid—to a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium. This is achieved by maximizing the amount of energy that is utilized adhering the cells together, which decreases the free energy available in the system. As cells with similar strengths of surface adhesion bond to one another, bonding energy in the overall system increases, and interfacial free energy decreases causing the system to be more thermodynamically stable. Liquids behave in a comparable manner, but with molecules moving around due to [[kinetic energy]] instead of motile cells moving around due to a combination of their kinetics and active movement.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

This allows examples of tissue arrangement to be corresponded to the behavior of liquids, such as one tissue spreading across another being corresponded to oil spreading across water; the oil spreads across the water to minimize weak oil-water interactions and maximize stronger water-water and oil-oil interactions, the cells similarly sort themselves to be near other cells of similar adhesive strength and bond with them.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; Other tissue interactions that DAH offers an explanation for includes tissue hierarchy, where tissues with weaker surface adhesion surround tissues with stronger surface adhesion, the rounding of irregular cell masses to become spherical, and the cell sorting and construction of anatomical structures that occurs independent of the path taken.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

DAH does not rely on qualitative differences in cell adhesion, only on quantitative differences in the strength of their surface adhesion.&lt;ref name=Forgacs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgacs|first=Gabor|author2=Foty, Ramsey A.|author3=Shafrir, Yinon|author4=Steinberg, Malcolm S.|title=Viscoelastic Properties of Living Embryonic Tissues: a Quantitative Study|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=May 1998|volume=74|issue=5|pages=2227–2234|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349598779329|accessdate=25 September 2013|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(98)77932-9|bibcode=1998BpJ....74.2227F}}&lt;/ref&gt; DAH has been supported experimentally and by computational models.&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

==Applications==
Since its original formulation in the context of vertebrate embryogenesis, DAH has been utilized to offer an explanation for several other morphogenic phenomena including [[wound healing]], and [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] in cancer progression and [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg2007/&gt;

[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzō Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]

A '''dress code''' is a set of written and, more often, [[unwritten rule]]s with regard to [[clothing]]. Clothing, like other aspects of human [[physical appearance]], has a social significance, with different rules and expectations applying depending on circumstance and occasion. Within a single day, an individual may need to navigate between two or more dress codes. For example, many navigate between a home dress code and a work dress code; usually this ability is a result of cultural acclimatization.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Different societies and cultures will have different dress norms, although [[Western dress codes]] are widely accepted as valid internationally.

The dress code has built in rules or signals indicating the message being given by a person's clothing and how it is worn. This message may include indications of the person's gender, [[income]], occupation and [[social class]], political, ethnic and religious affiliation, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, fashion, traditions, gender expression, marital status, sexual availability, and sexual orientation, etc. Clothes convey other social messages including the stating or claiming [[Identity (social science)|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], the establishing, maintaining, or defying [[group (sociology)|social group]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and appreciating comfort and functionality.

For example, wearing expensive clothes of high quality can communicate [[wealth]] or the [[image]] of wealth. The observer sees the expensive clothes, but may misinterpret the extent to which these factors apply to the wearer. Clothing can convey a social message, even if none is intended: if the receiver's code of interpretation differs from the sender's code of communication, misinterpretation follows. However clothes may be worn because they are comfortable and practical, not to convey a message.

In every culture, current [[fashion]] governs how clothing is constructed, assembled, and worn to convey a social message. The rate of change of fashion varies, clothes and its accessories within months or days, especially in small social groups or in communications media-influenced modern societies. More extensive changes, requiring more time, money, and effort to effect, may span generations. When fashion changes, the messages communicated by clothing change.

{{See also|Western dress codes|Sumptuary laws}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===The Americas===
The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social structure, including slaves, commoners, and nobles, and dress codes to indicate these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be "considered one of them, and conform to their customs". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.&lt;ref&gt;''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&amp;doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
{{See also|Cross-dressing}}
In most traditions, certain types of clothing are worn exclusively or predominantly by either men or women. For example, long sleeves are common for both genders, and while the wearing of a knee-  
to floor-length [[skirt]] or a knee- to floor-length [[dress]] tends to be associated with female dress, ankle-length [[trousers]] are associated with male dress. [[Hairdressing]] in some societies may also conform to a dress code, such as long hair for women and short hair for men.

===Social status===

[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammed Alim Khan|Emir Alim Khan]]'s bemedalled [[robe]] communicates a social message]]

[[File:Ming Dynasty royal attire.jpg|thumb|160px|Formal attire for the Emperor and Empress of the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China&lt;ref&gt;Note that the golden-colored YiShanGuan (翼善冠, lit. 'Winged Crown of Philanthropy') the male model wears is historically incorrect: according to archaeological findings at the Tomb of [[Wanli Emperor]] (明定陵, ''MingDingLing'', lit. 'The Mausoleum of Tranquility of Ming') - the golden version of YiShanGuan was only worn by deceased emperors as part of the burial ritual; a living emperor on the other hand, always wore the YiShanGuan made of black silk with decorative jewels and dragons, therefore a 'black' version of it instead of gold. A historical fact not widely known in modern day China, thus the misrepresentation of the Ming Royal Attire in the photo above.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In many societies, particular clothing may be a [[status symbol]], reserved or affordable to people of high rank. For example, in [[Ancient Rome]] only senators were permitted to wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]; and, in [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|traditional Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and [[palaoa]] or carved whale teeth. In [[China]] before the establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

In 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.” Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By requiring students to wear a school [[uniform]] they are less likely to have something to make fun of other students for. This would cause the students to get to know one another by their personality and who they really are rather than the clothes they wear.

===Occupation===
Military, police, and firefighters usually wear [[uniform]]s, as do workers in many industries. School children often wear [[school uniform]]s, while college and university students sometimes wear [[academic dress]]. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as [[religious habit|habits]]. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one's occupation or rank within a profession

===Ethnic and political affiliation===
In many regions of the world, [[national costume]]s and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his [[tartan]]. A French peasant woman identified her village with her cap or [[coif]]. A Palestinian woman identifies her village with the pattern of [[Palestinian handicrafts#Embroidery and weaving|embroidery]] on her [[Palestinian costumes|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dispossessed: The Ordeal of the Palestinians |last=Gilmour |first=David |year=1983 |publisher=Sphere Books |location=London |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In 19th-century Europe, artists and writers lived ''[[Bohemianism|la vie de Bohème]]'' and dressed to shock: [[George Sand]] in men's clothing, female emancipationists in [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]], male artists in velvet [[waistcoat]]s and gaudy neckcloths. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]], [[beatnik]]s, [[hippie]]s, [[Goth subculture|Goths]], [[Punk subculture|Punks]], and [[Skinhead]]s have continued the ([[counter-culture|countercultural]]) tradition in the 20th-century [[Western Culture|West]].

===Religious affiliation===
[[File:TiraMarket.jpg|thumb|Mannequins with traditional Muslim [[veil]] at a Saturday market in [[Tira, Israel]].]]
A [[Jewish]] or [[Muslim]] man may display his religious affiliation by wearing a [[cap]] and other traditional clothing. Many Muslim women wear head or body coverings (see [[sartorial hijab]], [[hijab]], [[burqa]] or [[niqab]], [[chador]], and [[abaya]]) that proclaim their status as respectable women and cover the so-called [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate parts]]. A [[Jew]]ish man may indicate his observance of [[Judaism]] by wearing a [[kippah]].

===Marital status===
{{See also|Visual markers of marital status}}

Traditionally, [[Hindu]] women wear ''[[sindoor]]'', a red powder, in the parting of their hair to indicate their married status; if widowed, they abandon ''sindoor'' and jewelry and wear simple white clothing. However, this is not true of all Hindu women; in the modern world this is not a norm and women without sindoor may not necessarily be unmarried.

In many [[Orthodox Jewish]] circles, married women wear head coverings such as a hat, [[snood (headgear)|snood]], or wig. Additionally, after their marriage, Jewish men of [[Ashkenazi]] descent begin to wear a [[talit]] during prayer.

Men and women of the Western world may wear [[wedding ring]]s to indicate their married status, and women may also wear [[engagement ring]]s when they are engaged.

==Laws and social norms==
{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]
In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public - this is uncommon in more developed areas. Women wear [[string skirt]]s. In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. In America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.

In the [[United States]], a few businesses or [[restaurant]]s display dress code signs requiring shoes and shirts, claiming to be there on account of a health code,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} although no such health codes exist.&lt;ref name="barefoot society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefooters.org/health-dept/ |title=Bare Feet and the Health Department |publisher=Barefooters.org |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is a common belief that there are laws against driving barefoot. However, no such laws exist. It is quite uncommon for people to be nude in public in the [[United States]] and in many circumstances, it is illegal. Many states and cities have laws and ordinances for [[indecent exposure]] and sometimes nudity can overlap with [[disorderly conduct]]. However, there are a few private beaches and resorts that cater to people who wish to be naked.

The “Free the Nipple Movement” is a global campaign seeking equality and empowerment for women when it comes to dress code. It emerged as a reaction to the idea that it was socially acceptable for men to appear without a shirt in public, whereas a woman appearing topless in public would be construed as indecent. The states of New York, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas have made it legal for both men and women to appear topless in public. The remainder of states consider the exposure of the female nipple to be an act of indecent exposure, putting them in a position where they can be charged with a criminal offense. This appears to be a gendered law that promotes different expectations on how a person is expected to dress when in public.

The Gender Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. While employers are not able to discriminate in their hiring practices, they do have the ability to create a gendered uniform. Employers cannot force someone to wear a uniform for a gender they do not identify themselves as, but this becomes an issue for non binary gendered people. In society, clothing is marketed by gender and dressing across this established line is often construed as an anomaly. Skirts, dresses, and high heels are clothing marketed almost exclusively for women. If a man wore any of these pieces in public it would be seen as outside of the norm.

==Private dress codes==
{{See also|shoe#etiquette|mourning|Sharia}}

[[File:LondonClubDressCode bordercropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dress code for a private club in [[Soho]], [[London]]]]

Private organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations.

*Religious bodies may insist on their standards of [[modesty]] being followed at their premises and events.
*Employees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) These policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some work places require that [[tattoo]]s be covered.
*Patrons of a [[disco]] or [[nightclub]] are sometimes expected to dress in a particular style, such as [[clubwear]]; and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s of a disco or nightclub at times refuse entrance to those whose clothing they consider not consistent with the atmosphere of the venue.
*Patrons of a [[casino]], shop, or restaurant are usually expected to dress to a minimum standard, such as [[smart casual]].
*The organisers of some parties sometimes specify a costume or theme for the event, such as a [[naked party]] or [[toga party]].
*[[Fetish club]]s often require patrons to dress in [[fetish fashion|fetish clothing]] or else all in black.

Dress codes function on certain social occasions and for certain jobs. A [[military]] institution may require specified [[uniform]]s; if it allows the wearing of plain clothes it may place restrictions on their use.

A "formal" or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tail-coats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. "Semi-formal" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women. "Business casual" typically means not wearing [[necktie]]s or [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s, but wearing instead collared shirts, and more ''country'' trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]). "Casual" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. "Wedding Casual" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. The [[uniform]] may consist of various items that are appropriate length and style depending on what the school suggests: for example, khaki pants or [[shorts]], plaid skirts, a button-up collared shirt, a sweater, a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[necktie|tie]] and even [[socks]]. Some schools have each grade assigned a color type which communicates what grade the student is currently in. That way if a student is lost someone is able to figure out what [[educational stage|grade]] they are in just by looking at the color of their shirt. If the student is younger, older students and faculty are able to look out for them and make sure they are safe.
Organisations which seek to maintain standards of [[modesty]] have difficulties with [[Sheer fabric|sheer]] and [[see-through clothing]].

Dress codes usually set a lower limit on body covering. However, sometimes it can specify the opposite: for example, in UK gay jargon, ''dress code'', means people who dress in a militaristic manner. ''Dress code'' nights in nightclubs, and elsewhere, are deemed to specifically target people who have militaristic fetishes (e.g. leather/[[skinhead]] men).

==Education==

=== History in school ===
Dress codes were first implemented in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to create a safer and more professional environment. Even though dress code was created to positively affect schools, the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District. The case was held because students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In some grade schools, students are prevented from wearing short shorts, leggings, crop tops, saggy pants, and other clothing items that are deemed "too revealing" or "inappropriate".

In colleges, the most common type of dress code is business casual, but most colleges don't have dress code requirements.

===Non-communicative and communicative===
Non-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000"&gt;Herbon, Beth, and Jane E. Workman. "Dress and Appearance Codes in Public Secondary School Handbooks." Journal of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences 92.5 (2000): 68-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000" /&gt;

===Dress code violations and the courts===
In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by noncommunicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on [[gender]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"&gt;Smith, Natalie. "Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Public School Dress Codes: The Necessity of Respecting Personal Preference." ''Journal of Law &amp; Education''; 41.1 (2012): 251-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the [[transgender]] populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet [[Passing (gender)|pass]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"/&gt;

White collar work place clothing has changed significantly through the years. In a corporate office, appropriate clothes are clean, business casual clothes such as (for men) a [[dress shirt]], [[polo shirt]], and [[trousers]], or other similar outfits. [[Suit (clothing)|Suit]]s, [[neckties]], and other formal wear are usually only required in law offices and financial sector offices. Previous business dress code eras (the 1950s in the U.S.) featured standardized business clothes that strongly differentiated what was acceptable and unacceptable for men and women to wear while working. Today, the two styles have merged; women's work clothes expanded to include the suit (and its variants) in addition to the usual dresses, skirts, and blouses; men's clothes have expanded to include garments and bright colours. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Casual wear entered business culture with the advent of the Silicon Valley, California, technology company featuring casual work clothes on the job. Additionally, some companies set aside days — generally Fridays ("dress-down Friday", "[[casual Friday]]") — when workers may wear casual clothes. The clothing a company requires its worker to wear on the job varies with the occupation and profession.

Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination law restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in fact, most businesses have much authority in determining and establishing what work place clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm |title = Dress Code Legal Issues|website =  Personnel Policy Services Inc|last = Thomas|first = Robin|dead-url = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064207/http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm|archivedate = 14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Obama 013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Barack Obama]] in what can be considered as men's Business Casual, 2010]]

''Business casual'' dress, also "smart casual", is a popular work place dress code that emerged in [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.

The [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition: ''In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together''. A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Examples of clothing combinations considered appropriate for work by businesses that consider themselves as using the business-casual dress code are:

*for men: a shirt with a collar ([[polo shirt]]) and [[cotton]] [[trousers]] (or "khakis" in [[American English]]).
*for women: a tennis shirt and trousers.

Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.

==Inverse dress codes==
Inverse dress codes, sometimes referred to as "[[undress code]]", set forth an upper bound, rather than a lower bound, on body covering. An example of an undress code is the one commonly enforced in modern communal bathing facilities. For example, in the public bath [[SchwabenQuellen]], no clothing of any kind is allowed in the sauna part of the resort. Other, less strict undress codes are common in public pools, especially indoor pools, in which shoes and shirts are disallowed.

Places where [[social nudity]] is practiced may be "clothing optional," or nudity may be compulsory, with exceptions. See [[issues in social nudity]].

==Violation of clothing taboos==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2017}}
Some clothing ''faux pas'' may occur intentionally for reasons of [[fashion]] or personal [[preference]]. People have the right to express themselves in freedom of speech and expression under the first amendment; however, some styles of clothing that people may chose to wear can be seen as taboos or violations. Dress codes are a way that public schools try to limit violence and danger in the classroom and at the school, as stated by Sue M. Stanley, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, in the journal of Education and Urban Society. She says how clothing styles, such as gang clothing, are linked with violence in schools. She believes that dress codes and uniforms will reduce the focus on fashion contests and violence and instead promote ideas and achievements. Violations of clothing taboos, such as students wearing gang clothing or intentionally baggy clothing, can be viewed as unsafe by administrators. However, these students are just expressing themselves in their style and fashion. For instance, the [[adolescence|teenage]] boys of [[hip hop#Culture|rap]] duo [[Kris Kross]] of the early 1990s wore all of their clothes backwards and extremely baggy. Just because the boys of the rap duo Kris Kross wore their clothing like this it did not make them dangerous. Rather, they were just trying to be different and break common fashion “rules” to express themselves. Limiting students to only wear certain things or uniforms because of fashion taboos is a violation against their freedom of expression. As stated by Paul M. Murphy, a lawyer and writer for the Southern California Law Review, in the article “Restricting Gang Clothing in Public Schools: Does a Dress Code Violate a Student's Right of Free Expression” in the Southern California Law Review, as an attempt to keep schools safe, administrators are prohibiting students from wearing gang related clothing. However this is a violation of the first amendment which is the freedom of speech and expression, says Paul M. Murphy.
There can be different clothing styles that can be viewed as taboo for different age groups and genders to wear as well. For example, for older women to wear brighter colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing is seen as a clothing taboo for this era of women. This information was taken from a survey done by the journal of Ageing and Society, where they had 36 women from the ages 71 to 93 say what clothes they usually don't wear, to see what their perspective on clothing and different styles are for their age group. The majority of women said that they refrain from wearing styles such as bright colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing. The women view these styles as taboo for their age, however that does not mean that one can not wear these clothing styles if they are in this age group.
There are different clothing brands and stores that can be seen as taboo as well. In a study done in the journal of Middle East Technical University Studies in Development, researchers took 300 participants in an emerging market context to see the effects of different styles and brands on the participants. The results were that customers were becoming less predictable and more diverse in their brands and clothing stores than before. This shows how people have lots of different styles of clothing and fashion, and how that is making clothing taboos become less common and not seen as a restriction.

==Rebellion against dress codes==
{{Example farm|section|date=December 2017}}
Social attitudes to clothing have brought about various rules and social conventions, such as keeping the body covered, and not showing underwear in public. The backlash against these social norms has become a traditional form of rebellion. An example of rebellion of general, universal dress codes is cross dressing. Cross dressing is defined as wearing clothing typical of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cloud|first1=Duane|title=What is Cross Dressing?|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cross-dressing-definition-psychology.html|website=Study.com|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rebellion to dress codes, because it goes against most social norms of a general dress code for men and women. Also over time, western societies have gradually adopted more casual dress codes in the workplace, school, and leisure. This has especially been the case since the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On Monday, September 22, 2014, "about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah."&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Students protest 'slut shaming' high school dress codes with mass walkouts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/24/us-high-schools-dress-codes-protest-sexism-hemline|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen girls were turned away from a [[homecoming dance]] for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; "School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules." It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, since they concentrate specifically on females and what they are and are not allowed to wear. There is also an emphasis placed on the effects that girls’ wardrobe choices have on their male classmates, which is seen by some as inappropriate. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school's dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was “too distracting for boys.” Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that “not being able to wear leggings because it’s ‘too distracting for boys’ is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.” In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are “walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Enforcing School Dress Codes Turns Into Slut Shaming|url=http://time.com/36997/when-enforcing-school-dress-codes-turns-into-slut-shaming/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a similar incident occurred at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York. Within the first few days of the semester, two hundred detention slips were handed out to students who violated the school's dress code. Approximately ninety percent of the slips distributed were given to girls as their clothing was deemed “disruptive to teaching and learning.” Many claim that making girls feel guilty for the actions of boys is similar to telling victims of sexual assault that they were “asking for it” by dressing in a particular manner and has thus been linked to the practice of victim-blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools Are Still Slut-Shaming Girls While Enforcing Dress Code|url=http://time.com/3394549/dress-code-long-island-new-york/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy "will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control." She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/lauren-wiggins-haltar-top_n_7284528.html|title=High Schooler Lauren Wiggins' Letter Nails Exactly What's Wrong With School Dress Codes|date=14 May 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eight Consciousnesses''' (Skt. ''aṣṭa vijñānakāyāḥ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/hvsatssu.htm|title=Sātyasiddhiśāstra|last=Harivarman|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|postscript=At vargaḥ 62 (nācaitasikavargaḥ): "ya ādhyātmiko 'sti vijñānakāyāḥ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a classification developed in the tradition of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. They enumerate the five sense consciousnesses, supplemented by the mental consciousness (''manovijñāna''), the '''defiled mental consciousness''' (''kliṣṭamanovijñāna''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;), and finally the fundamental '''store-house consciousness''' (''ālāyavijñāna''),  which is the basis of the other seven.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 97&lt;/ref&gt; This eighth consciousness is said to store the impressions (''[[vasanas|vāsanāḥ]]'') of previous experiences, which form the seeds (''[[bīja]]'') of future [[karma]] in this life and in the next after [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].

==The eightfold network of primary consciousnesses==
All surviving schools of Buddhist thought accept&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;"in common"&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;the existence of the first six primary consciousnesses (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|[[vijñāna]]}}'', {{bo|t=རྣམ་ཤེས་|w=rnam-shes}}).&lt;ref name="Berzin MMF Quote"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=Mind and Mental Factors: the Fifty-one Types of Subsidiary Awareness|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/science-of-mind/mind-mental-factors/primary-minds-and-the-51-mental-factors|publisher=Study Buddhism|accessdate=4 June 2016|location=Berlin, Germany; June 2002; revised July, 2006|quote=Unlike the Western view of consciousness as a general faculty that can be aware of all sensory and mental objects, Buddhism differentiates six types of consciousness, each of which is specific to one sensory field or to the mental field.  A primary consciousness cognizes merely the essential nature (''ngo-bo'') of an object, which means the category of phenomenon to which something belongs.  For example, eye consciousness cognizes a sight as merely a sight.  The Chittamatra schools add two more types of primary consciousness to make their list of an eightfold network of primary consciousnesses (''rnam-shes tshogs-brgyad''): deluded awareness (''nyon-yid''), ''alayavijnana'' (''kun-gzhi rnam-shes'', all-encompassing foundation consciousness, storehouse consciousness).  ''Alayavijnana'' is an individual consciousness, not a universal one, underlying all moments of cognition.  It cognizes the same objects as the cognitions it underlies, but is a nondetermining cognition of what appears to it (''snang-la ma-nges-pa'', inattentive cognition) and lacks clarity of its objects.  It carries karmic legacies (''sa-bon'') and the mental impressions of memories, in the sense that both are nonstatic abstractions imputed on the ''alayavijnana''.  The continuity of an individual ''alayavijnana'' ceases with the attainment of enlightenment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The internally coherent {{IAST|Yogācāra}} school associated with [[Maitreya]], [[Asaṅga]], and [[Vasubandhu]], however, uniquely&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;or "uncommonly"&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;also posits the existence of two additional primary consciousnesses, ''kliṣṭamanovijñāna'' and ''{{IAST|ālayavijñāna}}'', in order to explain the workings of ''[[karma]]''.&lt;ref name="Sparham" /&gt;  The first six of these primary consciousnesses comprise the five sensory faculties together with mental consciousness, which is counted as the sixth.&lt;ref name="Berzin Primary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=English Glossary of Buddhist Terms|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xprimary_20consciousness|work=Primary Consciousness|publisher=The Berzin Archives|accessdate=14 February 2013|location=Berlin, Germany|quote=Within a cognition of an object, the awareness of merely the essential nature of the object that the cognition focuses on.  Primary consciousness has the identity-nature of being an individualizing awareness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gareth Sparham, &lt;blockquote&gt;The ''{{IAST|ālaya-vijñāna}}'' doctrine arose on the Indian subcontinent about one thousand years before Tsong kha pa.  It gained its place in a distinctly {{IAST|Yogācāra}} system over a period of some three hundred years stretching from 100 to 400 {{smallcaps|C.E.}}, culminating in the ''{{IAST|[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]}}'', a short text by Asaṅga (circa 350), setting out a systematic presentation of the ''{{IAST|ālaya-vijñāna}}'' doctrine developed over the previous centuries.  It is the doctrine found in this text in particular that Tsong kha pa, in his ''Ocean of Eloquence'', treats as having been revealed in toto by the Buddha and transmitted to suffering humanity through the {{IAST|Yogācāra}} founding saints (Tib. ''shing rta srol byed''): Maitreya&lt;nowiki&gt;[-nātha]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Asaṅga, and Vasubandhu.&lt;ref name="Sparham" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;While some noteworthy modern scholars of the [[Gelug]] tradition (which was founded by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]]'s reforms to [[Atisha]]'s [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] school) assert that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is posited only in the Yogācāra philosophical tenet system, all non-Gelug schools of Tibetan buddhism maintain that the ''{{IAST|ālāyavijñāna}}'' is accepted by the various [[Madhyamaka]] schools, as well.&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC"&gt;{{cite web|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|title=English Glossart of Buddhist Terms: 'All-encompassing Foundation Consciousness'|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/about/glossary/glossary.html#xall-encompassing_20foundation_20consciousness|publisher=The Berzin Archives|accessdate=6 February 2013|location=Berlin, Germany|quote=An unspecified, nonobstructive, individual consciousness that underlies all cognition, cognizes the same objects as the cognitions it underlies, but is a nondetermining cognition of what appears to it and lacks clarity of its objects.

It is also translated as 'foundation consciousness' and, by some translators, as 'storehouse consciousness.'

This was the first time Buddha’s teachings were put into written form and, in this case, they were rendered into the Pali language. This version of The Three Basket-like Collections, The Tipitaka, is commonly known as The Pali Canon. The other Hinayana Schools, however, continued to transmit the teachings in oral form.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and development==

===Early Buddhist Texts ("EBTs")===
The first five sense-consciousnesses along with the sixth consciousness are identified in the Suttapiṭaka, especially the Salayatanavagga subsection of the [[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyuttanikāya]]:
{{quote|"Monks, I will teach you the All. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."&lt;br /&gt;
"As you say, lord," the monks responded.&lt;br /&gt;
The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html|title=Sabba Sutta: The All|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, the early Buddhist texts speak of [[anusaya|anusayā]] (Sanskrit: anuśayāḥ), the “underlying tendencies” or “latent dispositions” which keep beings caught in the circle of samsara. These potential tendencies are generally seen as unconscious processes which "lie beneath" our everyday consciousness, and according to Waldron "they represent the potential, the tendency, for cognitive and emotional afflictions (Pali: ''kilesā'', Sanskrit: ''kleśāḥ'') to arise".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sautrāntika and Theravāda theories====
The Sautrāntika school of Buddhism, which relied closely on the sutras, developed a theory of seeds (''bīja'', 種子) in the mindstream (''cittasaṃtāna'', 心相續,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?q=%E5%BF%83%E7%9B%B8%E7%BA%8C|title=Digital Dictionary of Buddhism - 心相續|last=Charles|first=Muller|date=2004-09-11|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lit. "mind-character-continuity") to explain how karma and the latent dispositions continued throughout life and rebirth. This theory later developed into the alayavijñana view.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Theravāda theory of the [[Bhavanga|bhavaṅga]] may also be a forerunner of the ālāyavijñana theory. [[Vasubandhu]] cites the bhavaṅgavijñāna of the [[Sinhala Kingdom|Sinhalese]] school (''Tāmraparṇīyanikāya'') as a forerunner of the ālāyavijñāna. The Theravadin theory is also mentioned by Xuánzàng.&lt;ref&gt;L. Schmithausen. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, Tokyo, 1987, I, 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yogācāra===
{{Main|Yogācāra}}
The texts of the Yogācāra school gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. It is "meant to be an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} The theory of the ālāyavijñana and the other consciousnesses developed out of a need to work out various issues in Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] thought. According to [[Lambert Schmithausen]], the first mention of the concept occurs in the [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhumiśāstra]], which posits a basal consciousness that contains seeds for future cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Schmithausen, Lambert. Ālayavijñāna: On the Origin and the Early Development of a Central Concept of Yogācāra Philosophy, International Institute for Buddhist Studies (1987), pp 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; It is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] and in the [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]] of [[Asanga|Asaṅga]].

[[Vasubandhu]] is considered to be the systematizer of Yogācāra thought.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=126}} Vasubandhu used the concept of the [[Vijñāna#Six vijñānas|six consciousnesses]], on which he elaborated in the ''Triṃśikaikākārikā'' (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=135-143}}

==Vijñānāni==
According to the traditional interpretation, Vasubandhu states that there are eight consciousnesses (''vijñānāni'', singular: ''vijñāna''):
* Five sense-consciousnesses,
* Mind (perception),
* Manas (self-consciousness),{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138-140}}
* Storehouse-consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137-139}}
According to Kalupahana, this classification of eight consciousnesses is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu's Triṃśikaikākārikā by later adherents.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}{{refn|group=note|Kalupahana: "The above explanation of ''alaya-vijnana'' makes it very different from that found in the ''Lankavatara''. The latter assumes ''alaya'' to be the eight consciousness, giving the impression that it represents a totally distinct category. Vasubandhu does not refer to it as the eight, even though his later disciples like Sthiramati and Hsuan Tsang constantly refer to it as such".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

===Ālayavijñāna===
The ālayavijñāna (Japanese: 阿頼耶識 arayashiki), or the "All-encompassing foundation consciousness",&lt;ref name="Berzin AEFC" /&gt; forms the "base-consciousness" (''mūlavijñāna'') or "causal consciousness". According to the traditional interpretation, the other seven consciousnesses are "evolving" or "transforming" consciousnesses originating in this base-consciousness. 
The store-house consciousness accumulates all potential energy as seeds (''bīja'') for the mental (''nāma'') and physical (''rūpa'') manifestation of one's existence ([[namarupa|nāmarūpa]]). It is the storehouse-consciousness which induces [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], causing the origination of a new existence.

====Role====
The ālayavijñāna is also described in the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra|Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra]] as the "mind which has all the seeds" (''sarvabījakam cittam'') which enters the womb and develops based on two forms of appropriation or attachment (''[[upādāna]]''); to the material sense faculties, and to predispositions (''[[vāsanā]]ḥ'') towards conceptual proliferations (''[[papañca|prapañca]]'').&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Waldron, William S. How Innovative is ALAYAVIJÑANA&lt;/ref&gt; The Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra also defines it in varying ways:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This consciousness is also called the appropriating consciousness ("adana-vijñana") because the body is grasped and appropriated by it.''

''It is also called the "alaya-vijñana" because it dwells in and attaches to this body in a common destiny ("ekayogakṣema-arthena").''

''It is also called mind ("citta") because it is heaped up and accumulated by [the six cognitive objects, i.e.:] visual forms, sounds, smells, flavors, tangibles and dharmas.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a seemingly innovative move, the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra states that the alayavijñana is always active subliminally and occurs simultaneously with, "supported by and depending upon" the six sense consciousnesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to [[Asanga]]'s [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]], the alayavijñana is taught by other Buddhist schools by different names. He states that the alaya is what the [[Mahasamghikas]] call the “root-consciousness” (''mulavijñana''), what the Mahīśāsakas call “the aggregate which lasts as long as samsara” (''asaṃsārikaskandha'') and what the [[Sthaviras]] call the [[bhavanga|bhavaṅga]].&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rebirth and purification====
The store-house consciousness receives impressions from all functions of the other consciousnesses, and retains them as potential energy, ''[[bīja]]'' or "seeds", for their further manifestations and activities. Since it serves as the container for all experiential impressions it is also called the "seed consciousness" (種子識) or '''container consciousness'''.

According to Yogācāra teachings, the seeds stored in the store consciousness of sentient beings are not pure.{{refn|group=note|name="individual"|Each being has his own one and only, formless and no-place-to-abide store-house consciousness. Our "being" is created by our own store-consciousness, according to the karma seeds stored in it. In "coming and going" we definitely do not own the "no-coming and no-going" store-house consciousness, rather we are owned by it. Just as a human image shown in a monitor can never be described as lasting for any instant, since "he" is just the production of electron currents of data stored and flow from the hard disk of the computer, so do seed-currents drain from the store-consciousness, never last from one moment to the next.}}

The store consciousness, while being originally immaculate in itself, contains a "mysterious mixture of purity and defilement, good and evil". Because of this mixture the transformation of consciousness from defilement to purity can take place and [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]] is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lankavatara Sutra, A Mahayana Text,'' Suzuki's introduction at p. xxvi, available online: [http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_eng/lanka-nondiacritical.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the process of purification the dharma practitioner can become an [[Arhat]], when the four defilements of the mental functions {{refn|group=note|心所法), self-delusion (我癡), self-view (我見), egotism (我慢), and self-love (我愛)}} of the manas-consciousness are purified.{{refn|group=note|By then the polluted mental functions of the first six consciousnesses would have been cleansed. The seventh or the manas-consciousness determines whether or not the seeds and the contentdrain from the alaya-vijnana breaks through, becoming a "function" to be perceived by us in the mental or physical world.}} {{refn|group=note|In contrast to an Arhat, a Buddha is one with all his seeds stored in the eighth Seed consciousness. Cleansed and substituted, bad for good, one for one, his polluted-seeds-containing eighth consciousness (Alaya Consciousness) becomes an all-seeds-purified eighth consciousness (Pure consciousness 無垢識 ), and he becomes a Buddha.}}

====Tathagata-garbha thought====
According to the [[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatārasūtra]] and the schools of Chan and Zen Buddhism, the ālāyavijñāna is identical with the ''[[tathagata-garbha|tathāgatagarbha]]''{{refn|group=note|The womb or matrix of the Thus-come-one, the Buddha}}, and is fundamentally pure.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=January 2016}}

The equation of ālāyavijñāna and tathāgatagarbha was contested. It was seen as "something akin to the Hindu notions of ''ātman'' (permanent, invariant self) and ''{{IAST|prakṛti}}'' (primordial substrative nature from which all mental, emotional and physical things evolve)." According to Lusthaus, the critique led by the end of the eighth century to the rise of the logico-epistemic tradition of Yogācāra and a hybrid school combining ''Tathāgatagarbha'' thought with basic Yogācāra doctrines:&lt;ref name=Lusthaus /&gt;

{{quote|The logico-epistemological wing in part sidestepped the critique by using the term ''citta-santāna'', "mind-stream", instead of ''ālaya-vijñāna'', for what amounted to roughly the same idea. It was easier to deny that a "stream" represented a reified self. On the other hand, the Tathāgatagarbha hybrid school was no stranger to the charge of smuggling notions of selfhood into its doctrines, since, for example, it explicitly defined the ''tathāgatagarbha'' as "permanent, pleasurable, ''self'', and pure (''nitya'', ''sukha'', ''ātman'', ''śuddha'')". Many Tathāgatagarbha texts, in fact, argue for the acceptance of selfhood (''ātman'') as a sign of higher accomplishment.

===Transformations of consciousness===
The traditional interpretation of the eight consciousnesses may be discarded on the ground of a reinterpretation of Vasubandhu's works. According to Kalupahana, instead of positing such an consciousnesses, the Triṃśikaikākārikā describes the ''transformations'' of this consciousness:
{{quote|Taking ''vipaka'', ''manana'' and ''vijnapti'' as three different kinds of functions, rather than characteristics, and understanding ''vijnana'' itself as a function (''vijnanatiti vijnanam''), Vasubandhu seems to be avoiding any form of substantialist thinking in relation to consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}}}

These transformations are threefold:{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=137}}
{{quote|Whatever, indeed, is the variety of ideas of self and elements that prevails, it occurs in the transformation of consciousness. Such transformation is threefold, [namely,]{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=192, Trimsika verse 1}}}}

The first transformation results in the ''ālāya'':
{{quote|the resultant, what is called mentation, as well as the concept of the object. Herein, the consciousness called ''alaya'', with all its seeds, is the resultant.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=194, Trimsika verse 2}}}}

The ālāyavijñāna therefore is not an eighth consciousness, but the resultant of the transformation of consciousness:
{{quote|Instead of being a completely distinct category, ''alaya-vijnana'' merely represents the normal flow of the stream of consciousness uninterrupted by the appearance of reflective self-awareness. It is no more than the unbroken stream of consciousness called the life-process by the Buddha. It is the cognitive process, containing both emotive and co-native aspects of human experience, but without the enlarged egoistic emotions and dogmatic graspings characteristic of the next two transformations.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=139}}}}

The second transformation is ''manana'', self-consciousness or "Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}} According to the Lankavatara and later interpreters it is the seventh consciousness.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} It is "thinking" about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=140}} The alaya is defiled by this self-interest;
{{quote|[I]t can be purified by adopting a non-substantialist (''anatman'') perspective and thereby allowing the ''alaya''-part (i.e. attachment) to dissipate, leaving consciousness or the function of being intact.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=138}}}}

The third transformation is ''viṣayavijñapti'', the "''concept'' of the object".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}} In this transformation the ''concept'' of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become "susceptible to grasping after the object":{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141}}
{{quote|Vasubandhu is critical of the third transformation, not because it relates to the conception of an object, but because it generates grasping after a "real object" (''sad artha''), even when it is no more than a conception (''vijnapti'') that combines experience and reflection.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=141-142}}}}

A similar perspective is give by [[Walpola Rahula]]. According to Walpola Rahula, all the elements of the Yogācāra storehouse-consciousness are already found in the Pāli Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', ''manas'', and ''vijñāna'') as presented by Asaṅga are also mentioned in the Pāli Canon:
{{quote|Thus we can see that 'Vijñāna' represents the simple reaction or response of the sense organs when they come in contact with external objects. This is the uppermost or superficial aspect or layer of the 'Vijñāna-skandha'. 'Manas' represents the aspect of its mental functioning, thinking, reasoning, conceiving ideas, etc. 'Citta' which is here called 'Ālayavijñāna', represents the deepest, finest and subtlest aspect or layer of the Aggregate of consciousness. It contains all the traces or impressions of the past actions and all good and bad future possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Understanding in Buddhist Tradition==

===China===

==== Fǎzàng and Huayan ====
According to Thomas McEvilley, although Vasubandhu had postulated numerous ālāya-vijñāna-s, a separate one for each individual person in the parakalpita,{{refn|group=note|name="individual"}} this multiplicity was later eliminated in the [[Dharma character school|Fa Hsiang]] and [[Huayan school|Huayan]] metaphysics.{{refn|group=note|See also [[Buddha-nature#Popularisation in Chinese Buddhism]]}} These schools inculcated instead the doctrine of a single universal and eternal ālaya-vijñāna. This exalted enstatement of the ālāyavijñāna is described in the Fa Hsiang as "primordial unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq=Fa-hsiang+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQErVo&amp;sig=_ueayedFHrmyNbKIjqjxOhJ8Ojw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas McEvilley further argues that the presentation of the three natures by Vasubandhu is consistent with the Neo-platonist views of [[Plotinus]] and his universal 'One', 'Mind', and 'Soul'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vTfm8KHn900C&amp;pg=PA572&amp;lpg=PA572&amp;dq=Plotinian+Neoplatonism+Consciousness-Only+Storehouse+McEvilley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=I92PoQysSt&amp;sig=37KFY-9Sv6RKj-EmdXMpNxniNpc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies|first=Thomas|last=McEvilley|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Allworth Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chán====
A core teaching of Chan/Zen Buddhism describes the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Wisdoms]].{{refn|group=note|It is found in Chapter 7 of the [[Platform Sutra]] of the Sixth Ancestor Zen Master [[Huineng]] and other Zen masters, such as [[Hakuin Ekaku]], in his work titled ''Keiso Dokuqui'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/hakuin1.html#1|title=Hakuin Ekaku (1685-1768). Selected  Writings|website=terebess.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hsu Yun|Xuyun]], in his work titled ''Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks'', Week 1, Fourth Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsuyun.budismo.net/en/dharma/chan_sessions3.html|title=Master Hsu Yun (Xu Yun) - Daily Lectures at Two Ch'an Weeks|website=hsuyun.budismo.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In this teaching, Buddhist practice is to turn the light of awareness around, from misconceptions regarding the nature of reality as being external, to kenshō, "directly see one's own nature".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. Thus the Eighth Consciousness is transformed into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, the Seventh Consciousness into the Equality (Universal Nature) Wisdom, the Sixth Consciousness into the Profound Observing Wisdom, and First to Fifth Consciousnesses into the All Performing (Perfection of Action) Wisdom.

===Korea===
The [[Huayan#Interpenetration|Interpenetration]] (通達) and [[Essence-Function (體用)]] of [[Wonhyo]] (元曉) is described in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Treatise on Awakening Mahāyāna Faith]] (大乘起信論, ''Mahāyānaśraddhotpādaśāstra,'' AMF in the excerpt below):
{{quote|The author of the ''AMF'' was deeply concerned with the question of the respective origins of ignorance and enlightenment. If enlightenment is originally existent, how do we become submerged in ignorance? If ignorance is originally existent, how is it possible to overcome it? And finally, at the most basic level of mind, the ''alaya'' consciousness (藏識), is there originally purity or taint? The ''AMF'' dealt with these questions in a systematic and thorough fashion, working through the Yogacāra concept of the ''alaya'' consciousness. The technical term used in the ''AMF'' which functions as a metaphorical synonym for interpenetration is "permeation" or "perfumation (薫)," referring to the fact that defilement (煩惱) "perfumates" suchness (眞如), and suchness perfumates defilement, depending on the current condition of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller |first=Charles A. |title=The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (通達) and Essence-Function (體用) in Wŏnhyo, Chinul and Kihwa |work=Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University |number=3 |date=March 1995 |pages=33–48 |url=http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |accessdate=18 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828072632/http://www.acmuller.net/budkor/wonhyo-chinul-kihwa.htm |archivedate=28 August 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[particle physics]], an '''elementary particle''' or '''fundamental particle''' is a [[&lt;!-- wiktionary:particle| --&gt;subatomic particle]] with no  substructure, thus not composed of other particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particles currently thought to be elementary include the fundamental [[fermion]]s ([[quark]]s, [[lepton]]s, [[antiquark]]s, and [[antilepton]]s), which generally are "matter particles" and "[[antimatter]] particles", as well as the fundamental [[boson]]s ([[gauge boson]]s and the [[Higgs boson]]), which generally are "force particles" that mediate [[fundamental interaction|interactions]] among fermions.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; A particle containing two or more elementary particles is a ''[[list of particles|composite particle]]''.

[[Matter|Everyday matter]] is composed of [[atom]]s, once presumed to be matter's elementary particles—''atom'' meaning "unable to cut" in Greek—although the atom's existence remained controversial until about 1910, as some leading physicists regarded molecules as mathematical illusions, and matter as ultimately composed of energy.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Common elementary particles ==
{{main | Cosmic abundance of elements }}

According to the current models of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|big bang nucleosynthesis]], the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all [[baryon]]s, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.

Some estimates imply that there are roughly {{10^|80}} baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="heile"&gt;

== Standard Model ==
{{main|Standard Model}}
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary [[fermion]]s, plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the [[Higgs boson]], which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]). However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is not known if it is compatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]], and [[superpartner|sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.

=== Fundamental fermions ===
{{main|Fermion}}

The 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermions are divided into 3&amp;nbsp;[[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 4&amp;nbsp;particles each. Half of the fermions are [[lepton]]s, three of which have an electric charge of &amp;minus;1, called the electron ({{Subatomic particle|electron-}}), the [[muon]] ({{Subatomic particle|muon-}}), and the [[tau (particle)|tau]] ({{Subatomic particle|tau-}}), the other three leptons are [[neutrino]]s ({{Subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|muon neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|tau neutrino}}), which are the only elementary fermions with no electric or color charge. The remaining six particles are [[quark]]s (discussed below).

====Mass====
The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: [[Electronvolt|millions of electron-volts (MeV)]]. For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark ({{Subatomic particle|top quark}}) at 172.7&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/c² or 172&amp;nbsp;700&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]/c², estimated using the [[On-shell scheme]].

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of [[quantum chromodynamics]] used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of [[gluons]] which confer vastly greater mass to the [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.

==== Antiparticles ====
{{main|Antimatter}}

There are also 12&amp;nbsp;fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12&amp;nbsp;particles.  For example, the [[antielectron]] (positron) ''{{Subatomic particle|antielectron}}'' is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.

==== Quarks ====
{{main|Quark}}

Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by [[Colour confinement|confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.

However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another "green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral [[baryon]]. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and "antigreen" can form a color-neutral [[antibaryon]].

Quarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +{{2/3}} or −{{1/3}}, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −{{2/3}} or +{{1/3}}.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
{{main|Boson}}

In the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, whereas the [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic [[mass]] of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state ([[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like [[meson]]s. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.

==== Gluons ====
{{main|Gluon}}

Gluons mediate the [[strong interaction]], which join quarks and thereby form [[hadron]]s, which are either [[baryon]]s (three quarks) or [[meson]]s (one quark and one antiquark).  Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the [[atomic nucleus]].  Like quarks, gluons exhibit [[color charge|color]] and anticolor—unrelated to the concept of visual color—sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
{{main|W and Z bosons|Photon}}

There are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: ''W&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;''; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The W bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay. The ''W&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;'' converts a neutron into a proton then decay into an electron and electron antineutrino pair. The ''Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' does not convert charge but rather changes momentum and is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.

==== Higgs boson ====
{{main|Higgs boson}}

Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]] collider at [[DESY]].  The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the ''W'' and ''Z'' bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain massless (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the [[Higgs boson]] was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. [[Peter Higgs]] who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[statistical significance]] of this discovery was reported as 5-sigma, which implies a certainty of roughly 99.99994%. In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.

==== Graviton ====

{{main|Graviton}}

The [[graviton]] is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to [[Graviton#Experimental observation|the difficulty inherent in its detection]], it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.&lt;ref name="PFIp1-3"/&gt; The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein]] gravitons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 0910.1535|bibcode = 2010PhLB..682..446C|title = Massless versus Kaluza-Klein gravitons at the LHC|journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 682|issue = 4–5|pages = 446–449|last1 = Calmet|first1 = Xavier|last2 = De Aquino|first2 = Priscila|last3 = Rizzo|first3 = Thomas G.|year = 2010|doi = 10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.045|hdl = 2078/31706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond the Standard Model ==

Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the [[Standard Model]], some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysteries, for instance the [[hierarchy problem]]. Theories [[beyond the Standard Model]] attempt to resolve these shortcomings.

=== Grand unification ===
{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}

One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of [[X and Y bosons]], which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of [[supersymmetric particle]]s, abbreviated as ''[[sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s, and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by {{1/2}} from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

=== String theory ===
{{main|String theory}}

String theory is a model of physics where all "particles" that make up [[matter]] are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to [[M-theory]], the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to [[F-theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Cumrun Vafa. "Evidence for F-theory." ''Nucl.Phys.'' '''B'''469: 403-418,1996
[[DOI:10.1016/0550-3213(96)00172-1]]. [[arXiv]]: [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602022 hep-th/9602022]&lt;/ref&gt;) universe.  These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin.  A string can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like a circle).  As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a ''[[world line#World lines as a tool to describe events|world sheet]]''.  String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-[[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the "fabric" of space using the [[uncertainty principle]] (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).

String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the 3 space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe.  The remaining 7 theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the "[[multiverse]]" outside our known universe).

Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]].

=== Technicolor ===
{{main|Technicolor (physics)}}

Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.

=== Preon theory ===
{{main|Preon}}

According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from "pre-quarks". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the [[particle zoo]] that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.

=== Acceleron theory ===
Accelerons are the hypothetical [[subatomic particle]]s that integrally link the newfound mass of the [[neutrino]] to the [[dark energy]] conjectured to be accelerating the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name=acceleron/&gt;

In theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart.&lt;ref name=acceleron&gt;

The '''Equal Protection Clause''' is part of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides "nor shall any State [...] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which guaranteed that all citizens would have the guaranteed right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

The meaning of the Equal Protection Clause has been the subject of much debate, and inspired the well-known phrase "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]". This clause was the basis for ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that helped to dismantle [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and also the basis for many other decisions rejecting discrimination against, and bigotry towards, people belonging to various groups.

While the Equal Protection Clause itself applies only to state and local governments, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954) that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] nonetheless imposes various equal protection requirements on the federal government.

==Text==
The Equal Protection Clause is located at the end of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; ''nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws''. [emphasis added]}}

==Background==
[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|right|thumb|Congressman [[John Bingham]] of [[Ohio]] was the principal framer of the Equal Protection Clause.]]
Equality as a concept has been enshrined in America since the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antieau|first=Chester James|date=1952|title=Equal Protection outside the Clause|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3477928|journal=California Law Review|volume=40|issue=3|pages=362–377|doi=10.2307/3477928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that it was a part of daily life or legal practices. Before the passing of the reconstruction amendments, which included the Equal Protection Clause, there were various legal challenges for the rights of Black people in America.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281|title=Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blacks were considered inferior, and up until the Thirteenth Amendment, it was legal to own them as slaves. Even freed Blacks had no legal rights. In fact, in one of the most infamous Supreme Court cases of all time, the Court purported that Black’s in America had no constitutional rights which they could appeal to in society or in the courts&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;. Before this decision there was nothing barring free Black Americans from theoretical access to rights under the law, but in the 1857 Scott v Sanford decision the Supreme Court created a precedence in which Black men, whether free or in bondage, had no legal rights within America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Dred Scott, 150 Years Ago|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25073625|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=55|pages=19–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many historians believed it was this judicial decision that set the United States on the path to the Civil War which would lead the the reconstruction amendments in which the Equal Protection Clause can be found&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swisher|first=Carl Brent|date=1957|title=Dred Scott One Hundred Years After|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2127194|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–183|doi=10.2307/2127194}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Before and during the Civil War, the Southern states violated the rights of free speech of pro-Union citizens, anti-slavery advocates, and northerners in general. During the Civil War, the Southern states stripped many white citizens of their state citizenship and banished them from the states, effectively confiscating their property.    
Shortly after the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was proposed by Congress and [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratified]] by the states in 1865, [[Abolitionism|abolishing]] [[slavery]]. Many ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states then adopted [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] following the war. These laws severely restricted the rights of blacks to hold [[property]], including [[real property]] (such as [[real estate]]) and many forms of [[personal property]], and to form legally enforceable [[contracts]]. These codes also created harsher criminal penalties for blacks than for whites.&lt;ref&gt;For details on the rationale for, and ratification of, the Fourteenth Amendment, see generally {{cite book |title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863—1877 |last=Foner |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric Foner |year=1988 |publisher=Harper &amp;amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-091453-0 |pages= }}, as well as {{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking |last=Brest |first=Paul |authorlink= |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Law &amp; Business |location=Gaithersburg |isbn=978-0-7355-1250-4 |pages=241–242 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the inequality these Black Codes imposed, Congress enacted the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. This Act provided that all those born in the United States were citizens (contrary to the Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''), and required that "citizens of every [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and color ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens."&lt;ref&gt;See Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 242–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights bill of 1866 amid concerns (among other things) that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to pass such a law.   Such doubts were one factor that led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Roger. ''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Congress wanted to protect [[Scalawag|white Unionists]] who were under personal and legal attack in the former Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, David. "Original Popular Understanding of the 14th Amendment As Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-68", Whittier Law Review, Vol. 30, p. 695 (2008-2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was led by the [[Radical Republicans]] of both houses of Congress, including [[John Bingham]], [[Charles Sumner]], and [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. The most important among these, however, was Bingham, a Congressman from [[Ohio]], who drafted the language of the Equal Protection Clause.

The [[Southern United States|Southern]] states were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, section 5, clause 1 of the Constitution, to "be the Judge of the ... Qualifications of its own Members", had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having rebelled against the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact—the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a "[[Rump legislature|rump]]" Congress—that allowed the Equal Protection Clause to be passed by Congress and proposed to the states. Its ratification by the former Confederate states was made a condition of their reacceptance into the Union.&lt;ref&gt;See Foner (1988), passim.

== Ratification ==
With the return to originalist interpretations of the Constitution, many wonder what was intended by the framers of the reconstruction amendments at the time of their ratification. The 13th amendment abolished slavery but to what extent it protected other rights was unclear.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuckert|first=Michael P.|date=1992|title=Completing the Constitution: The Fourteenth Amendment and Constitutional Rights|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3330348|journal=Publius|volume=22|issue=2|pages=69–91|doi=10.2307/3330348}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 13th amendment the South began to institute black codes which were restrictive laws seeking to keep Black Americans in a position of inferiority. The 14th amendment was ratified by nervous Republicans in response to the rise of Black codes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This ratification was irregular in many ways. First there were multiple states that rejected the 14th amendment, but when their new governments were created due to reconstruction, these new governments accepted the amendment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433/#tab-opinion-1936403|title=Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also two states, Ohio and New Jersey, that accepted the amendment and then later passed resolutions rescinding that acceptance. The nullification of the two state's acceptance was considered illegitimate and both Ohio and New Jersey were included in those counted as ratifying the amendment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Many historians have argued that 14th amendment was not originally intended to grant sweeping political and social rights to the citizens but instead to solidify the constitutionality of the 1866 Civil rights Act&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=Michael J.|date=1979|title=Modern Equal Protection: A Conceptualization and Appraisal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1121988|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=79|issue=6|pages=1023–1084|doi=10.2307/1121988}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While it is widely agreed that this was a key reason for the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, many historians adopt a much wider view. It is a popular interpretation that the Fourteenth Amendment was always meant to ensure equal rights for all those in American.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=William M.|date=1955|title=The Second Emancipation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/272626|journal=Phylon (1940-1956)|volume=16|issue=1|pages=77–86|doi=10.2307/272626}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was used by Charles Sumner when he used the 14th amendment as the basis for his arguments to expand the protections afforded to Black Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, Charles, and Daniel Murray Pamphlet Collection. . Washington: S. &amp; R. O. Polkinhorn, Printers, 1874. Pdf. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.loc.gov/item/12005313/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the equal protection clause is one of the most cited ideas in legal theory, it received little attention during the ratification of the 14th amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=John P.|last2=Munro|first2=Robert F.|date=1950|title=The Original Understanding of "Equal Protection of the Laws"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1118709|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=50|issue=2|pages=131–169|doi=10.2307/1118709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the key tenant of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification was the Privileges and Immunities Clause&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This clause sought to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens which now included Black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://constitutionus.com/|title=Constitution of the United States - We the People|last=Baltzell|first=George W.|website=constitutionus.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of this clause was substantially narrowed following the Slaughterhouse Cases in which it was determined that a citizen's privileges and immunities  were only ensured at the Federal level and that it was government overreach to impose this standard on the states &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Even in this halting decision the Court still acknowledged the context in which the Amendment was passed, stating that knowing the evils and injustice the 14th amendment was meant to combat is key in our legal  understanding of its implications and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/83/36/#tab-opinion-1967657|title=Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1872)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the abridgment of the Privileges and Immunities clause, legal arguments aimed at protecting Black American's rights became more complex and that is when the equal protection clause started to gain attention for the arguments it could enhance&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  

During the debate in Congress, more than one version of the clause was considered. Here is the first version: "The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure ... to all persons in the several states equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property."&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Alfred. "[http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Issue%2087.1/fn7.kelly.pdf Clio and the Court: An Illicit Love Affair]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Supreme Court Review'' at p. 148 (1965) reprinted in ''The Supreme Court in and of the Stream of Power'' (Kermit Hall ed., Psychology Press 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham said about this version: "It confers upon Congress power to see to it that the protection given by the laws of the States shall be equal in respect to life and liberty and property to all persons."&lt;ref name="Kelly" /&gt; The main opponent of the first version was Congressman [[Robert S. Hale]] of New York, despite Bingham's public assurances that "under no possible interpretation can it ever be made to operate in the State of New York while she occupies her present proud position."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Bickel|Bickel, Alexander]]. "[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4958&amp;context=fss_papers The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision]", ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 69, pp. 35-37 (1955).  Bingham was speaking on February 27, 1866.  ''See'' [http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llcg/071/0100/01061064.tif transcript].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hale ended up voting for the final version, however. When Senator [[Jacob Howard]] introduced that final version, he said:&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Michael. "[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2059&amp;context=bclr Resurrecting the Privileges or Immunities Clause and Revising the Slaughter-House Cases Without Exhuming Lochner: Individual Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment]", ''Boston College Law Review'', Vol. 38 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It prohibits the hanging of a black man for a crime for which the white man is not to be hanged. It protects the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield which it throws over the white man. Ought not the time to be now passed when one measure of justice is to be meted out to a member of one caste while another and a different measure is meted out to the member of another caste, both castes being alike citizens of the United States, both bound to obey the same laws, to sustain the burdens of the same Government, and both equally responsible to justice and to God for the deeds done in the body?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[39th United States Congress]] proposed the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866.  A difference between the initial and final versions of the clause was that the final version spoke not just of "equal protection" but of "the equal protection of the laws".  John Bingham said in January 1867: "no State may deny to any person the equal protection of the laws, including all the limitations for personal protection of every article and section of the Constitution ..."&lt;ref&gt;Glidden, William.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XROaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79 Congress and the Fourteenth Amendment: Enforcing Liberty and Equality in the States]'', p. 79 (Lexington Books 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  By July 9, 1868, three-fourths of the states (28 of 37) ratified the amendment, and that is when the Equal Protection Clause became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/constamrat.html|title=Ratification of Constitutional Amendments|accessdate=February 24, 2007|last=Mount|first=Steve|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history following ratification==
Bingham said in a speech on March 31, 1871 that the clause meant no State could deny to any one "the equal protection of the Constitution of the United States ... [or] any of the rights which it guarantees to all men", nor deny to anyone "any right secured to him either by the laws and treaties of the United States or of such State."&lt;ref&gt;Flack, Horace. ''The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment'', p. 232 (Johns Hopkins Press, 1908). For Bingham's full speech, see ''[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA83 Appendix to the Congressional Globe, 42d Congress, 1st Sess.]'', p. 83 (March 31, 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the meaning of equality varied from one state to another.&lt;ref&gt;requires citation&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Reconstruction_14th_amendment_is_not_recognized.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Reconstruction_14th_amendment_is_not_recognized.jpg|thumb|This is a drawing by E. W. Kemble shows a sleeping congress with a broken 14th Amendment. It makes the case that Congress ignored its constitutional obligations to Black Americans.]]
Four of the original thirteen states never passed any laws barring [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|interracial marriage]], and the other states were divided on the issue in the Reconstruction era.&lt;ref&gt;Wallenstein, Peter. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFei2wFmNfsC&amp;pg=PA253 Tell the Court I Love My Wife: Race, Marriage, and Law--An American History]'', p. 253 (Palgrave Macmillan, Jan 17, 2004). The four of the original thirteen states are New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. Id.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] ruled that the state's ban on mixed-race marriage violated the "cardinal principle" of the 1866 Civil Rights Act and of the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, Peggy. ''What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America'', p. 58 (Oxford U. Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a hundred years would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court followed that Alabama case (''Burns v. State'') in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. In ''Burns'', the Alabama Supreme Court said:&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven and Matthews, Andrea. "Originalism and Loving v. Virginia", ''Brigham Young University Law Review'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage is a civil contract, and in that character alone is dealt with by the municipal law. The same right to make a contract as is enjoyed by white citizens, means the right to make any contract which a white citizen may make. The law intended to destroy the distinctions of race and color in respect to the rights secured by it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As for public schooling, no states during this era of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] actually required separate schools for blacks.&lt;ref name=Foner&gt;[[Eric Foner|Foner, Eric]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FhvA0S_op38C&amp;pg=PA321 Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877]'', pp. 321–322 (HarperCollins 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some states (e.g. New York) gave local districts discretion to set up schools that were deemed [[separate but equal]].&lt;ref name=Bickel&gt;[[Alexander Bickel|Bickel, Alexander]]. "[http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4958&amp;context=fss_papers The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision]", ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Vol. 69, pp. 35–37 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Iowa and Massachusetts flatly prohibited segregated schools ever since the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, Paul. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=dNtyyzGUNzYC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;output=html_text Rehearsal for Reconstruction: Antebellum Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment]", in ''The Facts of Reconstruction: Essays in Honor of John Hope Franklin'', p. 19 (Eric Anderson and Alfred A. Moss, eds., LSU Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, some states were more favorable to women's legal status than others; New York, for example, had been giving women full property, parental, and widow's rights since 1860, but not the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch, Nancy. ''Women and the American Experience'', p. 185 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; No state or territory allowed [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] when the Equal Protection Clause took effect in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Stephen. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oVv-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27 Is This Any Way to Run a Democratic Election?]'', p. 27 (CQ PRESS 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, African American men had full voting rights in five states, at that time.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, Daniel. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTe5oqGna4C&amp;pg=PA212 A Traveller's History of the USA]'', P. 212 (Interlink Books, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gilded Age interpretation and the ''Plessy'' decision==
In the United States, the year 1877 marked the end of Reconstruction and the start of the [[Gilded Age]]. The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'' (1880). A black man convicted of murder by an [[all-white jury]] challenged a [[West Virginia]] [[statute]] excluding blacks from serving on juries. Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been "drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant's] race."  At the same time, the Court explicitly allowed [[sexism]] and other types of discrimination, saying that states "may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this. ... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color."&lt;ref&gt;Kerber, Linda.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIo1k6SSKcC&amp;pg=PA133 No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship]'', p. 133 (Macmillan, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Plessy'']]The next important postwar case was the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883), in which the constitutionality of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have "full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, [[common carriers|public conveyances]] on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement." In its opinion, the Court explicated what has since become known as the "[[State action (United States constitutional law)|state action doctrine]]", according to which the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause apply only to acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was "simply a private wrong". [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan]] dissented alone, saying, "I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism." Harlan went on to argue that because (1) "public conveyances on land and water" use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is "a quasi-public employment", and (3) "places of public amusement" are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services ''was'' an act sanctioned by the state.
A few years later, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote the Court's opinion in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', {{ussc|118|356|1886}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In it the word "person" from the 14th Amendment's section has been given the broadest possible meaning by the U.S. Supreme Court:&lt;ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annotation 18 - Fourteenth Amendment: Section 1 – Rights Guaranteed: Equal Protection of the Laws: Scope and application state action|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation18.html#t94|publisher=FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Law &amp; Legal Information by FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thus, the Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) [[Alien (law)|legal aliens]] in the United States who are Chinese citizens.

In its most contentious Gilded Age interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a [[Louisiana]] [[Jim Crow law]] that required the [[racial segregation|segregation]] of blacks and whites on [[Rail transport|railroads]] and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of the social, political and historical background to ''Plessy'', see {{cite book |title=The Strange Career of Jim Crow |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |authorlink=C. Vann Woodward |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514690-5 |pages=6 and pp. 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, speaking through Justice [[Henry B. Brown]], ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in [[civil rights]], not equality in [[social rule|social arrangements]]. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana's railway law amply met that requirement, being based on "the established usages, customs and traditions of the people." Justice Harlan again dissented. "Every one knows," he wrote,

{{quote|that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons&amp;nbsp; ... [I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no [[caste]] here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.}}

Such "arbitrary separation" by race, Harlan concluded, was "a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the [[equality before the law]] established by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;For a skeptical evaluation of Harlan, see {{cite journal |last=Chin |first=Gabriel J. |year=1996 |title=The ''Plessy'' Myth: Justice Harlan and the Chinese Cases |journal=Iowa Law Review |volume=82 |issue= |page=151 |issn=0021-0552 |ssrn=1121505 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harlan's philosophy of [[constitutional colorblindness]] would eventually become more widely accepted, especially after [[World War II]].

It was also in the Gilded Age that a ruling by the Supreme Court included [[headnote]]s written by John C.Bancroft, a former railway company president. Bancroft, acting as [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|court reporter]], indicated in the headnotes that corporations were "persons", while the actual court decision itself avoided specific statements regarding the Equal Protection Clause as applied to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/118/394/case.html Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]'', {{ussc|118|394|1886}}. In the summary of the case Bancroft wrote that the Court declared that it did not need to hear argument on whether the Equal Protection Clause protected corporations, because "we are all of the opinion that it does." Id. at 396.  Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] announced from the bench that the Court would not hear argument on the question whether the equal protection clause applied to corporations: "We are all of the opinion that it does." The background and developments from this utterance are treated in H. Graham, Everyman's Constitution--Historical Essays on the Fourteenth Amendment, the ''Conspiracy Theory,'' and American Constitutionalism (1968), chs. 9, 10, and pp. 566-84. Justice [[Hugo Black]], in Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77, 85 (1938), and Justice [[William O. Douglas]], in Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 576 (1949), have disagreed that corporations are persons for equal protection purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legal concept of [[corporate personhood]] predates the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Providence Bank v. Billings'', {{ussc|29|514|1830}}, in which Chief Justice Marshall wrote: "The great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men." Nevertheless, the concept of corporate personhood remains controversial. See {{cite journal |last=Mayer |first=Carl J. |authorlink= |year=1990 |title=Personalizing the Impersonal: Corporations and the Bill of Rights |journal=Hastings Law Journal |volume=41 |issue= |page=577 |issn=0017-8322 |url=http://reclaimdemocracy.org/personhood/mayer_personalizing.html |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Clause was used to strike down numerous statutes applying to corporations.

==Between ''Plessy'' and ''Brown''==
[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court Building]] opened in 1935, inscribed with the words "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]" which were inspired by the Equal Protection Clause.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah. ''Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;]]The ''Plessy'' decision was not all bad for civil rights. For example, in ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938), [[Lloyd Gaines]] was a black student at [[Lincoln University of Missouri]], one of the [[historically black colleges]] in [[Missouri]]. He applied for admission to the law school at the all-white [[University of Missouri]], since Lincoln did not have a law school, but was denied admission due solely to his race. The Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of ''Plessy'', held that a State offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.

In ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948), the Court showed increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. The ''Shelley'' case concerned a privately made contract that prohibited "people of the Negro or Mongolian race" from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of ''The Civil Rights Cases'', the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts' ''enforcement'' of such a contract could; after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.

The companion cases ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'', both decided in 1950, paved the way for a series of school integration cases. In ''McLaurin'', the [[University of Oklahoma]] had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]], said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:

{{quote|There is a vast difference—a Constitutional difference—between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual commingling of students, and the refusal of individuals to commingle where the state presents no such bar.}}

The present situation, Vinson said, was the former. In ''Sweatt'', the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas's state system of [[law school]]s, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system—not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not ''equal''. They lacked "substantial equality in the educational opportunities" offered to their students.

All of these cases, as well as the upcoming ''Brown'' case, were litigated by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. It was [[Charles Hamilton Houston]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate and law professor at [[Howard University]], who in the 1930s first began to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts. [[Thurgood Marshall]], a former student of Houston's and the future [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] and [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], joined him. Both men were extraordinarily skilled [[appellate court|appellate]] advocates, but part of their shrewdness lay in their careful choice of ''which'' cases to litigate, selecting the best legal proving grounds for their cause.&lt;ref&gt;See generally {{cite book |title=Origin of the Civil Rights Movements: Black Communities Organizing for Change |last=Morris |first=Aldon D. |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-922130-3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Brown'' and its consequences==
{{See also|Brown v. Board of Education}}
In 1954 the contextualization of the equal protection clause would change forever. The Supreme Court itself recognized the gravity of the Brown v Board decision acknowledging that a split decision would be a threat to the role of the Supreme Court and even to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karlan|first=Pamela S.|date=2009|title=WHAT CAN BROWN® DO FOR YOU?: NEUTRAL PRINCIPLES AND THE STRUGGLE OVER THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20684748|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1049–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Earl Warren]] became Chief Justice in 1953, ''Brown'' had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling—he had been an extremely successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician before joining the Court—was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;For an exhaustive history of the ''Brown'' case from start to finish, see {{cite book |title=Simple Justice |last=Kluger |first=Richard |year=1977 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-72255-9 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that opinion, Warren wrote:

{{quote|To separate [children in grade and high schools] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone ... We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.}}

Warren discouraged other justices, such as [[Robert H. Jackson]], from publishing any concurring opinion; Jackson's draft, which emerged much later (in 1988), included this statement: "Constitutions are easier amended than social customs, and even the North never fully conformed its racial practices to its professions".&lt;ref&gt;Shimsky, MaryJane. ''"Hesitating Between Two Worlds": The Civil Rights Odyssey of Robert H. Jackson'', p. 468 (ProQuest, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''I Dissent: Great Opposing Opinions in Landmark Supreme Court Cases'', pp. 133–151 (Mark Tushnet, ed. Beacon Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court set the case for re-argument on the question of how to implement the decision. In ''[[Brown II]]'', decided in 1954, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local [[board of education|school boards]] and to the [[United States district court|trial courts]] that had originally heard the cases. (''Brown'' was actually a consolidation of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with "all deliberate speed".

[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Brown'']]Partly because of that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared "[[massive resistance]]" in the South to the desegregation decision, [[racial integration|integration]] did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to ''Brown'' but to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was not until ''[[Green v. School Board of New Kent County]]'' (1968), in which Justice [[William J. Brennan]], writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a "freedom-of-choice" school plan as inadequate. This was a significant decision; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to ''Brown''. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks rarely attended white-identified schools.

In response to ''Green'', many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because [[residential segregation]] was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' approved [[Desegregation busing|busing]] as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students ''between'' [[school district|districts]], instead of merely ''within'' a district. ''Milliken'' basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive history of school desegregation from ''Brown'' through ''Milliken'' (one on which this article relies for its assertions), see Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 768–794.&lt;/ref&gt;

The curtailment of busing in ''Milliken v. Bradley'' is one of several reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments.&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the [[United States|American]] political branches' engagement with the Supreme Court's commitment to desegregation (and vice versa), see {{cite book |title=The Warren Court and American Politics |last=Powe |first=Lucas A., Jr. |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Belknap Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-00683-6 |pages= }}, and {{cite book |title=Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America |last=Kotz |first=Nick |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-618-08825-6 |pages= }} For more on the debate summarized in the text, see, e.g., {{cite book |title=The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change? |last=Rosenberg |first=Gerald N. |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-72703-5 |pages= }}, and {{cite journal |last=Klarman |first=Michael J. |year=1994 |title=''Brown'', Racial Change, and the Civil Rights Movement |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=80 |issue=1|pages=7–150 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1073592 |jstor= 1073592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Court itself decided in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows—but does not require—a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Troy. "Education Finance Reform Litigation and Separation of Powers: Kentucky Makes Its Contribution," ''Kentucky Law Journal'', Vol. 80 (1991): 309, 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Court's decision in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite "inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others", as [[Martha Minow]] has put it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Minow|Minow, Martha]]. "Confronting the Seduction of Choice: Law, Education and American Pluralism", ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 120, p. 814, 819-820 (2011)(''Pierce'' "entrenched the pattern of a two-tiered system of schooling, which sanctions private opt-outs from publicly run schools").&lt;/ref&gt;

American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still ''[[de facto]]'' segregated. Whether due to ''Brown'', or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For data and analysis, see {{cite web|url=http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |format=PDF |title=Schools More Separate |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author=Orfield |date=July 2001 |work=Harvard University Civil Rights Project |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215819/http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'' (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=Racial, Economic, and Linguistic Segregation: Analyzing Market Supports in the District of Columbia's Public Charter Schools.|journal=Education and Urban Society|date=8 August 2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=120–141|doi=10.1177/0013124511407317|url=http://eus.sagepub.com/content/45/1/120|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to federal government==
By its terms, the clause restrains only state governments. However, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[due process]] guarantee, beginning with ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954), has been interpreted as imposing some of the same restrictions on the federal government: "Though the Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause, as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the States, the concepts of equal protection and due process are not mutually exclusive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=347&amp;invol=497 |title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date=1954-05-17 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) the Supreme Court added: "Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests" &lt;ref&gt;Lawrence v. Texas, {{Ussc|539|598|2003}}, at page 2482&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars have argued that the Court's decision in ''Bolling'' should have been reached on other grounds. For example, [[Michael W. McConnell]] has written that Congress never "required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated."&lt;ref&gt;Balkin, J. M.; Bruce A. Ackerman (2001). "Part II". What Brown v. Board of Education should have said : the nation's top legal experts rewrite America's landmark civil rights decision. et al. New York University Press. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal.

==Tiered scrutiny==
Despite the undoubted importance of ''Brown'', much of modern equal protection jurisprudence originated in other cases, though not everyone agrees about ''which'' other cases. Some scholars assert that the opinion of Justice [[Harlan Stone]] in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938)&lt;ref&gt;304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938). For a theory of judicial review based on Stone's footnote, see Ely, John Hart (1981). ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-19637-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contained a footnote that was a critical turning point for equal protection jurisprudence,&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Goldstein, Leslie. "[https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume4/issue2/Goldstein4U.Pa.J.Const.L.372(2002).pdf Between the Tiers: The New(est) Equal Protection and Bush v. Gore]", ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law'', Vol. 4, p. 372 (2002) .&lt;/ref&gt; but that assertion is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Farber, Daniel and Frickey, Philip. "[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2542&amp;context=facpubs Is Carolene Products Dead--Reflections on Affirmative Action and the Dynamics of Civil Rights Legislation]", ''California Law Review'', Vol. 79, p. 685 (1991). Farber and Frickey point out that "only Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Roberts joined Justice Stone's footnote", and in any event "It is simply a myth ... that the process theory of footnote four in Carolene Products is, or ever has been, the primary justification for invalidating laws embodying prejudice against racial minorities."&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever its precise origins, the basic idea of the modern approach is that more judicial scrutiny is triggered by purported discrimination that involves "[[fundamental rights]]" (such as the right to procreation), and similarly more judicial scrutiny is also triggered if the purported victim of discrimination has been targeted because he or she belongs to a "[[suspect classification]]" (such as a single racial group). This modern doctrine was pioneered in ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'' (1942), which involved depriving certain criminals of the fundamental right to procreate:&lt;ref&gt;''Skinner v. Oklahoma'', 316 U.S. 535 (1942). Sometimes the "suspect" classification strand of the modern doctrine is attributed to ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), but ''Korematsu'' did not involve the Fourteenth Amendment, and moreover it came later than the ''Skinner'' opinion (which clearly stated that both deprivation of fundamental rights as well as oppression of a particular race or nationality were invidious).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Until 1976, the Supreme Court usually ended up dealing with discrimination by using one of two possible levels of scrutiny: what has come to be called "[[strict scrutiny]]" (when a suspect class or fundamental right is involved), or instead the more lenient "[[rational basis review]]". Strict scrutiny means that a challenged statute must be "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling" government interest, and must not have a "less restrictive" alternative. In contrast, rational basis scrutiny merely requires that a challenged statute be "reasonably related" to a "legitimate" government interest.

However, in the 1976 case of ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'', the Court added another tier of scrutiny, called "[[intermediate scrutiny]]", regarding gender discrimination. The Court may have added other tiers too, such as "enhanced rational basis" scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; and "exceedingly persuasive basis" scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

All of this is known as "tiered" scrutiny, and it has had many critics, including Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] who argued for a "spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination", instead of discrete tiers.&lt;ref name=Fleming /&gt; Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] argued for only one level of scrutiny, given that "there is only one Equal Protection Clause".&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;Fleming, James. "[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol74/iss4/26 'There is Only One Equal Protection Clause': An Appreciation of Justice Stevens's Equal Protection Jurisprudence]", ''Fordham Law Review'', Vol. 74, p. 2301, 2306 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The whole tiered strategy developed by the Court is meant to reconcile the principle of equal protection with the reality that most laws necessarily discriminate in some way.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996): "the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons."&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing the standard of scrutiny can determine the outcome of a case, and the strict scrutiny standard is often described as "strict in theory and fatal in fact".&lt;ref&gt;Curry, James et al. ''Constitutional Government: The American Experience'', p. 282 (Kendall Hunt 2003) (attributing the phrase to Gerald Gunther).&lt;/ref&gt; In order to select the correct level of scrutiny, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] urged the Court to identify rights as "fundamental" or identify classes as "suspect" by analyzing what was understood when the Equal Protection Clause was adopted, instead of based upon more subjective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Domino, John. ''Civil Rights &amp; Liberties in the 21st Century'', pp. 337-338 (Pearson 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discriminatory intent and disparate impact==
{{Main|Disparate impact}}
Because inequalities can be caused either intentionally or unintentionally, the Supreme Court has decided that the Equal Protection Clause itself does not forbid governmental policies that unintentionally lead to racial disparities, though Congress may have some power under other clauses of the Constitution to address unintentional disparate impacts. This subject was addressed in the seminal case of ''[[Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.]]'' (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a city in the suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] that had refused to [[zoning|re-zone]] a plot of land on which the plaintiff intended to build low-income, racially integrated housing. On the face, there was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights's]] planning commission. The result was racially disparate, however, since the refusal supposedly prevented mostly African-Americans and Hispanics from moving in. Justice [[Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], writing for the Court, stated, "Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause." Disparate impact merely has an [[evidence|evidentiary]] value; absent a "stark" pattern, "impact is not determinative."

The result in ''Arlington Heights'' was similar to that in ''[[Washington v. Davis]]'' (1976), and has been defended on the basis that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to guarantee [[equality of outcome|equal outcomes]], but rather [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]]; if a legislature wants to correct unintentional but racially disparate effects, it may be able to do so through further legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/03/constitutional__1.html |title=Constitutional Rights: Two |accessdate= |last=Herzog |first=Don |date=March 22, 2005 |work=Left2Right |publisher=}} Note that the Court has put significant limits on the [[congressional power of enforcement]]. See ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' (2001), and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000). The Court has also interpreted federal statutory law as limiting the power of states to correct disparate effects. See ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Krieger |first=Linda Hamilton |authorlink= |year=1995 |title=The Content of Our Categories: A Cognitive Bias Approach to Discrimination and Equal Protection Opportunity |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=47 |issue= 6|pages=1161–1248 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/1229191 |jstor= 1229191 }}, and {{cite journal |last=Lawrence |first=Charles R., III |authorlink= |year=1987 |title=Reckoning with Unconscious Racism |journal=Stanford Law Review |volume=39 |issue= 2|pages=317–388 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1228797 |jstor= 1228797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in ''Arlington Heights''.

For an example of how this rule limits the Court's powers under the Equal Protection Clause, see ''[[McClesky v. Kemp]]'' (1987). In that case a black man was convicted of murdering a white police officer and sentenced to death in the state of Georgia. A study found that killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than were killers of blacks.&lt;ref name="Baldus1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldus |first=David C. |authorlink= |author2=Pulaski, Charles |author3=Woodworth, George  |year=1983 |title=Comparative Review of Death Sentences: An Empirical Study of the Georgia Experience |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=661–753 |doi=10.2307/1143133 |jstor= 1143133|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol74/iss3/2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the defense had failed to prove that such data demonstrated the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.

==Voting rights==
[[File:John Marshall Harlan II official.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Justice John Marshall Harlan II sought to interpret the Equal Protection Clause in the context of Section 2 of the same amendment]]The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927) that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited denial of the vote based on race. The first modern application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the [[Tennessee]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause.

It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal [[voting rights]]; after all, it would seem to make the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II|John M. Harlan]] (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from ''Reynolds''. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:

{{quote|If constitutional amendment was the only means by which all men and, later, women, could be guaranteed the right to vote at all, even for ''federal'' officers, how can it be that the far less obvious right to a particular kind of apportionment of ''state'' legislatures ... can be conferred by judicial construction of the Fourteenth Amendment?'' [Emphasis in the original.]}}

Harlan also relied on the fact that Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment "expressly recognizes the States' power to deny 'or in any way' abridge the right of their inhabitants to vote for 'the members of the [state] Legislature.'"&lt;ref&gt;Van Alstyne, William. "The Fourteenth Amendment, the Right to Vote, and the Understanding of the Thirty-Ninth Congress", ''Supreme Court Review'', p. 33 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a specific federal response to such actions by a state: reduction of a state's representation in Congress. However, the Supreme Court has instead responded that voting is a "fundamental right" on the same plane as marriage (''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''); for any discrimination in fundamental rights to be constitutional, the Court requires the legislation to pass strict scrutiny. Under this theory, equal protection jurisprudence has been applied to voting rights.

A recent use of equal protection doctrine came in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in [[Florida]] in the aftermath of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices [[David Souter|Souter]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] joined the majority of five—but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.&lt;ref&gt;For criticisms as well as several defenses of the Court's decision, see Bush v. Gore'': The Question of Legitimacy'', edited by {{cite book |title= Bush v.

==Sex, disability, and sexual orientation==
Originally, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid sex discrimination to the same extent as other forms of discrimination. On the one hand, Section Two of the amendment specifically discouraged states from interfering with the voting rights of "males", which made the amendment anathema to many women when it was proposed in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-Dupont, Kathryn. ''Encyclopedia of Women's History in America'', pp. 91-92 (Infobase Publishing, Jan 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as feminists like [[Victoria Woodhull]] pointed out, the word "person" in the Equal Protection Clause was apparently chosen deliberately, instead of a masculine term that could have easily been used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hymowitz, Carol and Weissman, Michaele. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c-adTP64AsC&amp;pg=PT128 A History of Women in America]'', p. 128 (Random House Digital, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Reed v. Reed]],'' extending the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect women from sex discrimination, in situations where there is no rational basis for the discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.jrank.org/pages/24338/Reed-v-Reed-Significance.html Reed v. Reed - Significance, Notable Trials and Court Cases - 1963 to 1972]&lt;/ref&gt; That level of scrutiny was boosted to an intermediate level in ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'' (1976).&lt;ref&gt;''Craig v. Boren'', 429 U.S. 190 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 WY Proof Rev.png|thumb|left|Each state can guarantee more equality than does the Equal Protection Clause.  For example, the state of [[Wyoming]] granted women the right to vote even before the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] required it.]] The Supreme Court has been disinclined to extend full "[[suspect classification]]" status (thus making a law that categorizes on that basis subject to greater judicial scrutiny) for groups other than racial minorities and religious groups. In ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985), the Court refused to make the [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]] a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however&amp;mdash;and Justice Thurgood Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence&amp;mdash;that the Court did appear to examine the City of Cleburne's denial of a permit to a group home for intellectually disabled people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Pettinga |first=Gayle Lynn |authorlink= |year=1987 |title=Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny by Any Other Name |journal=Indiana Law Journal |volume=62 |issue= |page=779 |issn=0019-6665 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}; {{cite journal |last=Wadhwani |first=Neelum J. |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Rational Reviews, Irrational Results |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=84 |issue= |pages=801, 809&amp;ndash;811 |issn=0040-4411 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court's decision in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996) struck down a [[Colorado]] constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals "minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination." The Court rejected as "implausible" the dissent's argument that the amendment would not deprive homosexuals of general protections provided to everyone else but rather would merely prevent "special treatment of homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;Kuligowski, Monte. "Romer v. Evans: Judicial Judgment or Emotive Utterance?," ''Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development'', Vol. 12 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Much as in ''City of Cleburne'', the ''Romer'' decision seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joslin |first=Courtney |authorlink= |year=1997 |title=Equal Protection and Anti-Gay Legislation |journal=Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=32 |issue= |pages=225, 240 |issn=0017-8039 |url= |accessdate= |quote=The ''Romer'' Court applied a more 'active,' ''Cleburne''-like rational basis standard ...}}; {{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=Robert C. |authorlink= |year=1999 |title=Successful Rational Basis Claims in the Supreme Court from the 1971 Term Through ''Romer v.

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting [[homosexual]] [[sodomy]] on substantive due process grounds. In Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only ''homosexual'' sodomy, and not ''heterosexual'' sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited ''City of Cleburne'', and also relied in part on ''Romer''. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to [[sexual orientation]].

While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Koppelman |first=Andrew |authorlink= |year=1994 |title=Why Discrimination against Lesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination |journal=New York University Law Review |volume=69 |issue= |page=197 |issn=0028-7881 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}; see also &lt;u&gt;[[Fricke v.

In preventing Aaron Fricke from attending the senior reception, the school has afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students those wishing to attend the reception with companions of the same sex."]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree, arguing that "homophobia" is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstmann, Evan. '' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6o9FQgK7H8gC&amp;pg=PA55 Same Sex Marriage and the Constitution]'', p. 55 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Court struck down part of the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]], in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''. No state statute was in question, and therefore the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did employ similar principles, however, in combination with [[federalism]] principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor [[Erwin Chemerinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, Erwin. "[http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 Justice Kennedy's World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709102734/http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 |date=2013-07-09 }}", ''[[The National Law Journal]]'' (July 1, 2013): "There is another similarity between his opinion in Windsor and his earlier ones in Romer and Lawrence: the Supreme Court invalidated the law without using heightened scrutiny for sexual-orientation discrimination ... A law based on animus fails to meet even rational-basis review so there was no need to adopt a higher level of scrutiny."&lt;/ref&gt; The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/mobile/document/United_States_v_Windsor_No_12307_2013_BL_168683_US_June_26_2013_C/1 United States v. Windsor]'', No. 12-307, 2013 BL 169620, 118 FEP Cases 1417 (U.S. June 26, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court held [[Obergefell v. Hodges|in a 5–4 decision]] that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and required all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions.

==Affirmative action==
{{See also|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is the consideration of race, gender, or other factors, to benefit an underrepresented group or to address past injustices done to that group. Individuals who belong to the group are preferred over those who do not belong to the group, for example in educational admissions, hiring, promotions, awarding of contracts, and the like.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = Stanford University| title = Affirmative Action| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/
| accessdate =4/6/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such action may be used as a "tie-breaker" if all other factors are inconclusive, or may be achieved through [[racial quota|quota]]s, which allot a certain number of benefits to each group.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Congress enacted race-conscious programs primarily to assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives. Such legislation was enacted by many of the same people who framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause did not apply to such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Schnapper |first=Eric |authorlink= |year=1985 |title=Affirmative Action and the Legislative History of the Fourteenth Amendment |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=71 |issue= 5|pages=753–798 |quote= |doi=10.2307/1073012 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/AFFIRM.ACTION.LEGISLATIVE.HISTORY.%20FOURTEENTH%20AMENDMENT.pdf|jstor=1073012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to private universities and other private businesses, which are free to practice affirmative action unless prohibited by federal statute or state law.

Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government [[independent contractor|contractor]]s&amp;mdash;for instance, ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]]'' (1995) and ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'' (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by [[public university|public universities]]: ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''.

In ''Bakke'', the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their [[University and college admissions|admissions]] process. In ''Grutter'' and ''Gratz'', the Court upheld both ''Bakke'' as a precedent and the admissions policy of the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. In [[dicta]], however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In ''Gratz'', the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.

In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in ''Grutter'', and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in ''Bakke'', passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his dissent to ''Grutter''—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |title=Reflections on ''Grutter'' |accessdate= |last=Schuck |first=Peter H. |date=September 5, 2003 |work=Jurist |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909065433/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |archivedate=2005-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Reva B. |authorlink=Reva Siegel |year=2004 |title=Equality Talk: Antisubordination and Anticlassification Values in Constitutional Struggles over ''Brown'' |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue= 5|pages=1470–1547 |id= |quote= |doi=10.2307/4093259 |jstor= 4093259 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1102 |type=Submitted manuscript }}; {{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Stephen L. |authorlink=Stephen L.

'''Evil''', in a general sense, is the opposite or absence of [[good]]. It can be an extremely broad concept, though in everyday usage is often used more narrowly to denote profound [[wickedness]]. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal [[moral evil]] commonly associated with the word, or impersonal [[natural evil]] (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil can denote profound [[immorality]]&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |title=Evil |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the [[human condition]], where [[wikt:strife|strife]] and [[suffering]] (cf. [[Hinduism]]) are the true roots of evil.  In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a [[supernatural]] force.&lt;ref name="Oxford Dictionary Definition"/&gt; As defined in [[philosophy]]{{fact|date=July 2018}} it can be the name for the [[psychology]] and [[instinct]] of individuals which [[selfish]]ly but often necessarily [[Defence mechanism|defends]] the personal boundary against deadly attacks and serious threats. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Staub. ''Overcoming evil: genocide, violent conflict, and terrorism''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve [[Balance (metaphysics)|unbalanced]] behavior involving [[anger]], [[revenge]], [[fear]], [[hatred]], [[psychological trauma]], expediency, [[selfishness]], [[ignorance]], or [[neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews. ''Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus''. Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co, Jan 14, 2004. p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil is sometimes perceived as the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] antagonistic [[Binary opposition|binary opposite]] to [[good]],&lt;ref name="PA131 pp.136-7"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kf9err5bmr4C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=history+yehud+2008&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LGmPdldLsV&amp;sig=QIbpDXAPWb0nu2lOKXq5o636nuU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qAMBTNrHBYmlceLa6NUB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20yehud%202008&amp;f=false Izaak J. de Hulster, "Iconographic Exegesis and Third Isaiah", pp.136-7]&lt;/ref&gt; in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149"&gt;Paul O. Ingram, Frederick John Streng. ''Buddhist-Christian Dialogue: Mutual Renewal and Transformation''. University of Hawaii Press, 1986. pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In cultures with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving ''[[Nirvana]]''.&lt;ref name="Paul O. Ingram 1986. P. 148-149" /&gt; The [[ethics|philosophical]] questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;: [[Meta-ethics]] concerning the nature of good and evil, [[Normative ethics]] concerning how we ought to behave, and [[Applied ethics]] concerning particular moral issues. While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume an evildoer or doers.

Some religions and philosophies deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.

==Etymology==
The [[modern English]] word ''evil'' ([[Old English]] {{lang|ang|yfel}}) and its [[cognate]]s such as the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Übel}} and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|euvel}} are widely considered to come from a [[Proto-Germanic]] reconstructed form of ''*ubilaz'', comparable to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''huwapp-'' ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|''*wap-''}} and suffixed zero-grade form {{PIE|''*up-elo-''}}. Other later Germanic forms include [[Middle English]] {{lang|enm|evel}}, {{lang|enm|ifel}}, {{lang|enm|ufel}}, [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|evel}} (adjective and noun), [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|ubil}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ubil}}, and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] {{lang|got-Latn|ubils}}.

The root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown&lt;ref&gt;See 'Evil' entry in [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; to be akin to modern [[German language|German]] ''[[:de:Das Übel|Das Übel]]'' (although ''evil'' is normally translated as ''Das Böse'') with the basic idea of [[transgression (disambiguation)|transgressing]].&lt;ref name="Harper2001"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Harper, Douglas |year=2001 |title=Etymology for evil |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=evil|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese moral philosophy==
:''Main: [[Confucius#Ethics|Confucian Ethics]], [[Confucianism]] and ''[[Taoism#Ethics|Taoist Ethics]]''
As with Buddhism, in [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]] there is no direct analogue to the way ''good and evil'' are opposed although reference to ''demonic influence'' is common in [[Chinese folk religion]]. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Thus ''evil'' would correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of Taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good&amp;evil.htm ''Good and Evil in Chinese Philosophy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529010501/http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/good%26evil.htm |date=2006-05-29 }} C.W. Chan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of Chinese Philosophy'' Feng Youlan, Volume II The Period of Classical Learning (from the Second Century B.C. to the Twentieth Century A.D). Trans. Derk Bodde. Ch. XIV Liu Chiu-Yuan, Wang Shou-Jen, and Ming Idealism. part 6 § 6 ''Origin of Evil''. Uses strikingly similar language to that in the etymology section of this article, in the context of Chinese Idealism.&lt;/ref&gt;

==European philosophy==
===Spinoza===
[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] states
{{quote|1. By good, I understand that which we certainly know is useful to us. &lt;br /&gt; 2. By evil, on the contrary, I understand that which we certainly know hinders us from possessing anything that is good.&lt;ref name="ebgb"&gt;Benedict de Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Part IV ''Of Human Bondage or of the Strength of the Affects'' Definitions translated by W. H. White, Revised by A. H. Stirling, Great Books vol 31, Encyclopædia Britannica 1952 p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Spinoza assumes a [[formal system|quasi-mathematical]] style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'' :&lt;ref name="ebgb"/&gt;
* Proposition 8 "''Knowledge of good or evil is nothing but affect of joy or sorrow in so far as we are conscious of it.''"
* Proposition 30 "''Nothing can be evil through that which it possesses in common with our nature, but in so far as a thing is evil to us it is contrary to us.''"
* Proposition 64 "''The knowledge of evil is inadequate knowledge.''"
** Corollary "''Hence it follows that if the human mind had none but adequate ideas, it would form no notion of evil.''"
* Proposition 65 "''According to the guidance of reason, of two things which are good, we shall follow the greater good, and of two evils, follow the less.''"
* Proposition 68 "''If men were born free, they would form no conception of good and evil so long as they were free.''"

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in a rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' and ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' where he essentially says that the natural, functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong).

== Psychology ==
===Carl Jung===
[[Carl Jung]], in his book ''[[Answer to Job]]'' and elsewhere, depicted evil as the ''dark side of God''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgjungpage.org/learn/articles/book-reviews/727-answer-to-job-revisited-jung-on-the-problem-of-evil&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] onto others. Jung interpreted the story of [[Jesus]] as an account of God facing his own shadow.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/dow/ Dreams of Wholeness]: A course of introductory lectures on religion, psychology and personal growth (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1997/2008), see especially Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the book may have had a sudden birth, its gestation period in Jung's unconscious was long. The subject of God, and what Jung saw as the dark side of God, was a lifelong preoccupation. An emotional and theoretical struggle with the core nature of deity is evident in Jung's earliest fantasies and dreams, as well as in his complex relationships with his father (a traditional minister), his mother (who had a strong spiritual-mystical dimension), and the Christian church itself. Jung's account of his childhood in his quasi-autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Vintage, 1963; henceforth MDR), provides deep, personal background about his early religious roots and conflicts.

=== Philip Zimbardo ===
In 2007, [[Philip Zimbardo]] suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a [[collective identity]]. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the [[Stanford prison experiment]], was published in the book ''The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucifereffect.com/ Book website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==

===Problem of evil and source===

Most monotheistic religions posit that the singular God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good.  The [[problem of evil]] asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved.  Scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). These religions tend to attribute the '''source of evil''' to something other than God, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.

Polytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. These include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds ([[karma]]), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.

Non-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by [[evolution]], and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply [[Naturalism (philosophy)|following physical laws]].

===Bahá'í Faith===
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coll |first='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Some answered questions|year=1982|publisher=Bahá'í Publ. Trust|location=Wilmette, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87743-162-6 |edition=Repr. |translator=Barney, Laura Clifford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, evil does not exist and is relative to man. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], son of the founder of the religion, in [[Some Answered Questions]] states:

"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind—that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves."&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

Thus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.&lt;ref name="Coll. 1982"/&gt;

===Ancient Egyptian Religion===
Evil in the religion of [[Ancient Egypt]] is known as [[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|Isfet]], "disorder/violence". It is the opposite of [[Maat]], "order", and embodied by the serpent god [[Apep]], who routinely attempts to kill the [[sun god]] [[Ra]] and is stopped by nearly every other deity. Isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by Apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from Ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[File:Extermination of Evil Tenkeisei crop.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Extermination of Evil]]'', The God of Heavenly Punishment, from the Chinese tradition of [[yin and yang]]. Late [[Heian period]] (12th-century Japan)]]
:''Main: [[Buddhism#Buddhist ethics|Buddhist Ethics]]''

The primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer from the general teachings of the Buddha that the [[Dukkha|catalogued causes]] of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HyPnrDiBM7cC&amp;pg=PA424 ''Philosophy of Religion''] Charles Taliaferro, Paul J. Griffiths, eds. Ch. 35, ''Buddhism and Evil'' Martin Southwold p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html ''Lay Outreach and the Meaning of 'Evil Person''' Taitetsu Unno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018093156/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/LayOutreachAndMeaningOfEvilPerson-Unno.html |date=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions—desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. See ''ten unvirtuous actions in Buddhism''. Specifically, ''evil'' means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).

"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil." Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563–483 BC.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, the concept of [[Dharma]] or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called [[Dharmayuddha]]. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]], speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Sikhism===
In adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. Once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings [[Guru Arjan]] explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Gopal|title=Sri guru-granth sahib [english version]|date=1967|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of "vices" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the [[Five Thieves]], called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Charan|title=Ethics and Business: Evidence from Sikh Religion|ssrn=2366249|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandhu|first1=Jaswinder|title=The Sikh Model of the Person, Suffering, and Healing: Implications for Counselors|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|date=February 2004|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moh]], or Attachment
* [[Lobh]], or Greed
* [[Krodh|Karodh]], or Wrath
* [[Kaam]], or Lust
* [[Hankaar|Ahankar]], or Egotism
One who gives in to the temptations of the [[Five Thieves]] is known as "[[Manmukh]]", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the "[[Gurmukh]], who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Arjan|title=The universal ideal of sikhism|journal=Global Dialogue|date=January 2000|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Selfless Service|Sewa]], or selfless service to others.
* [[Simran|Nam Simran]], or meditation upon the divine name.

===Islam===
{{see also|Islamic views on sin}}
There is no concept of absolute evil in [[Islam]], as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Quran mentions the [[biblical]] forbidden tree, it never refers to it as the '[[tree of knowledge of good and evil]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from [[God in Islam|God]], whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as ''evil'' or ''bad'' are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will. Much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey God's orders, harming others or putting themselves over God or others, is considered to be evil.&lt;ref&gt;B. Silverstein ''Islam and Modernity in Turkey'' Springer 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-230-11703-7}} p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;
Unproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Dammen McAuliffe ''Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān'' Brill 2001 {{ISBN|9789004147645}} p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical understanding of evil is reflected by [[Al-Ash`ari]] founder of [[Ashʿari|Asharism]]. Accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. An event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by God. Since God is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of God's power, God's will determine, whether or not something is evil.&lt;ref&gt;P. Koslowski ''The Origin and the Overcoming of Evil and Suffering in the World Religions'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media 2013 {{ISBN|978-9-401-59789-0}} page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{see also|Satan#Judaism|label 1=Satan in Judaism}}
In [[Judaism]], evil is not real, it is [[Per se (terminology)|per se]] not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. Human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the [[Free will in theology#Judaism|free will]] to choose good (life in [[Jewish eschatology#"The world to come"|olam haba]]) or bad (death in heaven). ([[Deuteronomy]] 28:20) Judaism stresses obedience to God's [[mitzvah|613 commandments]] of the [[Written Torah]] (see also [[Tanakh]]) and the [[Halakha|collective body of Jewish religious laws]] expounded in the [[Oral Torah]] and [[Shulchan Aruch]] (see also [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]]). In Judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], when Jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.

===Christianity===
{{see also|Devil#Christianity|label 1=Devil in Christianity}}
Evil according to a Christian worldview is any action, thought, or attitude that is contrary to the character or will of God. This is shown through the law given in both the Old and New Testament. There is no moral action given in the Bible that is contrary to God's character or God's will.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Therefore, evil in a Christian worldview is contrasted by and in conflict with God's character or God's will. This evil shows itself through deviation from the character or will of God.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - The Temptation of Christ (1854).jpg|thumb|left|The [[devil]], in opposition to the will of God, represents evil and tempts Christ, the personification of the character and will of God. [[Ary Scheffer]], 1854.]]

[[Christian theology]] draws its concept of evil from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. The [[Christian Bible]] exercises "the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world."&lt;ref&gt;David Ray Griffin, ''God, Power, and Evil: a Process Theodicy'' (Westminster, 1976/2004), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the [[fallen angel]]s [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]] &lt;ref&gt;Hans Schwarz, ''Evil: A Historical and Theological Perspective'' (Lima, Ohio: Academic Renewal Press, 2001): 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'' is used to indicate unsuitability, while ''kakos'' is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, ''Evil'', 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[theologian]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], who in ''Summa Theologica'' defines evil as the absence or privation of good.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province (New York: Benziger Brothers, 1947) Volume 3, q. 72, a. 1, p. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French-American]] theologian [[Henri Blocher]] describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an "unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that ''ought not to be''."&lt;ref&gt;Henri Blocher, ''Evil and the Cross'' (Downers Grove: [[InterVarsity Press]], 1994): 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mormonism]], mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See [[Agency (LDS Church)]]. Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.

[[Christian Science]] believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most ''evil'' person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Zoroastrianism===
In the originally [[Iranian religions|Persian]] religion of [[Zoroastrianism]], the world is a battleground between the god [[Ahura Mazda]] (also called [[Ormazd]]) and the malignant spirit [[Angra Mainyu]] (also called [[Ahriman]]). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a [[Last Judgment|day of Judgement]], in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, [[angels]] and [[saints]] are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.

==Question of a universal definition==
A fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. [[C. S. Lewis]], in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as [[rape]] and [[murder]]. The numerous instances in which rape or murder is morally affected by social context call this into question.  Up until the mid-19th century, the United States—along with many other countries—practiced forms of [[slavery]]. As is often the case, those transgressing moral boundaries stood to profit from that exercise. Arguably, slavery has always been the same and objectively evil, but men with a motivation to transgress will justify that action.

[[File:Don't Kid Yourself...it's Up to You. Stop Him^ - NARA - 534297.jpg|right|thumb|[[Adolf Hitler]] is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2045995,00.html | title=Top 25 Political Icons - Adolf Hitler | website=Time | date=February 4, 2011 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | author=Sanburn, Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler's policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about [[World War II casualties|50 million people in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Testa, David W; Lemoine, Florence; Strickland, John (2003).

Universalists consider evil independent of culture, and wholly related to acts or intents. Thus, while the ideological leaders of Nazism and the Hutu Interhamwe accepted (and considered it moral) to commit genocide, the belief in genocide as ''fundamentally'' or ''universally'' evil holds that those who instigated this genocide are actually evil. Hitler considered it a moral duty to destroy Jews because he saw them as the root of all of Germany's ills and the violence associated with communism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007822&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osama bin Laden]] found it moral to kill all Christians and Jews because he saw Islam as under attack by Western and US influence, accusing the US and Israel of forming a Crusader-Zionist alliance to destroy Islam, and considering US troops in Saudi Arabia infidels in the land of Islam's two holiest sites. He therefore considered non-Muslims and Shiite Muslims evil people intent on destroying Islamic purity and therefore heretic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/08/afghanistan.terrorism15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical questions==
===Approaches===
{{main article| Ethics}}
Views on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as [[ethics]] - which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:
&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Meta-ethics]], that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. 
# [[Normative ethics]], investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. 
# [[Applied ethics]], concerned with the analysis of particular moral issues in private and public life.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

===Usefulness as a term===
One school of thought that holds that no ''person'' is evil and that only ''acts'' may be properly considered evil. Psychologist and mediator [[Marshall Rosenberg]] claims that the root of violence is the very concept of ''evil'' or ''badness''. When we label someone as bad or evil, Rosenberg claims, it invokes the desire to punish or inflict pain. It also makes it easy for us to turn off our feelings towards the person we are harming. He cites the use of language in Nazi Germany as being a key to how the German people were able to do things to other human beings that they normally would not do. He links the concept of evil to our judicial system, which seeks to create justice via punishment—''punitive justice''—punishing acts that are seen as bad or wrong.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}He contrasts this approach with what he found in cultures{{which|date=August 2013}} where the idea of evil was non-existent. In such cultures{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} when someone harms another person, they are believed to be out of harmony with themselves and their community, are seen as sick or ill and measures are taken to restore them to a sense of harmonious relations with themselves and others.

Psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] agrees, in his school of psychology called [[Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy]], or REBT. He says the root of anger, and the desire to harm someone, is almost always related to variations of implicit or explicit philosophical beliefs about other human beings. He further claims that without holding variants of those covert or overt belief and assumptions, the tendency to resort to violence in most cases is less likely.

American psychiatrist [[M. Scott Peck]] on the other hand, describes evil as ''militant ignorance''.&lt;ref name="Liemult"&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1983, 1988). ''People of the Lie: The hope for healing human evil''. Century Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Judeo-Christian concept of ''[[sin]]'' is as a process that leads one to ''miss the mark'' and not achieve perfection. Peck argues that while most people are conscious of this at least on some level, those that are evil actively and militantly refuse this consciousness. Peck describes evil as a malignant type of self-righteousness which results in a projection of evil onto selected specific innocent victims (often children or other people in relatively powerless positions). Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in [[Psychopathy|sociopaths]].

[[File:Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Genghis Khan]] is considered by many people to be 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/05/07/9-lessons-on-leadership-from-genghis-khan-yes-genghis-khan/ 9 Lessons on Power and Leadership from Genghis Khan]". ''Forbes.'' 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for over 40 million deaths.]]
According to Peck, an evil person:&lt;ref name="Liemult"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, M. Scott. (1978, 1992), ''The Road Less Travelled''. Arrow.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Is consistently self-deceiving, with the intent of avoiding [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and maintaining a [[self-image]] of [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfection]]
* Deceives others as a consequence of their own self-deception
* [[Psychological projection|Psychologically projects]] his or her evils and sins onto very specific targets, [[scapegoating]] those targets while treating everyone else normally ("their insensitivity toward him was selective") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1983/1988, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonly hates with the pretense of love, for the purposes of self-deception as much as the deception of others
* Abuses political or emotional power ("the imposition of one's will upon others by overt or covert coercion") &lt;ref&gt;Peck, 1978/1992, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintains a high level of respectability and lies incessantly in order to do so
* Is consistent with his or her sins. Evil people are defined not so much by the magnitude of their sins, but by their consistency (of destructiveness)
* Is unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim
* Has a covert intolerance to [[criticism]] and other forms of [[narcissistic injury]]

He also considers certain institutions may be evil, as his discussion of the [[My Lai Massacre]] and its attempted coverup illustrate. By this definition, acts of [[terrorism|criminal]] and [[state terrorism]] would also be considered evil.

===Necessity===
{{Main|Necessary evil}}
[[File:Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther]] believed that occasional minor evil could have a positive effect]]
[[Martin Luther]] argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, "Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for [[the Devil]], so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''Werke'', XX, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

According to certain{{which|date=August 2013}} schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon practicality; this approach to politics was put forth by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], a 16th-century [[Florence, Italy|Florentine]] writer who advised politicians "...&amp;nbsp;it is far safer to be feared than loved."&lt;ref name = "erragh"&gt;Niccolo Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', Dante University of America Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-937832-38-3}} {{ISBN|978-0-937832-38-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international relations]] theories of [[Realism in international relations|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]], sometimes called ''[[realpolitik]]'' advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and [[Ethics|ethical]] considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly [[amorality|amoral]] and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by laying claim to a ''higher moral duty'' specific to political leaders, under which the greatest evil is seen to be the failure of the state to protect itself and its citizens. Machiavelli wrote: "...&amp;nbsp;there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the Prince."&lt;ref name = "erragh"/&gt;

[[Anton LaVey]], founder of the [[Church of Satan]], was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word ''evil'' is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called evil are really good.&lt;ref&gt;Anton LaVey, ''The Satanic Bible'', Avon, 1969, {{ISBN|0-380-01539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3242">In [[logic]], '''extensionality''', or '''extensional equality''', refers to principles that judge objects to be [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of [[intensionality]], which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.

==Example==

Consider the two functions ''f'' and ''g'' mapping from and to [[natural number]]s, defined as follows:
* To find ''f''(''n''), first add 5 to ''n'', then multiply by 2.
* To find ''g''(''n''), first multiply ''n'' by  2, then add 10. 

These functions are extensionally equal; given the same input, both functions always produce the same value. But the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same. 

Similarly, in natural language there are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical. For example, suppose that a town has one person named Joe, who is also the oldest person in the town. Then, the two argument predicates "has one person named", "is the oldest person in" are intensionally distinct, but extensionally equal for "Joe" in that "town" now.

==In mathematics==
The extensional definition of function equality, discussed above, is commonly used in mathematics. Sometimes additional information is attached to a function, such as an explicit [[codomain]], in which case two functions must not only agree on all values, but must also have the same codomain, in order to be equal. 

A similar extensional definition is usually employed for relations: two relations are said to be equal if they have the same [[Extension (predicate logic)|extensions]].

In set theory, the [[axiom of extensionality]] states that two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.  In mathematics formalized in set theory, it is common to identify relations&amp;mdash;and, most importantly, [[function (mathematics)|functions]]&amp;mdash;with their extension as stated above, so that it is impossible for two relations or functions with the same extension to be distinguished.

Other mathematical objects are also constructed in such a way that the intuitive notion of "equality" agrees with set-level extensional equality; thus, equal [[ordered pair]]s have equal elements, and elements of a set which are related by an [[equivalence relation]] belong to the same [[equivalence class]].

[[Type theory|Type-theoretical]] foundations of mathematics are generally ''not'' extensional in this sense, and [[setoid]]s are commonly used to maintain a difference between intensional equality and a more general equivalence relation (which generally has poor [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructibility]] or [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] properties).

'''Han Seung-oh''' ({{ko-hhrm|한승오|韓昇旿}}; born 1978) was a [[South Korea]]n human rights activist and civil activist. He was one of founding members of [[Man of Korea]] (남성연대) also 2nd leader of [[Man of Korea]], July 29, 2013 until August 14.

Han was born in Seoul. In 2008 he was a founding member of Man of Korea, also May 1, 2012, he was appointed to one Leader of General Affairs Team for [[Sung Jae-gi]]. On July 8 and July 22 he was Participation of Visit protest for [[Jecheon Women's Library]] with [[Sung Jae-gi]]. 8 month later, he was appointed to Secretary General of [[Man of Korea]].

In July 25, 2013, he was nominated as successor to [[Sung Jae-gi]], before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wstarnews.hankyung.com/apps/news?popup=0&amp;nid=01&amp;c1=01&amp;c2=01&amp;c3=00&amp;nkey=201307271400311&amp;mode=sub_view ‘투신’ 성재기, 실종 25시간 지나도록 생사 확인 안돼] 한국경제 2013.07.27 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 26, 2013 Han was one of visitors [[Sung Jae-gi]]'s suicide, but he was did not discourage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000661759.html ‘성재기 투신’ 사고사로 수사 종료···남성연대 대국민 사과] 민중의 소리 2013.07.30 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; after four days, Seoul city police investigated, with an innocent disposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=653152 경찰 "성재기 투신 지켜본 사람들…자살방조 아냐"] 매일경제 2013.07.30 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 26 to August 14, Han was Sung Jae-gi's funeral and case settled. but this did not rectify infighting so there was demand resignation from some member of [[Man of Korea]]. On August 21 2013, he resigned.

A '''hidden message''' is information that is not immediately noticeable, and that must be discovered or uncovered and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include backwards audio messages, hidden visual messages and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] codes such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. Although there are many legitimate examples of hidden messages created with techniques such as [[backmasking]] and [[steganography]], many so-called hidden messages are merely [[Pareidolia|fanciful imaginings]] or [[apophany]].

== Description ==
The information in hidden messages is not immediately noticeable; it must be discovered or uncovered, and interpreted before it can be known. Hidden messages include [[Backmasking|backwards audio messages]], hidden visual messages, and [[symbol]]ic or [[:wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] [[code]]s such as a [[Cryptic crossword|crossword]] or [[Encryption|cipher]]. There are many legitimate examples of hidden messages, though many are imaginings.

== Backward audio messages ==
A backward message in an audio recording is only fully apparent when the recording is played reversed. Some backward messages are produced by deliberate [[backmasking]], while others are simply [[phonetic reversal]]s resulting from random combinations of words. Backward messages may occur in various mediums, including music, [[video game]]s, [[music video]]s, [[movies]], and [[television show]]s.

=== Backmasking ===
{{Main|Backmasking}}
Backmasking is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards. It was popularized by [[The Beatles]], who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]].'' The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1980s, when allegations of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent [[rock music]]ians, leading to [[Book burning|record-burnings]] and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments. In debate are both the existence of backmasked Satanic messages and their purported ability to subliminally affect listeners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Phonetic reversal ===
{{Main|Phonetic reversal}}

Certain phrases produce a different phrase when their [[phoneme]]s are reversed—a process known as phonetic reversal. For example, "Kiss" backwards sounds like "sick", and so the title of [[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Kiss Kiss Kiss (Yoko Ono song)|Kiss Kiss Kiss]]" sounds like "Sick Sick Sick" or "Six Six Six" backwards. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; backwards was claimed that the chorus, when played in reverse, can be heard as "It's fun to smoke marijuana"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first1= N. |last1= Epley |first2= B. |last2= Keysar |first3= L. |last3= Van Boven |first4= T. |last4= Gilovich |title= Perspective Taking as Egocentric Anchoring and Adjustment |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 87 |issue= 3 |pages= 327–339 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15382983 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/its_fun_to_smoke_dust_satanic_panic_preacher_gets_mashed-up_with_queen|title= It's Fun To Smoke Dust!

According to proponents of [[reverse speech]], phonetic reversal occurs unknowingly during normal speech.

== Visual messages ==
Hidden messages can be created in visual mediums with techniques such as [[hidden text]] and [[steganography]].

In the 1980s, Coca-Cola released in South Australia an advertising poster featuring the reintroduced contour bottle, with a speech bubble, "Feel the Curves!!" An image hidden inside one of the ice cubes was controversial.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/poster.asp|title=Risque Coca-Cola Poster|publisher=Snopes|date=14 May 2011|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of posters were distributed to hotels and bottle shops in Australia before the mistake was discovered by Coca-Cola management. The artist of the poster was fired and all the posters were recalled.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

Various other messages have been claimed to exist in Disney movies, some of them risque, such as the well-known allegation of an erection showing on a priest in ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Disney (Disney Films)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Snopes website, however, only one image "is clearly true [and] undeniably purposely inserted into the movie": images of a topless woman in two frames of ''[[The Rescuers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/rescuers.htm 'The Rescuers' Topless Scene : snopes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) had an antipathy towards [[PETCO]], a pet food retailer in San Diego, regarding the purported mistreatment of live animals at their stores. When the [[San Diego Padres]] baseball team announced that the retailer had purchased [[naming rights]] to [[Petco Park]] stadium, PETA was unable to persuade the sports team to terminate the agreement. Later, PETA successfully purchased a commemorative display brick with what appears to be a complimentary message: "Break Open Your Cold Ones! Toast The Padres! Enjoy This Championship Organization!" However, if one takes the first letters of each word, the resulting [[acrostic]] reads "BOYCOTT PETCO". Neither PETCO nor the Padres have taken any action to remove the brick, stating that if someone walked by, they would not know it had anything to do with the PETA/PETCO feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1783769 Rovell, Darren "Secret Message Makes it Into New Park" ESPN.com 4/16/2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[justice]] and [[law]], '''house arrest''' (also called '''home confinement''', '''home detention''', or, in modern times, '''electronic monitoring''') is a measure by which a person is confined by the authorities to their [[House|residence]]. Only those with a house are allowed to be sentenced to arrest in their residence. [[Travel]] is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a [[prison]] while pre-trial or sentenced.

While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by [[authoritarian]] governments against political [[dissident]]s. In that case, typically, the person under house arrest does not have access to any [[telephone|means of communication]]. If electronic communication is allowed, conversations will most likely be monitored. With some electronic monitoring units, the conversations of prisoners can be directly monitored via the unit itself.

==History==
Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. [[Galileo]] was confined to his home following his [[Galileo affair|infamous trial]] in 1633. Political authorities have often confined leaders to house arrest who were deposed in a coup d'état, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals.

This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities.  Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an [[electronic bracelet]] was in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2209984/ |work=Slate Magazine |title=You're Grounded! How do you qualify for house arrest? |author=Juliet Lapidos |date=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Home detention is an alternative to [[Incarceration|imprisonment]]; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levinson, David. (2002). ''Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment: Volumes I-IV.'' SAGE Publications. p. 859. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2258-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending.

The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the [[probation officer]] or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Spohn, Cassia. (2008). ''How Do Judges Decide?: The Search for Fairness and Justice in Punishment.'' SAGE Publications Inc. p. 52. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6104-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/strauss-kahn-granted-bail-pending-trial-in-hotel-maid-sexual-assault-case.html|title=Strauss-Kahn May Have Spent Last Night in Jail After Bail|author=Karen Freifeld, Chris Dolmetsch and Don Jeffrey|date=20 May 2011|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Mele, Christopher. (2005). ''Civil Penalties, Social Consequences.'' Routledge. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-415-94823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A [[curfew]] may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. "Home confinement" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is "home incarceration", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day/7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments.&lt;ref name=lev/&gt;

In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[Lawyer|legal representation]], and subject to restrictions on their associates.&lt;ref&gt;Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). ''Social Cohesion in Australia.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-521-70943-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's [[human rights|human right]] to a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4715478.stm "Q&amp;A: Terrorism laws"]. BBC News Online. July 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent.

==Using technology for enforcement==
In some countries, house arrest is often enforced through the use of technology products or services.  One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an [[ankle monitor]], also referred to as a [[tether]]). The electronic sensor transmits a [[GPS]] signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service.

If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal.  The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment.

Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The  respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern.

[[Electronic tagging|Electronic monitoring]] is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.

===Italy===
In Italy, house arrest (in Italian ''arresti domiciliari'') is a common practice of [[Remand (detention)|detaining suspects]], as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is ''[[de facto]]'' considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of [[Prison escape|escape]] within the previous five years.

Notable cases:
* [[Erich Priebke]], former [[SS]] captain, condemned for war crimes ([[Ardeatine massacre]] in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100).
* [[Adriano Sofri]], journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012.
* [[Silvia Baraldini]], activist of [[Black Liberation Army]] in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist [[Assata Shakur]], and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons.
* Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of [[Marta Russo]], spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service.

===New Zealand===
At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer.

Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the [[New Zealand Department of Corrections]] to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. {{as of|2015}} over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance.

*[[Phil Rudd]], two-time drummer with Australian rock legends [[AC/DC]], was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in [[Tauranga]] for charges relating to [[methamphetamine]] possession and making [[death threats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/acdcs-phil-rudd-sentenced-to-house-detention-for-eight-months-201597|title=AC/DC's Phil Rudd Sentenced to House Detention for Eight Months|work=Us Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How Rude!''''' is an American series of comic [[manners]] books for [[teens]] written by educator and psychologist Alex J. Packer, PhD.

==Titles==
Titles include:
* ''How Rude!: The Teenagers' Guide to Good Manners, Proper Behavior and Not Grossing People Out''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of School Manners for Teens''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of Family Manners for Teens''
* ''The How Rude! Handbook of Friendship and Dating Manners for Teens''

==Contents==
In 465 pages, ''How Rude!: The Teenagers' Guide to Good Manners, Proper Behavior and Not Grossing People Out'' covers most aspects of life that teens are likely to encounter. The text is broken up into short, "bite-sized" chunks for easy reading.

According to Packer, "Good manners are good for you. They impress people. They build self-esteem. They can help you get what you want from life: friends, fun, success and respect. ''And they don't cost anything''." Seeking to avoid the stereotype of [[etiquette]] books as preachy and dull, ''How Rude!'' keeps teenage readers amused as they learn the basics of polite behavior in all kinds of situations: at home, at school, in public, with friends, with strangers, at the mall, at the movies, on the phone, online, in conversations, at job interviews, in restaurants, on elevators, in cars, on skateboards, at parties, at formal dinners, on the bus and anywhere they go.

Young readers find out how to cope with cliques, handle friendship problems, be a host with the most (and a guest with the best), offer someone their seat, fight fair, answer invitations, deal with rude adults, respond to bigoted remarks, write a letter, dress properly for any occasion, master the proper techniques for civilized spitting, scratching, sneezing, yawning, coughing, hiccuping, nose-picking and much more.

Hundreds of "Dear Alex" questions and answers cover everything from dating to breaking up, thank-you notes to table manners, ethnic jokes to obscene phone calls, skiing to driving. "True Stories from the Manners Frontier" divulge the shocking consequences of ''not'' having good manners. Survey results reveal what teens, parents and teachers think about manners and why they are important.

==Reception==
''How Rude!'' was selected by [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] (YALSA) as a "Popular Paperback for Young Adults" and a "Quick Pick for Reluctant Young Adult Readers."

''[[Voice of Youth Advocates]]'' called ''How Rude!'' "the most incredibly readable, enjoyable, laughable, enlightening and insightful book." ''College Bound'' magazine described ''How Rude!'' as "...one fast-paced, fun-to-read book that covers the basics of good behavior for teens... Just one look at the table of contents will convince you that this isn't your grandma's guidebook. This is a wonderfully hip and humorous easy read!"

''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote, "From its intriguing title to the tongue-in-cheek ideas for dealing with many kinds of situations, readers will find this manual humorous, non-threatening, entertaining and educational."

==Author==
Packer is an author of many books on parenting. He is President Emeritus of FCD Educational Services, which provides [[drug education]] to colleges and schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen R. Delisio, "[http://www.education-world.com/a_issues/chat/chat139.shtml Teaching Manners in a Manner-less World]", ''Education World'', July 4, 2005. Accessed October 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books by Packer include: ''Wise Highs!: How to Thrill, Chill and Get Away from It All Without Alcohol or Other Drugs''; ''Parenting One Day at a Time''; ''Bringing Up Parents: The Teenager's Handbook''; ''365 Ways to Love Your Child''; and with co-author John Dacey, Ph.D., ''The Nurturing Parent: How to Rasie Creative, Loving, Responsible Children''. Packer's books have been translated into many languages including Spanish, German, Serbian, Mandarin, Romanian, Greek, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">{{Other uses|identity (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]], '''identity''', from {{Lang-la|[[wiktionary:identitas|identitas]]}} ("sameness"), is the relation each thing bears only to itself.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/ Identity], First published Wed Dec 15, 2004; substantive revision Sun Oct 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd Edition, CUP: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of identity gives rise to [[List of unsolved problems in philosophy|many philosophical problems]], including the [[identity of indiscernibles]] (if ''x'' and ''y'' share all their properties, are they one and the same thing?), and questions about change and [[personal identity]] over time (what has to be the case for a person ''x'' at one time and a person ''y'' at a later time to be one and the same person?).

The philosophical concept of identity is distinct from the more well-known notion of identity in use in [[psychology]] and the [[social science]]s. The philosophical concept concerns a [[relation (logic)|''relation'']], specifically, a relation that ''x'' and ''y'' stand in [[if and only if|if, and only if]] they are one and the same thing, or ''identical to'' each other (i.e. if, and only if ''x'' = ''y'').  The [[identity (social science)|sociological notion of identity]], by contrast, has to do with a person's self-conception, social presentation, and more generally, the aspects of a person that make them unique, or qualitatively different from others (e.g. [[cultural identity]], [[gender identity]], [[national identity]], [[online identity]] and processes of [[identity formation]]).

==Metaphysics of identity==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Don Quixote]] --&gt;
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
Metaphysicians, and sometimes philosophers of language and mind, ask other questions:
* What does it mean for an object to be the same as itself?
* If x and y are identical (are the same thing), must they always be identical? Are they ''necessarily'' identical?
* What does it mean for an object to be the same, if it changes over time? (Is apple&lt;SUB&gt;''t''&lt;/SUB&gt; the same as apple&lt;SUB&gt;''t''+1&lt;/SUB&gt;?)
* If an object's parts are entirely replaced over time, as in the [[Ship of Theseus]] example, in what way is it the same?
The [[law of identity]] originates from [[classical antiquity]]. The modern formulation of identity is that of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who held that ''x'' is the same as ''y'' [[if and only if]] every [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] true of ''x'' is true of ''y'' as well.

Leibniz's ideas have taken root in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], where they have influenced the development of the [[predicate calculus]] as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's law]]. Mathematicians sometimes distinguish identity from [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. More mundanely, an ''identity'' in [[mathematics]] may be an ''[[equation]]'' that holds true for all values of a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. [[Hegel]] argued that things are inherently self-contradictory{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and that the notion of something being self-identical only made sense if it were not also not-identical or different from itself and did not also imply the latter. In [[Hegel]]'s words, "Identity is the identity of identity and non-identity." More recent metaphysicians have discussed [[trans-world identity]]—the notion that there can be the same object in different possible worlds. An alternative to trans-world identity is the counterpart relation in [[Counterpart theory]]. It is a similarity relation that rejects trans-world individuals and instead defends an objects counterpart - the most similar object.

Some philosophers have denied that there is such a relation as identity. Thus [[Wittgenstein|Ludwig Wittgenstein]] writes (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' 5.5301): "That identity is not a relation between objects is obvious." At 5.5303 he elaborates: "Roughly speaking: to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing." [[Bertrand Russell]] had earlier voiced a worry that seems to be motivating Wittgenstein's point (''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' §64): "[I]dentity, an objector may urge, cannot be anything at all: two terms plainly are not identical, and one term cannot be, for what is it identical with?" Even before Russell, [[Frege|Gottlob Frege]], at the beginning of "[[On Sense and Reference]]," expressed a worry with regard to identity as a relation: "Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation?" More recently, [[C. J. F. Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;C.J.F. Williams, ''What is identity?'', Oxford University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that identity should be viewed as a second-order relation, rather than a relation between objects, and [[Kai Wehmeier]]&lt;ref&gt;Kai F. Wehmeier, "How to live without identity—and why," ''Australasian Journal of Philosophy'' 90:4, 2012, pp. 761–777.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that appealing to a binary relation that every object bears to itself, and to no others, is both logically unnecessary and metaphysically suspect.

'''Identity-based motivation theory (IBM)''' is a [[Social psychology|social psychological theory]] of human motivation and goal pursuit, which explains when and in which situations people’s identities or self-concepts will motivate them to take action towards their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D. (2015). Pathways to Success Through Identity-Based Motivation. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM predicts that the motivational power of our identities depends on which identities come to mind and what they are taken to mean in a given moment (termed “dynamic construction”), whether or not those identities feel like they fit with the current situation (termed “action-readiness”), and how experienced difficulties are interpreted (termed “interpretation of difficulty”).

People interpret situations and experienced difficulties in ways that are consistent with whichever identities are currently on their minds, and prefer to act in ways that are identity-consistent rather than identity-inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D., Fryberg, S. A., &amp; Yoder, N. (2007). Identity-based motivation and health. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, 1011-1027.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D. (2015). Pathways to Success Through Identity-Based Motivation. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When actions feel identity-consistent, difficulties that come up tend to be interpreted as important, suggesting actions are meaningful. On the other hand, when actions feel identity-inconsistent, the same difficulties suggest the behavior is pointless and “not for people like me.”

The IBM model was developed by [[University of Southern California]] Professor [[Daphna Oyserman]], and has been used as a foundation for a variety of aspiration-achievement gap interventions in schools,&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D. Bybee, D., &amp; Terry, K. (2006). Possible selves and academic outcomes: How and when possible selves impel action.

==Early inspiration for IBM – Devil's Night in Detroit==
Devil's Night in [[Detroit]], the eve before Halloween when youths traditionally tear up the town, got Oyserman, thinking about the role of identities in how we make decisions.

Oyserman had just arrived in nearby Ann Arbor for her doctoral studies at the University of Michigan. In quainter times, Devil’s Night tricks involved egging windows and toilet-papering trees. But by then – 1983 – pranks had escalated to fire-setting in parts of the city.

“I wondered what the youths who were setting fires were imagining about their futures,” Oyserman wrote in the author’s note of her book Pathways to Success Through Identity-Based Motivation. “Surely they were not thinking something along the lines of ‘I will set a fire and this may ruin my life if I get caught in a felony and am jailed’ or ‘I will set a fire and someone might die in this fire; it will be on my conscience and forever change the person I become.’”

On the other hand, she wondered about the ones who did not partake. “Perhaps they had a particular way of imagining possibilities for their future selves that highlighted the risks of participating in Devil’s Night.”

This experience led Oyserman to pursue decades of research that manifested into the current theory of identity-based motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, P. J. (2015, March 4). When I Grow Up, I will be…:Dean’s Professor of Psychology Daphna Oyserman’s new book explains why young children’s imagine futures matter for current action. University of Southern California News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original studies==
In a first test of the IBM process model, low-income racial-ethnic minority middle school students were randomly assigned to either attend school as usual or to an identity-based motivation intervention in an in-school randomized trial.&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D. Bybee, D., &amp; Terry, K. (2006). Possible selves and academic outcomes: How and when possible selves impel action. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 91, 188-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Intervention students participated in small group activities in which they were asked to think about the type of student they would like to be (“academic possible identities”), think about how who they were was connected to who they wanted to be the next year and when they were adults, and were guided to interpret experienced difficulties in school as signs that school is important. Students in the control group went to school as usual and experienced the usual difficulties with schoolwork without a structured interpretation.

Prior to the intervention, there were no differences between the two groups of students in terms of school grades, attendance, amount of time spent on homework, in-class behavior, or the aspirations students had. The intervention involved 12 bi-weekly in-class sessions completed before the end of the first marking period of 8th grade.

Compared to students in the control group, students in the intervention group had improved grades, spent more time on their homework, and had better attendance and standardized test scores.

==Further empirical studies==
Follow up experiments demonstrated that results generalized to the broader population. Results have been replicated and extended with students ranging from elementary school to universities.

In addition to results in the education domain, IBM has also been shown to improve motivation and goal pursuit outcomes in health &lt;ref&gt;(Oyserman, D., Fryberg, S. A., &amp; Yoder, N. (2007). Identity-based motivation and health. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93(6), 1011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oyserman, D., Smith, G. C., &amp; Elmore, K. (2014). Identity‐Based Motivation: Implications for Health and Health Disparities. Journal of Social Issues, 70(2), 206-225.&lt;/ref&gt; – nudging people to engage in healthier behaviors, planning – reducing people’s tendency to procrastinate, and savings – increasing the amount people plan to save for long term goals such as their child’s college education or their own retirement &lt;ref&gt;Lewis, N. A., Jr., &amp; Oyserman, D. (2015) When Does the Future Begin? Time Metrics Matter, Connecting Present and Future Selves. Psychological Science, 26, 816-825.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khazan, O. (2015, May 12). The Mechanics of Preventing Procrastination. The Atlantic&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBM interventions==
Identity-based motivation has been used as a foundation for school interventions (and tests of those interventions) in public schools in Detroit, Chicago, and other locations in the U.S. as well as internationally in Singapore and England.

==Mechanisms==
The IBM model assumes that identity is multifaceted, and which identities come to mind and what they are taken to mean depends on the situation in which one finds themselves (see Figure below from Oyserman, Lewis, Yan, Fisher, O'Donnell, &amp; Horowitz, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oyserman|first1=Daphna|last2=Lewis|first2=Neil A.|last3=Yan|first3=Veronica X.|last4=Fisher|first4=Oliver|last5=O'Donnell|first5=S. Casey|last6=Horowitz|first6=Eric|date=18 August 2017|title=An Identity-Based Motivation Framework for Self-Regulation|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=28|issue=2-3|pages=139–147|doi=10.1080/1047840X.2017.1337406}}&lt;/ref&gt; People interpret situations in ways that are consistent with whichever identity is currently on their mind, and prefer to act in ways that are identity-consistent .

One way this manifests in the education domain for example, is that students are more likely to take steps toward a future self goal (e.g. college) when this identity comes to mind and feels connected with their current self. This feeling of connectedness can set students on a path towards their future goals, and can shape how they interpret difficulty along the way.

Two interpretations of difficulty are possible. The first way to interpret experienced difficulty is that it reflects the importance of a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case suggests that although the path may be difficult, it is worth it, as articulated in the saying “no pain, no gain.” The second way to interpret experienced difficulty is that it reflects the possibility of failing in a task or of attaining a goal. Experienced difficulty in this case reflects that the goal is unlikely or even impossible. The same objective experience of difficulty can be interpreted either way depending on which cues are available in the particular moment and what the identities currently on one’s mind seem to mean for action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">The '''International Tribunal on Crimes against Women''' was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p148&lt;/ref&gt; The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

==History==
[[Diana E. H. Russell]] and Nicole Van Den Ven, the main organizers of the tribunal,&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. ''Rape as a War Crime: Reaching Moral Clarity'', ''On the Issues'', May 1996, p14&lt;/ref&gt; were inspired by [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[International War Crimes Tribunal]], a people's tribunal on crimes committed in the [[Vietnam War]].

==Content==
The ITCW  was attended by over 2000 women from 40 countries, and specific topics include medical and economic crimes, [[rape]], [[political prisoner]]s, crimes against [[lesbians]], [[spousal abuse]], [[prostitution]], [[pornography]] and [[femicide]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"/&gt;

Numerous testimonies were provided in writing by women who were unable to attend the tribunal.&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

Attendee Frances Doughty noted that the Tribunal confirmed for her that "the oppression of women in general and of lesbians in particular is truly worldwide"&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p149&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian poet [[Pat Parker]] was among the contributors of testimony, speaking about her eldest sister, who was murdered by her husband.&lt;ref name="ilene-alexander"&gt;[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Bios/entries/parker_pat.html Alexander, Ilene 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march took place as a candlelight procession in association with the Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dso.uncc.edu/women/TBN_Web/history.html Take Back the Night History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Organizers Russell and Van Den Ven published a book based on the Tribunal, ''Crimes Against Women: Proceedings of the International Tribunal'' later in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianarussell.com/publications.html#CRIMESAGAINSTWOMEN dianarussell.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Krogh model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|scientific model]] in the area [[mass transfer]] explaining concentration of [[oxygen|molecular oxygen]] through a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] as a function of a changing position over the capillary tube's length. It was first conceptualized by [[August Krogh]] in 1919 to describe oxygen supply in living tissues, particularly the one occurring in human [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wei|Anderson|1995|p=176.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its applicability has been extended to various academic fields, and has been successful explaining drug diffusion, water transport, and ice formation in tissues.&lt;ref name="Biomed Experts"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Axial oxygen diffusion in the Krogh model: modifications to account for myocardial oxygen tension in isolated perfused rat hearts measured by EPR oximetry.| pmid=16594144 | doi=10.1007/0-387-26206-7_18 | volume=566| journal=Adv Exp Med Biol| pages=127-34 | last1 = Grinberg | first1 = O | last2 = Novozhilov | first2 = B | last3 = Grinberg | first3 = S | last4 = Friedman | first4 = B | last5 = Swartz | first5 = HM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical modeling==
Krogh model is derived by applying [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and the [[Conservation of mass|law of conservation of mass]] over a radial [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;Rc \le r \le Rt&lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations==
Although Krogh model is a good approximation, it underestimates oxygen consumption&lt;ref name="Biomed Experts" /&gt; because the cylinder model does not include all the tissue surrounding the capillary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Truskey|Fan|Katz|2009|p=643.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Luther King Jr. Day''' (officially '''Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/#url=2013 |title=Federal Holidays |publisher=Opm.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Federal holidays in the United States|American federal holiday]] marking the birthday of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around King's birthday, January 15. The holiday is similar to holidays set under the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]]. The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21.

King was the chief spokesperson for [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|his assassination]] in 1968. President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.

The idea of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by [[trade union|labor unions]] in contract negotiations.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=William P. |date=January 30, 2006 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLFgB58?url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |title=Working-Class Hero |work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After King's death, [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] [[John Conyers]] (a Democrat from [[Michigan]]) and [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Edward Brooke]] (a Republican from [[Massachusetts]]) introduced a bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979. However, it fell five votes short of the number needed for passage.&lt;ref name="Wolfen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfensberger |first=Don |date=January 14, 2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLjow8L?url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |title=The Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday: The Long Struggle in Congress, An Introductory Essay |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive, and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition (King had never held public office).&lt;ref name="Wolfen" /&gt; Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them: [[George Washington]] and [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;!-- Please do not change this sentence. The *national* holiday is Washington's Birthday, not President's Day (which is the name of a state holiday in many states). --&gt;

Soon after, the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site|King Center]] turned to support from the corporate community and the general public. The success of this strategy was cemented when musician [[Stevie Wonder]] released the single "[[Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder song)|Happy Birthday]]" to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. Six million signatures were collected for a petition to Congress to pass the law, termed by a 2006 article in ''[[The Nation]]'' as "the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

Senators [[Jesse Helms]] and [[John Porter East]] (both [[North Carolina]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s) led opposition to the holiday and questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor. Helms criticized King's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and accused him of espousing "action-oriented [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="dewar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewar |first=Helen |date=October 4, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnjqzpMi?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |title=Helms Stalls King's Day in Senate |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A01 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helms led a filibuster against the bill and on October 3, 1983, submitted a 300-page document to the Senate alleging that King had associations with [[Communism|communists]]. New York Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] declared the document a "packet of filth", threw it on the Senate floor and stomped on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Frances|title=A Brief History of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872501,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtwright|first=David T.|title=No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-04677-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J5Vb52f6rOIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=moynihan+%22packet+of+filth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=moynihan%20%22packet%20of%20filth%22&amp;f=false|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] originally opposed the holiday, citing cost concerns. When asked to comment on Helms' accusations that King was a communist, the president said "We'll know in thirty-five years, won't we?", in reference to the eventual release of [[FBI]] surveillance tapes that had previously been [[record sealing|sealed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Younge|first1=Gary|title=The Misremembering of 'I Have a Dream'|journal=The Nation|date=September 2–9, 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/175764/misremembering-i-have-dream#|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on November 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill, proposed by [[Katie Hall (politician)|Representative Katie Hall]] of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King.&lt;ref name="reagan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=November 2, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnN6qLAO?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks on Signing the Bill Making the Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., a National Holiday |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|98|399|98|1475|1983|11|02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had passed the House of Representatives by a count of 338 to 90, a veto-proof margin.&lt;ref name="dewar"/&gt; The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.

The bill also established the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to oversee observance of the holiday, and [[Coretta Scott King]], King's wife, was made a member of this commission for life by [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]] in May 1989.&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=May 17, 1989 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnNNh4n5?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |title=George Bush: Remarks on Signing the Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday Commission Extension Act |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|101|30|103|60|1989|05|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level passage==
Although the federal holiday honoring King was signed into law in 1983 and took effect three years later, not every U.S. state chose to observe the holiday at the state level until 1991, when the [[New Hampshire]] legislature created "Civil Rights Day" and abolished "[[Fast Day]]".&lt;ref name="nhgov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbreth |first=Donna |year=1997 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnmmR8yQ?url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |title=Rise and Fall of Fast Day |publisher=New Hampshire State Library |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Utah]] became the last state to have a holiday named after King when "Human Rights Day" was officially changed to "Martin Luther King Jr. Day."&lt;ref name="newcrisis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petrie|first=Phil W.|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3783538/mlk-holiday-branches-work-make-work|title=The MLK holiday: Branches work to make it work|date=May–June 2000|work=[[The New Crisis]]|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Arizona [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Bruce Babbitt]], a Democrat, created a paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by executive order just before he left office, but in 1987, his Republican successor [[Evan Mecham]], citing an attorney general's opinion that Babbitt's order was illegal, reversed Babbitt's decision days after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ye Hee Lee|first=Michelle|title=Recalling Arizona's struggle for MLK holiday|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120112martin-luther-king-holiday-dilemma.html#ixzz2IYEyGRdg|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be "Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day" in Arizona, albeit as an unpaid holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Day in United States|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/civil-rights-day|website=timeanddate.com|publisher=Time and Date AS|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Arizona voters were given the opportunity to vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday. That same year, the [[National Football League]] threatened to move [[Super Bowl XXVII]], which was planned for Arizona in 1993, if the MLK holiday was voted down.&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/101611_az_mlk_dedication/arizonans-recall-fight-state-mlk-holiday |title=tucsonsentinel.com |publisher=tucsonsentinel.com |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November election, the voters were offered two King Day options: Proposition 301, which replaced [[Columbus Day]] on the list of paid state holidays, and Proposition 302, which merged [[Lincoln's Birthday|Lincoln's]] and [[Washington's Birthday|Washington's]] birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day. Both measures failed to pass, with only 49% of voters approving Prop 302, the more popular of the two options; although some who voted "no" on 302 voted "yes" on Prop 301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shumway|first1=Jim|title=STATE OF ARIZONA OFFICIAL CANVASS – GENERAL ELECTION – November 6, 1990|url=http://azsos.gov/sites/azsos.gov/files/canvass1990ge.pdf|website=Arizona Secretary of State ~ Home Page|publisher=Arizona Secretary of State|accessdate=April 11, 2015|page=12|format=PDF|date=November 26, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII, which was subsequently held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"/&gt; In a 1992 referendum, the voters, this time given only one option for a paid King Day, approved state-level recognition of the holiday.&lt;ref name="Reingold2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reingold|first=Beth|title=Representing Women: Sex, Gender, and Legislative Behavior in Arizona and California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENZoKQzCsk0C&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=May 4, 2014|year=2000|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807848500|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2000, South Carolina governor [[Jim Hodges]] signed a bill to make King's birthday an official state holiday. South Carolina was the last state to recognize the day as a paid holiday for all state employees. Prior to this, employees could choose between celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three [[Confederate holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/mlkhistory1.html The History of Martin Luther King Day], Infoplease&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
While all states now observe the holiday, some did not name the day after King. For example, in New Hampshire, the holiday was known as "Civil Rights Day" until 1999, when the State Legislature voted to change the name of the holiday to Martin Luther King Day.&lt;ref name="nyt99"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |date=May 26, 1999 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnlpRF0r?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |title=Contrarian New Hampshire To Honor Dr. King, at Last |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several additional states have chosen to combine commemorations of King's birthday with other observances:
*In [[Alabama]]: "[[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee]]/Martin Luther King Birthday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Alabama.gov|url=http://inform.alabama.gov/calendar.aspx|title=Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Virginia]]: it was known as [[Lee–Jackson–King Day]], combining King's birthday with the established [[Lee–Jackson Day]].&lt;ref name="newcrisis"/&gt;  In 2000, Lee–Jackson Day was moved to the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday in its own right.&lt;ref name="lege"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duran |first=April |date=April 10, 2000 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/mac/cns/on-the-lege-2000/holiday.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnrGdKpp?url=http://www.has.vcu.edu/mac/cns/on-the-lege-2000/holiday.htm |title=Virginia creates holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. |newspaper=On The Lege |publisher=[[Virginia Commonwealth University]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Arkansas]]: it was known as "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday and [[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee's Birthday]]" from 1985 to 2017. Legislation in March 2017 changed the name of the state holiday to "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday" and moved the commemoration of Lee to October.

==Workplace observance==
[[File:MLK Day March (Eugene, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A Martin Luther King Day march in Oregon]]

Overall, in 2007, 33% of employers gave employees the day off, a 2% increase over the previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers.&lt;ref name="bna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cody |first=Karen James |date=January 9, 2007 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnn7LcRx?url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |title=More Employers Plan to Observe Martin Luther King Day |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence just two weeks after the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. The observance of MLK Day has led to some colleges and universities extending their Christmas break to include the day as part of break. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a [[Long weekend|floating or movable holiday]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==King Day of Service==
[[File:MLK service obama.JPG|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] serving lunch at a Washington soup kitchen on MLK Jr. Day, 2010]]

The national Martin Luther King Day of Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nationalservice.gov/mlkday | title = Volunteer opportunities and resources for organizing an MLK Day of Service event | website = Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service homepage | publisher = Corporation for National and Community Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started by former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator [[Harris Wofford]] and Atlanta Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], who co-authored the King Holiday and Service Act. The federal legislation challenges Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service in honor of King. The federal legislation was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] on August 23, 1994. Since 1996, Wofford's former state office director, [[Todd Bernstein]], has been directing the annual Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/|title=Greater Philadelphia Martin Luther King Day of Service|publisher=Global Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest event in the nation honoring King.&lt;ref name="slt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Doug |date=January 16, 2011 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnstgaHT?url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |title=MLK events in Missouri form man's legacy |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other universities and organizations around the U.S., such as [[Arizona State University]], Greater DC Cares and [[City Year]], participate in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service.  In honor of MLK, hundreds of Volunteer Centers, and volunteers across the country donate their time to make a difference on this day.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The only other official national day of service in the U.S., as designated by the government, is [[September 11 National Day of Service]] (9/11 Day).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Outside the United States==
One place outside the U.S. where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed in the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] under mayor [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], who holds a special banquet at the mayor's office as an act of unifying his city's call for peace with King's message of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/heiwa/martin.html|title=Mayor's Speech at U.S. Conference of Mayors' Luncheon in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.|website=www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of Toronto]], in Ontario, Canada, is another city that has officially recognized Martin Luther King Jr. Day, although not as a paid holiday: all government services and businesses remain open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=David |authorlink=David Miller (Canadian politician) |year=2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnpGaDSS?url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |title=City of Toronto Proclamation |publisher=[[City of Toronto]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, during a visit by the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]], [[Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy chaplain]] Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] conducted the first Israeli presidential ceremony in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, held in the [[Beit HaNassi|President's Residence]], Jerusalem. [[Aura Herzog]], wife of Israel's then-President [[Chaim Herzog]], noted that she was especially proud to host this special event, because Israel had a national forest in honor of King, and that Israel and King shared the idea of "dreams".&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Week &amp; The American Examiner'', pg 37, February 3, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Resnicoff continued this theme in his remarks during the ceremony, quoting the verse from Genesis, spoken by the brothers of Joseph when they saw their brother approach, "Behold the dreamer comes; let us slay him and throw him into the pit, and see what becomes of his dreams." Resnicoff noted that, from time immemorial, there have been those who thought they could kill the dream by slaying the dreamer, but – as the example of King's life shows – such people are always wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Veterans History Project Oral History, Arnold Resnicoff, May 2010.

Every year, since 1986, the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner is held in Wassenaar, The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nl.usembassy.gov/martin-luther-king-jr-tribute-dinner/|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. Tribute Dinner|last=|first=|date=2017-01-30|website=U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in the Netherlands|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribute includes young people and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement as well as music.  it always ends with everyone holding hands in a circle and singing "We Shall Overcome." The Tribute is held on the last Sunday in January and bridges Dr. King's birthday and [[Black History Month]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18979">'''Medical Neutrality''' refers to a principle of noninterference with medical services in times of armed conflict and civil unrest: [[physicians]] must be allowed to care for the sick and wounded, and soldiers must receive care regardless of their political affiliations; all parties must refrain from attacking and misusing medical facilities, transport, and personnel. Concepts comprising the principles of medical neutrality derive from [[international human rights law]], [[medical ethics]] and [[humanitarian law]].  Medical neutrality may be thought of as a kind of social contract that obligates societies to protect medical personnel in both times of war and peace, and obligates medical personnel to treat all individuals regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or political affiliation.  Violations of medical neutrality constitute crimes outlined in the [[Geneva Conventions]].

==Historical Background==
The principle of medical neutrality has roots in many social traditions. 
*The Hippocratic Oath, which requires physicians to practice medicine ethically, dates back to the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein. ''The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The idea of ‘do no harm’ has histories in “Jewish and Islamic, as well as Chinese and Indian medicine”&lt;ref&gt;Sheila McLean, ''First Do No Harm: Law, Ethics, and Healthcare'', at 83 (Ashgate Publishing, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Geneva Conventions]] (the core of international humanitarian law, supported and protected by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]):
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] was written by Henri Dunant in response to seeing such the difficulty of treating wounded soldiers at the Battle of Solferino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sperry | first = C.S. | title = The Revision of the Geneva Convention, 1906 | journal = Proceedings of the American Political Science Association | year = 1906 |volume = 3 | page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The first and the following [[Geneva Conventions]] created the [[Red Cross]], outline the protections of medical personnel in times of war, codify the protections of citizens, soldiers, medical personnel, etc. 
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] states that there should be no “obstacle to the humanitarian activities”  and that wounded and sick “shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.”&lt;ref name="Convention I"&gt;”Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field. Geneva, 12 August 1949.” International Committee of the Red Cross. http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/365?OpenDocument. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**Article 19 demands that medical units, i.e. hospitals and mobile medical facilities, may in no circumstances be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;”Article 19, First Geneva Convention.” Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-I.pdf. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**The [[Declaration of Geneva]] was created as an amendment to the Hippocratic Oath in 1948, a response to the human experimentation on Nazi prisoners.

==Violations of Medical Neutrality==
Medical neutrality is violated when health care professionals, facilities, or patients come under attack, or when medical professionals are not allowed to provide treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. "The Principle of Medical Neutrality." http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/multimedia/principle-of-medical-neutrality.html. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Convention I"/&gt;
*Attacks on hospitals
*Attacks on patients
*Attacks on medical personnel
*Attacks on medical transport
*Misuse of medical facilities
*Breaches of medical ethics by medical personnel
*Using the hospital/Medical facilities in order to attack, fire/ fire rockets e.j., to civilians from the medical facilities
*Using the medical facilities in order to house weapons or soldiers
*Using the medical facilities for purposes other than medical assistance and/or aid to the public

==Recorded Historical Violations of Medical Neutrality==

===Afghanistan (2015)===
On 3 October 2015, U.S. airstrikes killed 42 people and destroyed the MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières - Doctors Without Borders) trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan (See [[Kunduz hospital airstrike|main article]]). Many patients in the hospital burned alive in their beds as a US AC-130 gunship made multiple passes firing upon the hospital from overhead. MSF's request for an independent inquiry was never honoured. The U.S. military investigated itself, eventually taking disciplinary action against a dozen servicemembers. No criminal prosecutions followed. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msf.org/en/article/one-year-after-kunduz-battlefields-without-doctors-wars-without-limits "One year after Kunduz: Battlefields without doctors, in wars without limits"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/kunduz-hospital-attack-msf-us-military-charges "Kunduz hospital attack: MSF's questions remain as US military seeks no charges"], ''The Guardian'', 29 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
The Bahraini government’s crackdown on the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahrain uprising]] in 2011 and 2012 included extensive violations of medical neutrality. An investigative report released by [[Physicians for Human Rights]] revealed that many doctors were attacked or incarcerated. Furthermore, Bahraini security forces have seized control of medical facilities, prevented patients from receiving treatment, misused ambulance services, and violently interrogated wounded patients.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights, Do No Harm: A Call for Bahrain to End Systematic Attacks on Doctors and Patients, http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/issues/persecution-of-health-workers/bahrain/&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, 20 medical workers in Bahrain were [[Bahrain health worker trials|sentenced]] to up to 15 years in prison for treating protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/world/middleeast/bahrain-court-hands-down-harsh-sentences-to-doctors-and-protesters.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig "Bahrain Court Hands Down Harsh Sentences to Doctors and Protesters"].

===Chechnya (1996)===
During the Battle of Grozny in 1996 during the [[First Chechen War]], several hospitals were attacked.  Municipal Hospital No. 9 was invaded by Russian soldiers and approximately 500 civilians were taken hostage.&lt;ref&gt;Memorial. “Occupation of Municipal Hospital No. 9.” http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/chechen/szczyt/eng/Chapter7.htm. Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ICRC Hospital of Novye Atagi]], which was created to symbolize medical neutrality in the war-torn area, was attacked and six members of the ICRC staff were killed.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. “17 December 1996: Six ICRC delegates assassinated in Chechnya.” https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jnj3.htm. Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt (2011)===
In 2011, during political unrest, state security forces directly attacked protestors and field clinics, injuring and killing numerous people.  A state security officer even dressed himself as a doctor and administered fatal shots to those injured in a field clinic outside of Tahrir Square.{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name= Tahrir&gt;Amani Massoud, A brief history of field hospitals in Tahrir Square, AlMasry Alyoum, November 27, 2011, http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/521861.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical supplies were confiscated by “military officers and field hospital tents were burned down during a Tahrir raid.”&lt;ref name= Tahrir /&gt;

===El Salvador (1980-1992)===
In the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], many field clinics were attacked by guerillas. Patients were commonly abducted from hospitals, and government forces greatly limited the movements of health workers. Medical transports were also attacked, in some cases resulting in the deaths of medical workers.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “El Salvador: Health Care Under Siege”. https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/el-salvador-health-care-under-siege.pdf.

In June 2008, Iranian authorities detained [[Kamiar and Arash Alaei incident|Dr. Arash Alaei and Dr. Kamiar Alaei]], two well-known Iranian physicians and leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The physicians, who are brothers, were held in Tehran’s notorious [[Evin prison]] for over six months without being charged or tried.  On December 31, 2008, a one-day, closed-door trial was held, in which the brothers were tried as conspirators working with an “enemy government” to overthrow the government of Iran. They were also tried at that time on unspecified other charges which neither they nor their lawyer were allowed to know, see the evidence of, or address.&lt;ref&gt;Iran Free the Docs. “Background.” http://iranfreethedocs.org/background/.

During the 2011 [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], human rights groups documented violations of medical neutrality along with many other gross violations of human rights. [[Physicians for Human Rights]] conducted investigations within Libya in 2011, and found that the military had attacked and destroyed hospitals. Several eyewitnesses reported that [[Gaddafi]] forces attacked ambulances carrying injured combatants, despite the fact that the ambulances were marked with the emblematic [[Red Crescent]].

===Panama (1988)===
Civil unrest and demonstrations began in Panama in June 1987. During the unrest, human rights groups such as [[Physicians for Human Rights]] documented a variety of human rights abuses and violations of medical neutrality. The military blocked access to hospitals and interfered with provision of medical care, took control of ambulance services for military purposes, and interrogated wounded patients.  In addition, Panamanian physicians were kidnapped, beaten, and tortured for speaking out against government policies which prevented them from providing their patients with adequate care.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “Panama 1987: Health Consequences of Police and Military Actions.” https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/panama-1987-health-cons.pdf.

==Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011 (H.R. 2643)==
The Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011, (H.R. 2643),  is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives [[Jim McDermott]] (D-WA), and [[Walter B. Jones, Jr.]] (R-NC) that intends to make the protection of medical professionals and access to medical services a global policy priority for the US government.&lt;ref name= "McDermott statement"&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “Introducing Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011: Representative Jim McDermott’s Statement for the Record”. http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/other/introducing-medical-neutrality-protection-act.html. Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bill calls for the creation of the position of a [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Protection and Promotion of Medical Neutrality and calls for investigations of violations of medical neutrality.  It also limits military aid from the USA to countries that have engaged in violating medical neutrality, and as well bans their government officials from attaining visas to the United States.&lt;ref name="Neutrality bill"&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office, “H.R. 2643”, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2643ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr2643ih.pdf.

** Militarized attacks on health care facilities, health care service providers, or individuals in the course of receiving medical treatment 
**Wanton destruction of medical supplies, facilities, records, or transportation services
**Willful obstruction of medical ethics as specified in the World Medical Association’s International Code of Medical Ethics, including preventing medical professionals from administering ethical medical care to individuals in need
** Coercion of medical personnel to commit acts in violation of their ethical responsibilities 
** Deliberate misuse of health care facilities, transportation services, uniforms, or other insignia
** Deliberate blocking of access to health care facilities and health care professionals 
** Arbitrary arrest or detention of health care service providers or individuals seeking medical care

The '''mediocrity principle''' is the [[philosophical]] notion that "if an item is drawn at random from one of several sets or categories, it's likelier to come from the most numerous category than from any one of the less numerous categories".&lt;ref name="Kukla2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Kukla |year=2009 |title=Extraterrestrials: A Philosophical Perspective |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739142455 |lccn=2009032272 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkdqTFVNwmgC&amp;pg=PA20 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been taken to suggest that there is nothing very unusual about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolution of the Solar System]], [[Earth's history]], the [[evolution of biological complexity]], [[human evolution]], or any one [[nation]]. It is a [[heuristic]] in the vein of the [[Copernican principle]], and is sometimes used as a philosophical statement about the place of humanity. The idea is to assume mediocrity, rather than starting with the assumption that a phenomenon is special, privileged, exceptional, or even [[supremacism|superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1377474/principle-of-mediocrity|title=principle of mediocrity - astrobiology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MediocrePZ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_12.html#myerspz|title=THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 2011 — Page 12|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial life==
[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|thumb|200px|Life is ubiquitous on Earth, but does it exist elsewhere?]]

The mediocrity principle suggests, given the existence of life on Earth, that [[life]] typically exists on [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]]s throughout the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric, and Steve McMillan. ''Astronomy: A Beginner’s Guide to the Universe.'' Ed. Nancy Whilton. San Francisco: Pearson, 2010.{{page needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other approaches==

The mediocrity principle is in contrast with the [[anthropic principle]], which asserts that the presence of an intelligent observer (humans) limits the circumstances to bounds under which intelligent life can be [[Observation bias|observed to exist]], no matter [[Rare Earth hypothesis|how improbable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; Both stand in contrast to the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning hypothesis]], which asserts that the natural conditions for intelligent life are implausibly rare.

The mediocrity principle implies that Earth-like environments are necessarily common, based in part on the evidence of [[Doomsday argument|any happening at all]], whereas the anthropic principle suggests that no assertion can be made about the probability of intelligent life based on a sample set of one ([[Dunning–Kruger effect|self-described]]) example, who are necessarily capable of making such an assertion about themselves.

It is also possible to handle the Mediocrity Principle as a statistical problem, a case of a single [[Data point]] statistics, also present in the [[German tank problem]].

==Other uses==
[[David Deutsch]] argues that the mediocrity principle is incorrect from a physical point of view, in reference to either humanity's part of the universe or to its species. Deutsch refers to [[Stephen Hawking]]'s quote: "The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies". Deutsch wrote that Earth's neighborhood in the universe is not typical (80% of the universe's matter is [[dark matter]]) and that a concentration of mass such as the Solar System is an "isolated, uncommon phenomenon". He also disagrees with [[Richard Dawkins]], who considers that humans, because of natural evolution, are limited to the capabilities of their species. Deutsch responds that even though evolution did not give humans the ability to detect [[neutrino]]s, scientists can currently detect them, which significantly expands their capabilities beyond what is available as a result of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-14-196969-5 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |author=[[David Deutsch]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''metric''' or '''distance function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that defines a [[distance]]  between each pair of elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. A set with a metric is called a [[metric space]]. A metric induces a [[topology]] on a set, but not all topologies can be generated by a metric. A [[topological space]] whose topology can be described by a metric is called [[metrizable]].

An important source of metrics in [[differential geometry]] are [[metric tensor]]s, [[bilinear form]]s that may be defined from the [[tangent vector]]s of a [[differentiable manifold]] onto a scalar. A metric tensor allows distances along curves to be determined through integration, and thus determines a metric. However, not every metric comes from a metric tensor in this way.

==Definition==

A '''metric''' on a set {{mvar|X}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (called the ''distance function'' or simply '''distance''')
:&lt;math&gt;d : X \times X \to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of non-negative [[real number]]s and for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt;, the following conditions are satisfied:

:{|
|-
|style="width:20px"| 1.
|style="width:250px"|&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
|| [[Non-negative|non-negativity]] or separation axiom
|-
| 2. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y&lt;/math&gt; || [[identity of indiscernibles]]
|-
| 3. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)  = d(y,x) &lt;/math&gt; || [[Symmetric function|symmetry]]
|-
| 4. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;  || [[subadditivity]] or [[triangle inequality]]
|}

Conditions 1 and 2 together define a ''[[positive-definite function]]''. 
The first condition is implied by the others.

A metric is called an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] if it satisfies the following stronger version of the ''triangle inequality'' where points can never fall 'between' other points:
: &lt;math&gt;d(x, z) \leq \max(d(x, y), d(y, z))&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt;

A metric {{mvar|d}} on {{mvar|X}} is called [[intrinsic metric|intrinsic]] if any two points {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|X}} can be joined by a [[curve]] with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|length]] arbitrarily close to {{math|''d''(''x'', ''y'')}}.

For sets on which an addition + : {{math|''X'' &amp;times; ''X'' → ''X''}} is defined,
{{mvar|d}} is called a '''[[Translational invariance|translation invariant metric]]''' if
: &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(x + a, y + a)&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|X}}.

== Notes ==

These conditions express intuitive notions about the concept of [[distance]]. For example, that the distance between distinct points is positive and the distance from ''x'' to ''y'' is the same as the distance from ''y'' to ''x''. The triangle inequality means that the distance from ''x'' to ''z'' via ''y'' is at least as great as from ''x'' to ''z'' directly. [[Euclid]] in his [[Euclidean geometry|work]] stated that the shortest distance between two points is a line; that was the triangle inequality for his geometry.

If a modification of the triangle inequality
:4*.  ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''z'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
is used in the definition then property 1 follows straight from property 4*. Properties 2 and 4* give property 3 which in turn gives property 4.

== Examples ==

{{Main|Metric space#Examples of metric spaces}}
* The [[discrete space|discrete metric]]: if ''x'' = ''y'' then ''d''(''x'',''y'') = 0.  Otherwise, ''d''(''x'',''y'') = 1.
* The [[Euclidean metric]] is translation and rotation invariant.
* The [[Taxicab geometry|taxicab metric]] is translation invariant.
* More generally, any metric induced by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is translation invariant.
* If &lt;math&gt;(p_n)_{n\in N}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sequence]] of [[seminorm]]s defining a ([[locally convex]]) [[topological vector space]] ''E'', then
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \frac{p_n(x-y)}{1+p_n(x-y)}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a metric defining the same [[topology]].  (One can replace &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; by any [[absolute convergence|summable sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; of strictly [[positive number]]s.)
* [[Graph metric]], a metric defined in terms of distances in a certain graph.
* The [[Hamming distance]] in coding theory.
* [[Riemannian metric]], a type of metric function that is appropriate to impose on any [[differentiable manifold]]. For any such [[manifold]], one chooses at each point p a symmetric, positive definite, bilinear form L: T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; × T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; → ℝ on the [[tangent space]] T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; at p, doing so in a smooth manner. This form determines the length of any tangent vector '''v''' on the manifold, via the definition ||v||  =  {{radic|L('''v''', '''v''')}}. Then for any differentiable path on the manifold, its length is defined as the integral of the length of the tangent vector to the path at any point, where the integration is done with respect to the path parameter.  Finally, to get a metric defined on any pair {x, y} of points of the manifold, one takes the infimum, over all paths from x to y, of the set of path lengths. A smooth manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric is called a [[Riemannian manifold]].
* The [[Fubini–Study metric]] on [[complex projective space]]. This is an example of a Riemannian metric.
* [[String metric]]s, such as [[Levenshtein distance]] and other [[Edit distance|string edit distances]], define a metric over [[String (computer science)|strings]].
* [[Graph edit distance]] defines a distance function between [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]].
* The [[Wasserstein metric]] is a distance function defined between two [[probability distribution]]s.

== Equivalence of metrics ==

For a given set ''X'', two metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''topologically equivalent''' ('''uniformly equivalent''') if the identity mapping
:id: (''X'',''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''X'',''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
is a [[homeomorphism]] ([[uniform isomorphism]]).

For example, if &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a metric, then &lt;math&gt;\min (d, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{d \over 1+d}&lt;/math&gt; are metrics equivalent to &lt;math&gt;d.&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Metric space#Notions of metric space equivalence|notions of metric space equivalence]].

== Metrics on vector spaces ==
&lt;!-- linked from [[Relation of norms and metrics]] --&gt;
Norms on vector spaces are equivalent to certain metrics, namely homogeneous, translation-invariant ones. In other words, every norm determines a metric, and some metrics determine a norm.

Given a [[normed vector space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \|\cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; we can define a metric on ''X'' by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) := \| x-y\|&lt;/math&gt;.
The metric ''d'' is said to be '''induced by''' the norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely if a metric ''d'' on a [[vector space]] ''X'' satisfies the properties
*&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = d(x+a,y+a)&lt;/math&gt; (''translation invariance'')
*&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha x, \alpha y) = |\alpha| d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; (''homogeneity'')
then we can define a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on ''X'' by
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\| := d(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a [[seminorm]] induces a pseudometric (see below), and a homogeneous, translation invariant pseudometric induces a seminorm.

==Metrics on multisets==
We can generalize the notion of a metric from a distance between two elements to a distance between two nonempty finite multisets of elements. A [[multiset]] is a generalization of the notion of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] such that an element can occur more than once.  Define &lt;math&gt;Z=XY&lt;/math&gt; if
&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the multiset consisting of the elements of the multisets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurs once in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and once in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; then it occurs twice in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. 
A distance function
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on the set of nonempty finite multisets is a metric&lt;ref name="Vi11"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TIT.2011.2110130|title=Information Distance in Multiples|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=57|issue=4|pages=2451|year=2011|last1=Vitanyi|first1=Paul M. B.|arxiv=0905.3347}}&lt;/ref&gt; if
#  &lt;math&gt;d(X)=0&lt;/math&gt; if all elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are equal and &lt;math&gt;d(X) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise ([[positive definiteness]]), that is, ([[Non-negative|non-negativity]] plus [[identity of indiscernibles]])
# &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under all permutations of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ([[symmetry]])
# &lt;math&gt;d(XY) \leq d(XZ)+d(ZY)&lt;/math&gt; ([[triangle inequality]])
Note that the familiar metric between two elements results if the multiset &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has two elements in 1 and 2 and the multisets &lt;math&gt;X,Y,Z&lt;/math&gt; have one element each in 3. For instance if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; consists of two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;d(X)=0&lt;/math&gt; according to 1.

A simple example is the set of all nonempty finite multisets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  of integers with &lt;math&gt;d(X)=\max\{x: x \in X\}- \min\{x:x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;. More complex examples are [[information distance]] in multisets;&lt;ref name="Vi11"/&gt; and [[normalized compression distance]] (NCD) in multisets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1212.5711|last1= Cohen|first1= Andrew R.|title= Normalized Compression Distance of Multisets with Applications|journal= IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|volume= 37|issue= 8|pages= 1602–1614|last2=  Vitanyi|first2= Paul M. B.|year= 2012|doi= 10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2375175}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalized metrics ==
There are numerous ways of relaxing the axioms of metrics, giving rise to various notions of generalized metric spaces. These generalizations can also be combined. The terminology used to describe them is not completely standardized. Most notably, in [[functional analysis]] pseudometrics often come from [[seminorm]]s on vector spaces, and so it is natural to call them "semimetrics". This conflicts with the use of the term in [[topology]].

=== Extended metrics ===
Some authors allow the distance function ''d'' to attain the value ∞, i.e. distances are non-negative numbers on the [[extended real number line]]. 
Such a function is called an ''extended metric'' or "∞-metric". 
Every extended metric can be transformed to a finite metric such that the metric spaces are equivalent as far as notions of [[topology]] (such as [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]] or [[limit (mathematics)|convergence]]) are concerned. This can be done using a [[Subadditive function|subadditive]] monotonically increasing bounded function which is zero at zero, e.g. ''d''&amp;prime;(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''x'', ''y'') / (1 + ''d''(''x'', ''y'')) or ''d''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;(''x'', ''y'') = min(1, ''d''(''x'', ''y'')).

The requirement that the metric take values in &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt; can even be relaxed to consider metrics with values in other [[directed set]]s.  The reformulation of the axioms in this case leads to the construction of [[uniform space]]s: topological spaces with an abstract structure enabling one to compare the local topologies of different points.

===Pseudometrics===
{{Main|Pseudometric space}}
A '''pseudometric''' on ''X'' is a function ''d'' : ''X'' × ''X'' → '''R''' which satisfies the axioms for a metric, except that instead of the second (identity of indiscernibles) only ''d''(''x'',''x'')=0 for all ''x'' is required. In other words, the axioms for a pseudometric are:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
&lt;!--# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y''--&gt;
# '''''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0''' (but possibly ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 for some distinct values ''x'' ≠ ''y''.)
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'').

In some contexts, pseudometrics are referred to as ''semimetrics'' because of their relation to [[seminorm]]s.

===Quasimetrics===
Occasionally, a '''quasimetric''' is defined as a function that satisfies all axioms for a metric with the possible exception of symmetry:&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Quasi uniformities: reconciling domains with metric spaces | last=Smyth | first=M. | year=1987 | pages=236–253 | conference=3rd Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Language Semantics | editor=M.Main |editor2=A.Melton |editor3=M.Mislove |editor4=D.Schmidt | publisher=Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The name of this generalisation is not entirely standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Functional Analysis and Control Theory: Linear Systems | last=Rolewicz | first=Stefan | year=1987 | isbn=90-277-2186-6 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | oclc=13064804 }} This book calls them "semimetrics". That same term is also frequently used for two other generalizations of metrics.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0 ('''positivity''')
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y'' ('''positive definiteness''')
# &lt;del&gt;''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')&lt;/del&gt; ('''symmetry''', dropped)
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') ('''triangle inequality''')

Quasimetrics are common in real life. For example, given a set ''X'' of mountain villages, the typical walking times between elements of ''X'' form a quasimetric because travel up hill takes longer than travel down hill. Another example is a [[taxicab geometry]] topology having one-way streets, where a path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' comprises a different set of streets than a path from ''B'' to ''A''. 

A quasimetric on the reals can be defined by setting
:''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' − ''y'' if ''x'' ≥ ''y'', and
:''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 otherwise. The 1 may be replaced by infinity or by &lt;math&gt;1+10^{(y-x)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The topological space underlying this quasimetric space is the [[Sorgenfrey line]]. This space describes the process of [[Filing (metalworking)|filing down]] a metal stick: it is easy to reduce its size, but it is difficult or impossible to grow it.

If ''d'' is a quasimetric on ''X'', a metric ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' on ''X'' can be formed by taking
:''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x'', ''y'') = {{frac|2}}(''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''x'')).

===Metametrics===

In a ''metametric'', all the axioms of a metric are satisfied except that the distance between identical points is not necessarily zero. In other words, the axioms for a metametric are:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 implies ''x'' = ''y'' (but not vice versa.)
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'').

Metametrics appear in the study of [[Δ-hyperbolic space|Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces]] and their boundaries. The ''visual metametric'' on such a space satisfies ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0 for points ''x'' on the boundary, but otherwise ''d''(''x'', ''x'') is approximately the distance from ''x'' to the boundary. Metametrics were first defined by Jussi Väisälä.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Semimetrics===
A '''semimetric''' on ''X'' is a function ''d'' : ''X'' × ''X'' → '''R''' that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the triangle inequality:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y''
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')

Some authors work with a weaker form of the triangle inequality, such as:
: ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ρ (''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'')) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ρ-relaxed triangle inequality)
: ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ρ max(''d''(''x'', ''y''), ''d''(''y'', ''z'')) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ρ-inframetric inequality).
The ρ-inframetric inequality implies the ρ-relaxed triangle inequality (assuming the first axiom), and the ρ-relaxed triangle inequality implies the 2ρ-inframetric inequality. Semimetrics satisfying these equivalent conditions have sometimes been referred to as "quasimetrics",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The ρ-inframetric inequalities were introduced to model [[round-trip delay time]]s in the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=inframetrics /&gt; The triangle inequality implies the 2-inframetric inequality, and the [[ultrametric inequality]] is exactly the 1-inframetric inequality.

===Premetrics===
Relaxing the last three axioms leads to the notion of a '''premetric''', i.e. a function satisfying the following conditions:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = ''0''

This is not a standard term. Sometimes it is used to refer to other generalizations of metrics such as pseudosemimetrics&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | year = 2006
 | author = Khelemskiĭ
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in translations of Russian books it sometimes appears as "prametric".&lt;ref&gt;Arkhangel'skii &amp;amp; Pontryagin (1990). {{citation

 | year = 1995
 | last1 = Aldrovandi	 | first1 =  R.
 | last2 =  Pereira	 | first2 =  J.G.
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any premetric gives rise to a topology as follows. For a positive real ''r'', the ''r''-ball centered at a point ''p'' is defined as
:''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'') = { ''x'' | ''d''(''x'', ''p'') &lt; r }.
A set is called ''open'' if for any point ''p'' in the set there is an ''r''-ball centered at ''p'' which is contained in the set. Every premetric space is a topological space, and in fact a [[sequential space]].&lt;!--I copied this claim from [[premetric space]] without checking--&gt;
In general, the ''r''-balls themselves need not be open sets with respect to this topology. 
As for metrics, the distance between two sets ''A'' and ''B'', is defined as
:''d''(''A'', ''B'') = inf&lt;sub&gt;''x''∊''A'', ''y''∊''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''x'', ''y'').
This defines a premetric on the [[power set]] of a premetric space. If we start with a (pseudosemi-)metric space, we get a pseudosemimetric, i.e. a symmetric premetric.
Any premetric gives rise to a [[preclosure operator]] ''cl'' as follows:
:''cl''(''A'') = { ''x'' | ''d''(''x'', ''A'') = 0 }.

===Pseudoquasimetrics===
The prefixes ''pseudo-'', ''quasi-'' and ''semi-'' can also be combined, e.g., a '''pseudoquasimetric''' (sometimes called '''hemimetric''') relaxes both the indiscernibility axiom and the symmetry axiom and is simply a premetric satisfying the triangle inequality. For pseudoquasimetric spaces the open ''r''-balls form a basis of open sets. A very basic example of a pseudoquasimetric space is the set {0,1} with the premetric given by ''d''(0,1) = 1 and ''d''(1,0) = 0. The associated topological space is the [[Sierpiński space]].

Sets equipped with an extended pseudoquasimetric were studied by [[William Lawvere]] as "generalized metric spaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lawvere | first=F.W. | title=Metric spaces, generalised logic, and closed categories | series=Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories | volume=1 | year=2002 | origyear=1973 | pages=1–37 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Vickers | first=Steven | title=Localic completion of generalized metric spaces I | journal=Theory and Applications of Categories | volume=14 | year=2005 | pages=328–356 | url=http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/15/14-15abs.html }}
&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Category theory|categorical]] point of view, the extended pseudometric spaces and the extended pseudoquasimetric spaces, along with their corresponding nonexpansive maps, are the best behaved of the metric space categories. One can take arbitrary products and coproducts and form quotient objects within the given category. If one drops "extended", one can only take finite products and coproducts. If one drops "pseudo", one cannot take quotients. [[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces that maintains these good categorical properties.

=== Important cases of generalized metrics ===
In [[differential geometry]], one considers a [[metric tensor]], which can be thought of as an "infinitesimal" quadratic metric function. This is defined as a [[nondegenerate]] symmetric [[bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] of a [[manifold]] with an appropriate [[differentiability]] requirement.  While these are not metric functions as defined in this article, they induce what is called a pseudo-semimetric function by [[Antiderivative|integration]] of its square root along a path through the manifold. If one imposes the positive-definiteness requirement of an [[inner product]] on the metric tensor, this restricts to the case of a [[Riemannian manifold]], and the path integration yields a metric.

In [[general relativity]] the related concept is a [[metric tensor (general relativity)]] which expresses the structure of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. Though the term "metric" is used in cosmology, the fundamental idea is different because there are non-zero [[null vector]]s in the tangent space of these manifolds. This generalized view of "metrics", in which zero distance does ''not'' imply identity, has crept into some mathematical writing too:&lt;ref&gt;S. Parrott (1987) ''Relativistic Electrodynamics and Differential Geometry'', page 4, Springer-Verlag {{isbn|0-387-96435-5}} : "This bilinear form is variously called the ''Lorentz metric'', or ''Minkowski metric'' or ''metric tensor''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Cecil (1992) ''Lie Sphere Geometry'', page 9, Springer-Verlag {{isbn|0-387-97747-3}} : "We call this scalar product the ''Lorentz metric''"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43608">The '''model of hierarchical complexity''' is a framework for scoring how complex a [[behavior]] is, such as [[verbal reasoning]] or other [[cognitive]] tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Robinson2013|Robinson, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of [[hierarchical]] complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized, in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"&gt;[[#Reference-Commons2007|Commons, 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been developed by [[Michael Commons]] and others since the 1980s.

==Overview==
The model of hierarchical complexity (MHC) is a [[Formal system|formal theory]] and a [[mathematical psychology]] framework for scoring how complex a behavior is.&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsPekker2008|Commons &amp; Pekker, 2008]]; [[#Reference-Commonsetal2014|Commons et al., 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Developed by [[Michael Commons|Michael Lamport Commons]] and colleagues,&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"&gt;[[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al., 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; it quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on mathematical principles of how the information is organized,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Coombsetal1970|Coombs, Dawes, &amp; Tversky, 1970]]&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[information science]].&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984a|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984a]], [[#Reference-CommonsRichards1984b|Commons &amp; Richards, 1984b]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-LindsayNorman1977|Lindsay &amp; Norman, 1977]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1990|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1990]], [[#Reference-CommonsRodriguez1993|Commons &amp; Rodriguez, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its forerunner was the general stage model.&lt;ref name="CommonsRichards"/&gt;

Behaviors that may be scored include those of individual humans or their social groupings (e.g., organizations, governments, societies), animals, or machines. It enables scoring the hierarchical complexity of task accomplishment in any domain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-GiriCommonsHarrigan2014|Giri, Commons, &amp; Harrigan, 2014]]; but for a different view see: [[#Reference-Mascolo2008|Mascolo, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the very simple notions that higher order task actions:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
#are defined in terms of the next lower ones (creating hierarchy);
#organize the next lower actions;
#organize lower actions in a non-arbitrary way (differentiating them from simple chains of behavior).

It is [[cross-cultural]]ly and cross-species valid. The reason it applies cross-culturally is that the scoring is based on the mathematical complexity of the hierarchical organization of information. Scoring does not depend upon the content of the information (e.g., what is done, said, written, or analyzed) but upon how the information is organized.

The MHC is a non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] model of [[developmental stage theories|developmental stages]].&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; It specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding [[developmental stage theories|stages]]. It is different from previous proposals about developmental stage applied to humans;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[#Reference-InhelderPiaget1958|Inhelder &amp; Piaget, 1958]]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of attributing behavioral changes across a person's age to the development of mental structures or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], this model posits that task sequences of task behaviors form hierarchies that become increasingly complex. Because less complex tasks must be completed and practiced before more complex tasks can be acquired, this accounts for the developmental changes seen, for example, in individual persons' performance of complex tasks. (For example, a person cannot perform [[arithmetic]] until the numeral representations of numbers are learned. A person cannot operationally multiply the sums of numbers until addition is learned).

The creators of the MHC claim that previous theories of stage have confounded the stimulus and response in assessing stage by simply scoring responses and ignoring the task or stimulus.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; The MHC separates the task or stimulus from the performance. The participant's performance on a task of a given complexity represents the stage of developmental complexity.

==Vertical complexity of tasks performed==
One major basis for this developmental theory is [[task analysis]]. The study of ideal tasks, including their instantiation in the real world, has been the basis of the branch of stimulus control called [[psychophysics]]. Tasks are defined as sequences of contingencies, each presenting stimuli and each requiring a behavior or a sequence of behaviors that must occur in some non-arbitrary fashion. The complexity of behaviors necessary to complete a task can be specified using the horizontal complexity and vertical complexity definitions described below. Behavior is examined with respect to the analytically-known complexity of the task.

Tasks are [[wikt:quantal|quantal]] in nature. They are either completed correctly or not completed at all. There is no intermediate state (''[[tertium non datur]]''). For this reason, the model characterizes all stages as [[P-hard]] and functionally distinct. The orders of hierarchical complexity are [[quantum|quantized]] like the [[electron]] [[atomic orbitals]] around the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]: each task difficulty has an order of hierarchical complexity required to complete it correctly, analogous to the atomic [[Slater determinant]]. Since tasks of a given quantified order of hierarchical complexity require actions of a given order of hierarchical complexity to perform them, the stage of the participant's task performance is equivalent to the order of complexity of the successfully completed task. The quantal feature of tasks is thus particularly instrumental in stage assessment because the scores obtained for stages are likewise discrete.

Every task contains a multitude of subtasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Overton1990|Overton, 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt; When the subtasks are carried out by the participant in a required order, the task in question is successfully completed. Therefore, the model asserts that all tasks fit in some configured sequence of tasks, making it possible to precisely determine the hierarchical order of task complexity. Tasks vary in complexity in two ways: either as ''horizontal'' (involving classical information); or as ''vertical'' (involving hierarchical information).&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

===Horizontal complexity===
Classical information describes the number of "yes–no" questions it takes to do a task. For example, if one asked a person across the room whether a penny came up heads when they flipped it, their saying "heads" would transmit 1 bit of "horizontal" information. If there were 2 pennies, one would have to ask at least two questions, one about each penny. Hence, each additional 1-bit question would add another bit. Let us say they had a four-faced top with the faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Instead of spinning it, they tossed it against a backboard as one does with dice in a game of [[craps]]. Again, there would be 2 bits. One could ask them whether the face had an even number. If it did, one would then ask if it were a 2. Horizontal complexity, then, is the sum of bits required by just such tasks as these.

===Vertical complexity===
Hierarchical complexity refers to the number of [[recursion]]s that the coordinating actions must perform on a set of primary elements. Actions at a higher order of hierarchical complexity: (a) are defined in terms of actions at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity; (b) organize and transform the lower-order actions (see Figure 2); (c) produce organizations of lower-order actions that are qualitatively new and not arbitrary, and cannot be accomplished by those lower-order actions alone. Once these conditions have been met, we say the higher-order action coordinates the actions of the next lower order.

To illustrate how lower actions get organized into more hierarchically complex actions, let us turn to a simple example. Completing the entire operation 3 × (4 + 1) constitutes a task requiring the [[distributive property|distributive]] act. That act non-[[arbitrarily]] orders adding and multiplying to coordinate them. The distributive act is therefore one order more hierarchically complex than the acts of adding and multiplying alone; it indicates the singular proper sequence of the simpler actions. Although simply adding results in the same answer, people who can do both display a greater freedom of mental functioning. Additional layers of abstraction can be applied. Thus, the order of complexity of the task is determined through analyzing the demands of each task by breaking it down into its constituent parts.

The hierarchical complexity of a task refers to the number of [[Abstract algebra|concatenation]] operations it contains, that is, the number of recursions that the coordinating actions must perform. An order-three task has three concatenation operations. A task of order three operates on one or more tasks of vertical order two and a task of order two operates on one or more tasks of vertical order one (the simplest tasks).

==Stages of development==
[[Stage theory|Stage theories]] describe [[Human evolution|human]] [[organism]]ic and/or [[Technological evolution|technological]] [[Evolution (term)|evolution]] as systems that move through a pattern of distinct stages over time. Here development is described formally in terms of the model of hierarchical complexity (MHC).

===Formal definition of stage===
Since actions are defined inductively, so is the function ''h'', known as the order of the hierarchical complexity. To each action ''A'', we wish to associate a notion of that action's hierarchical complexity, ''h(A)''. Given a collection of actions '''A''' and a participant ''S'' performing '''A''', the ''stage of performance'' of ''S'' on '''A''' is the highest order of the actions in '''A''' completed successfully at least once, i.e., it is: stage (''S'', '''A''') = max{''h(A)'' | ''A'' ∈ '''A''' and ''A'' completed successfully by ''S''}. Thus, the notion of stage is [[Classification of discontinuities|discontinuous]], having the same transitional gaps as the orders of hierarchical complexity. This is in accordance with previous definitions.&lt;ref name="Commonsetal1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsMiller2001|Commons &amp; Miller, 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CommonsPekker2008"/&gt;

Because MHC stages are conceptualized in terms of the hierarchical complexity of tasks rather than in terms of mental representations (as in Piaget's stages), the highest stage represents successful performances on the most hierarchically complex tasks rather than intellectual maturity.

===Stages of hierarchical complexity===
The following table gives descriptions of each stage in the MHC.

==Relationship with Piaget's theory==
There are some commonalities between the [[Theory of cognitive development|Piagetian]] and Commons' notions of stage and many more things that are different. In both, one finds:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher-order actions defined in terms of lower-order actions. This forces the hierarchical nature of the relations and makes the higher-order tasks include the lower ones and requires that lower-order actions are hierarchically contained within the relative definitions of the higher-order tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher-order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions. This makes them more powerful. Lower-order actions are organized by the actions with a higher order of complexity, i.e., the more complex tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

What [[#Reference-Commonsetal1998|Commons et al. (1998)]] have added includes:
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions in a non-arbitrary way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

This makes it possible for the model's application to meet real world requirements, including the empirical and analytic. Arbitrary organization of lower order of complexity actions, possible in the Piagetian theory, despite the hierarchical definition structure, leaves the functional correlates of the interrelationships of tasks of differential complexity formulations ill-defined.

Moreover, the model is consistent with the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. According to these theories, progression to higher stages or levels of cognitive development is caused by increases in processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. That is, higher-order stages place increasingly higher demands on these functions of information processing, so that their order of appearance reflects the information processing possibilities at successive ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Demetriou1998|Demetriou, 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following dimensions are inherent in the application:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;
# Task and performance are separated.
# All tasks have an order of hierarchical complexity.
# There is only one sequence of orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Hence, there is structure of the whole for [[ideal tasks]] and actions.
# There are transitional gaps between the orders of hierarchical complexity.
# Stage is defined as the most hierarchically complex task solved.
# There are discrete gaps in [[Rasch model|Rasch scaled]] stage of performance.
# Performance stage is different task area to task area.
# There is no structure of the whole—[[Horizontal and vertical décalage|horizontal décalage]]—for performance. It is not inconsistency in thinking within a developmental stage. Décalage is the normal modal state of affairs.

==Orders and corresponding stages==
The MHC specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding stages, positing that each of Piaget's substages, in fact, are robustly hard stages.&lt;ref name="CommonsCroneToddChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsCroneToddChen2014|Commons, Crone-Todd, &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; The MHC adds five postformal stages to Piaget's developmental trajectory: systematic stage 12, metasystematic stage 13, paradigmatic stage 14, cross-paradigmatic stage 15, and meta-cross-paradigmatic stage 16. It may be the Piaget's ''consolidate'' formal stage is the same as the ''systematic'' stage. The sequence is as follows: (0) calculatory, (1) automatic, (2) sensory &amp; motor, (3) circular sensory-motor, (4) sensory-motor, (5) nominal, (6) sentential, (7) preoperational, (8) primary, (9) concrete, (10) abstract, (11) formal, and the five postformal: (12) systematic, (13) metasystematic, (14) paradigmatic, (15) cross-paradigmatic, and (16) meta-cross-paradigmatic. The first four stages (0–3) correspond to Piaget's sensorimotor stage at which infants and very young children perform. Adolescents and adults can perform at any of the subsequent stages. MHC stages 4 through 5 correspond to Piaget's pre-operational stage; 6 through 8 correspond to his concrete operational stage; and 9 through 11 correspond to his formal operational stage.

More complex behaviors characterize multiple system models.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio1995|Kallio, 1995]]; [[#Reference-KallioHelkama1991|Kallio &amp; Helkama, 1991]]&lt;/ref&gt; The four highest stages in the MHC are not represented in Piaget's model. The higher stages of the MHC have extensively influenced the field of [[positive adult development]]. Some adults are said to develop alternatives to, and perspectives on, formal operations; they use formal operations within a "higher" system of operations. Some theorists call the more complex orders of cognitive tasks "[[postformal thought]]", but other theorists argue that these higher orders cannot exactly be labelled as postformal thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Kallio2011|Kallio, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Reference-Jordan2018|Jordan (2018)]] argued that unidimensional models such as the MHC, which measure level of complexity of some behavior, refer to only one of many aspects of adult development, and that other variables are needed (in addition to unidimensional measures of complexity) for a fuller description of adult development.

==Empirical research using the model==
The MHC has a broad range of applicability.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt; Its mathematical foundation permits it to be used by anyone examining task performance that is organized into stages. It is designed to assess development based on the order of complexity which the actor utilizes to organize information. The model thus allows for a standard [[Numerical data|quantitative]] analysis of developmental complexity in any cultural setting. Other advantages of this model include its avoidance of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] explanations, as well as its use of quantitative principles which are universally applicable in any context.&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

The following practitioners can use the MHC to quantitatively assess developmental stages:&lt;ref name="Commons2007"/&gt;

Correlations of similar magnitude have been found in a number of the studies. The following are examples of tasks studied using the model of hierarchical complexity or [[Kurt W.

As of 2014, people and institutes from all the major continents of the world, except Africa, have used the model of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"&gt;[[#Reference-CommonsChen2014|Commons &amp; Chen, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the model is very simple and is based on analysis of tasks and not just performances, it is dynamic.&lt;ref name="CommonsChen2014"/&gt; With the help of the model, it is possible to quantify the occurrence and progression of transition processes in task performances at any order of hierarchical complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Ross2014|Ross, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The descriptions of stages 13–15 have been described as insufficiently precise.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Young2011|Young, 2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rossetal2014|Ross et al., 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Negative energy''' is a concept used in [[physics]] to explain the nature of certain [[field (physics)|fields]], including the [[gravitational field]] and various [[quantum field]] effects.

In more speculative theories, negative energy is involved in [[wormhole]]s which may allow for [[time travel]] and [[warp drive]]s for faster-than-light space travel.

==Gravitational energy==
{{Main|Gravitational energy}}
The strength of the gravitational attraction between two objects represents the amount of [[gravitational energy]] in the field which attracts them towards each other. When they are infinitely far apart, the gravitational attraction and hence energy approach zero. As two such massive objects move towards each other, the motion accelerates under [[gravity]] causing an increase in the positive kinetic energy of the system. At the same time, the gravitational attraction - and hence energy - also increase in magnitude, but the [[law of energy conservation]] requires that the net energy of the system not change. This issue can only be resolved if the change in gravitational energy is negative, thus cancelling out the positive change in kinetic energy. Since the gravitational energy is getting stronger, this decrease can only mean that it is negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[universe]] in which positive energy dominates will eventually collapse in a "[[big crunch]]", while an "open" universe in which negative energy dominates will either expand indefinitely or eventually disintegrate in a "[[big rip]]". In the [[zero-energy universe]] model ("flat" or "Euclidean"), the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly [[zero]]: its amount of positive energy in the form of [[matter]] is exactly cancelled out by its negative energy in the form of [[gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''The Grand Design'', 2010, Page 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum field effects==
Negative energies and negative energy density are consistent with [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everett |first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas |title=Time Travel and Warp Drives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2012 |page=167 |isbn=0-226-22498-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual particles===
{{Main|Virtual particles}}
In quantum theory, the [[uncertainty principle]] allows the vacuum of space to be filled with [[virtual particles|virtual]] particle-antiparticle pairs which appear spontaneously and exist for only a short time before, typically, annihilating themselves again. Some of these virtual particles can have negative energy. Their behaviour plays a role in several important phenomena, as described below.

===Casimir effect===
{{Main|Casimir effect}}
In the Casimir effect, two flat plates placed very close together restrict the wavelengths of quanta which can exist between them. This in turn restricts the types and hence number and density of [[virtual particle]] pairs which can form in the intervening vacuum and can result in a negative energy density. This causes an attractive force between the plates, which has been measured.&lt;ref name="fordroman"&gt;Ford and Roman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hawking radiation===
{{Main|Hawking radiation}}
[[Virtual particles]] with negative energy can exist for a short period. This phenomenon is a part of the mechanism involved in [[Hawking radiation]] by which [[black hole]]s evaporate.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; ''A Brief History of Time'', Bantam 1988, Pages 105-107. {{ISBN|0-593-01518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squeezed light===
{{Main|Squeezed light}}
It is possible to arrange multiple beams of laser light such that destructive [[quantum interference]] suppresses the [[vacuum fluctuations]]. Such a squeezed vacuum state involves negative energy. The repetitive waveform of light leads to alternating regions of positive and negative energy.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

===Dirac sea===
{{Main|Dirac sea}}
According to the theory of the [[Dirac sea]], developed by [[Paul Dirac]] in 1930, the [[vacuum]] of space is full of negative energy. This theory was developed to explain the anomaly of negative-energy [[quantum states]] predicted by the [[Dirac equation]].

The Dirac sea theory correctly predicted the existence of [[antimatter]] two years prior to the discovery of the [[positron]] in 1932 by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]]. However, the Dirac sea theory treats antimatter as a hole where there is the absence of a particle rather than as a real particle. [[Quantum field theory]] (QFT), developed in the 1930s, deals with antimatter in a way that treats antimatter as made of real particles rather than the absence of particles, and treats a vacuum as being empty of particles rather than full of negative-energy particles like in the Dirac sea theory.

Quantum field theory has displaced the Dirac sea theory as a more popular explanation of these aspects of physics. Both the Dirac sea theory and quantum field theory are equivalent by means of a [[Bogoliubov transformation]], so the Dirac sea can be viewed as an alternative formulation of quantum field theory, and is thus consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=López de Recalde|first=Andrea|date=2017|title=The Standard Electro-Weak Theory, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=mNevDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=dirac+sea+equivalent+transformation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dirac%20sea%20equivalent%20transformation&amp;f=false|location=Morrisville, North Carolina|publisher=LuLu Press, Inc.|page=65|isbn=978-1-365-65887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative suggestions==
===Wormholes===
{{Main|Wormhole}}
Negative energy appears in the speculative theory of [[wormhole]]s, where it is needed to keep the wormhole open. A wormhole directly connects two locations which may be separated arbitrarily far apart in both space and time, and in principle allows near-instantaneous travel between them.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking; "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1269288/STEPHEN-HAWKING-How-build-time-machine.html How to build a time machine]", ''Mail Online'' 27 April 2010(retrieved 4 November 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp drive===
{{Main|Warp drive}}
A theoretical principle for a [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) warp drive for spaceships has been suggested, involving negative energy. The [[Alcubierre drive]] comprises a solution to Einstein's equations of [[general relativity]], in which a bubble of spacetime is moved rapidly by expanding space behind it and shrinking space in front of it.&lt;ref name="fordroman" /&gt;

'''''Nolle prosequi''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɒ|l|i|_|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|s|ə|k|w|aɪ}};&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{OED|Nolle prosequi}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-la|ˈnolːe ˈproːsekwiː|classical}}) is a legal [[term of art]] and a [[List of Latin legal phrases|Latin legal phrase]] meaning "be unwilling to pursue",&lt;ref name="refdotcom"&gt;"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Nolle+prosequi Nolle prosequi]". reference.com. Accessed 2012-03-02.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;"[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dprosequor Nolle prosequi]". Lewis &amp; Short. Accessed 2017-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase amounting to "do not prosecute". It is a phrase used in many [[common law]] [[criminal jurisdiction|criminal]] prosecution contexts to describe a [[prosecutor]]'s decision to voluntarily discontinue [[criminal law|criminal]] charges either before [[trial (law)|trial]] or before a [[verdict]] is rendered.&lt;ref&gt;A ''nolle prosequi'' can be entered at any time after the  indictment or information has been signed and before verdict:''R v Dunn [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/EngR/1843/60.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[1843]&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{abbr|EngR|English Reports}} 60]; R v Colling (1847) 2 [[Cox's Criminal Cases|Cox CC]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tGk0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA184#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 184]; R v Sneesby (1951) [[State Reports Queensland|St R Qd]] 26; {{cite AustLII|SASC|1670|1989|litigants=R v Economou |paralleicte=(1989) 51 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 421}}; {{cite AustLII|TASRp|16|1979|litigants=R v Heald |parallecite=[1979] [[Tasmanian Reports|Tas R]] 185}} source: {{cite AustLII|SASC|5679|1996|litigants=R v Michael Charles Baenisch |date=28 June 1996 |pinpoint=para. 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts with an [[involuntary dismissal]].

== Application in law ==
''Nolle prosequi'' as a declaration is most often used in criminal cases, but in jurisdictions making use of ''nolle prosequi'' in civil lawsuits, it is used by a plaintiff that voluntarily drops its claims. In civil cases, a motion for [[voluntary dismissal]] may be made by a plaintiff instead of a declaration of ''nolle prosequi'', depending upon the custom and rules of a given jurisdiction.

=== Decision-maker ===
''Nolle prosequi'' as a declaration can be made by a prosecutor in a criminal case either before or during trial, resulting in the prosecutor declining to further pursue the case against the defendant. Courts seldom challenge applications for ''nolle prosequi''. In the [[United States]], judges will usually sign a dismissal order prepared by the prosecution or make a docket entry indicating the disposition of the case to be ''nolle prosse'' after a declaration or motion by the prosecution.

In criminal cases in the United States it has been held improper for a court to enter an order of ''nolle prosequi'' on its own, without a motion by the prosecutor,&lt;ref name="cox"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4202544690014107094&amp;hl=en United States v. Cox], 342 F.2d 167 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert denied, 381 U.S. 935 (1965). Involved a federal grand jury indictment against civil rights workers and the refusal by a US attorney to sign the indictment. The Fifth Circuit held that the US attorney's signing or withholding of his signature was within prosecutorial discretion and could not be coerced by the courts. See also the dicta in US v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 at 693, 1974, "[The] Executive Branch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case." (citing Cox).&lt;/ref&gt; but as to sentencing discrepancies involved in a sentence recommendation, a trial judge is authorized to reject an underlying guilty plea based upon concerns of fairness and justice or because it is presented after the plea cutoff date.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4529448885415177681&amp;hl=en People v. Grove], 566 N.W.2d 547 at 556, Mich. Sup. Ct. 1997, and cited by Casenote: Criminal Law – Plea Bargaining, 75 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 741, Summer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The notes to Rule 48 of the US [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] (FRCRP) draw attention to the effect of the rule as contrasting with common law. Rule 48 now mandates for prosecutors to seek leave of the court before they dismiss a case via filing a ''nolle prosequi''.&lt;ref name="frcpNote"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_48 FRCRP 48 notes], cornell.edu. Retrieved 2011-11-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reason ===
The declaration may be made because the charges cannot be proved because the evidence is too weak to carry the burden of proof, the evidence is fatally flawed in light of the claims that are brought,&lt;ref name="snead"&gt;Snead v. Jones, 169 Ala. 143, 53 So. 188; MacLaughlin v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 93 N. J. L. 263, 108 Atl. 309; Dickerson v. Atlantic Refining Co., 201 N. C. 90, 159 S.E. 446; Hobbs v. Illinois Cent. R. Co., 182 Iowa 316, 165 N.W. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecutor becomes doubtful that the accused is guilty, the defendant's innocence is proved, or the defendant has died. It has also been used when a federal criminal charge is brought up against a defendant when the prosecutor on a state charge for the same offense no longer wishes to pursue the case. Usually, that happens when the state prosecutor is content with the sentence on the federal charge and has no need to go any further with the original case.

=== Timing ===
In criminal cases, ''nolle prosequi'' declarations are made generally after an indictment as long as adjudication on the merits has not occurred or, in some jurisdictions, as long as a trial has not commenced. In civil cases, ''nolle prosequi'' declarations are made either before the trial begins or before a judgment on the merits is rendered, depending on the rules of the jurisdiction.

=== Legal effect ===
The entry of a ''nolle prosequi'' is not an acquittal. Since the principle of [[double jeopardy]] therefore does not apply, the defendant may later be indicted on the same charge again.&lt;ref name="klopfer"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4221560055012353994&amp;hl=en Klopfer v. North Carolina], 386 US 213 at 214, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1, Sup. Ct., 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swick"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17187521144565403858&amp;hl=en Swick v. Liautaud], 662 NE 2d 1238, 169 Ill. 2d 504, Ill Sup. Ct., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klopfer at 215 et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wynne"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1665611583418567020&amp;hl=en Wynne v. Rosen], 464 NE 2d 1348, Mass Sup. J. Ct., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application in civil cases ===
In civil cases, a ''nolle prosequi'' or voluntary dismissal may be entered as to one of several counts or claims, or as to one of several defendants, or both. In any jurisdiction, whether a motion for voluntary dismissal or a declaration of ''nolle prosequi'' is used, federal and state rules of [[civil procedure]] generally govern when, how, and why claims may be voluntarily dismissed and apply different rules to different types of claims and to whether a court may give leave to dismiss a matter with or without [[prejudice (legal procedure)|prejudice]].&lt;ref name="frcp"&gt;See [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] Rule 41, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarity to a declination of prosecution ==
''Nolle prosequi'' is similar to a declination of prosecution, which is an agreement not to prosecute made before any charges are brought or suit has been filed. A declination of prosecution may be made by an attorney or may be made as an agreement between the aggrieved party and the claimant.

In contrast, ''nolle prosequi'' is usually made after a decision to prosecute has already been made. A declination of prosecution may be made for many reasons, such as weak evidence or a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name="greenblum"&gt;Greenblum, [http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/documents/greenblum.pdf What Happens to a Prosecution Deferred-Judicial Oversight of Corporate Deferred Prosecution Agreements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119054112/http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/documents/greenblum.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}, 105 Colum.

The '''one-electron universe''' postulate, proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] in a telephone call to [[Richard Feynman]] in the spring of 1940, hypothesises that all [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. According to Feynman:

{{cquote|I received a telephone call one day at the graduate college at Princeton from Professor Wheeler, in which he said, "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass" "Why?" "Because, they are all the same electron!"&lt;ref name=Feynman1965&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html | title= Nobel Lecture |date= 11 December 1965 | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|author=Richard Feynman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Overview==
The idea is based on the [[world line]]s traced out across [[spacetime]] by every electron. Rather than have myriad such lines, Wheeler suggested that they could all be parts of one single line like a huge tangled knot, traced out by the one electron. Any given moment in time is represented by a slice across spacetime, and would meet the knotted line a great many times. Each such meeting point represents a real electron at that moment.

At those points, half the lines will be directed forward in time and half will have looped round and be directed backwards. Wheeler suggested that these backwards sections appeared as the [[antiparticle]] to the electron, the positron.

Many more electrons have been observed than positrons, and electrons are thought to comfortably outnumber them. According to Feynman he raised this issue with Wheeler, who speculated that the missing positrons might be hidden within [[proton]]s.&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;

Feynman was struck by Wheeler's insight that antiparticles could be represented by reversed world lines, and credits this to Wheeler, saying in his Nobel speech:

{{cquote|I did not take the idea that all the electrons were the same one from [Wheeler] as seriously as I took the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole!&lt;ref name=Feynman1965/&gt;}}

Feynman later proposed this interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time in his 1949 paper "The Theory of Positrons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=6 |date=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749–759|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76..749F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |date=1950|bibcode=1950PThPh...5...82N |doi=10.1143/PTP.5.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic equations|Equations]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Onsager reciprocal relations''' express the equality of certain ratios between [[flux|flow]]s and [[force]]s in [[thermodynamic system]]s out of [[equilibrium (thermo)|equilibrium]], but where a notion of [[local thermodynamic equilibrium|local equilibrium]] exists.

"Reciprocal relations" occur between different pairs of forces and flows in a variety of physical systems. For example, consider fluid systems described in terms of temperature, matter density, and pressure. In this class of systems, it is known that [[temperature]] differences lead to [[heat]] flows from the warmer to the colder parts of the system; similarly, [[pressure]] differences will lead to [[matter]] flow from high-pressure to low-pressure regions. What is remarkable is the observation that, when both pressure and temperature vary, temperature differences at constant pressure can cause matter flow (as in [[convection]]) and pressure differences at constant temperature can cause heat flow. Perhaps surprisingly, the heat flow per unit of pressure difference and the [[density]] (matter) flow per unit of temperature difference are equal. This equality was shown to be necessary by [[Lars Onsager]] using [[statistical mechanics]] as a consequence of the [[time reversibility]] of microscopic dynamics ([[microscopic reversibility]]). The theory developed by Onsager is much more general than this example and capable of treating more than two thermodynamic forces at once, with the limitation that "the principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present", in which case "the reciprocal relations break down".&lt;ref name="onsager"&gt;L. Onsager, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v37/i4/p405_1 Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes. I., Phys. Rev. 37, 405–426 (1931)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the fluid system is perhaps described most intuitively, the high precision of electrical measurements makes experimental realisations of Onsager's reciprocity easier in systems involving electrical phenomena. In fact, Onsager's 1931 paper&lt;ref name="onsager" /&gt; refers to [[thermoelectricity]] and transport phenomena in [[electrolysis|electrolytes]] as well-known from the 19th century, including "quasi-thermodynamic" theories by [[Thomson effect#Thomson effect|Thomson]] and [[Helmholtz]] respectively. Onsager's reciprocity in the thermoelectric effect manifests itself in the equality of the Peltier (heat flow caused by a voltage difference) and Seebeck (electrical current caused by a temperature difference) coefficients of a thermoelectric material. Similarly, the so-called "direct [[piezoelectric effect|piezoelectric]]" (electrical current produced by mechanical stress) and "reverse piezoelectric" (deformation produced by a voltage difference) coefficients are equal. For many kinetic systems, like the [[Boltzmann equation]] or [[chemical kinetics]], the Onsager relations are closely connected to the principle of [[detailed balance#Onsager reciprocal relations and detailed balance|detailed balance]]&lt;ref name="onsager" /&gt; and follow from them in the linear approximation near equilibrium.

[[Experiment]]al verifications of the Onsager reciprocal relations were collected and analyzed by D. G. Miller&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Miller, Thermodynamics of irreversible processes. The experimental verification of the Onsager reciprocal relations, Chem. Rev. 60 (1960), 15–37.&lt;/ref&gt; for many classes of irreversible processes, namely for [[thermoelectricity]], [[Electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetics]], transference in [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] [[solution]]s, [[diffusion]], [[heat conduction|conduction of heat]] and [[conduction of electricity|electricity]] in [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] [[Solid-state physics|solids]], [[thermomagnetism]] and [[galvanomagnetism]]. In this classical review, [[chemical kinetics|chemical reactions]] are considered as "cases with meager" and inconclusive evidence. Further theoretical analysis and experiments support the reciprocal relations for chemical kinetics with transport.&lt;ref&gt;[[Grigoriy Yablonsky|G. S. Yablonsky]], [[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|A. N. Gorban]], D. Constales, V. V. Galvita and G. B. Marin, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1056v2.pdf Reciprocal relations between kinetic curves], EPL, 93 (2011) 20004.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his discovery of these reciprocal relations, [[Lars Onsager]] was awarded the 1968 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. The presentation speech referred to the three laws of thermodynamics and then added "It can be said that Onsager's reciprocal relations represent a further law making a thermodynamic study of irreversible processes possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1968/press.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1968. Presentation Speech.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have even described Onsager's relations as the "Fourth law of thermodynamics".&lt;ref&gt;For example Richard P. Wendt, Journal of Chemical Education v.51, p.646 (1974) "Sîmplified Transport Theory for Electrolyte Solutions"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example: Fluid system ==

=== The fundamental equation ===
The basic [[thermodynamic potential]] is internal [[energy]]. In a simple [[fluid]] system, neglecting the effects of [[viscosity]] the fundamental thermodynamic equation is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=T\,\mathrm{d}S-P\,\mathrm{d}V+\mu\,\mathrm{d}M&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' is the internal energy, ''T'' is temperature, ''S'' is entropy, ''P'' is the hydrostatic pressure, ''V'' is the volume, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the chemical potential, and ''M'' mass. In terms of the internal energy density, ''u'', entropy density ''s'', and mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the fundamental equation at fixed volume is written:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}u=T\,\mathrm{d}s+\mu\,\mathrm{d}\rho&lt;/math&gt;

For non-fluid or more complex systems there will be a different collection of variables describing the work term, but the principle is the same. The above equation may be solved for the entropy density:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}s = (1/T)\,\mathrm{d}u + (-\mu/T)\,\mathrm{d}\rho&lt;/math&gt;

The above expression of the first law in terms of entropy change defines the entropic [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variables]] of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, which are &lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\mu/T&lt;/math&gt; and are [[intensive quantity|intensive quantities]] analogous to [[potential energy|potential energies]]; their gradients are called thermodynamic forces as they cause flows of the corresponding extensive variables as expressed in the following equations.

=== The continuity equations ===

The conservation of mass is expressed locally by the fact that the flow of mass density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[continuity equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_\rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass flux vector. The formulation of energy conservation is generally not in the form of a continuity equation because it includes contributions both from the macroscopic mechanical energy of the fluid flow and of the microscopic internal energy. However, if we assume that the macroscopic velocity of the fluid is negligible, we obtain energy conservation in the following form:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_u = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy density and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_u&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy flux.

Since we are interested in a general imperfect fluid, entropy is locally not conserved and its local evolution can be given in the form of entropy density &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_s = \frac{\partial s_c}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s_c}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of increase in entropy density due to the irreversible processes of equilibration occurring in the fluid and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_s&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy flux.

=== The phenomenological equations ===

In the absence of matter flows, [[Fourier's law]] is usually written:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_{u} = -k\,\nabla T&lt;/math&gt;;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]]. However, this law is just a linear approximation, and holds only for the case where &lt;math&gt;\nabla T \ll T&lt;/math&gt;, with the thermal conductivity possibly being a function of the thermodynamic state variables, but not their gradients or time rate of change. Assuming that this is the case, Fourier's law may just as well be written:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_u = k T^2\nabla (1/T)&lt;/math&gt;;

In the absence of heat flows, [[Fick's law]] of diffusion is usually written:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_{\rho} = -D\,\nabla\rho&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''D'' is the coefficient of diffusion. Since this is also a linear approximation and since the chemical potential is monotonically increasing with density at a fixed temperature, Fick's law may just as well be written:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_{\rho} = D'\,\nabla(-\mu/T) \! &lt;/math&gt;

where, again, &lt;math&gt;D'&lt;/math&gt; is a function of thermodynamic state parameters, but not their gradients or time rate of change. For the general case in which there are both mass and energy fluxes, the phenomenological equations may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_{u} = L_{uu}\, \nabla (1/T) + L_{u\rho}\, \nabla (-\mu/T)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_{\rho} = L_{\rho u}\, \nabla (1/T) + L_{\rho\rho}\, \nabla (-\mu/T)&lt;/math&gt;

or, more concisely,
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}_\alpha = \sum_\beta L_{\alpha\beta}\,\nabla f_\beta&lt;/math&gt;

where the entropic "thermodynamic forces" conjugate to the "displacements" &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;f_u=(1/T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_\rho=(-\mu/T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the Onsager matrix of phenomenological coefficients.

=== The rate of entropy production ===

From the fundamental equation, it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s}{\partial t}=(1/T)\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+(-\mu/T)\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_s=(1/T)\mathbf{J}_u+(-\mu/T)\mathbf{J}_\rho=\sum_\alpha \mathbf{J}_\alpha f_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Using the continuity equations, the rate of entropy production may now be written:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s_c}{\partial t}= \mathbf{J}_u \cdot \nabla (1/T)+\mathbf{J}_\rho \cdot \nabla (-\mu/T)=\sum_\alpha \mathbf{J}_\alpha \cdot \nabla f_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

and, incorporating the phenomenological equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s_c}{\partial t}= \sum_\alpha\sum_\beta L_{\alpha \beta}(\nabla f_\alpha)\cdot(\nabla f_\beta)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that, since the entropy production must be greater than zero, the Onsager matrix of phenomenological coefficients &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive semi-definite matrix]].

=== The Onsager reciprocal relations ===

Onsager's contribution was to demonstrate that not only is &lt;math&gt;L_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; positive semi-definite, it is also symmetric, except in cases where time-reversal symmetry is broken. In other words, the cross-coefficients &lt;math&gt;\ L_{u\rho}&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\ L_{\rho u}&lt;/math&gt; are equal. The fact that they are at least proportional follows from simple [[dimensional analysis]] (''i.e.'', both coefficients are measured in the same [[unit (measurement)|unit]]s of temperature times mass density).

The rate of entropy production for the above simple example uses only two entropic forces, and a 2x2 Onsager phenomenological matrix. The expression for the linear approximation to the fluxes and the rate of entropy production can very often be expressed in an analogous way for many more general and complicated systems.

== Abstract formulation ==
Let &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; denote fluctuations from equilibrium values in several thermodynamic quantities, and let &lt;math&gt;S(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; be the entropy. Then, [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]] gives for the probability [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] &lt;math&gt;w =A\exp(S/k)&lt;/math&gt;, ''A''=const, since the probability of a given set of fluctuations &lt;math&gt;{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the number of microstates with that fluctuation. Assuming the fluctuations are small, the probability [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] can be expressed through the second differential of the entropy&lt;ref name="landau"&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Physics, Part 1|last=Landau |first=L. D.|author2=Lifshitz, E.M. |year=1975 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-81-8147-790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w=\tilde{A}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\beta_{ik}x_ix_k}\, ; \;\;\;\;\ \beta_{ik}= -\frac{1}{k}\frac{\partial^2 S}{\partial x_i \partial x_k}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where we are using [[Einstein summation convention]] and &lt;math&gt;\beta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive definite symmetric matrix.

Using the quasi-stationary equilibrium approximation, that is, assuming that the system is only slightly [[non-equilibrium]], we have&lt;ref name="landau"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i=-\lambda_{ik}x_k&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose we define ''thermodynamic conjugate'' quantities as &lt;math&gt;X_i=-\frac{1}{k}\frac{\partial S}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;, which can also be expressed as linear functions (for small fluctuations): &lt;math&gt;X_i= \beta_{ik}x_k&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we can write &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i=-\gamma_{ik}X_k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ik}=\lambda_{il}\beta^{-1}_{lk}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''kinetic coefficients''

The ''principle of symmetry of kinetic coefficients'' or the ''Onsager's principle'' states that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetric matrix, that is &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ik}=\gamma_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="landau"/&gt;

===Proof===

Define mean values &lt;math&gt;\xi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Xi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; of fluctuating quantities &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; respectively such that they take given values &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; Note that &lt;math&gt;\dot{\xi}_i(t)=-\gamma_{ik}\Xi_k&lt;/math&gt;

Symmetry of fluctuations under time reversal implies that &lt;math&gt;\langle x_i(t)x_k(0)\rangle=\langle x_i(-t)x_k(0)\rangle = \langle x_i(0)x_k(t)\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

or, with &lt;math&gt;\xi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\langle\xi_i(t)x_k\rangle=\langle x_i\xi_k(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and substituting, we get &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{il}\langle\Xi_l(t)x_k\rangle=\gamma_{kl}\langle x_i\Xi_l(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Putting &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; in the above equation, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{il}\langle X_lx_k\rangle=\gamma_{kl}\langle X_lx_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

It can be easily shown from the definition that &lt;math&gt;\langle X_ix_k\rangle=\delta_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;, and hence, we have the required result.

'''People's Democracy''' ('''PD''') was a political organisation that, while supporting the campaign for [[civil rights]] for [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Irish Catholic|Catholic minority]], stated that such rights could only be achieved through the establishment of a [[Socialist state|socialist republic]] for all of [[Ireland]].  It demanded more radical reforms of the [[government of Northern Ireland]] than the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] it came from.

==Foundation==
It was founded on 9 October 1968 at a meeting held in the [[Queen's University Belfast]] debating hall. A catalyst for its foundation had been the attack on a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) march in [[Derry]] on 5 October by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC).{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=101}}

The group consisted mainly of students who were involved with the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association or left wing groups such as the Labour Clubs and Young Socialist Alliance.

At the meeting the group decided on five aims:
* [[One man, one vote]]
* Repeal of the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]]
* An end to [[gerrymandering]] of electoral boundaries
* Freedom of speech and assembly
* Fair allocation of jobs and housing

It was initially led by a committee of ten members which consisted of Queen's University students Malcolm Miles, Fergus Woods, Anne McBurnley, Ian Godall, [[Bernadette Devlin]], Joe Martin, Eddie McCamely, Michael O'Kane and Patricia Drinan, as well as [[Kevin Boyle (lawyer)|Kevin Boyle]], a law lecturer at QUB.  Other prominent members included [[Cyril Toman]], [[Eamon McCann]] and [[Michael Farrell (activist)|Michael Farrell]].{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=102}}

The name of the group was selected by accident, according to [[Bernadette Devlin]].
{{quote|The next evening our leaflet and poster were approved by a mass meeting of the students, and taken off to be printed. John D. Murphy, our printer, got the material late at night and only then noticed that our organisation had no name. To comply with the law, he had to put up the name of the organisation responsible at the bottom of the leaflet, and, the story goes, he read through it, decided it was all about people's rights and christened us People's Democracy.{{sfn|Devlin|1969|p=103}} }}

After marches in Belfast, in imitation of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s]] [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], about 40 People's Democracy members held a four-day march between [[Belfast]] and Derry starting on 1 January 1969. The march was repeatedly attacked by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]] along its route, including an incident at [[Burntollet]] bridge on 4 January where the marchers were attacked by about 200 [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]], including off-duty [[Ulster Special Constabulary|special constables]], armed with iron bars, bottles and stones, while the RUC stood by and watched.&lt;ref&gt;''The IRA'' by Tim Pat Coogan ({{ISBN|978-0312294168}}), page 626&lt;/ref&gt;

PD became increasingly radicalised as a result of these events. They also attacked the [[Censorship in the Republic of Ireland|censorship laws in the Republic]] &amp;mdash; earning a rebuke from [[Ruairi Quinn]] and Basil Miller, then leaders of Students for Democratic Action, a revolutionary socialist student organisation, for letting [[British imperialism]] off the hook. In later years, members of the PD either quit politics altogether or became independent left-wing activists (such as Devlin and Farrell).

==Development==
In 1971, PD became a founder of the [[Socialist Labour Alliance]].

In the mid-1970s, the experience of the Ulster Workers' Council strike led to PD predicting a loyalist takeover in Northern Ireland, but it later came round to the view that this perspective was incorrect, giving loyalism a degree of autonomy from imperialism which it did not possess.&lt;ref&gt;John McAnulty ''A People Undefeated''&lt;/ref&gt;  The minority which clung to the old perspective left to form the Left Revolutionary Group, becoming the [[Red Republican Party]] in 1976, which was moribund by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, PD evolved towards [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] positions and, by merging with the [[Dublin]]-based [[Movement for a Socialist Republic]], was recognised by the [[reunified Fourth International]] as its Irish section.

PD was especially active around the issues of [[internment]] and prisoners' rights. Following the formation of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee in 1979 to build support for the Republican prisoners then on the "[[blanket protest]]" in support of political status and the subsequent death of [[Bobby Sands]] and nine of his comrades during the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|H-Block hunger strikes]], a number of members of the organisation, led by Vincent Doherty - then a member of the Political Committee and a former party general election candidate - argued that PD should join Sinn Féin, which had moved openly to the left in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In [[Northern Ireland local elections, 1981|1981]], two members of People's Democracy were elected to [[Belfast City Council]]. John McAnulty and Fergus O'Hare were elected in a joint campaign with the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party|IRSP]]. [[Fergus O'Hare]] won the council seat of [[Gerry Fitt]], a sitting Westminster MP. O'Hare had been a founding member of the National H-Block/Armagh Committee and had previously been chairperson of the Political Hostages Release Committee which spearheaded the campaign against internment in the early 1970s. He subsequently went on to found the first Irish-language secondary school in Northern Ireland [[Meánscoil Feirste]].

When Sinn Féin ended its boycott of elections and gained mass support among the republican community, PD entered a political crisis. From 1982 on, a number of activists left them and joined Sinn Féin. At a PD national conference in 1986, a group including [[Anne Speed]] proposed the dissolution of the group and that the members all join SF as individuals. This position was defeated by 19 votes to five. A few weeks later the minority of five resigned from PD followed by their supporters and joined [[Sinn Féin]]. The remaining rump who continued to oppose this view maintained PD as a small propaganda group.

In the early 1990s the remaining members of PD initiated the [[Irish Committee for a Marxist Programme]] as an attempt to regroup [[socialists]] and left wing [[Irish Republicanism|republicans]]. This project ended in 1996, when PD dissolved and reconstituted itself as [[Socialist Democracy (Ireland)|Socialist Democracy]], adopting the program put forward by the ICMP.

{{wiktionary}}

A '''political football''' is a topic or issue that is seized on by opposing political parties or factions and made a more political issue than it might initially seem to be. "To make a political football" [out of something] is defined in [[William Safire]]'s ''Safire's Political Dictionary'' as "To thrust a social, national security, or otherwise ostensibly non-political matter into partisan politics".  In 1953 the gangster [[Lucky Luciano]] complained in an interview to Safire that "I been a political football".&lt;ref name="saf 555"/&gt; 

A less-used meaning, is a political issue that is continually debated but left unresolved.  The term is often used during a political election [[Political campaign|campaign]] to highlight issues that have not been completely addressed, such as the [[natural environment]] and [[abortion]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==History==

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has English examples of the use of "football" (the ball, not the game) in a figurative sense for something helplessly tossed around by others as early as the 16th century, for example, from about 1600: "I am the verye foote-ball of the starres". The phrase is used by the ''[[Bangor, Maine]] Whig and Courier'' in 1857.&lt;ref name="saf 555"&gt;Safire, 555&lt;/ref&gt; An American cartoon  from the time of [[Benjamin Harrison|President Harrison]] in 1889 shows a clear visual illustration of the metaphor, without using the actual phrase. It is now equally popular in other English-speaking countries, where the association is naturally with [[association football]] ("soccer") or the predominant local form of football.

==Other football metaphors in American politics==
Many other [[American football]] terms are in common use in the United States. Once a topic or issue has presented itself, the opposition will take the issue and "[[Rush (football)|run with it]]" and "try to score points". There may be many parties in opposition to take up the topic, and sometimes run it into the ground, which at times can "backfire" and end up hurting the opposing faction. This can happen to the point of that party being seen as "[[Fumble|fumbling]]" the issue. When a party or candidate ends up ignoring or putting off the issue, they are said to be "[[Punt (gridiron football)|punting]]" it.  In addition to the opponents of the politician or party using the subject as political fuel, the [[Mass media|media]] may also "run with it". "[[Moving the goalposts]]" is the practice of changing the criteria of something while it is in progress (such as an investigation or a hearing) in order to offer one side an inherent advantage or disadvantage. Sometimes these matters become larger, like during an election, than anyone would have thought possible during the event itself.

Other countries also use metaphors drawn from their local sport in discussing politics, such as [[association football|soccer]], [[Australian rules football]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]]/[[rugby league]] or [[cricket]].

In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[category theory]], a '''polygraph''' is a generalisation of a [[directed graph]].  It is also known as a '''computad'''.  They were introduced as "polygraphs" by [[Albert Burroni]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Burroni. ''Higher-dimensional word problems with applications to equational logic''. TCS, 115(1):43--62, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "computads" by [[Ross Street]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Street. Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors. Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, 8(2):149--181, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way that a [[Multigraph#Directed_multigraph_(edges_without_own_identity)|directed multigraph]] can [[Free object|freely]] generate a [[Category (mathematics)|category]], an ''n''-computad is the "most general" structure which can generate a free [[n-category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=computad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relapse prevention''' ('''RP''') is a [[cognitive-behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach to [[relapse]] with the goal of identifying and preventing high-risk situations such as substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive behavior, sexual offending, obesity, and depression.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"&gt;Witkiewitz, K. &amp; Marlatt, G.A. (2004). Relapse Prevention for Alcohol and Drug Problems. American Psychologist, 59, 4, 224-235.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an important component in the treatment process for [[alcoholism]], or [[alcohol dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=Mary E.|author2=Palmer, Rebekka S. |author3=Marlatt, G. Alan |date=1999|title=Relapse Prevention|publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/151-160.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalbug.com/what-is-alcohol-addiction-what-causes-alcohol-addiction/#more-164|title=What is Alcohol Addiction: What Causes Alcohol Addiction?|date=6 January 2012|publisher=Medical Bug|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying assumptions==
Relapse is seen as both an outcome and a transgression in the process of behavior change. An initial setback or lapse may translate into either a return to the previous problematic behavior, known as relapse, or the individual turning again towards positive change, called prolapse.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt; A relapse often occurs in the following stages: emotional relapse, mental relapse, and finally, physical relapse. Each stage is characterized by feelings, thoughts, and actions that ultimately lead to the individual returning to their old behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ambrosiatc.com/addiction/relapse-prevention-comeback/?ambTRK=PR |title=Relapse Prevention &amp; Comeback |date= September 15, 2016|website=Ambrosia Treatment Center |publisher= Ambrosia Treatment Center |access-date= June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relapse is thought to be multi-determined, especially by self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, coping, emotional states, and interpersonal factors. In particular, high [[self-efficacy]], negative outcome [[Expectancy theory|expectancies]], potent availability of [[coping skills]] following treatment, positive [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], and functional [[social support]] are expected to predict positive outcome. Craving has not historically been shown to serve as a strong predictor of relapse.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt;

==Efficacy and effectiveness==
Carroll ''et al''. conducted a review of 24 other trials and concluded that RP was more effective than no treatment and was equally effective as other active treatments such as [[supportive psychotherapy]] and [[interpersonal therapy]] in improving substance use outcomes. Irvin and colleagues also conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of RP techniques in the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and polysubstance use, and upon reviewing 26 studies, concluded that RP was successful in reducing substance use and improving psychosocial adjustment. RP seemed to be most effective for individuals with alcohol problems, suggesting that certain characteristics of alcohol use are amenable to the RP.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt; Miller et al. (1996) found the GORSKI/CENAPS relapse warning signs to be a good predictor of the occurrence of relapse on the AWARE scale (r = .42, p &lt; .001).

==Systems theory==
Some theorists, including [[Katie Witkiewitz]] and [[G. Alan Marlatt]], borrowing ideas from [[systems theory]], conceptualize relapse as a multidimensional, [[complex system]]. Such a [[nonlinear]] [[dynamical system]] is believed to be able to best predict the data witnessed, which commonly includes cases where small changes introduced into the equation seem to have large effects. The model also introduces concepts of self-organization, feedback loops, timing/context effects, and interplay between tonic and phasic processes.&lt;ref name="Marlatt"/&gt;

Rami Jumnoodoo and Dr. Patrick Coyne, in London UK, have been working with [[National Health Service]] users and carers over the past ten years to transfer RP theory into the field of adult mental health. The uniqueness of the model is the sustainment of change by developing service users and carers as 'experts' - following RP as an educational process and graduating as Relapse Prevention Practitioners. The work has won many national awards, been presented at many conferences, and has resulted in a number of publications.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Terence Gorski MA has developed the CENAPS (Center for Applied Science)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenaps.com/The_Cenaps_Corporation/Home.html CENAPS (Center for Applied Science)]&lt;/ref&gt; model for relapse prevention including Relapse Prevention Counseling (Gorski, Counseling For Relapse Prevention, 1983) and a system for certification of Relapse Prevention Specialists (CRPS).

[[File:Sauwastika swastika comparison.svg|thumb|274px|Comparison between left-facing "sauwastika" and right-facing "swastika"]]

The term '''''sauwastika'''''  (or ''sauvastika''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika - Hindu Symbols |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/576371/swastika |title=swastika (symbol) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1935-09-15 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (as a character: 卍) is sometimes used to distinguish the left-facing from the right-facing [[swastika]] symbol, a meaning which developed in 19th century scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;In use from the 1850s, certainly so used by D'Alviella (1894) "[[sauvastika]]" is used to classify the geometrical form  of symbols in Liungman, Carl G., ''Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms'', HME Publishing (2004) {{ISBN|91-972705-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-facing variant is favoured in [[Bön]] and [[Gurung Dharma]]; it is called ''yungdrung'' in Bon and ''Gurung Yantra'' in Gurung Dharma. Both the right-facing and left-facing variants are employed in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]; however, the ''left-facing'' is more commonly used in Buddhism than Hinduism and the right-facing is more commonly used in Hinduism than Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanskrit.org/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-swastika/ |title=What is the meaning of a Swastika? |publisher=Sanskrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism the left-facing sauwastika is imprinted on the chest, feet, palms of Buddha and also the first of the 65 auspicious symbols on the footprint of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/symbols/swastika.htm |title=Swastika Symbol in Buddhism - Buddhist Swastika |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swastikaphobia.com/buddhist.html |title=Buddhist - The Swastikaphobia Project |publisher=Swastikaphobia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism the left-facing sauwastika is associated with esoteric tantric practices and often stands for Goddess [[Kali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/~bmori/syll/315syll/Swastika.html |title=Swastika |publisher=Cla.calpoly.edu |date=1935-09-05 |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhas-online.com/swastika.html |title=The Swastika or WAN Symbol in Asian Art - The Heart of Buddha |publisher=Buddhas-online.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Sanskrit]] ''sauvastika'' is the adjective derived from ''svastika'' through the standard process of [[vṛddhi]] of the vowel ''u'' in the initial syllable.   (''Svastika'' is the transformation of "su asti" + "ka" through [[sandhi]].  Vrddhi applies to the original form before sandhi.)  It is attested as an adjective meaning "benedictive, salutatory".&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Horace Hayman Wilson|Wilson]] (1819), cited by [[Monier-Williams]].&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to a "reversed" ''svastika'' is probably first made by  [[Eugène Burnouf]] in 1852, and taken up by [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]] in ''Ilios'' (1880), based on a letter from [[Max Müller]], who is in turn quoting Burnouf. The term ''sauwastika'' is used in the sense of "backwards swastika" by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]] (1894): "In India it [the ''[[gammadion]]''] bears the name of ''swastika'', when its arms are bent towards the right, and ''sauwastika'' when they are turned in the other direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/sym/mosy/mosy06.htm#page_40 ''The Migration of Symbols''], by [[Eugène Goblet d'Alviella]], (1894), p.40 at [[sacred-texts.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been misspelled as ''suavastika'', a term attributed to Max Müller by Wilson (1896).
Wilson  finds that "The 'suavastika' which Max Müller names and believes was applied to the swastika sign, with the ends bent to the left ... seems not to be reported with that meaning by any other author except Burnouf."&lt;ref&gt;On Oriental Carpets. Article III.—The Svastika, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs (1903) also uses the term with reference to Müller.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of a distinction in Indian religions==
[[Image:buddhistswastika.jpg|thumb|225px|"Left-facing" swastika on a Buddhist temple in [[Korea]].]]
[[Image:Kipling swastika.png|frame|Left-facing swastika from a 1911 edition of [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'']]
[[Eugene Burnouf]], the first Western expert on Buddhism, stated in his book ''Lotus de la bonne loi'' (1852) that the ''sauvastika'' was a Buddhist variant of the ''svastika''.

When [[Heinrich Schliemann]] discovered swastika motifs in [[Troy]], he wrote to the Indologist [[Max Müller]], who, quoting Burnouf, confirmed this distinction, adding that "the ''svastika'' was originally a symbol of the sun, perhaps of the vernal sun as opposed to the autumnal sun, the ''sauvastika'', and, therefore, a natural symbol of light, life, health, peace and wealth." The letter was published in Schliemann's book ''Ilios'' (1880):
{{quote|"In the footprints of Buddha the Buddhists recognize no less than sixty-five auspicious signs, the first of them being the Svastika ..." (Eugene Burnouf, ''Lotus de la bonne loi'', p. 625); “the fourth is the sauvastika {{sic}}, or that with the arms turned to the left.”}}

The term ''sauvastika'' thus cannot be confirmed as authentic and is probably due to Burnouf (1852).  Notions that sauwastikas are considered "evil" or inauspicious versions of the auspicious swastika in [[Indian religions]] have even less substance, since even Burnouf counts the svastika and the sauvastika equally among the "sixty-five auspicious signs".

D'Alviella (1894) voices doubts about the distinction:
{{quote|sign=|source=|Would it not be simpler to admit that the direction of the branches is of secondary importance in the symbolism of the gammadion?  When it is desired to symbolize the progress of the sun, namely, its faculty of translation through space, rather than the direction in which it turns, little attention will have been paid to the direction given to the rays. (p. 68)}}

Although the more common form is the right-facing swastika, the symbol is used in both orientations for the sake of balance in [[Hinduism]]. Buddhists almost always use the left-facing swastika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Use==
The sauwastika was a favorite symbol of the last Russian Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]. She put this sign everywhere for good luck. In particular, she drew it with a pencil on the wall, at the window opening, and on the wallpaper above the bed of her son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich]] in [[Ipatiev House]], where the murdered Emperor's family spent the last days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Gilliard]]. Thirteen Years at the Russian Court&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[complex systems]] and [[hierarchy theory]], the concept of scale refers to the combination of (1) the level of analysis (for example, analyzing the whole or a specific component of the system); and (2) the level of observation (for example, observing a system as an external viewer or as an internal participant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ahl |first1=Valerie |last2=Allen |first2=Timothy F.

For example, on at the scale of analysis of a given population of zebras, the number of predators (e.g. lions) determines the number of preys that survives after hunting, while at the scale of analysis of the ecosystem, the availability of preys determines how many predators can survive in a given area. The semantic categories of "prey" and "predator" are not given, but are defined by the observer.

'''''Seny''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsɛɲ|ec}}; from Proto-Germanic *sinnaz) is a form of ancestral [[Catalonia|Catalan]] wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action.  More specifically, a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' anthropologist defined ''seny'' as "a kind of refined good sense and self-realization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic People of the World|page=181|last=Kostyal|first=K.M.|year=2001|publisher=''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''|ISBN=0-7922-6401-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''seny'' is known as '''''rauxa''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈrawʃə|pron}}) "sudden determination or action".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=rauxa&amp;operEntrada=0]''Institut d'Estudis Catalans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Many Catalans consider ''seny'' something unique to their culture, a true [[Catalan symbols|Catalan symbol]]. ''Seny'' as a particular characteristic of Catalan society is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the [[Ethics|scale of values]] and [[Sociology|social norms]] of traditional Catalan rural society. The values of ''seny'' were transmitted from generation to generation without much change by the exemplary behaviour of the elder members of the family, as well as in the shape of aphorisms and moral stories. The latter were largely based on [[Christian]] values and their examples and illustrations often included animals and plants that were common in rural Catalonia.

This oral lore caught the attention of [[Josep Torras i Bages]], bishop of [[Vic]] at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Torras i Bages, ''La tradició catalana'', 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
He became very interested in the pattern in which the ''seny'' was transmitted from one generation to the other as an [[oral tradition]]. Thus he encouraged [[Josep Abril i Virgili]] (1869–1918), a writer, to gather the moral stories and illustrate them in a book that was published as ''Bon seny'' ("Good sense"). This more or less representative compilation of moral lessons regarding ''seny'' was illustrated by artist [[Joan Junceda]] (1881–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 Joan Junceda: l'Enciclopèdia&amp;nbsp;– enciclopedia.cat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219034538/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in the Catalan language before the [[Spanish Civil War]] ''Bon seny'' became rare during [[General Franco]]'s era, when so much Catalan printed material had been burned and printing in Catalan was severely restricted.&lt;ref&gt;'''Bon seny''', aforismes, faules i acudits; Balmes DL, Barcelona, Reprinted 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ''seny'' proverbs that defined traditional Catalan values have lost most of their sense today. The reason is the erosion of Christian values as fundamental in present-day [[Postchristianity|postchristian]] Catalan society, which sees itself today as a society based largely on secular principles.

''Seny'' is mentioned in the motto of [[castell]]s, the Catalan tradition of building human towers, as one of the values of that endeavour: ''Força, equilibri, valor i seny'' (strength, balance, courage, and ''seny'').

==Examples==
*Many of the ''seny'' aphorisms are short:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Tenen els plaers de la vida,
:''bona entrada i mala eixida.

:''L'home avar és com el porc,
:''no aprofita fins que és mort.

:''No vos 'nemoreu, amor,
:''de cap fadrina gallarda
:''que és com la flor d'olivarda
:''molt guapa, i dolenta d'olor

:''Home pelut,
:''o és molt savi o és molt ruc.
||
:The pleasures of life have,
:a good entrance and a bad exit.

:The tight-fisted man is like a pig,
:he is only useful after death.

:My dear one, don't fall in love
:with any woman who only has good looks,
:she is like a [[false yellowhead]] ''(Dittrichia viscosa)'' flower:
:beautiful, but full of stench (unpleasantness).

:A hairy man,
:is either very wise or (brutish) like a donkey.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

*The following story, ''La rata magra'' o ''La rata engarjolada'', illustrates the dangers of greed:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Rata magra veu l'ocell,''
:''tranquil a dintre sa gàbia,''
:''i, amb tota la seva ràbia, s'hi fica;
:''i el passarell té un surt fort, i es mort.''

:''Rata magra s'el cruspeix,''
:''mes s'ha tant ben atipada,''
:''que, de cop, no té passada.''

:''Moral:''
:''Quan t'atii la maldat,''
:''pensa aixó que es veritat:''
:''Panxa prim hi passaràs,''
:''massa fart t'hi quedaràs.''

||

:The lean rat sees the bird
:sitting quietly in its cage,
:and full of anger she enters it
:and the bird dies startled.

:The lean rat eats it,
:but she has filled her belly so much
:that, suddenly, she is not able to leave (the cage).

:''Morale:''
:When evil tempts you,
:think about the following truth:
:With a lean belly you will escape
:Too full, you will be trapped.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8880">'''Syneisaktism''' is the practice of "spiritual marriage", which is where a man and a woman who have both taken [[vows of chastity]] live together in a chaste and non-legalized partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Patricia Cox, ed. Women in Early Christianity : Translations from Greek Texts. Washington, DC, USA: Catholic University of America Press, 2012. Pg. 117. ProQuest ebrary.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, the woman would move into the house of the man, and they would live as brother and sister, both committed to the continuation of their vows of chastity. The women who entered into a spiritual marriage were known as ''subintroductae'' ("those brought in covertly"), ''agapetae'' ("beloved ones"), and ''syneisaktoi'' ("those brought into the house together").&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; This practice emerged around the 2nd century CE, and survived into the Middle Ages, despite being condemned by numerous church leaders, writers, and councils.

==Emergence==
The practice of asceticism grew in the early years of [[Christianity]] due to the teachings of both [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Jesus Christ]], who suggested that a celibate life was the best way to prepare for life in the Kingdom of God.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli, Elizabeth. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 2, no. 1 (Spring, 1986): 65. Accessed March 6, 2015. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25002030.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have also emerged as an alternative to [[martyrdom]], so that the faithful could reach the Kingdom of Heaven and receive their rewards in the afterlife without giving their lives. It became more and more popular as Christianity became accepted and legalized in the [[Roman Empire]] and martyrdoms became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginity became a favoured alternative to earthly marriage, promoted by writers such as [[Eusebius of Emesa]] and [[Jerome]], all of whom saw marriage as promoting evil, quarrels, and the road to sin and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Castelli. "Virginity and Its Meaning for Women's Sexuality in Early Christianity." 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginity emerged as a popular practice for women around the 2nd century CE, although it became more fully developed during the next couple of centuries, and it became "constructed as a form of liberation not only from the strictures of marriage and childbearing, but also from physical passion and materiality",&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 78&lt;/ref&gt; which were considered sinful and dangerous to the soul.

One issue that many ascetic virgins, especially women, came across was how they were to live once they denounced marriage and earthly pleasures. Some independently wealthy women were able to seclude themselves on their estates, others were supported by family, but many had no means with which to support themselves. Monasteries for women were a later development; in the 2nd century CE there would have been very few in existence. Thus, spiritual marriage may have emerged as a solution to this problem. An ascetic woman would have gone to live with an ascetic man in his house, living as brother and sister in a sort of unofficial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Women in Early Christianity. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual marriages would have also offered a rare opportunity for a man and a woman to engage in an emotionally and spiritually intimate friendship, something that was next to unheard of in the ancient world, in which it was believed that men and women could never be friends, as friendship implied parity, and the sexes were not considered equal.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elizabeth A. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae"" Church History 46, no. 2 (1977): 183. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3165004.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, spiritual marriages would have been a desirable option for both ascetic men and women.

==Condemnation==
Despite the appeal of spiritual marriages, subintroductae and the practice itself were continuously condemned by various councils, writers, and theologians. John 20:17 was one New Testament verse that was used as evidence that spiritual marriage was not endorsed by Christ, as Jesus pushes away [[Mary Magdelene]] with the command "touch me not".&lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae""172.&lt;/ref&gt; Various other authorities and texts were used, with writers building upon earlier arguments in response to the flourishing practice.

===Councils===
The earliest council to condemn the virgines subintroductae and the practice of spiritual marriage was the [[Council of Antioch (268)]], and this stance was reiterated at the [[Synod of Elvira]] in 300 (Canon 27: "a bishop or any other clergy may have living with him only a sister or a virgin daughter dedicated to God; by no means shall he keep any woman unrelated to him".&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenröther, Alois Knöpfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et Ané. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.&lt;/ref&gt;), at Ancyra in 317, and at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nicaea denounces spiritual marriage in its third canon, which forbids any clergy member from living with a woman unless she is a relative.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgens, W.A. "First Council of Nicaea." In The Faith of the Early Fathers: Pre-Nicene and Nicene Eras, 283. Liturgical Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decrees against spiritual marriage and the subintroductae continued to be issued by various authorities all over Europe until the Middle Ages &lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae"". 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writers===
Church writers and theologians also spoke out against the practice of spiritual marriage, more often than not condemning it. Those who wrote about this subject include [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Jerome]], [[Eusebius of Emesa]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], and [[John Chrysostom]], among others.

===Athanasius of Alexandria===
[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] was a fourth century writer who wrote two letters on the subject of virginity. The second letter is addressed to a group of virgins newly returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He gives advice on how to continue their ascetic lives properly, including a section on spiritual marriage. Here, he condemns the practice of spiritual marriage and of the subintroductae, suggesting that it is a betrayal of the Bridegroom Christ to whom all virgins devote their life to when they take their vows of chastity. He mentions those virgins who "dare[d] even to live and mix with men, not considering such a great danger or how easy it is to fall in this life" &lt;ref&gt;Miller, Patricia Cox. "Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections)." In Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 118-123. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to call on women to abandon their practice of spiritual marriage, "lest you break your covenant with the heavenly bridegroom".&lt;ref&gt;"Athanasius of Alexandria: Second Letter to Virgins (selections)." in Women in Early Christianity. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Chrysostom===
John Chrysostom, another fourth-century writer, wrote two treatises on the subject of spiritual marriage, both condemning the practice. He suggests that living together chastely will only intensify lust for one another, as it is never satisfied by sexual intercourse ("sexual desire...serves to still passion and often leads the man to satiation... But with a virgin, nothing of this sort happens...the men who live with them are stirred by a double desire"&lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins." Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts, 124-125. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;), and that it was not spiritual love but lust that drew these couples together; &lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: Instruction and Refutation Against Those Men Living With Virgins" Women in Early Christianity. 129&lt;/ref&gt; like Athanasius, he sees spiritual marriage as a betrayal of Christ the Bridegroom as well.&lt;ref&gt;"John Chrysostom: On the Necessity of Guarding Virginity." Translated by Patricia Cox Miller. Women in Early Christianity: Translations from Greek Texts,149. Washington, DC.: Catholic University of America Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His protests also show the prevailing views of men and women that existed during this time, as his writing suggests that spiritual marriage goes against traditional views of men and women occupying separate spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Clark. "John Chrysostom and the "Subintroductae""183.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''system context diagram''' (SCD) in [[engineering]] is a [[diagram]] that defines the boundary between the [[system]], or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it.&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Kumar Choubey (2012) ''IT Infrastructure and Management (For the GBTU and MMTU)''. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This diagram is a high level view of a [[system]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]].

== Overview == 
System context diagrams show a system, as a whole and its [[Input/output|input]]s and [[Output (computing)|output]]s from/to external factors. According to Kossiakoff and Sweet (2011):&lt;ref name="KoSw03"&gt;Alexander Kossiakoff, William N. Sweet (2011). ''Systems Engineering: Principles and Practices'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|System Context Diagrams&amp;nbsp;... represent all external entities that may interact with a system&amp;nbsp;... Such a diagram pictures the system at the center, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environments and activities. The objective of the system context diagram is to focus attention on external factors and events that should be considered in developing a complete set of systems requirements and constraints.}}

System context diagrams are used early in a project to get agreement on the scope under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wiener (1998) ''Journal of Object-oriented Programming''. Vol 11. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Context diagrams are typically included in a requirements document. These diagrams must be read by all project stakeholders and thus should be written in plain language, so the stakeholders can understand items within the document.

== Building blocks ==
Context diagrams can be developed with the use of two types of building blocks:
* ''Entities (Actors)'': labeled boxes; one in the center representing the system, and around it multiple boxes for each external actor
* ''Relationships'': labeled lines between the entities and system

For example, "customer places order." Context diagrams can also use many different drawing types to represent external entities. They can use [[Oval (geometry)|oval]]s, [[stick figure]]s, [[picture]]s, [[clip art]] or any other representation to convey meaning. Decision trees and data storage are represented in system flow diagrams.

A context diagram can also list the classifications of the external entities as one of a set of simple categories&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Robertson, James C. Robertson (2006) ''Mastering the Requirements Process''. Pearson Education, 17 mrt. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (Examples:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/81429/RESCUE_i_SD_tutorial.pdf System Goal Modelling using the i*: Approach in RESCUE] Centre HCI Design, 27 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;), which add clarity to the level of involvement of the entity with regards to the system. These categories include:
* ''Active'': Dynamic to achieve some goal or purpose (Examples: "Article readers" or "customers").
* ''Passive'': Static external entities which infrequently interact with the system (Examples: "Article editors" or "database administrator").
* ''Cooperative'': Predictable external entities which are used by the system to bring about some desired outcome (Examples: "Internet service providers" or "shipping companies").
* ''Autonomous (Independent)'': External entities which are separated from the system, but affect the system indirectly, by means of imposed constraints or similar influences (Examples: "regulatory committees" or "standards groups").

== Alternatives ==
The best system context diagrams are used to display how a system interoperates at a very high level, or how systems operate and interact logically. The system context diagram is a necessary tool in developing a baseline interaction between systems and actors; actors and a system or systems and systems. Alternatives to the system context diagram are:

[[File:Greater Yellowstone Rural ITS Architecture Interconnect Diagram.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram.&lt;ref name="USDT06"/&gt;]]
* ''Architecture Interconnect Diagram'': The figure gives an example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram: A representation of the Albuquerque regional ITS architecture interconnects for the Albuquerque Police Department that was generated using the Turbo Architecture tool is shown in the figure. Each block represents an ITS inventory element, including the name of the stakeholder in the top shaded portion. The interconnect lines between elements are solid or dashed, indicating existing or planned connections.&lt;ref name="USDT06"/&gt;
* ''[[Business Model Canvas]]'', a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances.[1] It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.
* ''[[Enterprise data model]]'': this type of [[data model]] according to Simsion (2005) can contain up to 50 to 200 entity classes, which results from specific "high level of generalization in [[data modeling]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeme Simsion|Graeme C. Simsion]], Graham C. Witt (2005). ''Data Modeling Essentials''. p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''IDEF0 Top Level Context Diagram'': The [[IDEF0]] process starts with the identification of the prime function to be decomposed. This function is identified on a "Top Level Context Diagram" that defines the scope of the particular IDEF0 analysis.
* ''[[Problem Frames Approach#Problem diagrams|Problem Diagrams (Problem Frames)]]'': In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows requirements and requirements references.
* ''[[Use case diagram]]'': One of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagrams. They also represent the scope of the project at a similar level of abstraction. - Use Cases, however, tend to focus more on the goals of 'actors' who interact with the system, and do not specify any solution. Use Case diagrams represent a set of Use Cases, which are textual descriptions of how an actor achieves the goal of a use case. for Example Customer Places Order.

Most of these diagrams work well as long as a limited number of interconnects will be shown. Where twenty or more interconnects must be displayed, the diagrams become quite complex and can be difficult to read.&lt;ref name="USDT06"&gt;US Department of Transportation, Office of Operations (2006)[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/regitsarchguide/5defineint.htm Regional ITS Architecture Guidance Document].

In [[psychology]], the '''theory of planned behavior''' (abbreviated '''TPB''') is a theory that links one's beliefs and [[behavior]].

The theory states that attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, together shape an individual's behavioral intentions and behaviors.

The concept was proposed by [[Icek Ajzen]] to improve on the predictive power of the [[theory of reasoned action]] by including perceived behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ajzen|first=Icek|title=The theory of planned behavior|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|date=1991|volume=50|issue=2|pages=179–211|doi=10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been applied to studies of the relations among [[beliefs]], attitudes, [[Theory of planned behavior#Concepts of key variables|behavioral intentions]] and behaviors in various fields such as [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[advertising campaign]]s, [[healthcare]], sport management and sustainability.

==History==

===Extension from the theory of reasoned action===
The theory of planned behavior was proposed by Icek Ajzen in 1985 through his article "From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. (1985). From intentions to actions: A theory of planned behavior. In J. Kuhl &amp; J. Beckmann (Eds.), ''Action control: From cognition to behavior''. Berlin, Heidelber, New York: Springer-Verlag. (pp. 11-39).&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from the [[theory of reasoned action]], which was proposed by [[Martin Fishbein]] together with Icek Ajzen in 1980. The theory of reasoned action was in turn grounded in various theories of attitude such as [[learning theories]], [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-value theories]], consistency theories (such as Heider's [[balance theory]], Osgood and Tannenbaum's congruity theory, and Festinger's [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance theory]]) and [[attribution theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M. &amp; Ajzen, I. (1975). Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of reasoned action, if people evaluate the suggested behavior as positive (attitude), and if they think their significant others want them to perform the behavior (subjective norm), this results in a higher intention (motivations) and they are more likely to do so. A high correlation of attitudes and subjective norms to behavioral intention, and subsequently to behavior, has been confirmed in many studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppard | first1 = B.H. | last2 = Hartwick | first2 = J. | last3 = Warshaw | first3 = P.R. | year = 1988 | title = The theory of reasoned action: A meta-analysis of past research with recommendations for modifications and future research | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–343 | doi=10.1086/209170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counter-argument against the high relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior has also been proposed, as the results of some studies show that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norberg | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Horne | first2 = D. R. | last3 = Horne | first3 = D. A. | year = 2007 | title = The privacy paradox: Personal information disclosure intentions versus behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Affairs | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 100–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6606.2006.00070.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of circumstantial limitations, behavioral intention does not always lead to actual behavior. Namely, since behavioral intention cannot be the exclusive determinant of behavior where an individual's control over the behavior is incomplete, Ajzen introduced the theory of planned behavior by adding a new component, "perceived behavioral control". By this, he extended the theory of reasoned action to cover non-volitional behaviors for predicting behavioral intention and actual behavior.

The most recent addition of a third factor, perceived behavioral control, refers to the degree to which a person believes that they control any given behavior (class notes). The theory of planned behavior suggests that people are much more likely to intend to enact certain behaviors when they feel that they can enact them successfully.  Increased perceived behavioral control is a mix of two dimensions: self-efficacy and controllability (170). Self-efficacy refers to the level of difficulty that is required to perform the behavior, or one's belief in their own ability to succeed in performing the behavior. Controllability refers to the outside factors, and one's belief that they personally have control over the performance of the behavior, or if it is controlled by externally, uncontrollable factors. If a person has high perceived behavioral control, then they have an increased confidence that they are capable of performing the specific behavior successfully.

The theory has since been improved and renamed the [[reasoned action approach]] by Azjen and his colleague Martin Fishbein.

===Extension of self-efficacy===
In addition to attitudes and subjective norms (which make the theory of reasoned action), the theory of planned behavior adds the concept of ''perceived behavioral control'', which originates from [[self-efficacy]] theory (SET). Self-efficacy was proposed by Bandura in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bandura|first1 = A.|journal = Psychological Review|date = 1977|volume = 84|issue = 2|page = 191|title = Self-efficacy: toward a unifying theory of behavioral change|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came from [[social cognitive theory]]. According to Bandura, expectations such as motivation, performance, and feelings of frustration associated with repeated failures determine effect and behavioral reactions. Bandura separated expectations into two distinct types: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined self-efficacy as the conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes. The ''outcome expectancy'' refers to a person's estimation that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. He states that self-efficacy is the most important precondition for behavioral change, since it determines the initiation of coping behavior.
Previous investigations have shown that peoples' behavior is strongly influenced by their confidence in their ability to perform that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A. | last2 = Adams | first2 = N. E. | last3 = Hardy | first3 = A. B. | last4 = Howells | first4 = G.

J. (2005). Correlations of Depression and Total Mood Disturbance with Physical Activity and Self-Concept in Preadolescents Enrolled in an After-School Exercise Program 1.

==Concepts of key variables==

===Normative beliefs and subjective norms===
* '''Normative belief''': an individual's perception of social [[normative]] pressures, or relevant others' beliefs that he or she should or should not perform such behavior.
* '''Subjective norm''': an individual's perception about the particular behavior, which is influenced by the judgment of significant others (e.g., parents, spouse, friends, teachers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amjad | first1 = N. | last2 = Wood | first2 = A.M. | year = 2009 | title = Identifying and changing the normative beliefs about aggression which lead young Muslim adults to join extremist anti-Semitic groups in Pakistan | url = http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/amjadwood.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Aggressive Behavior | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 514–519 | doi=10.1002/ab.20325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control beliefs and perceived behavioral control===
* '''Control beliefs''': an individual's beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or hinder performance of the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 2001 | title = Nature and operation of attitudes | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 27–58 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of perceived behavioral control is conceptually related to self-efficacy.
* '''Perceived behavioral control''': an individual's perceived ease or [[Difficulty of engagement|difficulty of performing]] the particular behavior.&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"/&gt; It is assumed that perceived behavioral control is determined by the total set of accessible control beliefs.

===Behavioral intention and behavior===
* '''Behavioral intention''': an indication of an individual's readiness to perform a given behavior. It is assumed to be an immediate antecedent of behavior.&lt;ref name=Ajzen02&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I | year = 2002 | title = Perceived Behavioral Control, Self-Efficacy, Locus of Control, and the Theory of Planned Behavior | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 665–683 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2002.tb00236.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control, with each predictor weighted for its importance in relation to the behavior and population of interest.
* '''Behavior''': an individual's observable response in a given situation with respect to a given target. Ajzen said a behavior is a function of compatible intentions and perceptions of behavioral control in that perceived behavioral control is expected to moderate the effect of intention on behavior, such that a favorable intention produces the behavior only when perceived behavioral control is strong.

===Conceptual / operational comparison===

====Perceived behavioral control vs. self-efficacy====
As Ajzen (1991) stated in the theory of planned behavior, knowledge of the role of perceived behavioral control came from Bandura's concept of self-efficacy. More recently, Fishbein and Cappella stated&lt;ref&gt;Fishbein, M., &amp; Cappella, J. N. (2006). The role of theory in developing effective health communications. Journal of Communication, 56(s1), S1-S17.&lt;/ref&gt; that self-efficacy is the same as perceived behavioral control in his integrative model, which is also measured by items of self-efficacy in a previous study.&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, I. (2002). Residual effects of past on later behavior: Habituation and reasoned action perspectives. Personality and social psychology review, 6(2), 107-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In previous studies, the construction and the number of item inventory of perceived behavioral control have depended on each particular health topic. For example, for smoking topics, it is usually measured by items such as "I don't think I am addicted because I can really just not smoke and not crave for it," and "It would be really easy for me to quit."

The concept of self-efficacy is rooted in Bandura's social cognitive theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). ''[[Self-efficacy: The exercise of control]]'' (see article). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcome. The concept of self-efficacy is used as perceived behavioral control, which means the perception of the ease or difficulty of the particular behavior. It is linked to control beliefs, which refers to beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of the behavior.

It is usually measured with items which begins with the stem, "I am sure I can ... (e.g., exercise, quit smoking, etc.)" through a self-report instrument in their questionnaires. Namely, it tries to measure the confidence toward the probability, feasibility, or likelihood of executing given behavior.

====Attitude toward behavior vs. outcome expectancy====
The theory of planned behavior specifies the nature of relationships between beliefs and attitudes. According to these models, people's evaluations of, or attitudes toward behavior are determined by their accessible beliefs about the behavior, where a belief is defined as the subjective probability that the behavior will produce a certain outcome. Specifically, the evaluation of each outcome contributes to the attitude in direct proportion to the person's subjective possibility that the behavior produces the outcome in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ajzen | first1 = I. | last2 = Fishbein | first2 = M. | year = 1975 | title = A Bayesian analysis of attribution processes | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 82 | issue = 2| page = 261 | doi=10.1037/h0076477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outcome expectancy was originated from the expectancy-value model. It is a variable-linking belief, attitude, opinion and expectation. The theory of planned behavior's positive evaluation of self-performance of the particular behavior is similar to the concept to perceived benefits, which refers to beliefs regarding the effectiveness of the proposed preventive behavior in reducing the vulnerability to the negative outcomes, whereas their negative evaluation of self-performance is similar to perceived barriers, which refers to evaluation of potential negative consequences that might result from the enactment of the espoused health behavior.

====Social influence====
The concept of social influence has been assessed by social norm and normative belief in both the theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior. Individuals' elaborative thoughts on subjective norms are perceptions on whether they are expected by their friends, family and the society to perform the recommended behavior. Social influence is measured by evaluation of various social groups. For example, in the case of smoking:
# Subjective norms from the peer group include thoughts such as, "Most of my friends smoke," or "I feel ashamed of smoking in front of a group of friends who don't smoke";
# Subjective norms from the family include thoughts such as, "All of my family smokes, and it seems natural to start smoking," or "My parents were really mad at me when I started smoking"; and
# Subjective norms from society or culture include thoughts such as, "Everyone is against smoking," and "We just assume everyone is a nonsmoker."

While most models are conceptualized within individual cognitive space, the theory of planned behavior considers social influence such as social norm and normative belief, based on collectivistic culture-related variables. Given that an individual's behavior (e.g., health-related decision-making such as diet, condom use, quitting smoking and drinking, etc.) might very well be located in and dependent on the social networks and organization (e.g., peer group, family, school and workplace), social influence has been a welcomed addition.

==Model==
Human behavior is guided by three kinds of consideration, "behavioral beliefs," "normative beliefs," and "control beliefs." In their respective aggregates, "behavioral beliefs" produce a favorable or unfavorable "attitude toward the behavior"; "normative beliefs" result in "subjective norm"; and "control beliefs" gives rise to "perceived behavioral control."

In combination, "attitude toward the behavior," "subjective norm," and "perceived behavioral control" lead to the formation of a "behavioral intention".&lt;ref name=Ajzen02 /&gt; In particular, "perceived behavioral control" is presumed to not only affect actual behavior directly, but also affect it indirectly through behavioral intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noar | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = R. S. | year = 2005 | title = Health Behavior Theory and cumulative knowledge regarding health behaviors: are we moving in the right direction? | url = | journal = Health education research | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 275–290 | doi=10.1093/her/cyg113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a general rule, the more favorable the attitude toward behavior and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived behavioral control, the stronger the person's intention to perform the behavior in question should be. Finally, given a sufficient degree of actual control over the behavior, people are expected to carry out their intentions when the opportunity arises.&lt;ref name=Ajzen02 /&gt;

==Formula==
In a simple form, behavioral intention for the theory of planned behavior can be expressed as the following mathematical function:
:&lt;math&gt;BI = w_A A + w_{SN} SN + w_{PBC} PBC&lt;/math&gt;
The three factors being proportional to their underlying beliefs&lt;ref name="Aizen1991"/&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n b_i e_i \\
SN &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n n_i m_i \\
PBC &amp;\propto \sum_{i=1}^n c_i p_i
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Evaluation of the theory==

===Strengths===
The theory of planned behavior can cover people's non-volitional behavior which cannot be explained by the theory of reasoned action.

An individual's behavioral intention cannot be the exclusive determinant of behavior where an individual's control over the behavior is incomplete. By adding "perceived behavioral control," the theory of planned behavior can explain the relationship between behavioral intention and actual behavior.

Several studies found that the TPB would help better predict health-related behavioral intention than the theory of reasoned action.&lt;ref name=Ajzen89&gt;Ajzen, I. (1989). Attitude structure and behavior. Attitude structure and function, 241-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The TPB has improved the predictability of intention in various health-related fields such as condom use, leisure, exercise, diet, etc.

In addition, the theory of planned behavior as well as the theory of reasoned action can explain the individual's social behavior by considering "social norm" as an important variable.

===Limitations===
Some scholars claim that the theory of planned behavior is based on cognitive processing, and they have criticised the theory on those grounds. More recently, some scholars criticize the theory because it ignores one's needs prior to engaging in a certain action, needs that would affect behaviour regardless of expressed attitudes. For example, one might have a very positive attitude towards beefsteak and yet not order a beefsteak because he is not hungry. Or, one might have a very negative attitude towards drinking and little intention to drink and yet engage in drinking as he's seeking group membership.

Also, one's emotions at the interviewing or decision-making time are ignored despite being relevant to the model as emotions can influence beliefs and other constructs of the model.  Still, poor predictability for health-related behavior in previous health research seems to be attributed to poor application of the model, associated methods and measures. Most of the research is correlational, and more evidence based on experimental studies is welcome although experiments, by nature, lack external validity because they prioritize internal validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sniehotta | first1 = F.F. | year = 2009 | title = An experimental test of the Theory of Planned Behavior | url = | journal = Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 257–270 | doi=10.1111/j.1758-0854.2009.01013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of the theory==
So far, the theory of planned behavior has more than 1200 research bibliographies in academic databases such as ''Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete'', ''Academic Search Premier'', ''PsycARTICLES'', ''Business Source Premier'', ''PsycINFO'', and ''PsycCRITIQUES''.

In particular, recently, several studies found that the TPB would better help to predict health-related behavioral intention than the theory of reasoned action (TRA)&lt;ref name=Ajzen89 /&gt; given that the TPB has improved the predictability of intention in various health-related fields such as condom use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albarracin | first1 = D. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = B.

For example, the goal to lose 10&amp;nbsp;kg in weight by the end of March, therefore a positive attitude and intention towards dieting. However, if a need is taken in calculation (health related or partner finding) the TPB fails. Assuming that one's need is to find a partner, if the partner is found and she like him overweight, or does not mind one's weight, then despite his positive attitude towards losing weight, he won't engage in a such behaviour as he might lose his partner, the main reason for engaging in dieting in first place.

The TPB also shows good applicability in regards to antisocial behaviours, such as using deception in the online environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the TPB relies on self-reports, there is evidence to suggest the vulnerability of such data to self-presentational biases. To a great extent, this has been ignored in the literature pertaining to the TRA/TPB, in spite of the threat to the validity and reliability of the models. More closely related to the concerns of the present study, Hessing, ElVers, and Weigel (1988) examined the TRA in relation to tax evasion and contrasted self-reports with official documentation. Findings indicated that while attitudes and subjective norms correlate with self-reported behaviour, it does not correlate with documentary evidence, in spite of considerable effort to maintain the anonymity of respondents. The implication was that self-reports of behaviour were unreliable, compared with more objective behaviour measures (see also Armitage &amp; Conner, 1999a, 1999b; Norwich &amp; Rovoli, 1993; Pellino, 1997).

Another application of the theory of planned behavior is in the field of '''''[[environmental psychology]]'''''. Generally speaking, actions that are environmentally friendly carry a positive normative belief. That is to say, sustainable behaviors are widely promoted as positive behaviors. However, although there may be a behavioral intention to practice such behaviors, perceived behavioral control can be hindered by constraints such as a belief that one's behavior will not have any impact.&lt;ref&gt;Koger, S. &amp; Winter, D. N. N. (2010). ''The Psychology of Environmental Problems''. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = P. C. | year = 2005 | title = Understanding individuals' environmentally significant behavior | url = | journal = Environmental Law Reporter: News and Analysis | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 10785–10790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one intends to behave in an environmentally responsible way but there is a lack of accessible recycling infrastructure, perceived behavioral control is low, and constraints are high, so the behavior may not occur. Applying the theory of planned behavior in these situations helps explain contradictions between sustainable attitudes and unsustainable behavior.

The theory of planned behavior model is thus a very powerful and predictive model for explaining human behavior. That is why the health and nutrition fields have been using this model often in their research studies. In one study, utilizing the theory of planned behavior, the researchers determine obesity factors in overweight Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liou | first1 = D. | last2 = Bauer | first2 = K. D. | year = 2007 | title = Exploratory investigation of obesity risk and prevention in Chinese Americans | url = | journal = Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 134–141 | doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2006.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intention to prevent becoming overweight was the key construct in the research process. It is important that nutrition educators provide the proper public policies in order to provide good tasting, low-cost, healthful food.

The theory of planned behavior can also be applied in area of '''''applied nutrition intervention'''''. In a recent study by Sweitzer,&lt;ref&gt;Sweitzer, S.J. et al.  (2011) Psychosocial Outcomes of "Lunch is in the Bag", a Parent Program for Packing Healthful Lunches for Preschool children.  J Nutr Ed Behav. 43:536-542.&lt;/ref&gt; TPB (in conjunction with SCT) was utilized to encourage parents to pack more fruits, vegetables and whole grains (FVWG) in sack lunches of preschool children. Behavioral constructs of TPD were used to develop intervention strategies. Knowledge/behavioral control, Self-efficacy/perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and intentions were measured to see effects on behavior. The results found a significant increase in vegetables and whole grains packed in lunches when interventions were planned using the TPB constructs. Psychosocial variables were useful predictors of lunch packing behaviors of parents and this study provided a divergent application of model-exploration of an area of parental behavior as a role in the development of young children's dietary behaviors. In a study by McConnon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McConnon | first1 = A. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to weight control in an overweight cohort. Results from a pan-European dietary intervention trial (DiOGenes) | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 313–318 | doi=10.1016/j.appet.2011.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the application of the TPB was used to prevent weight regain in an overweight cohort who recently experienced a significant weight loss.  Using the constructs of TPB, it was found that perceived need to control weight is the most positive predictor of behavior for weight maintenance. The TPB model can be used to predict weight gain prevention expectation in an overweight cohort. The TPB can also be utilized to measure behavioral intention of practitioners in promoting specific health behaviors. In this study by Chase,&lt;ref&gt;Chase, K., Reicks, M., &amp; Jones, J. (2003). Applying the theory of planned behavior to promotion of whole-grain foods by dietitians. J Am Diet Assoc. 103:1639-1642.&lt;/ref&gt; dietitians' intentions to promote whole grain foods was studied.  It was found that the strongest indicator of intention of dietitians to promote whole grain foods was the construct of normative beliefs with 97% of dietitians indicating that health professionals should promote whole grains and 89% wanted to comply with this belief. However, knowledge and self-efficacy of instituting this belief was faulted with only 60% of dietitians being able to correctly identify a whole grain product from a food label, 21% correctly identifying current recommendations and 42% of dietitians did not know there was a recommendation for whole grain consumption. Although the response rate to complete mailed surveys for this study was low (39%), the results provided preliminary data on the strong effect of normative beliefs on dietitian intentions to promote whole grain and the need for nutrition need for additional education for practicing dietitians focusing on increase knowledge and self-efficacy for promoting whole grains.

===Important steps===

When applying the TPB as a theoretical framework, certain steps should be followed to promote increased validity of results. First, target behavior should be specified in terms of action, target, context, and time. For example, the goal might be to "consume at least one serving of whole grains during breakfast each day in the forthcoming month". In this statement, "consuming" is the action, "one serving of whole grains" is the target, "during breakfast each day" is the context, and "in the forthcoming month" is the time.  Once a goal is specified, an elicitation phase can be used to identify salient issues. The pertinent and central beliefs for a certain behavior may be very different for different populations. Therefore, conducting open-ended elicitation interviews is one of the most crucial steps in applying the TPB. Elicitation interviews help to identify relevant behavioral outcomes, referents, cultural factors, facilitators, and barriers for each particular behavior and target population under investigation.&lt;ref name=Glanz36&gt;Glanz K, Rimer BK, &amp; Viswanath K; Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice, 5th Edition, Jossey-Bass, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are sample questions that may be used during an elicitation interview:&lt;ref name=Glanz36 /&gt;

* What do you like/ dislike about behavior X?
* What are some disadvantages of doing behavior X?
* Who would be against your doing behavior X?
* Who can you think of that would do behavior X?
* What things make it hard for you to do behavior X?
* If you want to do behavior X, how certain are you that you can?

However, the action, target, context and time construct shows little applicability when one engages in consuming luxury or fashion goods, especially as one's need is not present. For example, the goal might be to "buy three pairs of luxury high heels in the forthcoming month". In this statement, "buying" is the action, "three pairs of high heels" is the target, "luxury goods" is the context, and "in the forthcoming month" is the time.  In normal circumstances, once the goal is specified, the elicitation phase can be used to identify salient issues but not in this case as the need behind buying the shoes (wedding, sport, to show off, to feel good, to match with an existing outfit) primes in the decision making and therefore in the resulted behaviour.

Also, while the pertinent and central beliefs for a certain behavior may be very different for different populations, the questionnaire can then be designed, based on results from the elicitation interview, to measure model constructs with attention to cultural issues. After implementation of the questionnaire, thorough analysis should be conducted to assess whether the intervention influenced model constructs associated with intention and behavior.&lt;ref name="Glanz36" /&gt; Results and findings from the analysis can be used to develop effective interventions for eliciting behavioral change, especially within nutrition and health but not for luxury or fashion goods where one's need behind his purchase intentions (behavior) are in most social context cases to associate, dissociate or show status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5073">'''Venom optimization hypothesis''', also known as '''venom metering''', is a [[Biological Theory (journal)|biological hypothesis]] which postulates that [[venomous animals]] have physiological control over their production and use of [[venoms]]. It explains the economic use of venom because venom is a metabolically expensive product, and that there is a biological mechanism for controlling their specific use. The hypothetical concept was proposed by Esther Wigger, Lucia Kuhn-Nentwig, and Wolfgang Nentwig of the Zoological Institute at the [[University of Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in 2002.&lt;ref name=wigger&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigger E, Kuhn-Nentwig L, Nentwig W |title= The venom optimisation hypothesis: a spider injects large venom quantities only into difficult prey types |year =2002 |url= | journal= Toxicon | volume= 40 | issue= 6 |pages = 749–752 |pmid= 12175611 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/S0041-0101(01)00277-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morgen&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Morgenstern D, King GF |title= The venom optimization hypothesis revisited |year =2013 |url= | journal= Toxicon | volume=63 | issue=  |pages = 120–128 |pmid=23266311 |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of venomous animals have been experimentally found to regulate the amount of venom they use during predation or defensive situations. Species of anemones, jellyfish, ants, scorpions, spiders, and snakes are found to use their venoms frugally depending on the situation and size of their preys or predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Nisani Z |title= Behavioral and Physiological Ecology of Scorpion Venom Expenditure: Stinging, Spraying, and Venom Regeneration|year=2008 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BGqkiciYtsIC&amp;dq |pages=32–39 | publisher= ProQuest |isbn=  9780549591610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Venom optimization hypothesis was postulated by Wigger, Kuhn-Nentwig, and Nentwig from their studies of the amount of venom used by a [[wandering spider]] ''[[Cupiennius salei]]''. This spider produces a [[neurotoxin|neurotoxic peptide]] called CsTx-1 for paralysing its prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kuhn-Nentwig L, Fedorova IM, Lüscher BP, Kopp LS, Trachsel C, Schaller J, Vu XL, Seebeck T, Streitberger K, Nentwig W, Sigel E, Magazanik LG |title=  A venom-derived neurotoxin, CsTx-1, from the spider ''Cupiennius salei'' exhibits cytolytic activities|year = 2012|url= | journal= J Biol Chem | volume= 287 | issue= 30 |pages = 25640–25649 |pmid= 22613721 |pmc= 3408166 |doi= 10.1074/jbc.M112.339051}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not weave webs for trapping preys, and therefore, entirely depends on its venom for predation.

==Concept==

Animal venoms are complex biomolecules and hence, their biological synthesis require high metabolic activity. A particular venom itself is a complex chemical mixture composed of hundreds of proteins and non-proteinaceous compounds, resulting in a potent weapon for prey immobilization and predator deterrence. The metabolic cost of venom is sufficiently high to result in secondary loss of venom whenever its use becomes non-essential to survival of the animal. This suggests that venomous animals may have evolved strategies for minimizing venom expenditure, that they should use them only as and when required, and that too in optimal amount.&lt;ref name=morgen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3697">{{for|the Megadeth album|Warchest}}
A '''war chest''' is a metaphor for any collection of [[tool]]s or [[money]] intended to be used in a challenging or dangerous situation.  Historically, it referred to the chest located in the homes or barracks of [[soldier]]s, in which the soldier kept [[Armaments|arms]] and [[armor]].  In the modern era, it more often refers to a collection of [[funding|funds]] (or less occasionally special tools or equipment) intended to allow a person or organization to get through a situation that requires much more readiness or money than usual.

==Etymology==

In arms and armor, a '''war chest''' is a [[Chest (furniture)|container]] for the [[personal weapon]]s and [[Personal armor|protective gear]] of a [[Militia|citizen-soldier]], kept in the household, and is the origin of the term. The term's modern meaning originates with the [[medieval]] practice of having a [[chest (furniture)|chest]], literally, filled with money to open in time of [[war]].

==In politics==
In [[politics]], a war chest is funding obtained from donors well in advance of a campaign, usually accumulated by an incumbent for either re-election or to contest a more advanced office, or provided by a wealthy candidate to their own campaign. The possession of such excess funds may discourage otherwise viable candidates from a primary or general election challenge.

==In business==
In [[business]] a war chest, or '''cash mountain''' is a stash of money set aside to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, or to use when expansion possibilities arise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/ici-eyes-buyups-with-1631bn-war-chest-435693.html ICI eyes buy-ups with £1bn war chest] ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', 9 February 2007, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today companies can use accumulated cash or rely on quickly raised [[debt]] which costs less to carry when you don't need it. This is not always a reasonable substitute, as the credit available to a company typically drops as a result of the same actions that require the war chest to be opened.

Companies can redistribute their war chests to [[shareholder]]s by issuing larger or special [[dividend]]s, or more commonly through share [[Share repurchase|buyback]] operations.  Companies do this because if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the [[money market]]s, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects.  If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company's shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover.  This would place the current management's jobs at risk.

==In professional sports==
In [[Association football]] it refers to the amount of money a manager has been given by a club's chairman, owner or investors to acquire new players, as in the newspaper headline, "[[Jermain Defoe|Defoe]] and [[Wes Brown|Brown]] top [[Kevin Keegan|Keegan]] wishlist as [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Ashley]] grants £25m war chest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-508769/Defoe-Brown-Keegan-wishlist-Ashley-grants-25m-war-chest.html Defoe and Brown top Keegan wishlist as Ashley grants £25m war chest] ''[[Daily Mail]]'', 17 January 2008, accessed 19 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related terms==
Similar terms are also referred to as surplus cash, cash reserves, emergency reserves, acquisition funds, [[rainy day fund]]s, or undistributed earnings within different contexts.

'''''Weather Machine''''' is a [[Lumino kinetic art|lumino-kinetic]] [[bronze sculpture]] and columnar machine that serves as a [[weather beacon]], displaying a [[Weather forecasting|weather prediction]] each day at noon. Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=1}} tall sculpture was installed in 1988 in the northwest corner of [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' weatherman [[Willard Scott]]. The machine cost $60,000.

During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet [[fanfare]], mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a [[Great Blue Heron|blue heron]] for [[drizzle]] and transitional weather, or a [[dragon]] and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two [[bronze]] [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] and displays the temperature via vertical colored lights along its stem. The [[air quality index]] is also displayed by a light system below the [[stainless steel]] globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the [[National Weather Service]] and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, ''Weather Machine'' has been called "bizarre",&lt;ref name=Carlin&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/23/travel/what-s-doing-in-portland-ore.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=What's Doing In: Portland, Ore.|accessdate=May 9, 2013|date=April 23, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Peter|last=Carlin|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|issn=0362-4331|oclc=1645522}}&lt;/ref&gt; "playful",&lt;ref name=Rotarian&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=May 1990|work=The Rotarian|title=Pioneer Courthouse Square|pages=26–27|publisher=Rotary International|volume=156|issn=0035-838X|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "unique",&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{Cite news|title=Downtown Portland Public Art|date=April 12, 1991|first=Phil|last=Hunt|work=[[The Oregonian]]|page=R26|location=Portland, Oregon|issn=8750-1317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "wacky",&lt;ref name=McInerny&gt;{{Cite news|title=63-Year-Old Local Scribe Rises From Bedridden, Troubled Youth to Dance Literary Waltz of Words|date=October 16, 1988|first=Vivian|last=McInerny|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|page=L01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared to a giant [[Sceptre|scepter]].

The machine, whose height is reported to be between {{convert|25|and|33|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=Carlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rotarian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; includes two bronze [[Anemometer|wind scoops]] that turn in opposite directions.&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; It also indicates the temperature (when 20 [[Fahrenheit|°F]] or above)&lt;ref name=Richard/&gt; via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem.&lt;ref name=Hortsch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;&lt;ref name=PPR/&gt; Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F).&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Referring to an additional light system (below the [[stainless steel]] globe) that indicates air quality, ''The Oregonian'' reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects "semismoggy"&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt; air and a red light indicates poor air quality.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; However, in 1998 one writer for ''The Oregonian'' warned: "you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on".&lt;ref name=Hortsch/&gt; Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt;

In addition to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, ''Weather Machine'' had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor [[Bud Clark]] and other city officials.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt; On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of {{convert|82|F|C|0}}. Following the fanfare, known officially as "Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of "[[You Are My Sunshine]]".&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt; Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly.&lt;ref name=Under&gt;{{Cite news|title=Under the Weather|date=December 1, 1995|page=C01|work=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.&lt;ref name=Saker/&gt;

In the weeks following ''Weather Machine''{{'s}} dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence.&lt;ref name=Garcia/&gt; Following the dedication, ''The Oregonian'' published: "It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance&amp;nbsp;... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it."&lt;ref name=Sunshine/&gt;

Ponzi described the machine as "light-hearted . . . active, distinctive—and fun".&lt;ref name=Bella/&gt; O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a "gentle spectacle" and described the work as "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day."&lt;ref name=TO/&gt; In 1994, ''The Oregonian'' reported that O'Donnell regarded ''Weather Machine'' with a "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" and stated that he "[didn't] think it's all that attractive".&lt;ref name=Nokes&gt;{{Cite news|title=Are We All Wet?|date=March 3, 1994|first=R. Gregory|last=Nokes|work=The Oregonian|page=D01|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well&amp;nbsp;. . . And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round."&lt;ref name=McInerny/&gt;&lt;ref name=TO/&gt;

In 1995, ''The Oregonian''{{'s}} Jonathan Nicholas wrote, "To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a [[John Kitzhaber|governor in blue jeans]]. We can't really explain it: It just happens."&lt;ref name=Ponzi/&gt; Grant Butler of ''The Oregonian'' gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples of ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dining Cheap Eats Saigon Kitchen Cart|date=June 28, 2002|first=Grant|last=Butler|work=The Oregonian|page=17|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine is considered a [[tourist attraction]], recommended in visitor guides for Portland&lt;ref&gt;Visitor guides:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Zebra''' is the American [[medical slang]] for arriving at an exotic [[medical diagnosis]] when a more commonplace explanation is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is shorthand for the [[aphorism]] coined in the late 1940s by Dr. [[Theodore Woodward]], professor at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland]] School of Medicine, who instructed his [[internship (medicine)|medical interns]]: "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since horses are common in Maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Imperato|Imperato (1979) pages 13, 18.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained by Sotos,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 7.]]&lt;/ref&gt; medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of (a) the [[availability heuristic]] ("events more easily remembered are judged more probable") and (b) the phenomenon first enunciated in ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (circa 85 BC), "the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind."  Thus, the aphorism is an important caution against these biases when teaching medical students to weigh medical evidence.

Diagnosticians have noted, however, that "zebra"-type diagnoses must nonetheless be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out:
{{quote|In making the diagnosis of the cause of illness in an individual case, calculations of probability have no meaning.  The pertinent question is whether the disease is present or not.  Whether it is rare or common does not change the odds in a single patient. ... If the diagnosis can be made on the basis of specific criteria, then these criteria are either fulfilled or not fulfilled. — A. McGehee Harvey, James Bordley II, Jeremiah Barondess&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey (1979) page 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term for an obscure and rare diagnosis in medicine is [[wiktionary:fascinoma|fascinoma]].

==Examples==
[[Necrotic]] skin lesions in the United States are often diagnosed as [[loxoscelism]] ([[recluse spider]] bites), even in areas where ''Loxosceles'' species are rare or not present.  This is a matter of concern because such misdiagnoses can delay correct diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spiders of the genus ''Loxosceles'' (Araneae, Sicariidae): a review of biological, medical and psychological aspects regarding envenomations|first=Richard S. |last=Vetter |year=2008 |work=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=36 |pages=150–163 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v36_n1/arac-36-1-150.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1636/rst08-06.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter usage==
[[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]] and [[hypermobility syndrome]] are both medical zebras and yet are commonly under diagnosed and misdiagnosed. The EDS and hypermobility syndrome awareness movements have adopted the zebra as the mascot for their campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Why the Zebra|url=http://www.ehlers-danlos.org/about-eds-uk/why-the-zebra&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The television series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' episode "[[My Balancing Act]]", focuses on this theme, and the medical veteran [[Perry Cox|Dr. Cox]] uses the metaphor to explain to [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J. D." Dorian]] why he should first consider a simple diagnosis.

The television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' had the working title ''Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain'',&lt;ref name="House-Holmes"&gt;{{cite news|title=House... and Holmes|date=January 2006|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=BBC Magazines Ltd.|page=57|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msfesWep?url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archivedate=January 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the show's recurring theme of hunting for obscure diagnoses while a patient is in a critical condition. The title character, diagnostic expert [[Dr. Gregory House]] rejects the aphorism, arguing that any cases with simple solutions would have been successfully diagnosed by someone else before reaching him. 

The episode [[Zebras (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|"Zebras"]] of the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' was named after this term and cites a version of the aphorism in the teaser.

[[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]]'s 2017 music video "IT'S NOT A ZEBRA!" depicts a group of first-year medical students erroneously trying to diagnose a patient with a rare and unlikely disease, when in fact she has the flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-best-moments-from-the-2017-harvard-medical-school_us_59013778e4b00acb75f1849b|title=10 Best Moments from the Class of 2020 Harvard Medical School/Harvard School of Dental Medicine Music Video|last=Price|first=Mirissa D.|date=2017-04-27|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Other medical aphorisms==
* [[Sutton's law]] – perform first the diagnostic test expected to be most useful
* [[Occam's razor]] – select from among competing hypotheses the one that makes the fewest new assumptions
* Leonard's Law of Physical Findings – it's obvious or it's not there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hickam's dictum]] – "Patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please"

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Where programs require subsidy, ZeeWee organizers may use a "green fee" to help move the event toward sustainability by paying for [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]], buying recycled products, or more recently purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norkarecreation.com/hcrewards.htm |title=Bellingham/Whatcom County Washington |publisher=NorKarecreation.com |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
When the bid was submitted for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], [[LOCOG]], The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, pledged not just to host the biggest sporting event in the world but also to stage the first truly sustainable Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160540 |title=London 2012 Olympics team publishes first green report - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this was an ambitious target to send zero waste from Games-time venues directly to landfill &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/london-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications &amp;#124; Downloads &amp;#124; Olympic.org |publisher=London2012.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – something that no Games has attempted before. 
In February 2012 an initiative was launched to share the lessons learnt from delivering a zero waste games with the wider waste and events community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerowasteevents.org/front/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327035411/http://zerowasteevents.org/front/ |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
