'''''All That Jazz''''' is a 1979 American [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Bob Fosse]]. The screenplay, by [[Robert Alan Aurthur]] and Fosse, is a [[autobiographical novel|semi-autobiographical]] [[fantasy]] based on aspects of Fosse's life and career as a dancer, choreographer and director. The film was inspired by Fosse's manic effort to edit his film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' while simultaneously staging the 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It borrows its title from the [[Kander and Ebb]] tune "[[All That Jazz (song)|All That Jazz]]" in that production. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]].

In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1833/year/1980.html|title=ALL THAT JAZZ|publisher=[[Cannes Film Festival]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical with editing a Hollywood film he has directed. He is a workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes; without a daily dose of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], [[Visine]], [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Dextroamphetamine|Dexedrine]], and [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], he wouldn't have the energy to keep up the biggest "show" of all—his life. His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. In his imagination, he flirts with an [[Death (personification)|angel of death]] named Angelique.

Gideon's condition gets progressively worse. He is rushed to a hospital after experiencing chest pains during a particularly stressful [[Read-through|table-read]] (with the production's penny-pinching backers in attendance) and is admitted with severe [[Angina pectoris|angina]]. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal. He collapses in the doctor's office, and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, in brazen denial of his mortality. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around his hospital room, and cigarettes are constantly being smoked. As cardiogram readings show no improvement, Gideon dances with death. A negative review for his film—which has been released without him—comes in, and Gideon has a massive coronary event. He undergoes [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].

The show's backers must decide whether it's time to pack up, or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact, money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of Joe's [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]]. The producers realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon dying: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. Meanwhile, elements from Gideon's past life are staged in dazzling dream sequences of musical numbers he directs from his hospital bed while on life support. Realizing death is imminent and his mortality unconquerable, Gideon has another heart attack. In the film's glittery finale, he goes through the [[five stages of grief]]—anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance—featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing. As death closes in on Gideon, his fantasy episodes become more hallucinatory and extravagant. In an epilogue set up as a monumental [[variety show]] featuring everyone from his past, Gideon takes center stage.

The final shot shows his corpse being zipped up in a [[body bag]].

==Production==
With increasing production costs and a loss of enthusiasm for the film, [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] brought in [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to finance completion, who acquired domestic distribution rights in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Daily Variety]]|title='Kramer' Wins Five-Oscar Judgment|date=April 15, 1980|page=1|last=Harwood|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's structure is often compared to [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]'', another thinly veiled autobiographical film with fantastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF Vincent Canby in ''The New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 DVD review in ''The Onion: A.V. Club''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223116/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/7299 |date=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26"&gt;"Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide" page 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Audrey Paris—Joe's ex-wife and continuing muse, played by [[Leland Palmer (actress)|Leland Palmer]]—closely reflects that of Fosse's wife, the dancer and actress [[Gwen Verdon]], who continued to work with him on projects including ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''All That Jazz'' itself.

Gideon's rough handling of chorus girl Victoria Porter closely resembles [[Bob Fosse]]'s own treatment of Jennifer Nairn-Smith during rehearsals for ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''All His Jazz: The Life &amp; Death of Bob Fosse'' by Martin Gottfried, Da Capo Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Nairn-Smith herself appears in the film as Jennifer, one of the ''NY/LA'' dancers.

[[Ann Reinking]] was one of Fosse's sexual partners at the time and was more or less playing herself in the film, but nonetheless she was required to audition for the role as Gideon's girlfriend, Kate Jagger.

[[Cliff Gorman]] was cast in the titular role of ''The Stand-Up''—the film-within-a-film version of ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]''—after having played the role of Lenny Bruce in the original theatrical production of the show (for which he won a [[Tony Award]]), but was passed over for Fosse's film version of the production in favor of [[Dustin Hoffman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Robert Simonson |last1=Simonson |first1=Robert |title=Cliff Gorman, Broadway's Lenny, Is Dead at 65 |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/cliff-gorman-broadways-lenny-is-dead-at-65-com-108241 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=13 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Reviews were largely positive. ''All That Jazz'' scores an 86% "Fresh" (or "good") rating on [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|all_that_jazz|All That Jazz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] called the film "an uproarious display of brilliance, nerve, dance, maudlin confessions, inside jokes and, especially, ego" and "an essentially funny movie that seeks to operate on too many levels at the same time... some of it makes you wince, but a lot of it is great fun... A key to the success of the production is the performance of Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon... With an actor of less weight and intensity, ''All That Jazz'' might have evaporated as we watched it. Mr. Scheider's is a presence to reckon with."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803E2DF1538E732A25753C2A9649D946890D6CF ''The New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "a self-important, [[egomania]]cal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film" and added, "Roy Scheider gives a superb performance as Gideon, creating a character filled with nervous energy… The film's major flaw lies in its lack of real explanation of what, beyond ego, really motivates [him]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117796599.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' said, "The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type . . . ''All That Jazz'' is great-looking but not easy to watch. Fosse's indulgent vision at times approaches sour self-loathing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/jazz/review/111363 ''TV Guide'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two-and-a-half stars (out of four) in his 2009 movie guide; he said that the film was "self-indulgent and largely negative," and that "great show biz moments and wonderful dancing are eventually buried in pretensions"; he also called the ending "an interminable finale which leaves a bad taste for the whole film."&lt;ref name="Leonard Maltin page 26" /&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' states, "As translated onto screen, [Fosse's] story is wretched: the jokes are relentlessly crass and objectionable; the song 'n' dance routines have been created in the cutting-room and have lost any sense of fun; [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]]-esque moments add little but pretension; and scenes of a real open-heart operation, alternating with footage of a symbolic Angel of Death in veil and white gloves, fail even in terms of the surreal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507033352/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77740/All_That_Jazz.html |date=2008-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in 1979, director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who is mentioned in the movie, reportedly called it "[the] best film I think I have ever seen".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=12}}
In 2001, ''All That Jazz'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]] and selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. It was also preserved by the [[Academy Film Archive]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=All+That+Jazz&amp;filmmaker=&amp;category=All&amp;collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the film was ranked #14 by the [[American Film Institute]] on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|Greatest Movie Musicals]].

The film would be the last musical nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] until Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991, and was the last live-action musical to compete in the category until [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' was nominated over twenty years later.

An '''art centre''' or '''arts center''' is distinct from an [[art gallery]] or [[art museum]]. An arts centre is a functional [[community centre]] with a specific remit to encourage arts practice and to provide facilities such as [[theatre]] space, gallery space, venues for [[music]]al performance, workshop areas, educational facilities, technical equipment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G. (2001) 'Amenity planning and the arts centre', Chapter 4 of Cultural Planning: an urban renaissance? London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], "art centers" are generally either establishments geared toward exposing, generating, and making accessible art making to arts-interested individuals, or buildings that rent primarily to artists, galleries, or companies involved in art making.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], art centres began after [[World War II]] and gradually changed from mainly [[middle-class]] places to 1960s and 1970s [[Fads and trends|trendy]], [[Alternative lifestyle|alternative]] centres and eventually in the 1980s to serving the ''whole'' community with a programme of enabling access to wheelchair users and [[disabled]] individuals and groups.

In the rest of Europe it is common among most art centres that they are partly government funded, since they are considered to have a positive influence on society and economics according to the [[Rhineland model]] philosophy. A lot of those organisations originally started in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as [[Squatting|squatted]] spaces and were later legalized.

'''''Bhowani Junction''''' is a 1956 [[film adaptation]] of the 1954 novel ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' by [[John Masters]] made by [[MGM]]. The film was directed by [[George Cukor]] and produced by [[Pandro S. Berman]] from a screenplay by [[Sonya Levien]] and [[Ivan Moffat]].

The film starred [[Ava Gardner]] as Victoria Jones, an [[Anglo-Indian]] who has been serving in the [[Indian Army]], and [[Stewart Granger]] as Colonel Rodney Savage, a (British) Indian Army officer.  It also featured [[Bill Travers]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]], [[Lionel Jeffries]] and (uncredited)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0049007|title=Bhowani Junction}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neelo]] (who went on to become one of the leading ladies of the Pakistan film industry).

The film was shot in England at [[MGM-British Studios]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], on the [[Longmoor Military Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald, D. W.|author2=Carter, R. J.|title=The Longmoor Military Railway|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot|year=1974|isbn=0-7153-6357-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on location in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].

==Plot==
India, 1947: In the final days of British rule, Victoria Jones, the daughter of an Indian mother and an English [[railroad engineer|train engineer]], is serving in the British Army. She returns on leave after four years to her home in Bhowani, where supporters of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] are non-violently protesting against British rule and communists, led by a revolutionary known as Davay, foment riot and sabotage.

She becomes reacquainted with a childhood sweetheart also of [[Anglo-Indian]] heritage, rail traffic superintendent Patrick Taylor, and with Colonel Rodney Savage, whose Indian battalion has been sent to Bhowani to maintain law and order as British rule ends. The protesters disrupt rail service and Savage places Victoria on duty during the crisis. He disperses the protesters but Victoria does not approve of his methods. She begins seriously contemplating her identity and speculates that she might marry a man from India, although clearly Taylor is still in love with her and Savage infatuated.

Walking home alone one night, Victoria is attacked and nearly raped by Captain McDaniel, one of Savage's officers, killing him with a steel bar. Finding her, a [[Sikh]] co-worker of Taylor's, Ranjit Kasel, takes her to his home and offers her sanctuary, introducing her to his mother, the Sardarni, and to a guest in their home, Ghan Shyam, who offers to hide McDaniel's body after the Sardarni worries that her son Ranjit will be accused of murdering the officer.

Davay's raids continue. He blows up a train, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Victoria, influenced by her love for India, decides to marry Ranjit, but during the ceremony fearing the complete loss of her identity, suddenly flees. When an army sentry is found murdered because he saw McDaniel and Victoria together just before she killed the officer, Victoria realizes that the man in Ranjit's home, Ghan Shyam, is actually Davay and that the Sardarni, once a notorious Indian resistance leader, has been harboring him.

Davay kidnaps Victoria, using her to escape the city aboard her father's train. Savage and Taylor intercept the train before it reaches a tunnel, rescuing Victoria but finding Davay has gone into the tunnel with dynamite. Taylor recklessly advances to defuse the dynamite but is shot by Davay, who is immediately killed by Savage. Savage, cradling Taylor as he dies, watches the passage of the train. On board is Gandhi, whom Davay meant to assassinate, thereby inciting further hostilities and riots.

Savage's duty in India ends and he is summoned back to England, but his love for Victoria has become overwhelming. When she refuses to marry him and live in England, he proposes to marry but remain in India, and she accepts. Savage's superior offers to expedite his early release from military service as reward for his accomplishments.

==Differences from novel==
The film, like the original novel, portrays the Anglo-Indian protagonist, Victoria Jones, as tugged in different directions by three suitors, Col. Rodney Savage, Ranjit Kasel and Patrick Taylor, each representing a different ethnic community: British, Indian (Sikh) and Anglo-Indian, respectively.  The film-makers, however, changed the novel's ending and Victoria's fate.  Whereas in the novel Victoria finally seeks her future with her fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick, a railway worker, the film-makers instead matched her at the end with the more obviously dashing British officer Rodney Savage, while consigning Patrick to a heroic death.&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Andrew|title=Bhowani Junction –a brief but memorable encounter with Hollywood|url=http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006151540/http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(In the writer's own depiction, in the (unfilmed) sequel "[[To the Coral Strand]]", Rodney Savage does stay on in India after the end of British rule - but he does not marry Victoria, but rather goes through many upheavals and finally finds love with an Indian woman.)

New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113115288&lt;/ref&gt; Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger were announced as leads almost immediately; Gardner had been on suspension at the studio for refusing to appear in ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Special to The New York Times. (1954, Aug 14). AVA GARDNER SET FOR FILM ON INDIA. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/112983416&lt;/ref&gt;

George Cukor was assigned to direct. He travelled to India in October 1954 to research the movie. "I feel that for the first time India has been presented in this book as it really is, instead of the usual hokey-pokey atmosphere in which it is painted by most authors who write about it," he said.&lt;ref&gt;GeorgeCukor HereToGet the feel of india. (1954, Oct 03). The Times of India (1861-Current) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/608296868&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government refused to cooperate with the production of the film.&lt;ref&gt;By A.H. WEILER. (1954, Oct 24). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113049044&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional  location Bhowani [[Junction (rail)|Junction]] was in [[India]], most probably [[Jhansi]].  MGM had wanted to shoot the film in location in India; but, as the government of India insisted on script approval and imposed high taxes,  MGM  decided to film in [[Pakistan]] where the government was more welcoming.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By, J. P. (1955, May 15). First 'invasion' of pakistan by film troupe met with welcome reception. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113436640&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the change in location to Pakistan, the script was altered to show Rodney Savage in command of the 1/13 Frontier Force Battalion ([[55th Coke's Rifles (Frontier Force)|Coke's Rifles]]), which at that time of filming was part of the 7th (Golden Arrow) Division of the [[Pakistan Army]], rather than in command of a [[Gurkha]] Battalion, the  1/13 Gorkha Rifles, as in the book.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt; Pakistan army and police enthusiastically assisted in making of the film.  Several Pakistan army units of the 7 Golden Arrow Division including the 5th Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 10 Frontier Force Regiment), 5th Probyn’s Horse, 1st Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 7 Frontier Force Regiment), participated in the making of the film. Colonel Savage in the film is shown wearing the Golden Arrow formation sign of the Pakistan 7 Division.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;

Also in the movie is the 4th Battalion (Wilde's) 13th Frontier Force Rifles, the band at the Lahore Railway Station with a deer as its mascot, while the troops taking part in the train accident were from the 4/13th. The battalion has a copy of the book and autographed photographs from both Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger.

The future Pakistani film star [[Neelo]] appeared in a small role as a reporter in a crowd scene. Neelo was introduced to Cukor by A. H. Rana, the film's production manager and casting assistant in Pakistan, who worked with the film's casting director, Harvey Woods. This was her first role in a movie.

==Reception==
The film earned $2,075,000 in North America and $2.8 million elsewhere, making a profit of $1,238,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

It recorded admissions of 1,554,970 in France.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|title=Ava Gardner Box Office|last=Soyer|first=Renaud|first2=Didier|last2=Noisy|date=28 March 2014|work=Box Office Story|language=French|accessdate=7 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919020036/http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|archivedate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bijou''' (plural: bijoux) is an intricate jewellery piece incorporated into clothing, or worn by itself on the body.

==Use==
Besides its decorative function, a bijou serves as a [[signalling theory|signal]] for many other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Dictionnaire International du Bijou|publisher=Regard|place=Paris|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have varied over time and space, and really its perceived function is dictated by the wearer, not those who view it. Nevertheless, it is possible roughly to categorise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Dictionnaire du Corps en Sciences Humaines et Sociales|trans-title=The dictionary of bodies and human sciences|chapter=Bijou|editor=Bernard Andrieu|publisher=CNRS|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In high society===
A bijou can be a mark of [[social status]], and indicates whether the wearer is married, engaged, a [[debutante]], and so forth. Traditionally, these kind of bijoux are enjewelled with [[jade]], or other black stone.

===As member===
Bijoux can indicate the membership of some group, be it a religion, a profession, a political allegiance, one of ethnicity or sex, or allegiance to a [[team (sports)|sports team]]: as [[wristband]]s might do in other cultures. They are also used as purely identification symbols, for example the [[Companions of the Tour de France]] &lt;!-- fr: Compagnons du Tour de France, not sure good tr here --&gt; wear them as [[earring]]s to show their allegiance to a particular rider. In a crowd, it may thus distinguish them from others supporting other riders, depending on how dedicated each are to recognise the symbol.

===As a magic or religious symbol===
Bijoux are often used for physical therapy, like [[amulet]]s. Generally, a significant date is inscribed thereon, and perhaps their birth colour, or their astrological sign, a [[patron saint]], or other magic symbols. They may also be used for fun in [[guessing-game]]s.

The date, generally, is that of the birth of the wearer. A fish symbol, often called an [[Ichthys]], indicates that the wearer is a Christian.

===In daily life===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
{{vague|date=September 2015}}
A bijou can be used in daily life as various significands by the wearer, and can be put on scarves, capes, hats, handbags, and so on.

===As a gift of love===
Bijoux are often given as a symbol of love, specifically to one person. It has a special meaning to the wearer, and similarly to that of an [[engagement ring]], is displayed publicly and proudly. In French it is sometimes called a [[souvenir]], but this is a [[false friend]], {{lang|fr|souvenir}} being the infinitive for the verb "to remember".

''Bijouterie'', the art of making or wearing bijoux, has thus developed its own [[private language]] or [[rebus]] known only to the initiated. Symbols may be religious or [[allegory|allegorical]] (two hands interwtwined, for example, indicate the love of two fools, like [[Romeo and Juliet]]); [[Pansy|Pansies]] ({{lang-fr|fleurs de pensée}}, literally "Flowers of thought") indicate "I am thinking of you".

Sometimes the bijou will have, hidden under a clasp, a photograph of the lover-to-be, or a strand of their hair, or one of their [[baby tooth|baby teeth]]. &lt;!-- we should have an article about this I will check later cos I know what it means but can't think of the word and fr:wp hasn't it, semograph or something. --&gt;

The bijou is usually given as a symbol of [[eternal love]], and also its fragility: it can be easily broken, lost or discarded. Sometimes the [[gemstone]] is made of glass to emphasise this fragility and essential uselessness, such as those made by [[Foire de Beaucaire]] ([[Gard-France]]) in the 18th century (The name comes from the small cry made by the wearer when it was torn from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|language=fr|title=Le bijou Provençal|first=Remy|last=Kerténian|publisher=Aubanel|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===As a promise of sex===
[[Baudelaire]] writes of the bijou's function thus in his novel ''Les Bijoux'', as does [[Diderot]] in ''[[Les bijoux indiscrets]]''. (Roughly, "[[The Indiscreet Jewels]]"). In both novels, the bijou serves as a symbol, like a [[pink carnation]] may do in English culture. It is worn by the wearer to show that she is available but must be wooed, before any touch, sight or smell, and is an erotic act of [[self-denial]].

As a well-known symbol, this same object can still have various uses. Among others, it is a symbol of [[emancipation]] and a symbol of [[sexual equality]], but most people in Western culture wear it as a sign of faithfulness, be it in marriage, religion, or society. Not to wear one is a statement in itself.

==History==

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Or de Varna - Nécropole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tomb 43 at the [[Varna Necropolis]] contains some of the most ancient bijoux yet found]]
Body ornamentation &lt;!--- don't like this --&gt; predates that of [[history of writing|writing]]. Some{{who|date=September 2015}} consider it as itself part of human evolution, and call it the {{lang|fr|Révolution Symbolique}}, the rise of [[Symbolic culture]].

The oldest well-identified bijoux are some 45 pieces unearthed from [[Blombes, South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanhaeren|first=M|last2=D'Errico|first2=F|language=fr|title=Aux origines de la parure|trans-title=On the Origin of Ornament|journal=Pour la Science|date=July 2008|pp=58&amp;ndash;64}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perforated and styled bijoux have been dated to being {{formatnum:75000}} years old.

Beyond Africa, [[Yvette Taborin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yvette|last=Taborin|authorlink=Yvette Taborin|title=Langage sans parole - la parure au temps préhistorique|trans-title=Language without speech: conversation in prehistoric times|publisher=La Maison des Roches}}&lt;/ref&gt; has &lt;!-- wasted a lifetime --&gt; devoted her life to studying the use of language symbols in Europe. She divides her analysis of the first objects of interaction between people into two types: those that are simply to collect things, as [[hunter-gatherer]]s do, and those that are deliberately made or modified to be [[Ornament (art)|ornament]]s. Taborin does not classify on which material or source these ornaments were made from.

Most [[paleoarcheology]] concentrates on remains of bodies themselves, such as [[fossil]]s, or animal remains such as teeth. Taborin took a different tack, to investigate the remains  of those around them. In doing so, she literally unearthed a whole new classification and understanding of our prehistoric ancestors, based on scientific evidence and statistics. For example, she established that the teeth used as ornaments in jewellery were not [[correlation|statistically correlated]] with the animals living thereabouts, neither browsers nor carnivores, so that they were specifically ornamental and not just "spare parts" after killing an animal to eat it.

Most ancient jewellery is of bone, ivory, antler or some soft stone (such as [[limestone]] or [[lignite]]). The diversity and manufacture of these pieces, then, indicates a significant development in human evolution, especially as it comes in such various forms (hairbands, placed in clothing, bracelets, anklets, and so forth).

=== Bronze age ===
[[File:Trésor de Blanot musée archéologique Dijon France.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Sacred objects from [[Blanot, Côte-d'Or]] dating to the [[Bronze Age]], now housed at the Archaeological Museum in [[Dijon]]]]
In Europe, the [[Celtic people]] were foremost in their work in bijou and filigree; [[strapwork]] variations on the [[celtic cross]] are still popular today.

Once metal had become part of the human way of life, and particularly during the [[Iron Age]], various techniques such as [[filigree]] and [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]].&lt;!-- and [[granulation]] not sure what granulation means here --&gt; An enormous variety of objects, of the highest quality, have been found. Bijouterie flourished in the civilisations around the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and slowly but surely, bijouitiers established a trade and business, passing on their knowledge through [[guild]]s and adapting their wares to the tastes of their clients and the fashion of the day.

=== Recorded history ===
[[File:Parure_realizzata_per_la_regina_Farida_d'Egitto_(1934).JPG|thumb|left|100px|Coral bijou made for Queen [[Farida of Egypt]](1938, Naples, at the [[Coral Jewellery Museum]], [[Naples]]).]]

*In [[Ancient Egypt]] and contemporaenously but disparately in [[Western Africa]], bijouterie was considered a form of high art.
*In the [[New World]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] &lt;!-- not sure what is the neutral here, French says pre-columbian people, ''peuples précolombiens''  --&gt; had a culture of making bijoux from gold. [[Christopher Columbus]], indeed, ransacked much gold of this sort on his return to [[Portugal]].

The art of bijouterie was pretty much stable, over many centuries, and reserved and codified as a [[profession]].

*Metalworking techniques developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]] made bijoux affordable to all, so they were no longer considered mere luxuries for the rich.
*In the [[First World War]], French soldiers wore bijoux carefully selected to indicate their rank and speciality.
**These would often be made simply of [[iron]] or [[aluminium]]{{citation needed|reason=aluminium was quite a precious metal at that time. It had only been discovered a few years earlier, although Bauxite much earlier. Was not that it didn't exist, but that the technology to extract it didn't exist.|date=September 2015}}
*In the [[Second World War]], the new industry of bijoux manufacture in France was paralysed; but they responded by producing {{lang|fr|bijoux patriotiques}}, with the emblems of regiments and other army units, to wear on their uniforms.
*After the second world war, in the optimistic spirit of the time, with more money, more hope, and more future, bijou once again became part of daily life as a way to express thanks and love.

==Modern day==
After the 1950s, three distinct strands of the art developed:
* ''Joaillerie'', made as one-off pieces or in [[limited edition]]s, in [[precious metal]] and [[gemstone]]s.
* ''Bijouterie fantaisie'', made of many new materials such as plastic
* ''Bijouterie artisanale'', again made as one-offs or in limited editions, but not of high-valued material.

* The ''grande parure'' has those plus a [[diadem]] and two bracelets.

The '''Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III''' is a black [[limestone]] [[Assyrian sculpture]] with many scenes in [[bas-relief]] and inscriptions. It comes from [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu), in northern [[Iraq]], and commemorates the deeds of King [[Shalmaneser III]] (reigned 858–824 BC). It is on display at the [[British Museum]] in London, and several other museums have cast replicas.

It is the most complete Assyrian [[obelisk]] yet discovered, and is historically significant because it is thought to display the earliest ancient depiction of a biblical figure – [[Jehu]], King of Israel. The traditional identification of "Yaw" as [[Jehu]] has been questioned by some scholars, who proposed that the inscription refers to another king, [[Jehoram of Israel]].&lt;ref name=McCarter&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1356327 P. Kyle McCarter, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 216 (Dec., 1974), pp. 5–7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1356296 Edwin R. Thiele, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 222 (Apr., 1976), pp. 19–23]&lt;/ref&gt; Its reference to ''Parsua'' is also the first known reference to the Persians.

[[Tribute]] offerings are shown being brought from identifiable regions and peoples. It was erected as a public monument in 825 BC at a time of civil war, in the central square of Nimrud, close to the much earlier [[White Obelisk of Ashurnasirpal I]]. It was discovered by archaeologist Sir [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846 and is now in the [[British Museum]].

==Description==
[[File:The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III receives tribute from Sua, king of Gilzanu, The Black Obelisk..JPG|thumb|The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III receives tribute from Sua, king of Gilzanu, The Black Obelisk.]]

It features twenty relief scenes, five on each side. They depict five different subdued kings, bringing tribute and prostrating before the Assyrian king. From top to bottom they are: (1) [[Sua (king)|Sua]] of Gilzanu (in north-west [[Iran]]), (2) "[[Jehu]] of Bit [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]]" (Jehu of the House of Omri), (3) an unnamed ruler of [[Musri]] (probably [[Egypt]]), (4) Marduk-apil-usur of Suhi (middle [[Euphrates]], Syria and Iraq), and (5) Qalparunda of Patin ([[Antakya]] region of [[Turkey]]). Each scene occupies four panels around the monument and is described by a [[cuneiform script]] above them.

On the top and the bottom of the reliefs there is a long cuneiform inscription recording the annals of Shalmaneser III. It lists the military campaigns which the king and his commander-in-chief headed every year, until the thirty-first year of reign. Some features might suggest that the work had been commissioned by the commander-in-chief, Dayyan-Assur.

==Second register==
[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jehu]], or Jehu's ambassador, bows before [[Shalmaneser III]].]]

The second [[Register (sculpture)|register]] from the top is thought to include the earliest surviving picture of a biblical figure. The name appears as ''&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;Ia-ú-a mar &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;Hu-um-ri-i''. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson's]] original translation in 1850 seminal work "On the Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia" stated: "The second line of offerings are said to have been sent by Yahua, son of Hubiri, a prince of whom there is no mention in the annals, and of whose native country, therefore, I am ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/jstor-25228628 On the Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia], 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U5f4EO5t8BYC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14 The Bible in the British Museum: Interpreting the Evidence, T. C. Mitchell, page 14]&lt;/ref&gt; Over a year later, a connection with the bible was made by Reverend [[Edward Hincks]], who wrote in his diary on 21 August 1851: "Thought of an identification of one of the obelisk captives — with Jehu, king of Israel, and satisfying myself on the point wrote a letter to the Athenaeum announcing it".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6dkyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159 Studies on the Text and Versions of the Hebrew Bible in Honour of Robert Gordon, edited by Geoffrey Khan, Diana Lipton], p159&lt;/ref&gt; Hincks' letter was published by [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]] on the same day, entitled "Nimrud Obelisk".&lt;ref&gt;"Nimrud Obelisk, Athenaeum, 1251, 1384-85&lt;/ref&gt; Hincks' identification is now the commonly held position by biblical archaeologists.

The identification of "Yaw" as [[Jehu]] was questioned by contemporary scholars such as [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]]&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/assyrianeponymca00smitiala#page/189/mode/1up Assyrian Eponym Canon], [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]], 1875, page 190, "There is another supposed Hebrew king in the annals of Shalmaneser, b.c. 842, Extracts VIII. and X., called "Jehu son of Omri," who is generally identified with "Jehu son of Nimshi," the king of Israel. The country ruled by Jehu, son of Omri, is not stated in the inscriptions; and it appears unlikely that Jehu, king of Israel, who exterminated the family of Omri, should call himself son of that king. Without advancing any theory for the identification of the monarch mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, I would urge that the identity of the Jehu of the Bible with the Jehu of the inscriptions is not proved, and that these notices are not enough to force us to alter all our Bible dates."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in more recent times by P. Kyle McCarter and [[Edwin R. Thiele]],&lt;ref name="McCarter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thiele"/&gt; based on the fact that Jehu was not an Omride, as well as transliteration and chronology issues. However, the name read as "Yaw, son of Omri (Bit-Khumri", see [[House of Omri]]), is generally accepted to follow Hincks as the Biblical [[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]].

The stele describes how Jehu brought or sent his tribute in or around 841 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Millard, Alan (1997) Discoveries from Bible Times, Oxford, Lion, p121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehu]] severed [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel’s]] alliances with [[Phoenicia]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and became subject to [[Assyria]]. The caption above the scene, written in Assyrian cuneiform, can be translated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“The tribute of [[Jehu]], son of [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]]: I received from him silver, gold, a golden bowl, a golden vase with pointed bottom, golden tumblers, golden buckets, tin, a staff for a king [and] spears."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Capitoline Wolf''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Lupa Capitolina'') is a [[bronze]] sculpture depicting a scene from the legend of the [[founding of Rome]]. The sculpture shows a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] suckling the mythical twin founders of Rome, [[Romulus and Remus]]. According to the legend, when [[Numitor]], grandfather of the twins, was overthrown by his brother [[Amulius]], the usurper ordered them to be cast into the [[Tiber River]]. They were rescued by a she-wolf who cared for them until a herdsman, [[Faustulus]], found and raised them.

The age and origin of the Capitoline Wolf is controversial.  The statue was long thought to be an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] work of the 5th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANARD/11*.html (Lacus Curtius website) Rodolfo Lanciani, ''Ancient Rome in the Light of Recent Discoveries'' ch.

==Description==
The sculpture is somewhat larger than life-size, standing {{convert|75|cm}} high and {{convert|114|cm}} long. The wolf is depicted in a tense, watchful pose, with alert ears and glaring eyes which are watching for danger. By contrast, the human twins – executed in a completely different style – are oblivious to their surroundings, absorbed by their suckling.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya. ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', p. 241. Wadsworth, 2004. {{ISBN|0-534-64095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution and dating==
The she-wolf from the legend of Romulus and Remus was regarded as a symbol of Rome from ancient times. Several ancient sources refer to statues depicting the wolf suckling the twins. [[Livy]] reports in his ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Roman history]]'' that a statue was erected at the foot of the Palatine Hill in 295 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Livy ''Ab Urbe Condita Book X ch.23&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions the presence in the [[Roman Forum]] of a statue of a she-wolf that was "a miracle proclaimed in bronze nearby, as though she had crossed the [[Comitium]] while [[Attus Navius]] was taking the omens". [[Cicero]] also mentions a statue of the she-wolf as one of a number of sacred objects on the Capitoline that had been inauspiciously struck by [[lightning]] in the year 65 BC: "it was a gilt statue on the Capitol of a baby being given suck from the udders of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Forum/resources/primarysources/Cicero_Cat._3.19  ''[[In Catilinam]]'' 3.19.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero also mentions the wolf in ''[[De Divinatione]]'' 1.20 and 2.47.&lt;ref&gt;([http://dlib.etc.ucla.edu/projects/Forum/resources/Richardson/Ficus_Navia L. Richardson Jr.,] "[[Ficus Navia]]").&lt;/ref&gt;

It was widely assumed that the Capitoline Wolf was the very sculpture described by Cicero, due to the presence of damage to the sculpture's paw, which was believed to correspond to the lightning strike of 65 BC. The 18th-century German art historian [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] attributed the statue to an Etruscan maker in the 5th century BC, based on how the wolf's fur was depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Haskell, Nicholas Penny. ''Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture, 1500–1900'', p. 241. Yale University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-300-02641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first attributed to the [[Veii]]an artist [[Vulca]], who decorated the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]], and then re-attributed to an unknown Etruscan artist of approximately 480–470 BC. Winckelmann correctly identified a [[Renaissance]] origin for the twins; they were probably added in 1471 or later.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina, "[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]''. ''La Repubblica''. 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, a number of researchers questioned Winckelmann's dating of the bronze. [[August Emil Braun]], the secretary of the Archaeological Institute of Rome, proposed in 1854 that the damage to the wolf's paw had been caused by an error during casting. Wilhelm Fröhner, the Conservator of the [[Louvre]], stated in 1878 that style of the statue was attributable to the [[Carolingian art]] period rather than the Etruscan, and in 1885 [[Wilhelm von Bode]] also stated that he was of the view that the statue was most likely a mediaeval work. However, these views were largely disregarded and had been forgotten by the 20th century.&lt;ref name="laregina2006" /&gt;

In 2006, the Italian art historian Anna Maria Carruba and the Etruscologist Adriano La Regina contested the traditional dating of the wolf on the basis of an analysis of the [[casting]] technique. Carruba had been given the task of restoring the sculpture in 1997, enabling her to examine how it had been made. She observed that the statue had been cast in a single piece, using a variation of the [[lost-wax casting]] technique. This technique was not used in [[Classical antiquity]]; ancient Greek and Roman bronzes were typically constructed from multiple pieces, a method that facilitated high-quality castings, with less risk than would be involved in casting the entire sculpture at once. Single-piece casting was, however, widely used in the [[Middle Ages]] to mould bronze items that needed a high level of rigidity, such as [[bell]]s and [[cannon]]s. Carruba argues, like Braun, that the damage to the wolf's paw had resulted from an error in the moulding process. In addition, La Regina, who is the state superintendent of Rome's cultural heritage, argues that the sculpture's artistic style is more akin to Carolingian and [[Romanesque art]] than that of the ancient world.&lt;ref name="laregina2006" /&gt;

Radiocarbon and [[thermoluminescence]] dating was carried out at the [[University of Salento]] in February 2007 to resolve the question.  The results revealed with an accuracy of 95.4 percent that the sculpture was crafted between the 11th and 12th century AD.

==History of the sculpture==

[[File:She-wolf of Rome.JPG|thumb|right|The sculpture in Musei Capitolini]]

It is unclear when the sculpture was first erected, but there are a number of mediaeval references to a "wolf" standing in the Pope's [[Lateran Palace]]. In the 10th century ''Chronicon'' of [[Benedict of Soracte]], the monk chronicler writes of the institution of a supreme court of justice "in the Lateran Palace, in the place called the Wolf, viz, the mother of the Romans." Trials and executions "at the Wolf" are recorded from time to time until 1438.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Lanciani, ''New Tales of Old Rome'', p. 38. Ayer Publishing, 1968. {{ISBN|0-405-08727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th-century English cleric [[Magister Gregorius]] wrote a descriptive essay ''De Mirabilibus Urbis Romae''&lt;ref&gt;G. McN. Rushforth, "Magister Gregorius de Mirabilibus Urbis Romae: A New Description of Rome in the Twelfth Century", ''The Journal of Roman Studies'' '''9''' (1919, pp. 14–58), p. 28f. Magister Gregorius' description seems independent of the well-known topography ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in an appendix three pieces of sculpture he had neglected: one was the Wolf in the [[portico]], at the principal entrance to the Lateran Palace. He mentions no twins, for he noted that she was set up as if stalking a bronze ram that was nearby, which served as a [[fountain]]. The wolf had also served as a fountain, Magister Gregorius thought, but it had been broken off at the feet and moved to where he saw it.&lt;ref&gt;''Lupa etiam quondam singulis mammis aquam abluendis manibus emittebat, sed nunc fractis pedibus a loco suo divulsa est''&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-day Capitoline Wolf could not have been the sculpture seen by Benedict and Gregorius, if its newly attributed age is accepted, though it is conceivable that it could have been a replacement for an earlier (now lost) depiction of the Roman wolf. In December 1471 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] ordered the present sculpture to be transferred to the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] on the Capitoline Hill, and the twins were added some time around then. The Capitoline Wolf joined a number of other genuinely ancient sculptures transferred at the same time, to form the nucleus of the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitoline Museum]].

The image was favoured by [[Benito Mussolini]], who cast himself as the founder of the "[[New Rome]]" and donated [[List of Capitoline Wolf statues|copies of the statue to various places around the world]].&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laskow|first1=Sarah|title=Neither Rome, GA, Nor Rome, NY, Could Handle a Statue with Wolf Teats|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/neither-rome-ga-nor-rome-ny-could-handle-a-statue-with-wolf-teats|accessdate=5 January 2018|work=Atlas Obscura|date=16 October 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage [[United States|American]] goodwill, he sent several copies of the Capitoline Wolf to U.S. cities.

The Capitoline Wolf was used on both the [[emblem]] and the [[poster]] for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome. The Roman football club [[A.S. Roma]] uses it in its emblem as well.

The Capitoline Wolf was used as the logo for [[Artie Ripp|Artie Ripp's]] record label [[Artie Ripp#Family Productions|Family Productions]], which in 1971 released [[Billy Joel|Billy Joel's]] first album as a solo artist, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]''. Due to contractual obligations, it continued to appear on numerous Joel albums even after he was subsequently signed to [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/billy-joel-is-angry-19800904|date=September 4, 1980|accessdate=June 11, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|last1=White|first1=Timothy|title=Billy Joel Is Angry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme of conservation undertaken in the 1990s resulted in an exhibition devoted to the ''Lupa Capitolina'' and her iconography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/eventi/mostre_lupa.htm Capitoline Museums: Exhibition "The Capitoline She-Wolf", June–October 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516045944/http://www.museicapitolini.org/en/eventi/mostre_lupa.htm |date=16 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 film ''[[Agora (film)|Agora]]'', set in 5th-century [[Alexandria]], the Capitoline Wolf—complete with the del Pollaiolo twins—can be seen in the prefect's palace.  This is visible in the scene before [[Hypatia]]'s capture, directly behind her character.
In Rick Riordan's [[The Son of Neptune]], Lupa is the wolf that trains all demigods who wish to enter Camp Jupiter.  She trains [[Percy Jackson]] and is mentioned that she trained [[Jason Grace]] also.

In the first episode of the American television programme ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', a mirror-image sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf is on display in the Addams's living room. It can be seen standing atop a table, just to the right of the main staircase.

The [[Boston Latin School]] uses an image on the cover of their agenda book as well as being the official school emblem.

The Capitoline Wolf is used in Romania and Moldova as a symbol of the Latin origin of its inhabitants and in some major cities there are replicas of the original statue given as a gift from Italy at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Capitoline Wolf is reimagined in ''[[Look at Me (new Capitoline Wolf)]]'', a 2011 [[Installation art|installation]] by [[Poland|Polish]] artist [[Paweł Wocial]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

{{Christian culture}}

{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

'''Christian music''' is [[music]] that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding [[Christianity|Christian]] life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or with a positive message as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

== Worship services ==
{{Main|Church music}}

[[File:Kirchenchor.gif|thumbnail|left|A church [[choir]] singing]]

Among the most prevalent uses of Christian music are in church worship or other gatherings. Most Christian music involves singing, whether by the whole congregation (assembly), or by a specialized subgroup—such as a soloist, duet, trio, quartet, madrigal, [[choir]], or [[Contemporary worship#Worship band|worship band]]— [[responsory|or both]]. It is frequently accompanied by instruments, but some denominations (such as some [[Exclusive Brethren]], the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Primitive Baptists]] and the [[Free Church of Scotland (Continuing)|Free Church of Scotland]]) or congregations still prefer unaccompanied or ''[[a cappella]]'' singing. Some groups, such as the Bruderhof, sing songs both with religious and non-religious meanings and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/bruderhof|title=Bruderhof Communities|website=SoundCloud|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, the act of singing is important. One of the earliest forms of worship music in the church was the [[Gregorian chant]]. [[Pope Gregory I]], while not the inventor of chant, was acknowledged as the first person to order such music in the church, hinting the name "Gregorian" chant. The chant reform took place around 590–604 CE (reign of Pope Gregory I) (Kamien, pg. 65–67). The Gregorian chant was known for its very [[monophony|monophonic]] sound. Believing that complexity had a tendency to create [[cacophony]], which ruined the music, Gregory I kept things very simple with the chant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]]. Music: An Appreciation. 9th ed. New York, New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumental accompaniment ===
[[File:Ninth Symphony original.png|thumb|A page (leaf 12 [[recto]]) from Beethoven's manuscript. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,&lt;ref name="Hall100"&gt;Hall, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.&lt;ref name="Murray45"&gt;Murray, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the West, the majority of Christian denominations use instruments such as an organ, piano, electronic keyboard, guitar, or other accompaniment, and occasionally by a band or orchestra, to accompany the singing. But some churches have historically not used instruments, citing their absence from the New Testament. During the last century or so several of these groups have revised this stance.

The singing of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] is also generally unaccompanied, though in the United States organs are sometimes used as a result of Western influence.

=== Instrumental music ===

Some worship music may be unsung, simply instrumental. During the [[Baroque]] period in Europe, the [[chorale prelude]] (for organ) was widely used, generally composed by using a popular hymn tune thematically, and a wide corpus of other solo organ music began to develop across Europe. Some of the most well-known exponents of such organ compositions include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[François Couperin]], [[César Franck]] and [[Charles-Marie Widor]] to name a few. Up to the present time, various composers have written instrumental (often [[organ (music)|organ]]) music as acts of worship, including well known organ repertoire by composers like [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Maurice Duruflé]], and [[Jean Langlais]].

The [[church sonata]] (for orchestra and chamber group) and other sacred instrumental musical forms also developed from the [[Baroque]] period onwards.

== Contemporary Christian music ==
{{Main|Contemporary Christian music}}

From the latter half of the 20th century to the present day in Western Christendom—especially in the United States and in other countries with evangelical churches—various genres of music originally often related to [[pop rock]], have been created under the label of Contemporary Christian Music ("CCM") for home-listening and concert use. It can be divided into several genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. These genres (sometimes referred to as "style") like other forms of music may be distinguished by the techniques, the styles, the context and the themes, or geographical origin. Specific subgenres of CCM may include (but are not limited to): [[Christian country music]], [[Christian pop]], [[Christian rock]], [[Christian metal]], [[Christian hardcore]], [[Christian punk]], [[Christian alternative rock]] and [[Christian hip hop]].

Called Christian pop or gospel in a generalized form, this is a relatively new musical movement and has now evolved into a large number of musical genres by region that comes in a Christian context. This movement appeared as a form of [[evangelization]] for the young but the genre is best known and seen in the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Protestantism|Protestant]] proselytizing movements, often using rhythms similar to those in secular music.

CCM is not a musical genre like the other genres. When a song is identified as "Christian" it takes into account the lyrics and the songwriters and performers, rather than musical style. Therefore, one can say that CCM is diverse and there are Christian songs that are sung to the rhythm of salsa, reggae, rock, folk, hip-hop or rap, ballads, pop, country, singer-songwriters and even extreme music such as punk or heavy metal.

In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music played a significant role in [[Evangelical]] [[Christian worship]].&lt;ref&gt; Suzel Ana Reily, Jonathan M. Dueck, ''The Oxford Handbook of Music and World Christianities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2016, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Mathew Guest, ''Evangelical Identity and Contemporary Culture: A Congregational Study in Innovation'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of musical styles has developed traditional praise.&lt;ref&gt; George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 629&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other languages ===

Similar developments took place in other language, for example the German [[Neues Geistliches Lied]] and [[Korean Contemporary Christian music]].

=== Industry ===
{{Main|Christian music industry}}

Christian music is supported by a segment of the general music industry which evolved as a parallel structure to the same. Beginning in the 1970s and developing out of the [[Jesus movement]], the [[Christian music industry]] subsequently developed into a near-billion dollar enterprise. By the 1990s the genre had eclipsed classical, jazz, and [[new-age music]], and artists began gaining acceptance in the general market.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Christian media}}

Today, Christian music is available through most available media. Christian music is broadcast over the radio, television, or the Internet. Christian Albums and video recordings ([[CD]], [[LP album|LP]], [[music download|digital download]], [[DVD]], etc.) have been increasingly more popular and have continued to increase in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Turner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/27/obituaries.mainsection |title=Obituary: Larry Norman &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2008-02-27|accessdate=2011-09-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Musicals is another growing area, especially with the help of the internet. Church drama groups frequently enjoy performing musical dramas which can be downloaded on-line for free use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Musicals|url=http://www.christianmusicals.co.za|publisher=Gospel Musicals|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music festivals and conferences ===
{{Main|Christian music festival}}

In the US several Christian [[music festivals]] have been organized. They are common in the summertime and draw many different people, specifically those from organized groups such as church [[youth groups]] and campus groups. In addition to music festivals like those that are part of the [[Christian Festival Association]], there are also many Christian [[Academic conference|conferences]] which focus more on speakers, but usually also have musical performances, especially for a [[Worship service]].

The [[Ichthus Music Festival]] started in 1970. Today festivals are held annually around the world, and may draw upwards of 100,000 people.

New Zealand's [[Parachute Music Festival]], the largest Christian music festival in the Southern Hemisphere, began in 1989 and is held annually at Mystery Creek Events Centre outside the city of Hamilton.

England's [[Big Church Day Out Festival]] began in 2009 and has annual attendance of approximately 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Church Day Out|url=http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|publisher=Big Church Day Out|accessdate=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815042528/http://www.bigchurchdayout.com/about|archive-date=15 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerts ===

Like any musical group or act, many Christian musical artists perform concerts in [[concert halls]], bars &amp; clubs, or outdoor venues, as well as in Church-related venues. Sometimes it may be for pure entertainment, other times with the intention of [[evangelism|witnessing]] (evangelizing by bearing witness of one's faith), and other times may be part [[contemporary worship|worship]] as well.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
A '''composite film''' is a [[feature film]] whose [[screenplay]] is composed of two or more distinct stories. More generally, '''composite structure''' refers to an [[aesthetics|aesthetic principle]] in which the [[narrative structure]] relies on contiguity and linking rather than linearity. In a composite text or film, individual pieces are complete within themselves, yet they form a whole work that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris"&gt;Dunn, Morris (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of composite films begins with composite novels. The composite novel is a literary work composed of shorter texts that—though individually complete and autonomous—are interrelated in a coherent whole according to one or more organizing principles.

Although the composite-text aesthetic can be traced back through [[Frame story|framework-stories]] (such as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''), story cycles (such as the [[Arthurian]] stories), and sacred composites (such as the [[Bible]]), composite texts had specific precursors in the village sketch of nineteenth century Europe and America. Reflecting its roots in the framework-story and/or the cycle, a typical village sketch may feature an introductory story and a summary story, with individually titled internal stories that do not necessarily depend upon specific sequencing.

Twentieth century experimentation with the composite whole-text aesthetic, i.e., combining individual short stories into a whole-text narrative, began with [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Dubliners]]'' and [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]] and accelerated thereafter, but the composite novel remained controversial among readers, reviewers, and critics. Some wanted to call these works "[[novel]]s" while others wanted to call them "collections". To their authors, however, these works were clearly not just collections of stories. Joyce insisted that ''Dubliners'' was a planned, integrated whole text. [[William Faulkner]] fought both publishers and critics over the whole-text coherence of ''[[Go Down, Moses]]'', refusing to append "And Other Stories" to the book's title. Later, [[Maxine Hong Kingston]] and [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]] would wage similar battles over ''The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Childhood Among Ghosts'' (1976) and ''[[The Things They Carried]]'' (1990), respectively. By the end of the twentieth century, authors were announcing their whole-text intentions by insisting on such sub-titles as "A Novel in Stories", or simply "A Novel".&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris" /&gt;

Composite novels have been referred to as a number of other genre-names including short story cycle, framed miscellany, multi-faceted novel, story-novel, short story blend, double-novel, short story compound, short story composite, composite, anthology novel, para novel, triptych, [[mosaic novel]], loose-leaf novel, and short story sequence.

== Titles ==
Within a composite film, the individual stories may or may not be titled. Most highly integrated composite films, such as ''[[Love Actually]]'', ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' etc., do not have individually titled components while more traditional composite films, such as ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', ''[[Coffee &amp; Cigarettes]]'', ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' etc., do. Titling each component reinforces its autonomy and helps viewers experience it both individually and as part of the whole film.

== Unifying elements ==
Many different devices are used to connect the individual stories to each other and to the film in its entirety. Unifying elements include repeated images (such as coffee cups and ash trays in ''Coffee &amp; Cigarettes''), recurring characters (the women within ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' appear in at least one story other than their own), shared incidents (drug addiction in ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]''), common settings (the dark streets of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''), similar themes (the three women of ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]''), a single protagonist (Tommy in ''[[The Fountain]]''), collective protagonists (a group of people like generations of a family, coworkers, a club etc.), etc.

== Story sequencing ==
The sequence in which the individual stories unfold is often significant to the overall meaning of the film. Component pieces can be arranged in a number of different ways (chronologically, thematically, geographically etc.) and each method produces different results.

== Composite film scores ==
In regards to issues with connectivity, it is important to consider the musical score of composite films. Much like visual repetition or thematic similarities, the score offers another medium through which stories can be linked. Rather than leaving viewers with content to process, decode, intellectualize and then react to, the film score can produce emotional reactions immediately, before viewers have a chance to analyze their own responses. There are three main categories of composite film scores:

===Unified score===
In a unified score, there is no discernible difference between the music playing during each story segment. For example, in ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', the highly stylized background music offers ambiance and contributes to the setting and does not vary between characters and stories.  In ''[[Love Actually]]'', pop music blares through happy moments, ballads wail during morose moments, and triumphant strings swell when all things are as they should be.
  
===Composite score===
In a composite score, the music within each individual segment is independent and distinct from the music within other segments. For example, in ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', each titled piece is accompanied by music that relates only to that single piece rather than the film as a whole. In this example, rather than linking the story lines, the music serves to further distinguish each neighborhood from the others.

===Theme and variation===
Theme and variation refers to a main theme that varies slightly by story segment. For example, in ''[[The Fountain]]'', one main theme appears in each character's story, but there are also variations on that theme specific to those individual characters (tribal drums accompany the conquistador in Mayan territory, etc.). In ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', the main theme throughout the film consists of somber classical guitar and accompanying piano, but within each individually titled segment, there are minor differences. Sultry horns are added to the banker's scenes, as she is having an affair, and as the detective investigates the death of her Hispanic friend, the music takes on a subtle Latin sound, etc.

[[File:Chateau Versailles petit appartement Reine salle a manger.jpg|thumb|Encoignure cupboards at Versaille]]
'''Encoignure''' is a type of [[furniture]] located in a corner of a room. In French, it literally means the angle, or return, formed by the junction of two walls. Since the 20th century, the word is chiefly used to designate a small [[armoire]], [[commode]], [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] or [[cupboard]] made to fit a corner. A chair placed in a corner is referred to as a chaise encoignure.

Originally the object comes from France, hence the name, famous pieces by [[Louis Quinze]] or [[Louis Seize]] in [[lacquer]] or in [[mahogany]], elaborately mounted in gilded bronze, are delightfully alluring pieces from the period of grand French furniture. It was made in a vast variety of forms but is strictly limited by its destination. As a rule these delicate and dainty pieces were in pairs and placed in opposite angles; frequently the tops were finished in expensive colored [[marble]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17503">The '''Free Southern Theater''' ('''FST''') was a community theater group founded in 1963 at [[Tougaloo College]] in [[Madison County, Mississippi]], by [[Gilbert Moses]], [[Denise Nicholas]], [[Doris Derby]], and John O’Neal. The company manager was [[Mary Lovelace O'Neal|Mary Lovelace]], later Chair of the Art Department at [[U.C. Berkeley]]. The company disbanded in 1980.

The Free Southern Theater was a part of the emerging Black Theatre Movement and also closely allied with the [[civil rights movement]]—O’Neal and Derby were also directors of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name=Breunlin&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/legacyfreesouttheater.htm The Legacy of the Free Southern Theater in New Orleans], Interviews by Rachel Breunlin.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented plays by [[Langston Hughes]], [[John O. Killens]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[Ossie Davis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/sites/default/files/RPW.reel_.3.FST%20Brochure.pg%2012-19.pdf Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities at Vanderbilt University: The Free Southern Theater.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing a space for their members to write their own plays.

The founders sought to introduce free theater to the South, both as a voice for social protest, and to emphasize positive aspects of [[African-American culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  O’Neal, Derby, and Moses outlined the philosophy of the troupe in a founding document:&lt;ref name=veterans&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/tim63b.htm Civil Rights Movement Veterans Website: Free Southern Theater Founded]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our fundamental objective is to stimulate creative and reflective thought among Negroes in Mississippi and other Southern states by the establishment of a legitimate theater, thereby providing the opportunity in the theater and the associated art forms. We theorize that within the Southern situation a theatrical form and style can be developed that is as unique to the Negro people as the origin of blues and jazz. A combination of art and social awareness can evolve into plays written for a Negro audience, which relate to the problems within the Negro himself, and within the Negro community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mission ==
In 1963, John O'Neal, Doris Derby, Gilbert Moses, and William Hutchinson drafted "A General Prospectus for the Establishment of a Free Southern Theater, Jackson, Mississippi." This document outlined the goals of the theater company and how they would accomplish them. They included:
# To acquaint Southern peoples with a breadth of experience with the theater and related art forms
# To liberate and to explore the creative talent and potential that is here as well as to promote the production of art
# To develop an appreciation of the theater and related art forms- an understanding of the technical problems as well as ideas and concepts
# To bring in artists from outside the state as well as to provide the opportunity for local people with creative ability to have experience with the theater
# To emphasize the universality of the problems of the Negro people
# To strengthen communication between Southern Negroes
# To assert that self-knowledge and creativity are the foundations of Human Dignity&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.tulane.edu/exhibits/items/show/634|title=A General Prospectus for the Establishment of a Free Southern Theater, Jackson, Mississippi|last=Free Southern Theater|first=|date=1963|website=Tulane University Online Exhibits|publisher=|access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With these goals in mind, they solidified a mission statement: "Our objective is to stimulate creative and reflective thought among Negroes in Mississippi and other Southern states by the establishment of a legitimate theater, thereby providing the opportunity for involvement in the theater and associated art forms."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==

The Free Southern Theater was formed in September 1963 when Gilbert Moses and John O’Neal met in Mississippi while working with the [[civil rights movement]]. Their first production, ''In White America'', toured 16 towns and cities ranging in size from Mileston in [[Holmes County, Mississippi]], to [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gilbert Moses, John O'Neil, Denise Nicholas, Murray Levy, Richard Schecner, "Dialog: The Free Southern Theater (1965)", in Bean, Annemarie, ''A Sourcebook of African-American Performance Plays, People, Movements''. London: Routledge, 1999, pp. 102–113. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Moses recalls: "The Holmes County people came in from the farms to see us. We had to play in the afternoon because they wanted to get back home by dark."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For professional help in theater management the Free Southern Theater began working with professor [[Richard Schechner]], then at [[Tulane University]], who joined the theatre as one of its producing directors.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  They toured rural Louisiana and Mississippi presenting plays such as [[Samuel Beckett]]’s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. Initially consisting of both black and white actors, the company gradually became exclusively African-American and presented only plays by black playwrights such as the controversial [[LeRoi Jones]] (later known as Amiri Baraka).

From the first, the company was plagued by artistic and managerial disagreements;&lt;ref name=Breunlin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and, with free admission as a primary objective, money was always in short supply. Following their January 1965 tour, the company did fundraising performances in New York.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under financial duress and hoping to draw on a larger middle class black population, the troupe moved to [[New Orleans]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; where they purchased an office space and gathered a board of directors. The company went from eight members to twenty-three.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1966 Moses, Schechner, and O’Neal left, and the company was taken over by African-American poet and writer [[Thomas Dent (writer)|Thomas Dent]] assisted by [[Kalamu ya Salaam|Val Ferdinand]] (later known as Kalamu ya Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/2514/Dent-Thomas-Covington.html Brief Biographies]: Thomas Covington Dent Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched workshops for actors and introduced plays written by their own members.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  They adapted the play ''In White America'' by [[Martin Duberman]] to depict the murders of [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) field workers [[James Chaney]], [[Michael Schwerner]], and [[Andrew Goodman]], killed in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also performed ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]].&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ossie Davis's "Purlie Victorious".&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Schechner, Moses.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in spite of grants from the [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[Ford Foundation]]s, and support from celebrities including [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Julian Bond]], The Free Southern Theater gradually lost its creative momentum and financial support.&lt;ref name=veterans/&gt; In 1980, The Free Southern Theater closed, however the 1985 production ''A Funeral for the Free Southern Theater: A Valediction Without Mourning'', honored the company “featuring a jazz funeral and a three-day conference of art for social change”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alternateroots.org/from-script-to-screen-documenting-the-free-southern-theater/|title=From Script to Screen Documenting the Free Southern Theater|last=Jason Foster|first=Kiyoko McCrae|date=February 2, 2016|website=Alternative Roots|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; John O’Neal’s theater company Junebug Productions strives to carry on the legacy of the Free Southern Theater.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition to John O'Neal and Gilbert Moses, well known actors who appeared in FST productions included [[Roscoe Orman]],&lt;ref name="Breunlin" /&gt; and [[Denise Nicholas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digilib.usm.edu/cdm/search/searchterm/%20Nicholas,%20Denise,%201944-/mode/exact The University of Southern Mississippi: Digital Collections.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding members ==

=== Gilbert Moses ===
[[Gilbert Moses]], a founding member of The Free Southern Theater and noted theater director, was born in Cleveland in August 1942.  As a student at [[Oberlin College]], Moses studied for a year at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris before leaving school to join the civil rights movement. During his time in Mississippi, Moses served as a journalist for the ''Mississippi Free Press''. ''New York Times'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] observes that an interest in the work of [[Jean Vilar]] and the [[Théâtre National Populaire|Theatre National Populaire]] led Moses to pursue more "socially relevant theater".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/18/obituaries/gilbert-moses-is-dead-at-52-award-winning-stage-director.html|title=Gilbert Moses Is Dead at 52; Award-Winning Stage Director|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=1995-04-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his involvement with The Free Southern Theater, Moses directed stage productions both on and off-Broadway. In 1969 Moses won an [[Obie Award]] for [[Amiri Baraka]]'s 1969 play ''Slave Ship''. Reflecting on a 1972 ''New York Times'' interview with Moses, Gussow observes how he "called for a deeper investigation of the lives of black people in the United States".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He quotes Moses, “We as blacks are starved for images of ourselves all over this country”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Moses died of [[multiple myeloma]] in April 1995.

=== Doris Derby ===
Born in either 1939 or 1940 in the [[The Bronx|Bronx, New York]], [[Doris Derby]]’s long career has spread across a wide array of disciplines, ranging from theater to education. From an early age, Derby expressed strong interest in community activism and civil rights and joined a [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) youth group in the Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights History Project, US, Joseph Mosnier, and Doris Adelaide Derby. ''Doris Adelaide Derby oral history interview conducted by Joseph Mosnier in Atlanta, Georgia, 2011-04-26''. Atlanta, Georgia, None , 4, 2011. Video. Retrieved from the Library of Congress, &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.loc.gov/item/2015669107/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; As a student at [[Hunter College]] in New York, Derby was a member of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aas.msstate.edu/fsc/guests/|title=Freedom Summer Conference :: African American Studies :: College of Arts &amp; Sciences|last=Dev|first=ITS Web|website=www.aas.msstate.edu|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department of African American studies at [[Mississippi State University]] observes that the SNCC “organized voter registration drives, self help economic and educational initiatives and carried out protests at such places as segregated local, statewide and national governmental facilities, public movie theaters, parks, medical facilities and churches”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Derby’s work within the SNCC was centered, primarily, in New York, Georgia, and Mississippi. In Mississippi Derby taught adult literacy through the SNCC and helped found ''The Free Southern Theater''. In 1990, Derby joined the faculty of [[Georgia State University]] and served as the founding Director of the Office of African American Student Services and Programs, as well as, Adjunct Associate Professor of Cultural Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A noted photographer, as well, Derby’s work has been exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts|Bronx Museum of Art]]. Her documentary photographs are known to “depict the life of struggling Americans who defied the post-emancipation status quo brought about by political, economic, social and cultural domination and exploitation”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2012, Derby retired from Georgia State University following a successful 22 years of service.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== John O’Neal ===
Like fellow FST founder, Doris Derby, John O’Neal worked for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi as a field director. O’Neal also served as national field program director of the Committee for Racial Justice. The recipient of the Award of Merit from the [[Association of Performing Arts Presenters]] and a [[Ford Foundation|Ford Foundation Award]], O’Neal has written eighteen plays, a musical comedy, poetry, and several essays.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://junebugproductions.org/about/board-members/|title=Board Members {{!}} Junebug Productions|website=junebugproductions.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, ''The Free Southern Theater'' produced their final performance, a solo piece written and performed by O’Neal titled ''Don't Start Me to Talking or I’ll Tell Everything I Know''. The play features the character Junebug Jabbo Jones, “created by the SNCC members to represent and symbolize the wit and wisdom of common folk”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcg.org/fifty/EDI/groundat20john.cfm|title=The Ground at 20: John O’Neal, Free Southern Theater &amp; Junebug Productions|last=|first=|date=|website=Theatre Communications Group|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performance marked the final production of the FST, but also signified the creation of O’Neal’s new theater company, Junebug Productions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; John O’Neal currently serves as the Founding Director and Artistic Director Emeritus for Junebug Productions.

== Notable productions ==
The first productions put on by the Free Southern Theatre were ''In White America'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. These productions toured through the poor areas of the south, especially in Mississippi, where the company was founded. As part of their mission, the shows never charged an entry fee and performed in public places like churches and community halls. As mentioned in the History section, their production of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' was performed in whiteface since most of the cast was African American at the time. The theater also performed [[Purlie|''Purlie Victorious'']]. In a ''New York Times'' article, a company member only referred to as "James" (James Cromwell, who played Pozzo) describes the enthusiasm that [[Waiting for Godot|Godot]] received from the audiences in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://storage.synaptic.att.com/rest/objects/4a08bf2ea61f2e0e04f4ffec85b79604f5fd9dbec87a?uid=7be5f8cb9eb14188b0e40ae93aca2099%2FkingcenterATpalantirDOTnet&amp;expires=1590984000&amp;signature=VGCVGx25H8yq1zKh3Op2SZmB1oA%3D|title=They Are Waiting for Godot In Mississippi, Too|last=Minor|first=W.F.|date=31 January 1965|work=The New York Times|access-date=18 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==
In addition to free performances throughout its existence, the Free Southern Theatre remained rooted in its Civil Rights roots. They had workshops for the community and college students at various stops on their tours, an acting apprenticeship, and a sponsorship program for local artists in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/u/0/exhibit/wgJy0M-5vTtQIg|title=The Free Southern Theater  - Google Arts &amp; Culture|newspaper=Google Cultural Institute|language=en|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their partnership with the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]] was essential for them to gain funding and support in order to continue their mission.

The Free Southern Theater had to end its operations in 1980. Their mission did not entirely end, however, as [http://junebugproductions.org/ Junebug Productions] was formed in the shadow of the Free Southern Theater. This company is still working in several communities in the south in order to bring arts to areas that need it most. Their biggest project is the [http://animatingdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/documents/labs/color_line_project_case_study.pdf National Color Line Project] in which the company travels and collects stories surrounding the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and uses them to archive history as well as bring new light to the current racial situation in the [[United States|U.S.]]

'''''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.''''', 581 U.S. ___ (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.|link=|volume=581|year=2017|docket=15-1189}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] in [[patent]] law in which the Court held that after the sale of a patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by [[Lexmark]] against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used [[ink cartridge]]s, refilled them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a [[digital rights management]] scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the [[Federal Circuit]], held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or resale of its contracts with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

==Background==

===Factual setting===

[[File:Lexmark_toner_cartridge_drawing_from_U.S._Pat._No._5,802,431.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Drawing of toner cartridge from one of Lexmark's patents]]

Lexmark International, Inc. makes and sells printers and toner cartridges for its printers. Lexmark owns a number of patents that cover its cartridges and their use. Lexmark sold the cartridges at issue in this case—some in the United States and some abroad.

==== Domestic sales ====

Lexmark's domestic sales were in two categories. A "Regular Cartridge" is sold at "list price" and confers an absolute title and property right on the buyer.{{efn|This litigation does not involve these domestically sold cartridges.}} A "Return Program Cartridge” is sold at a discount of about 20 percent, and is subject to post-sale restrictions: The buyer may not reuse the cartridge after the toner runs out and may not transfer it to anybody else. The first branch of the case turns on the legal status of these post-sale restrictions.

Lexmark manufactured the toner cartridges with microchips in them, which send signals to the printers indicating toner level. When the amount of toner in a cartridge falls below a certain level, the printer will not operate with that cartridge. Also, the printer will not operate with a Return Program Cartridge that has been refilled by a third party. Thus, Lexmark's technology prevented violation of the post-sale restriction against refilling the Return Program Cartridges. The Regular Cartridges do not have this anti-refill feature and can therefore be refilled and reused (but they cost 20 percent more).{{efn|It was stipulated that the 20% price difference "reflects the value of the property interest and use rights conveyed to the purchaser under the express terms of the conditional sale contract and conditional single-use license conferred by Lexmark."}}

“To circumvent this technological measure,” however, “third parties have ‘hacked’ the Lexmark microchips. They created their own "unauthorized replacement" microchips that, when installed in a Return Program cartridge, fool the printer into allowing reuse of that cartridge. Various companies{{efn|For example, Static Control Components, Inc., which became involved in related litigation with Lexmark. See, e.g., ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.|Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]'', 487 F. Supp. 2d 830 (E.D. Ky. 2007).}} purchase used Return Program Cartridges from the customers who bought them from Lexmark. They replace the microchips with "unauthorized replacement" microchips, refill the cartridges with toner, and sell the "re-manufactured" cartridges to resellers such as Impression Products for marketing to consumers for use with Lexmark printers. Lexmark had previously argued in ''[[Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.]]'' that replacing these microchips violated copyright law and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), but both federal and the Supreme Court have ruled against Lexmark, affirming that replacing the microchips is not in violation of copyright.

====Imported cartridges====

The second branch of the case involves cartridges that Lexmark sold outside the US. While some of the foreign-sold cartridges were Regular Cartridges and some were Return Program Cartridges, this branch of the case does not involve any distinction among the two types of imported cartridges.

===Trial court decision===

The district court granted Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the single-use cartridges Lexmark had first sold in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 2014 WL 1276133 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court concluded that the Supreme Court in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  found exhaustion where “the Supreme Court determined that the agreements [at issue] broadly authorized Intel [the seller] to sell the licensed products without restrictions or conditions."&lt;ref&gt;2014 WL 1276133, at *5.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court said “that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'' ''sub silentio'',” and therefore "those post-sale use restrictions do not prevent patent rights from being exhausted given that the initial sales were authorized and unrestricted." &lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court held, however, that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply to the cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad. It said that international exhaustion did not apply to patents because ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 568 U.S. __, 133 S. Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;, which established international exhaustion in at least some cases, applied only to copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Ink Techs. Printer Supplies, LLC'', 9 F. Supp. 3d 830, 833-34 (S.D. Ohio 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The court therefore denied Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the cartridges Lexmark had sold abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. at 838.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government ''amicus curiae'' position===

In its ''amicus curiae'' brief, the US Government argued that ''Mallinckrodt'' had been wrongly decided in 1992 and in any case it had been overruled ''sub silentio'' in ''Quanta''. It stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the view of the United States, the first authorized sale of a patented article in the United States wholly exhausts the patentee’s exclusive rights in that article, notwithstanding any post-sale restriction imposed by the patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The government also argued that the decision of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission]]'' (2001) should be partially overruled in light of ''Kirtsaeng'' insofar as it held that foreign sales can ''never'' exhaust US patent rights. When the patentee neither makes nor authorizes a foreign sale, as occurred in ''[[Boesch v. Graff]]'',&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; it is proper to say no exhaustion occurred. But when the patentee makes or authorizes a foreign sale, and fails expressly to reserve its US rights, then exhaustion should be found. In the present case, Lexmark made the foreign sales and failed to expressly reserve its US rights; therefore, the sale exhausted the patent rights.

==Federal Circuit decision==
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc.ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit oral argument on March 6, 2015.]]
[[File:Fed. Cir. oral argument. 2014-1617 Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc. (Re-argument en-banc).ogg|thumb|Federal Circuit re-argument en banc on October 15, 2015.]]
The parties each appealed.  After a three judge panel had heard oral argument the Federal Circuit ''[[sua sponte]]'' set the case for argument ''en banc'' in the first instance and invited the filing of ''amicus curiae'' briefs.&lt;ref&gt;''Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Impression Prods., Inc.'', 785 F.3d 565 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majority opinion===

Judge Taranto, writing for a 10-2 majority, reaffirmed both of the prior Federal Circuit rulings. In summary, the court held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; that a patentee, when selling a patented article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser, does not by that sale give the buyer, or downstream buyers, the resale/reuse authority that has been expressly denied. Such resale or reuse, when contrary to the known, lawful limits on the authority conferred at the time of the original sale, remains unauthorized and therefore remains infringing conduct under the terms of §&amp;nbsp;271. Under Supreme Court precedent, a patentee may preserve its §&amp;nbsp;271 rights through such restrictions when licensing others to make and sell patented articles; ''Mallinckrodt'' held that there is no sound legal basis for denying the same ability to the patentee that makes and sells the articles itself. We find ''Mallinckrodt''’s principle to remain sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Second, we adhere to the holding of ''[[Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission|Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Comm’n]]'',&lt;ref&gt;264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; that a U.S. patentee, merely by selling or authorizing the sale of a U.S.-patented article abroad, does not authorize the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States, which are infringing acts in the absence of patentee-conferred authority. ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion ruling recognizes that foreign markets under foreign sovereign control are not equivalent to the U.S. markets under U.S. control in which a U.S. patentee’s sale presumptively exhausts its rights in the article sold. A buyer may still rely on a foreign sale as a defense to infringement, but only by establishing an express or implied license—a defense separate from exhaustion, as ''Quanta'' holds—based on patentee communications or other circumstances of the sale. We conclude that ''Jazz Photo''’s no-exhaustion principle remains sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;– U.S. –, 133 S.Ct. 1351 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court did not address patent law or whether a foreign sale should be viewed as conferring authority to engage in otherwise-infringing domestic acts. ''Kirtsaeng'' is a copyright case holding that 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) entitles owners of copyrighted articles to take certain acts “without the authority” of the copyright holder. There is no counterpart to that provision in the Patent Act, under which a foreign sale is properly treated as neither conclusively nor even presumptively exhausting the U.S. patentee’s rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;- F.3d at -.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its ''Mallincrodt'' decision and rejected contentions that ''Quanta'' had silently overruled it.

=====§&amp;nbsp;271 abrogates common-law rule=====

The court began by distinguishing the Patent Act's and Copyright Act's respective approaches to infringement. in 17 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;109(a) the Copyright Act says, "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3)," defining infringement by selling, a purchaser "is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession" of a purchased copy of a work. In contrast, the Patent Act contains no exhaustion provision. Therefore, the Patent Act requires a "conferral of 'authority' by the patentee .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. in order for the actions listed in §&amp;nbsp;271(a) not to constitute infringement." This means there must be "permission from the patentee" to avoid infringement. The court does not accept exhaustion as a form of "constructive" permission. Hence, if the patentee places explicit limits or conditions on its permission, they qualify the scope of the permission. This has the effect of limiting the common law.

=====''General Talking Pictures'' rule applies to "conditional" sale=====

The court turned to the ''General Talking Pictures'' decision,{{efn|''General Talking Pictures Corp v Western Electric Co.'', 304 U.S. 175, 182 (1938) (upholding as legitimate field-of-use limitations on scope of patent licenses to make and sell amplifiers only in “non-commercial” field), aff’d on reh’g, 305 U.S. 124 (1938).}} which holds "that Lexmark would not have exhausted its patent rights in those cartridges, upon the manufacturing licensee’s sale (the first sale), if a buyer with knowledge of the restrictions resold or reused them in violation of the restrictions." Although the government in its ''amicus curiae'' brief and defendant Impression argue "that a different result is required—that Lexmark automatically lost its patent rights—simply because Lexmark sold the Return Program cartridges itself, subject to the same communicated restriction, rather than having left the manufacture and sale to others under license," the court does not accept that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We conclude otherwise, as we did in ''Mallinckrodt'' and subsequent decisions. A sale made under a clearly communicated, otherwise-lawful restriction as to post-sale use or resale does not confer on the buyer and a subsequent purchaser the "authority" to engage in the use or resale that the restriction precludes. And there is no sound reason, and no Supreme Court precedent, requiring a distinction that gives less control to a practicing-entity patentee that makes and sells its own product than to a non-practicing-entity patentee that licenses others to make and sell the product.{{efn|But see ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]'', in which the Court stated that it was well settled that “where a patentee makes the patented article and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee's rights.” On the other hand, the Court said, “the question is a different one ... when we consider what a patentee who grants a license to one to make and vend the patented article may do in limiting the licensee in the exercise of the right to sell.”}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====''Quanta'' distinguishable and inapplicable=====

The court turned to the ''Quanta'' decision and found it inapplicable to the present issues. "'Quanta did not involve a patentee’s sale at all, let alone one subject to a restriction or, more particularly, a single-use/no-resale restriction." Rather, ''Quanta'' involved a patentee's (LGE's) license to a manufacturer (Intel) that sold to the accused infringer (Quanta). LGE had not limited Intel's license to manufacture the patented product, although it imposed contractual obligations on Intel. "No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents." The Federal Circuit emphasized: "There were no patentee sales, and there were no restrictions on the sales made by the licensee." Those facts were removed from the case at bar. Thus the ''Quanta'' "Court’s discussion of that issue does not undermine ''Mallinckrodt''&amp;#8202;’s ruling that a patentee can preserve its patent rights through restrictions on its sales." The Federal Circuit also emphasized as significant the failure of the ''Quanta'' Court to explicitly repudiate ''Mallinckrodt'' despite the fact that in its ''amicus'' brief "the government prominently featured an argument that ''Mallinckrodt'' was incorrect and should be repudiated."

=====Prior cases=====

The court then turned to the prior Supreme Court cases. Reviewing them, it found that although they used sweeping language that a patentee's sale of the patented product placed it beyond the reach of the patent, so that no post-sale restriction could be enforced under the patent laws, that language went beyond the actual facts of the cases. First, the sales were in most cases without any condition or restriction on what the buyer might do with the product. Second, in the cases where an explicit condition or restriction was imposed, the case involved a tie-in or a price-fix.

The Court conceded that in the ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.|General Electric]]'' case, the Supreme Court had said: “It is well settled, as already said, that where a patentee makes the patented article, and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee’s rights.” But that case involved an antitrust challenge to GE's distribution of lamps that did not meet that description. The case involved price restrictions on a licensed manufacturer. The Federal Circuit then explained that the word "settled" in the Supreme Court's statement had a special, narrow meaning:
"We read that language to deem 'settled' only what was settled in the cited precedents—a patentee’s sales ''without restrictions'' exhaust patent rights in the item sold." Thus, the Supreme Court's sweeping exhaustion language applies precedentially only to cases in which either the sale was without condition or restriction or else the sale was made with a tie-in or price-fixing condition. "But the Court did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights."

Similarly, in ''[[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]]'', the Supreme Court's sweeping language must now be limited to the factual context of the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, although some language in ''Univis'',  like language in other decisions in the area, can be taken out of context and read as going beyond the specific restrictions involved, the most the Court ruled, even as to patent law all by itself, was that a vertical price-control restriction was ineffective to preserve patent rights after sales of articles embodying the patents. While ''Univis'' is controlling on what it decided on the issues before it, we do not think it appropriate to give broad effect to language in ''Univis'', taken out of context, to support an otherwise-unjustified conclusion here on a question not faced there.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal Circuit therefore drew this conclusion from the past series of Supreme Court cases on exhaustion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the foregoing reasons, we think that the best lesson to draw from the Supreme Court’s precedents, as applied to the question before us, is that a patentee may preserve its patent rights by otherwise-proper restrictions when it makes and sells patented articles itself and not only when it contracts out manufacturing and sales.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Patent law trumps common law=====

The Federal Circuit returned to the common law and Lord Coke's commentary on it. Again, the court insisted that Congress had overridden the common law's prohibitions on post-sale restraints, in order to promote technological progress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hatever considerations might go into a jurisdiction’s choice as to the background rule for personal property in general, lawmaking authorities may reasonably make different choices for particular kinds of property. Notably, as to intellectual property in its various forms, Congress, implementing the Constitution, has long deemed it important to incentivize creation and disclosure through grants to the creator of rights to exclude others for a time.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. That overriding legislative prescription removes the patented-article sale from the scope of Lord Coke’s 1628 description of his country’s general judicially fashioned property law.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. In short, notwithstanding Lord Coke’s description of English general personal-property judge-made law, the patent-specific statutory analysis must govern here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Likely effects on public=====

The court then turned to what it called "the likely real-world consequences of one answer or another to the exhaustion question presented here." The court noted that in ''Kirtsaeng'' the Supreme Court had envisioned serious adverse effects on competition unless Coke's 1628 property law rules were followed. The Federal Circuit said that did not apply to patents:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e see no basis for predicting the extreme, lop-sided impacts the Court found plausible in ''Kirtsaeng'' in different circumstances. ''Mallinckrodt'' has been the governing case law since 1992 and has been reiterated in subsequent precedent. And yet we have been given no reliable demonstration of widespread problems not being solved in the marketplace. Given ''General Talking Pictures'', the only question is about patentees’ ability to do for their own sales what they already can do by contracting out their manufacturing and sales. Regarding the specific scenario we are addressing today—in which the patentee has sought to preserve its patent rights by conditioning its first sale on a single-use/no-resale restriction of which the accused infringer had adequate notice at the time of purchase—we have been given no proof of a significant problem with enforcing patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the Federal Circuit maintained, the conduct challenged here can have benefits. Under Lexmark's program, customers who agree to the restriction pay a lower price than those who do not. It could be that the companies that refill the cartridges use inferior products that could harm the Lexmark machines, which "could harm Lexmark’s reputation." To assume that the restrictions are illegitimate would run counter to the trends "over the last four decades, that have displaced the strict condemnation of various vertical restrictions that characterized" earlier antitrust and patent-misuse law in the first part of the twentieth century. “Field-of-use, territorial, and other limitations on intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as possible.” Therefore, the court concluded it is appropriate to apply to post-sale restrictions the same tolerance that the ''General Talking Pictures'' doctrine accords limitations in manufacturing licenses.

====International exhaustion====

In this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed it ''Jazz Photo'' opinion and rejected contentions that ''Kirtsaeng'' had undermined the basis for ''Jazz Photo''. The Federal Circuit insisted that "''Kirtsaeng'' says nothing about patent law."

The court emphasized the differences between patent law and copyright law. For example, patent law gives patentees an exclusive right to use of the invention but copyright law gives no general exclusionary right as to use (it gives exclusive public performance and display "use" rights, but not others). Also, it is much more costly and time-consuming to obtain a patent than a copyright. The court did not explain, however, the way that or other differences between copyrights and patents called for contrary results as to international exhaustion.

The court did say that the US patent statute gives patentees the reward available from "sales in American markets, not from sales in foreign markets." A sale in a foreign market therefore does not furnish a proper basis for finding exhaustion. "American markets differ substantially from markets in many other countries, and not just because of disparities in wealth that can lead to dramatically different prices" in this country and abroad (as was the case in ''Kirtsaeng''). "Government policies differ dramatically, including policies on price regulation and, most particularly, policies on the availability and scope of patent protection." The court did not explain further, however, whether and how such dramatic differences in policy applied to the toner cartridges at issue in the present case.

The court then turned to the only Supreme Court case on foreign exhaustion, ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Graff was the assignee of a US patent. Boesch bought the product from a German supplier who had a prior-user right under German law to make and sell the product, because the supplier had begun activity before the application for the German counterpart patent was filed. The US assignee and the inventor had no connection with Boesch. When Graff imported the product into the US, Boesch sued for infringement. The US courts found Boesch liable. The rights that Boesch had under German law did not entitle him to import the product into the US. That is governed by US law. The US patentee had never "received any royalty or given any license to use the patented article in any part of the United States."
Accordingly, the court held, a foreign sale does not of its own force authorize importation into the US.

This does not mean, however, that a patentee by its conduct cannot waive its US rights, be estopped from asserting them, or be found to have granted an implied license.

The court expressed concern that overruling ''Jazz Photo'' would harm the US drug industry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the court rejected a proposal that exhaustion should be presumed unless the patentee express states that it reserves its US rights. Foreign governments might "prohibit sellers from stating reservations of rights that would make importation into and sale in the United States more difficult." Also: "Intermediary companies between the foreign purchase and the importation into the United States may be created that make it difficult for the U.S. patentee to carry an affirmative burden of proving adequate notice of reservations attached to a foreign-sold article."

===Dissenting opinion===

Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented from both branches of the court's exhaustion analysis. Judge Dyk summarized his dissent in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would overrule our decision in ''Mallinckrodt'' as inconsistent with governing Supreme Court authority and overrule ''Jazz Photo'' to the extent that it imposes a blanket ban on foreign exhaustion. I would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Domestic exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued that the majority had misunderstood the Supreme Court's exhaustion jurisprudence in order to substitute its own ideas of the proper balance between patent rights and public rights. He began by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, I agree with the government that ''Mallinckrodt'' was wrong when decided, and in any event cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in ''Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. 617 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that since 1850 the Supreme Court has held that a sale by the patentee or its licensee exhausts all patent rights. In such cases, "The question of whether the seller has 'authorized' the buyer to use or resell the item is simply irrelevant." Post-sale restrictions could not be enforced under federal patent law. The only Supreme Court case to depart from that principle was ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;224 U.S. 1 (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; and it was explicitly overruled five years later by ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. 502, 518 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the overruled ''Dick'' case that a patentee could impost a post-sale restriction by giving a buyer notice of it was "the same as the panel’s holding in ''Mallinckrodt'' and the majority’s holding in this case."

He insisted that the majority opinion misread the ''Motion Picture Patents'' decision by asserting "that it only 'held particular restrictions improper' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. but 'did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights.'" He explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is not accurate. ''Motion Picture Patents'' did not leave behind the remnants of ''A.B. Dick''—minus tie-ins and resale price maintenance. To the contrary, the Court in ''Motion Picture Patents'' found that “[t]he patent law furnishes no warrant for” the restrictions imposed by the patent owner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later cases, such as ''Quanta'', confirmed this "broad patent exhaustion rule [in ''Motion Picture Patents''] and left no room for a resurrection of ''A.B. Dick''."

He next turned to the majority's referenced to "conditional sales" and "unconditional sales," and said that the majority misconstrued the terms. "Conditional sales," he said, as used in pre-''Mallinckrodt'' case law referred only to the retention of title for a security interest in installment purchases. "In other words, a sale with restrictions could nonetheless be an 'unconditional' sale in which title passes, with the restrictions invalid under the patent laws because of exhaustion."

He then criticized the majority for making up special rules for patent cases that differed from the common law and general legal principles, citing Supreme Court admonitions not to do that--"The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed us not to ignore traditional legal principles to fashion rules 'unique to patent disputes.'"{{efn|He cited as examples: ''eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C.'', 547 U.S. 388, 393 (2006); ''Global–Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.A.'', 563 U.S. 754 (2011); ''MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.'', 549 U.S. 118, 132 n. 11 (2007).}}

Finally, Judge Dyk took issue on multiple grounds with the majority's efforts to distinguish and limit the Supreme Court's rulings. "The majority’s justifications for refusing to follow Supreme Court authority establishing the exhaustion rule misconceive our role as a subordinate court." Each justification in the majority decision was unsupportable, he said.

* "First, the majority characterizes the statement of the exhaustion rule in the Supreme Court cases as mere dictum because in those cases there was either no restriction imposed or the restriction would otherwise violate the antitrust laws. But the cases impose no such qualification on the rule announced. The Supreme Court has repeatedly advised the courts of appeals that our task is to follow the rules proclaimed by the Court, and not to attempt to distinguish Supreme Court cases on their facts."
* "Second, the majority relies on 35 U.S.C. §§&amp;nbsp;271(a) and 154(a)(1) to suggest that a broad reading of the exhaustion doctrine is inconsistent with statutory language making an act of infringement .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. any use or sale of a patented invention 'without authority' of the patent owner, and providing the patent owner with a 'right to exclude.'" But the patent exhaustion doctrine is a limitation on the operation of those sections, and applies notwithstanding them.
* "Third, the majority claims that giving full sweep to the articulation of the exhaustion doctrine in Quanta and other cases would be inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.]]'' .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The majority suggests it would be incongruous if 'a patentee cannot preserve its patent rights against uses of a patented article .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. if, instead of licensing someone else to make and sell the article, it chooses to make and sell the article itself.'&amp;#8239;”

:But ''General Talking Pictures'' was a case of a license to manufacture in a limited field,  not a sale with a post-sale restriction. The cases recognize that distinction. Thus, in ''Quanta'' the Supreme Court stated that ''General Talking Pictures'' "held that exhaustion did not apply because the manufacturer had no authority to sell the amplifiers for commercial use.”&lt;ref&gt;553 U.S. at 636.&lt;/ref&gt; And where the manufacturer in that case (Intel) did have a general authority to make and sell, the Supreme Court held that exhaustion applied to the sale.

:The majority found "tension" between "the Supreme Court’s broad statement of the exhaustion rule and ''General Talking Pictures''" and sought to resolve it by extending the rule of ''General Talking Pictures'' and contracting the exhaustion doctrine in the area of possible conflict. But, Dyk maintained:

:&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t is not our task to ignore Supreme Court rulings as "unjustifi[ed]" or "unsound" because they are purportedly inconsistent with other Supreme Court cases. The distinction between restrictions on sales (impermissible) and restrictions on licensees (permissible) exists in the Court’s precedent, and it is not for us to decide if it is a sound distinction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* "Finally, the majority proposes that we should somehow sustain the restriction here because it may be pro-competitive. Exhaustion does not turn on whether a particular post-sale restriction is desirable or undesirable, pro-competitive or anti-competitive, but whether the sale was authorized and the item has passed beyond the scope of the patent monopoly." Furthermore, the Supreme Court said in ''Kirtsaeng'' that a prohibition on resale is "manifestly anti-competitive."&lt;ref&gt;''Kirtsaeng'', 133 S.Ct. at 1363.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyk concluded his discussion of domestic exhaustion with the statement: "There is, in sum, no colorable basis for the majority’s failure to follow the exhaustion rule for domestic sales as articulated by the Court in ''Quanta'' and numerous other cases."

====International exhaustion====

In this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued for a nuanced balance that called for different results depending on whether the patentee was responsible for the sale abroad that was alleged to trigger exhaustion.

He began by pointing out that because Lexmark's foreign sales were made without any restrictions or reservations, "even under the majority’s cramped view of exhaustion, there is no question that the sales would have exhausted Lexmark’s domestic patent rights. The issue is whether the foreign location of the sale should lead to a different result, as we previously held in ''Jazz Photo''."

He then turned to "the centerpiece of the majority’s holding that there is a doctrinal blanket ban on foreign exhaustion, namely the Supreme Court’s decision in ''Boesch v. Graff''.&lt;ref&gt;133 U.S. 697 (1890).&lt;/ref&gt; But "''Boesch'' announced no such blanket ban," he said. "It did not even involve an authorized sale by the holder of U.S. patent rights but rather a sale by a third party under a foreign law’s prior use exception."{{efn|Under German law, the defendant had a ''prior user right'' to use the invention because it had begun to do so before the patentee filed its patent application.}} But "''Boesch'' does not apply here because the foreign sales were made by Lexmark."

In every US lower court decision before ''Jazz Photo'': "When the sale was made by an entity not holding U.S. patent rights, as in ''Boesch'', or when the authorized foreign seller clearly reserved U.S. rights, there was no exhaustion." In contrast, "where the foreign sale was made by a seller holding U.S. patent rights without a contractual reservation of U.S. rights, exhaustion occurred as a result of an authorized foreign sale."

Dyk maintained that "''Kirtsaeng'' provides significant guidance and cannot be dismissed as simply a copyright case, or as limited to the 'first sale' provision of the Copyright Act." Rather, the policies that animated ''Kirtsaeng'' typically apply to patent exhaustion. But because in some cases a difference may be significant, there should be abalanced approach. Dyk argued for "put[ting] the burden on the U.S. rights holder to provide notice of a reservation of U.S. rights to the purchaser." Thus, he "would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights."

==Supreme Court==
In March 2016, Impression filed a petition for ''[[certiorari]]'' in the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Impression-Products-v.-Lexmark-cert-petition-no-appendix.pdf Petition for a Writ of Certiorari], ''Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc.'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1189.htm No. 15-1189].&lt;/ref&gt; Impression presented these questions in its petition:&lt;ref&gt;Br. Pet. at ''i''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1. Whether a "conditional sale" that transfers title to the patented item while specifying post-sale restrictions on the article’s use or resale avoids application of the patent exhaustion doctrine and therefore permits the enforcement of such post-sale restrictions through the patent law’s infringement remedy.
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2. Whether, in light of this Court’s holding in ''Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.'', 133 S. Ct. 1351, 1363 (2013), that the common law doctrine barring restraints on alienation that is the basis of exhaustion doctrine "makes no geographical distinctions," a sale of a patented article—authorized by the U.S. patentee—that takes place outside of the United States exhausts the U.S. patent rights in that article.

[[File:SCOTUS Oral Argument. 15-1189. Impressions Products, Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.ogg|thumb|Supreme Court oral argument 03/21/17]]
On June 20, 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file briefs in this case expressing the views of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', No. 15-1189, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 3982, at *1 (June 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, the government filed the requested ''amicus curiae'' brief. It recommended grant of ''certiorari'' on both questions. The brief argues that the "Federal Circuit's decision misreads" the Supreme Court's precedents and "would substantially erode the exhaustion doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/15-1189-US-Amicus.pdf ''Brief For The United States As Amicus Curiae''] on petition for certiorari at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court granted ''certiorari'' on December 2, 2016&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.'', 2016 U.S. LEXIS 7275.&lt;/ref&gt; and heard oral argument in the case on March 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Mann. ''[http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/argument-analysis-justices-skeptical-categorical-exhaustion-patent-rights/ Argument analysis: Justices skeptical of categorical “exhaustion” of patent rights]'', [[SCOTUSblog]] (March 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court published its decisions on May 30, 2017.

===Majority===
A unanimous Court{{efn|Justice Gorsuch joined the Court after oral arguments were heard and took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;}} found that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights upon first sale domestically, even with the single-use/no-resale restrictions imposed by Lexmark in contracts with its customers, although such restrictions could be enforced under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court noted that the exhaustion doctrine has a long history&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 5-9.&lt;/ref&gt; and that any change would have significant effects on commerce in the modern world, noting that "extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain,"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that complex modern [[supply chain]]s can involve large numbers of patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8 (citing [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15-1189-tsac-Costco-et-al.pdf Brief for Costco Wholesalers, Corp. et al.] as ''[[Amicus curiae|Amicus Curiae]]'' at 7-9; [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Intel-Vizio-Amicus-Brief-as-Filed.pdf Brief for Intel, Corp. et al.] as ''Amicus Curiae'' at 17, n. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Citing, ''inter alia'', an [[Amicus curiae|''amicus'' brief]] filed by [[Intel]] that a generic smartphone could practice an estimated 250,000 patents.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, compared the situation to automobile repair shops: "The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/supreme-court-patent-rights-lexmark.html | title = Supreme Court Rules Patent Laws Can’t Be Used to Prevent Reselling | first1=  Adam | last1 = Liptak | first2=Vindu | last2=Goel | date = May 30, 2017 | accessdate = May 30, 2017 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven justices joined the Court's opinion extending that reasoning to items imported from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', syllabus at 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lexmark had argued, and the Federal Circuit agreed, that sale abroad "does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee 'expressly or implicitly transfers or licenses' its rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13 (quoting [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15-1189-respondent-merits.pdf Brief for Respondent] 36-37)(some internal punctuation marks removed).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, however, ruled that "[a]n authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court relied on its 2013 decision in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' on a nearly identical issue under copyright law. Because the underlying statute was not clear as to its geographical scope, the Court in ''Kirtsaeng'' decided that, because the statute was based in the common law exhaustion doctrine, which is not limited in geographic extent, the statute at issue was therefore not intended to be limited to only U.S. sales.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying the same principle to patent law, which historically has a close connection with copyright law, was "straightforward"&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bond between [copyright and patent law] leaves no room for a rift on the question of international exhaustion".&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial dissent===
Justice Ginsburg dissented from the Court's holding with respect to imported items. Adhering to substantially the same reasoning of her dissent in ''Kirtsaeng'', Justice Ginsburg argued that because patent law is territorial and the sale of an item abroad is "independent[] of the U.S. patent system, it makes little sense to say that such a sale exhausts an inventor's U.S. patent rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt; She would have upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Impression Prods.'', slip op. at 2-3 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
{{Update|section|date=May 2017|inaccurate=yes|reason=The content of this section pertains to the Federal Circuit decision, which was reversed by SCOTUS and therefore the reactions do not reflect the actual law after the SCOTUS decision was released.}}
===Gerstein===

Robert M. Gerstein concluded that further review in the Supreme Court was likely:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the Supreme Court’s interest in patent cases, a vigorous dissent in ''Lexmark'' that relies on a number of Supreme Court precedents, including ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', and the position of the Justice Department that ''Quanta'' overruled ''Mallinckrodt'', it would not be surprising to see the Supreme Court take up Lexmark in its next term.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Gerstein, [http://www.marshallip.com/publications/federal-circuit-sidesteps-supreme-court-twice-in-exhaustion-ruling/ ''Federal Circuit Sidesteps Supreme Court Twice in Exhaustion Ruling''] (Feb. 15, 2016).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dodd and Dowd===

Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd viewed the decision as an affirmation of strong patent rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' embraces a very strong view of patent rights and a narrow view of the scope of exhaustion. It affirms that patent holders have wide latitude to segment and control distribution in the market channels for products covered by patents. This latitude is particularly wide with respect to limiting the import into the United States of patented goods sold in authorized sales in foreign markets even where restrictions on resale were not proven to have been communicated to foreign buyers. Even so, the court left open the possibility that foreign sales, under the right circumstances, may incorporate an implied license to import and use the product within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd, [https://www.andrewskurth.com/insights-1307.html ''The En Banc Federal Circuit Holds That Patent Rights Are Not Exhausted by Prior Restricted Sales or by Foreign Sales''] (Feb. 19, 2016).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cukierski and Masia===

Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia see the decision as "pro-patent owner" but warn again premature celebration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But take caution—it is likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to hear the case. Given the tension between this case and the Supreme Court’s language in ''Quanta'' and ''Kirtsaeng'', along with the discord at the district court level and among commentators before the Federal Circuit’s decision, there’s a good chance the Supreme Court will do so. Until the Supreme Court has its say, you should take precautions in case the Supreme Court takes an expansive view of patent exhaustion and decides to remove these exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia, [http://www.ngelaw.com/Patent-Exhaustion/ ''Federal Circuit Affirms Pro-Patent Owner Limits on Patent Exhaustion''] (Feb. 16, 2015),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="Without Precedent"===

Another commentator (unsigned comment) indicated a skeptical view of the Federal Circuit's tendency to march to a different drummer. After quoting Judge Dyk's admonition, “We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court,” he (or she) observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For present purposes, it is simply worth noting that the Federal Circuit appears to be inching closer again to the concept that patent law is simply a unique beast, with unique rules and requirements. The Supreme Court has taken a skeptical view of that approach in the past. And may well again.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brannlaw.com/ip-wise/without-precedent/ ''Without Precedent''] (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jahn, Pichler, and Lo===

Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler and Lincoln Lo raise many questions (mostly about "clear communication") about what the ''Lexmark'' majority opinion left unresolved:

* Conflict or tension with Quanta: "''Quanta'' expressly distinguished implied licenses and exhaustion, holding that disclaimers of license rights are 'irrelevant' where 'the right to practice the patents is based not on implied license but on exhaustion.'&amp;#8239;" But "the Federal Circuit appears to treat exhaustion like an implied license—one that the patentee can disclaim by 'clearly communicate[d]' restrictions." ''Quanta'' appears to hold that the patentee's attempt to impose a post-sale restriction on a manufacturing licensee is ineffective if the license does not conform to the ''General Talking Pictures'' case.
* "[W]hat arrangement between a seller and buyer is sufficient to deny 'authority.'? It was undisputed in ''Lexmark'' that there was 'an express and enforceable contractual agreement' between Lexmark and each end-user, and that the no-resale and no-reuse restrictions were binding on end users.  Yet throughout the ''Lexmark'' opinion, the majority suggests that restrictions may be sufficient if 'clearly communicated'—even if well short of a contractual meeting of the minds."
* Another way to put this is what is a "clear communication"? In ''Jazz Photo'', the Federal Circuit noted that the “package instructions [were] not in the form of a contractual agreement by the purchaser to limit reuse of the cameras.”  Accordingly, “There was no showing of a ‘meeting of the minds’ whereby the purchaser, and those obtaining the purchaser's discarded camera, may be deemed to have breached a contract or violated a license limited to a single use of the camera.”&lt;ref&gt;''Jazz Photo'', 264 F.3d at 1108.&lt;/ref&gt; The writers conclude, therefore, "It is unclear if the Federal Circuit intended an expansion of the patentee-seller’s ability to avoid exhaustion."
* Also, how clear must a "clear communication" be? "The Federal Circuit appears to limit infringement claims against subsequent downstream buyers to those 'having knowledge of the restrictions.' The appellate court did not elaborate on what defenses a subsequent downstream purchaser ''without knowledge'' may have, assuming no exhaustion. The court only mentions in passing that 'we do not have before us the questions that would arise, whether under principles governing ''bona fide'' purchasers or otherwise, if a downstream re-purchaser acquired a patented article with less than actual knowledge of the restriction.'&amp;#8239;"
* Finally, does the court's focus on “clear communication” have a negative impact on post-sale restrictions that a limited licensee under ''General Talking Pictures'' is required to impose? "The Federal Circuit suggested repeatedly that buyers’ knowledge of the licensee's field of use limitation may be required for a licensee's sale to be non-exhaustive. While ''General Talking Pictures'' did not clearly resolve this question, many licensors have assumed that sales by a licensee outside of its licensed field are unauthorized altogether and are therefore non-exhaustive regardless of the purchaser's knowledge of the field of use limitation." Therefore, does the emphasis, here "on the buyer’s knowledge, even if ''dicta'', add to the uncertainty concerning this issue"?&lt;ref&gt;Paul Jahn, Rufus Pichler, and Lincoln Lo. [http://www.mofo.com/resources/publications/2016/02/160222restrictedsales ''Federal Circuit Holds that Restricted Sales and Foreign Sales Do Not Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castanias, Nix, and Kazhdan===

Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan also point to unresolved issues over which patent owners "must still be cautious":
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Lexmark'' explicitly left open several fact-specific questions, including (i) what happens if someone acquires a patented article with "less than actual knowledge" of the restrictions placed on the original sale by the patent owner and (ii) when would a foreign buyer have an "implied license" to sell in the United States, independent of patent exhaustion. These issues will surely be raised in future cases.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan, [http://www.jonesday.com/ien-banci-federal-circuit-reaffirms-that-foreign-sales-and-restricted-domestic-sales-dont-exhaust-patent-rights-02-17-2016/ '' En Banc Federal Circuit Reaffirms that Foreign Sales and Restricted Domestic Sales Don't Exhaust Patent Rights''] (Feb. 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crouch===

Dennis Crouch, in ''Patently-O'' commented on the issues and provided a summary of the merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;With personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind subsequent purchasers. Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the potential of gumming up the marketplace.  The Federal Circuit in this case went all the way to the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted.  I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market – and have also repaired them several times.  Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights.  Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods.  I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Crouch, [http://patentlyo.com/patent/2017/01/resale-prevent-arbitrage.html ''Can Your Patent Block Repair and Resale and Prevent Arbitrage?''], {{smallcaps|Patently-O}} (Jan. 31, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''International Association of Astronomical Artists''' (IAAA), is a non-profit organization whose members implement and participate in [[astronomical]] and [[space]] art projects, promote education about [[space art]] and foster [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] in artistic work inspired by the exploration of the [[Universe]].

The IAAA was founded in 1982 and was formally registered as an association of astronomical artists in 1986. Since its founding, the IAAA has grown to number over 120 members, representing twenty countries. The organization serves the community of artists creating works inspired by astronomy and outer space, serving as a networking resource on topics specific to the trade as well as issues common to professional artists. Although the early practitioners in the 1930s and 40s, such as Lucian Rudaux and Chesley Bonestell, (see [[Space Art]]) were realists, many IAAA artists produce work which is impressionistic, expressionistic, abstract or surreal; however, the majority (unlike science fiction and fantasy artists, who work almost purely from imagination) do have a background in astronomy, physics and mathematics which enables them to interpret accurately the data from observatories and space probes, and convert them into believable images.

They may also be called upon to depict those very probes and satellites (often working with NASA or JPL scientists) – for who is out there to photograph them? They paint in oils, acrylics, gouache and markers, use pens, pastels or coloured pencils, or the latest digital technology. But these artists have an advantage over mere technology, for they can travel where machines cannot; and this includes into the past, the future and faster than light.

A major activity of the IAAA is space art workshops, in most cases at remote locations with geology common to what has been discovered on other worlds. Iceland, Death Valley, Hawaii, The Colorado Plateau including Meteor Crater, and other locations with a sense of the unworldly about them have been visited in workshops. Painting and sketching such scenery outdoors helps in training the artist to know the landscape and the forces shaping it, as well as to reinforce the sensory impressions one is putting into their work of the effects of light and shade in the atmosphere.

'''Julia Emilie Neilson''' (12 June 1868 – 27 May 1957)&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; was an English actress best known for her numerous performances as Lady Blakeney in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', for her roles in many tragedies and historical romances, and for her portrayal of Rosalind in a long-running production of ''[[As You Like It]]''.

After establishing her reputation in a series of plays by [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1888, Neilson joined the company of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], where she remained for five years, meeting her future husband, [[Fred Terry]] (brother to actresses [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], [[Marion Terry|Marion]] and Florence Terry and great uncle of [[John Gielgud]]).  With Terry, she played in London and on tour for nearly three decades.  She was the mother of the actress [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry]] and actor [[Dennis Neilson-Terry]].

==Life and career==
Neilson was born in London, the only child of Alexander Ritchie Neilson, a jeweller, and his wife, Emilie Davis, a member of a family of five Jewish sisters, many of whose offspring became actresses.  Neilson's parents divorced shortly after her birth, and her father soon died, leaving her mother to struggle to support her child.  Her mother much later married a solicitor, William Morris, the widower of the actress Florence Terry, elder sister of the actor [[Fred Terry]], who had, by that time, married Neilson.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Roy, Donald. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35196 "Neilson, Julia Emilie (1868–1957)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Neilson was an indifferent student.  At the age of twelve, she was sent to a boarding school in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, where she learned to speak French and German and began to study music, discovering that she excelled at this.  She returned to England to enter the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1884, at the age of fifteen, to study piano.  She soon discovered that she had a talent as a singer, winning the Llewellyn Thomas Gold Medal (1885), the Westmoreland Scholarship (1886) and the Sainton Dolby Prize (1886).  While at the Academy, in 1887, she sang at the [[St James's Hall]] and also played roles in amateur theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Early stage career===
[[File:Miss Julia Neilson 1894.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''The Era Almanack'', 1894]]
Neilson met the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], who cast her in her first professional stage appearance in March 1888.  She played Cynisca in a charity matinée of his play, ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], and later that year, in the same play, she was the lead character, Galatea, in a similar matinée at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Gilbert suggested that the statuesque young woman concentrate her career on acting rather than singing, and he coached her on acting.  Her next role was Lady Hilda in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.  Gilbert wrote the lyrics to a short song for her to sing during Act I, and she proposed that a fellow student of hers at the Royal Academy, [[Edward German]], should set it to music.  She then played Selene in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]''.  In November 1888, she created the role of Ruth Redmayne in [[Rutland Barrington]]'s production of Gilbert's ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

These roles led to an invitation for Neilson to join [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company, in which she toured in ''Captain Swift'', ''The Red Lamp'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.  She remained with Tree's company for five years at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] as a tragedienne, beginning with the role of Julie de Noirville in ''A Man's Shadow'', which opened in September 1889.  In 1891, Neilson married another actor in the company, [[Fred Terry]], the brother of Gilbert's former protégée, [[Marion Terry]] (and the actresses [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]] and Florence Terry).  Neilson and her husband appeared together in [[Sydney Grundy]]'s translation of the French play ''A Village Priest'' and numerous other productions together with Tree's company, including ''Beau Austin'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''Peril'' and Gilbert's ''Comedy and Tragedy'' (1890).  She also played Drusilla Ives in ''The Dancing Girl'' (1891) by [[Henry Arthur Jones]], and Terry and Neilson's daughter [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry|Phyllis]] was born in 1892.  Neilson was soon back on stage as Lady Isobel in Jones's ''The Tempter'' (1893),&lt;ref&gt;Beerbohm Tree's New Play; ''The Tempter'', ''The New York Times'', 21 September 1893, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and created the role of Hester Worsley in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[A Woman of No Importance]]'' (1893).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; A review of Neilson's performance in the play ''Ballad Monger'' in 1890 declared: 
[[File:Julia Neilson w book.jpg|thumb|Postcard photo, 1890s]]
:Miss Neilson's really wonderful singing took the curtain up on the very keynote of the beautiful and pathetic play.  And to her singing no higher tribute can be paid.  One of these days, we do not doubt, it will be possible to write in the same strain about her acting.  In that there is splendid promise.  And the promise will come the more near to performance when she is a trifle less conscious of her remarkable physical beauty, and of the fact that she has been to some extent rushed into her present position.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Alec (pseudonym of Edward Aveling). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/eleanor-marx/1890/theatre.htm "Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling 1890"], www.marxists.org, Eleanor Marx Archive, accessed 7 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1894, Neilson and Terry appeared together in ''Shall We Forgive Her?'' by Frank Harvey at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], with Neilson as Grace.  The next year, she played Lady Chiltern in Wilde's comedy ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' at the Haymarket under the management of [[Lewis Waller]].  She gave birth to her second child, Dennis, in October 1895.  Two months later, the family travelled to America to perform with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]]'s company.  There they played together in New York in ''The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], with Neilson as Agnes.  In 1896, they returned to England where, at the [[St James's Theatre]], Neilson played Princess Flavia in ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' by [[Anthony Hope]], remaining at that theatre for two years.  There she played Rosalind in the extremely successful run of ''[[As You Like It]]'' (in which role she toured North America in 1895 and 1910).  She played the title role in Pinero's ''[[The Princess and the Butterfly]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Fyfe, Hamilton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GPMOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA247 ''Arthur Wing Pinero, Playwright: a Study''], 1902, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband appeared with her in ''The Tree of Knowledge'' and other plays from October 1897 until the summer of 1898; her roles included Beatrice in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. Next, they appeared in ''The Gipsy Earl''.  Again with Tree's company, now at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], Neilson was Constance in ''King John'' (1899) (and appeared in an early short silent movie recreating King John's death scene at the end of the play)&lt;ref&gt;"London Theatre Gossip", ''The New York Times'', 1 July 1899, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and Oberon in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1900).  They then toured in ''As You Like It''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:Neilson-Terry-Henry-of-Navarre-1909.jpg |thumb|upright|Neilson and [[Fred Terry]] in ''Henry of Navarre'', 1909]]

===Later years===
The couple entered into management together in 1900, producing and starring in ''[[Sweet Nell of Old Drury]]'' by [[Paul Kester]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Royal This Day&amp;nbsp;– Miss Julia Neilson and Mr. Fred Terry", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 28 November 1900, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They would continue to produce plays together for the next 30 years, most notably, ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1905 at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]]), which they also starred in and, with J. M. Barstow, adapted for the stage from [[Baroness Orczy]]'s manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Julia Neilson at the Theatre Royal Tonight", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 5 September 1905, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Despite scathing reviews from the critics, the play was a record-breaking hit and played for more than 2,000 performances, then enjoying numerous revivals.

[[File:Julia Neilson, circa 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Neilson, c. 1920, by [[Reginald Grenville Eves|R. G. Eves]]]]
Neilson's roles also included the title role in Kester's adaptation of ''[[Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall]]'' (1907). Neilson's and Terry's productions continued to favour historical romances or comedy melodramas, including ''Henry of Navarre'' by William Devereux (1909 at the New Theatre). ''Henry'' and ''Sweet Nell'' became their signature pieces during many tours of the British provinces and during their US tour in 1910. They also produced and starred with much success in ''For Sword or Song'' by Robert Legge and [[Louis Calvert]] (1903),&lt;ref&gt;"For Sword or Song", ''The New York Times'', 22 January 1903, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dorothy o' the Hall'' by Paul Kester and [[Charles Major (writer)|Charles Major]] (1906), ''The Popinjay'' by Boyle Lawrence and Frederick Mouillot (1911), ''Mistress Wilful'' by Ernest Hendrie (1915), ''The Borderer'' (1921), ''The Marlboroughs'' (1924),&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements and Exhibitions", ''Western Daily Press'', 21 November 1924, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Wooing of Katherine Parr'' by William Devereux (1926). They also starred in ''A Wreath of a Hundred Roses'' (1922), which was a [[masque]] by [[Louis N. Parker]] at the Duke's Hall to celebrate the Royal Academy's centenary.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1926, Neilson starred alongside [[Lawrence Grossmith]] in a revival of ''Henry of Navarre'', which toured the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements at the Theatre Royal", ''Nottingham Evening Post'', 13 September 1926, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; She later starred in ''This Thing Called Love'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements and Exhibitions", ''Western Daily Press'', 21 November 1929, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Her son Dennis died of pneumonia in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis Neilson-Terry Dead in South Africa", ''The New York Times'', 15 July 1932, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband, Fred Terry, died in 1933.  Neilson retired from the stage after a run as Josephine Popinot in the revival of the farce ''Vintage Wine'' by [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Ashley Dukes]] at [[Daly's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"By Cable and Courier", ''The New York Times'', 20 May 1934, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, she was given a testimonial luncheon to mark her fiftieth anniversary as a performer. Neilson made a brief return to the stage in 1944 to play Lady Rutven in ''The Widow of 40'' by [[Heron Carvic]]. She wrote a memoir entitled, ''This For Remembrance'', which gives an account of her life in the theatre business. Her children with Terry, [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry|Phyllis]] and [[Dennis Neilson-Terry|Dennis]], were both actors.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Neilson died in a hospital in Hampstead, London, after a fall at her home, in 1957 at the age of 88. She was cremated at [[Golders Green]], and she and her husband are both buried at [[Hampstead Cemetery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;"Julia Neilson-Terry, 88; Well-Known Actress on Stage in Britain, 1888–1944, Dies", ''The New York Times'', 28 May 1957, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things'''''|怪談|Kaidan|also ''Kwaidan'' (archaic)}}, often shortened to '''''Kwaidan''''' ("[[ghost story]]"), is a book by [[Lafcadio Hearn]] that features several [[kaidan|Japanese ghost stories]] and a brief non-fiction study on insects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Stableford]], "Kwaidan", in [[Frank N. Magill]], ed. ''Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature'', Vol 2. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Salem Press, Inc., 1983, {{ISBN|0-89356-450-8}} (pp. 859-860).&lt;/ref&gt; It was later used as the basis for a movie called ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' by [[Masaki Kobayashi]] in 1964.

==Stories==
Hearn declares in his introduction to the first edition of the book, which he wrote on January 20, 1904, shortly before his death, that most of these stories were translated from old Japanese texts. He also states that one of the stories – ''[[Yuki-onna]]'' – was told to him by a farmer in [[Musashi Province]], and his was apparently the first record of it, both by his own account and according to the research of modern folklorists. ''Riki-Baka'' is based on a personal experience of Hearn's. While he does not declare it in his introduction, ''Hi-Mawari'' – among the final narratives in the volume – seems to be a recollection of an experience in his childhood (it is, setting itself apart from almost all the others, written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]] and set in rural [[Wales]]).

In the last half of the book, Hearn listens collected Chinese/Japanese superstitions and his own personal thoughts on various members of the insect world.

The first 25 and the 39th Tom Swift Sr. books are in the [[public domain]] all around the world and are available as downloadable texts from [[Project Gutenberg]].  However, in Canada, due to its life plus 50 years policy, and because [[Howard R. Garis]] and Thomas Moyston Mitchell died in 1962, on January 1, 2013 volumes 1 to 35 (written by Garis) and 39-40 (written by Mitchell) entered into the Canadian Public Domain. (Canadian Copyright Act, Sections 6.1 and 6.2)  This applies to other countries as well that have a life plus 50 policy.  Volumes 36 to 38, which were written by [[Harriet Adams|Harriet Stratemeyer-Adams]], will enter the Canadian Public Domain on January 1, 2033.

A '''literary cycle''' is a group of stories focused on common figures, often (though not necessarily) based on mythical figures or loosely on historical ones. Cycles which deal with an entire country are sometimes referred to as '''matters'''. A fictional cycle is often referred to as a [[mythos]].

==Examples from folk and classical literature==
*The [[Anansi]] tales, which center on the Ashanti  of Ghana trickster spider-spirit Anansi, and its variations in the Americas as [[Ti Malice and Bouki]] in Haiti, [[Br'er Rabbit]] or John and Old Master in the Southern US.
*The tales of the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian nights]], brought together by the [[frame story]] of the tale of [[Scheherazade]] and [[Shahryār]].
*The four [[troubadour]]s [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Pere Salvatge]], [[Roger Bernard III of Foix]], and [[Peter III of Aragon]] composed a cycle of four ''[[sirventes]]'' in the summer of 1285 concerning the [[Aragonese Crusade]].
*The [[Matter of Britain]] (or the "Arthurian cycle"), which centers on [[King Arthur]] and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]
*The [[Matter of France]] (or the "Carolingian cycle"), which centers on [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Paladin|Twelve Peers]]
*The [[Henriad]], the four plays of Shakespeare centered on Henry V.
* Two examples of Japanese cycles are: the [[Matter of Japan]] (''[[Kojiki]]'', ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', etc.) and the Genji-Heike Cycle (''[[The Tale of the Heike]]'', ''[[Gikeiki]]'' about [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]], etc.). Also popular are the [[Soga Monogatari|Soga Brothers]] and [[Forty-seven rōnin|Forty-Seven Ronin]] cycles.
*The [[Matter of Rome]] (or the "cycle of Rome"), which centers on [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Alexander the Great]]
*The [[Mythological Cycle]], which centers on the [[Celtic pantheon]]
*The [[Fenian Cycle]], which centers on [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] and the [[Fianna]]
*The [[Cycle of the Kings]], which centers on the [[monarchy of Ireland]]
*The [[Reynard cycle]], which centers on the fabular fox [[Reynard]]
*[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]] (or the "Ring cycle"), which centers on the Ring and the [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse pantheon]]
*The voyages of [[Sinbad the sailor]], the hero of a cycle of tales of monsters, magical places, and supernatural phenomena met on his successive voyages.
*The [[epic cycle]] centering on the [[Trojan War]]
*The [[Ulster Cycle]], which centers on [[Cú Chulainn]] and the [[Ulster|Kingdom of Ulster]]

==Early life==
'''Mary Antoinette Anderson''' was the daughter of Charles Henry Anderson, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated New Yorker, and his wife, Antonia Leugers; the latter had been disowned by her [[Philadelphia]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] family after the couple had eloped to California.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Shortly after Mary was born, the couple moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where her father enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]] in the [[American Civil War]]. He was killed in action at [[Mobile, Alabama, in the Civil War|Mobile]] when she was three.

Mary was educated at the [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] convent and the all-girl [[Presentation Academy]] in Louisville. She was an unenthusiastic pupil except for an interest in reading and acting Shakespeare. Encouraged by her stepfather, Dr Hamilton Griffin, at 14 she was sent to New York for ten lessons with the actor [[George Vandenhoff]], her only professional training.

==Stage career==
In 1875, she made her first stage appearance at a benefit performance at [[Macauley's Theatre]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in the role of Shakespeare's Juliet. The manager, Barney Macauley, was sufficiently impressed to extend the booking to a week as Juliet and further roles including Julia in [[James Sheridan Knowles|Sheridan Knowles]]'s ''The Hunchback'', Bianca in [[Henry Hart Milman]]'s ''Fazio'', and R. L. Sheil's ''Evadne''.

Further engagements at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St Louis]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and [[John Edward McCullough|John McCullough]]'s theatre in [[San Francisco]] led to a contract with [[John T. Ford]]. Starting as Lady Macbeth in his Washington theatre in 1877, she began an extensive US tour, culminating with a six-week engagement in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer Lytton]]'s ''The Lady of Lyons'' at the [[5th Avenue Theatre]], New York. Critical review was mixed, but she was immediately popular with the public as "Our Mary"

From this point she enjoyed a twelve-year career of unbroken success, with regular New York performances and US tours. In 1879 she went on a voyage to Europe, meeting [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Adelaide Ristori]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 1883, after starring in an American production of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', she went on the London stage at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], remaining in England for six years to perform to much acclaim including at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in [[Stratford-on-Avon]]. Her first season there, she starred in Gilbert's ''Comedy and Tragedy''&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/com_trag/index.html ''Comedy and Tragedy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610172418/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/com_trag/index.html |date=2010-06-10 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 18 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Music and the Drama|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=27 March 1884|volume=1|issue=17|page=270|url=https://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n136/mode/1up|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 in London she appeared in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' in the double role of Perdita and Hermione (the first actress to include this innovation). This production ran to 160 performances, and was taken back to the United States. She invited writer [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]] to appear in the production, but, even in a non-speaking role, he froze up and interrupted the performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wemyss Reid]]. ''William Black, Novelist''. London and New York: Harper and Brothers, 1902, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, however, she collapsed on stage due to severe nervous exhaustion during a performance at [[Albaugh's Theatre]] in Washington. Disbanding her company, she announced her retirement at the age of 30. Some commentators, particularly in the British press, ascribed this turn of events to hostile press reviews on her return to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1911/10/07/archives/return-of-mary-anderson.html Return of Mary Anderson], ''New York Times'', October 7, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Willa Cather]] went further and blamed a specifically hurtful review from a close friend.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kingdom of Art:  Willa Cather's First Principles and Critical Statements'',  ed. Bernice Slote, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966.

==Later life==
Ordered to rest after her breakdown, Mary Anderson visited England. In 1890 she married Antonio Fernando de Navarro (1860–1932),&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Anderson, Mary" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; an American sportsman and barrister of Basque extraction, who was a [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Papal Privy Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape]]. She became known as '''Mary Anderson de Navarro'''. They settled at Court Farm&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.free-at-last.co.uk/2014/06/18/amazing-secret-gardens-of-broadway/|title=Amazing Secret Gardens of Broadway {{!}} Free at Last|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Cotswolds]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire]], where she cultivated an interest in music and became a noted hostess with a distinguished circle of musical, literary and ecclesiastical guests. She also gave birth to three children, one son who died at birth, another son, Alma Jose "Toty" Maria de Navarro (1896–1979) and a daughter, Mary Elena de Navarro, in her happy marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1911/10/25/archives/mary-anderson-has-another-play-idea-former-actress-and-robert.html New York Times] MARY ANDERSON HAS ANOTHER PLAY IDEA; Former Actress... dated Wednesday October 25, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1905/10/08/archives/mary-anderson-to-modjeska-sends-her-good-wishes-for-polish-actresss.html New York Times Sunday October 8 1905] MARY ANDERSON TO MODJESKA: Sends Her Good Wishes for Polish Actress's Farewell Tour&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewterbank.com/Antonio_de_Navarro_EOF.pdf|title=Antonio Fernando de Navarro|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.pewterbank.com/Antonio_de_Navarro_EOF.pdf|publisher=|access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A devout Roman Catholic,  she had a chapel built in her attic, with stained-glass windows designed by [[Paul Woodroffe]]. She has been cited as a model for characters in the [[Mapp and Lucia|Lucia]] novels of [[Edward Frederic Benson|E F Benson]], either the operatic soprano Olga Bracely &lt;ref&gt;''Mr Benson remembered in Rye, and the world of Tilling'', Cynthia &amp; Tony Reavell, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America'', Contributor Adolf Carl von Noé, v.47 1953, University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; or Lucia herself,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Anderson, Mary", ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2007.

She resisted encouragements to return to the theatre, but did a number of  fund-raising performances during [[World War I]] in Worcester, Stratford and London. The latter included roles as [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], Juliet and Clarice in [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s play ''Comedy and Tragedy''.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Mme. de Navarro, ''The Times'', May 30, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; She published two books of her memories, the 1896 ''A Few Memories'' and the 1936 ''A Few More Memories'', and collaborated with [[Robert Smythe Hichens]] on a 1911 New York stage adaptation of his novel, ''[[The Garden of Allah (novel)|The Garden of Allah]]''.

==Death==
She died at her home in [[Broadway, Worcestershire]], in 1940, aged 80. She was survived by her son and daughter.

==Legacy==
Land donated by Anderson in [[Mount St. Francis, Indiana]] to the Conventual [[Franciscan]] Friars is now the [http://mountsaintfrancis.org/ Mount Saint Francis Center for Spirituality]. The center serves as the headquarters for the Province of Our Lady of Consolation and home to the [http://www.maryandersoncenter.com/ Mary Anderson Center], an artist colony.  In 1989, the portion of [[U.S. Route 150|US Route 150]] that adjoins the donated property was named The Mary Anderson Memorial Highway.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Menin Gate at Midnight''''' (also known as '''''Ghosts of Menin Gate''''') is a [[1927 in art|1927]] painting by Australian artist [[Will Longstaff]]. The painting depicts a host of ghostly soldiers marching across a field in front of the [[Menin Gate]] war memorial.&lt;ref name="AWMEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grey|first=Anne|title=Menin Gate at Midnigh|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/menin|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is part of the collection of the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name="AWM Collection"&gt;{{cite web|title=ART09807 - Menin Gate at midnight|url=http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART09807|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=21 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630152957/http://cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART09807|archivedate=30 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longstaff painted the work after attending the unveiling of the Menin Gate memorial, at [[Ypres]] in Belgium, on 24 July 1927. The memorial commemorated those men of the [[British Empire]], including Australia, who died in the battles of the [[First World War]] around the town.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; Walking around the streets of Ypres after the ceremony, Longstaff was said to have seen a "vision of steel-helmeted spirits rising from the moonlit cornfields around him".&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; Returning to London, Longstaff was reported to have painted the work in a single session, while "still under psychic influence".&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;

The painting was immediately popular. It was purchased by [[Lord Woolavington]] for 2,000 [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]]s and presented to the Australian government.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt; After a royal command viewing for [[George V]] and the Royal family at Buckingham Palace, the painting was displayed in Manchester and Glasgow. It was then taken around Australia, where record crowds paid to view the work. Longstaff oversaw the making of 2,000 prints and 400 of these were given to the nascent [[Australian War Memorial]] to sell to raise funds.&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;

The success of this work lead Longstaff to paint three later companion pieces with a similar ghostly, spiritualist theme:&lt;ref name=AWMEncyclopedia /&gt;
*''Immortal Shrine (Eternal Silence)'' &amp;ndash; showing ghostly soldiers marching past the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph]] in London on [[Remembrance Day]]
*''Ghosts of Vimy Ridge'' (1931) &amp;ndash; depicting men of the [[Canadian Corps]] at [[Vimy Ridge]].
*''Carillon'' (1932) &amp;ndash; with New Zealand soldiers in Belgium hearing the bells in their native country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13966">'''Mitchell Fields''' (1901 &amp;ndash; 1966) was a Romanian-born American sculptor, known for his life-size sculptures, as well as for his portraits. Fields's works belong to the schools of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Social Realism]].
[[Image:Work of Mitchell Fields 025.jpg|thumb|Mitchell Fields]]

== Early life ==
Mitchell Fields (né Mendel Feldman) was born on September 28, 1901 in a small village near [[Iaşi]], [[Romania]]; he was the third of five sons of Marku Feldman and Tova Felderman.  In 1907 the family immigrated to the United States and made its home in East [[Harlem]] (Manhattan), then an immigrant neighborhood. The parents supported the family by selling vegetables in markets in Manhattan and the Bronx.

== Education as an artist ==
Fields graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]], then as now a school whose pupils specialized in the sciences and engineering; early on he showed an interest in drawing and [[sculpture]] which was encouraged by his teachers. After a year at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in Hoboken NJ he decided to pursue a career as a sculptor and enrolled at the [[National Academy of Design]] School of Fine Arts in New York and the [[Beaux-Arts Institute of Design]] in New York. The Beaux-Arts Institute aimed to train architects, sculptors and mural painters in accordance with the agenda of the French [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Its student body consisted mainly of immigrants or first-generation Americans, many of whom came from a working-class background. Fields studied at Beaux-Arts from 1917 until 1927.

== Career ==
[[Image:From Sheba Nursing School.jpg|thumb|''Young Woman Holding Wounded Bird'', Sheba Medical Center School of Nursing, Ramat Gan, Israel]]
On completing his studies Fields began to work as a sculptor; he created in clay and plaster, in marble, and when commissioned to do so, cast his works in bronze. Fields continued living in New York, where he belonged to an informal circle of predominantly Jewish artists whose work was for the most part representational:  Moses Soyer, [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[De Hirsh Margules]], James Lechay, Myron Lechay, Joseph Kantor, Saul Berman, Tully Filmus, were among the painters; while after World War II the informal "circle" of which he was part included the sculptors Clara Bratt, [[Chaim Gross]], [[Alexander Archipenko]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]].

During the early 1930s Fields was active in the [[John Reed Club]], whose aim was to support leftist and Marxist artists and writers. On occasion Fields produced works with a political message: in 1935 he sculpted a monument to the civilians killed in the February 1934 Vienna Uprising, also known as the [[Austrian Civil War]]. The location of this statue is not known. There were, in any case, not many commissions to be had during the [[Great Depression]]. As did many artists at the time, Fields worked for the Federal Arts Project of the [[Work Projects Administration]].

During the mid-1930s Fields divided his time between New York and Europe. The [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] awarded him a fellowship in 1932 which enabled him to live and work in Paris for two years; subsequently, in 1935 a second Guggenheim Fellowship enabled him to reside and work in Moscow. Statues of his were placed in the Gorky Park of Culture and Leisure in Moscow, in the Museum of Modern Western Art in Moscow and in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, now the [[Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts]]. "Mother and Child with Oar", a life-size marble statue of a woman holding a baby in one arm and an oar with the other arm, was commissioned for Gorky Park; versions of the same theme by other sculptors were also placed in [[Gorky Park (Moscow)]]. Attempts at locating this statue have not been successful; it was probably destroyed by German shelling during World War II. A plaster cast of the baby is still extant.

In 1938 Fields, his wife Beatrice (née Meyers) and their infant son Michael David returned to New York City. Fields continued creating sculpture until the entrance of the United States into World War II. Too old to be drafted into the army, he decided to "do his bit" for the war effort by working in a factory which engaged in war production; he operated a lathe on the production line until after the final Allied victory.

In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s Fields lived in New York and maintained a studio at 3 Gt. Jones St., New York. He was represented by the  statue ''Bather'' in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]'s [[3rd Sculpture International]] exhibit in 1949. He created a larger-than-life-size portrait bust of the late [[Albert Einstein]] which was placed in the Museum of Immigration on [[Ellis Island]].

From time to time Fields taught courses in sculpture at the [[Art Students League of New York]] schools in Manhattan and Woodstock, New York, at the [[National Academy of Design]] School of Fine Arts in New York, as well as at the [[University of Iowa]] (Iowa City).

== Career in Israel ==
From the late 1950s until his death in 1966 Fields spent long periods of time in Israel, where he had a studio at 16 Da Modena St., Tel Aviv. During his stays in Israel he created portraits of personages for public spaces. These personages included [[Yehiel De-Nur]] (Ka-tzetnik), author; [[Yosef Sprinzak]], first Speaker of the Knesset; Prof. [[Chaim Sheba]], head of the Medical Corps of the Israel Defense Forces and later director of the Tel Hashomer Hospital and Medical Center, which now bears his name; Member of Knesset Avraham Hertzfeld, as well as works now in private collections.

During this period he created a portrait bust of the great Yiddish author [[Sholem Aleichem]]. This portrait is on exhibit in the [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] Regional Council Library. Fields also attempted a portrait bust of [[Anne Frank]] as she might have looked during the last months of her life in hiding with her family in [[Amsterdam]], based upon available photographs from when she was younger. Fields sent photographs of the bust to Frank's father, Otto, who felt that the portrait did not represent his daughter as he remembered her during their last months together. His statue "Young Woman Holding Wounded Bird" is in the School of Nursing of the [[Sheba Medical Center]] at Tel Hashomer.

Fields was assisted by Robert Bannet, City Architect of [[Tel Aviv]] and head of the team of architects which planned [[Ramat Aviv]]. He had many friends among Israeli painters and sculptors; Agnes Adler and David Adler, sculptors who immigrated from Israel to the United States in 1961, are numbered among the latter. Fields made the acquaintance of Batya Lishanski, who was awarded the [[Dizengoff Prize]] for her sculpture, and of [[Marcel Janco]], one of the founders of the [[Dada]] school of art. His friendships with Israeli painters and sculptors, as well as his observations of the vibrant artistic scene in late 1950s' Israel are described in the chapter which he composed for ''Assignment in Israel'' (1960).

Fields's work was to influence that of his eldest grandson, Reuven Fields Sadeh, a sculptor who works mainly in metal. Although he was only five years old when his grandfather died, Sadeh, who lives and works in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, grew up surrounded by Fields's sculpture. His own creations reflect the statuesque, essentially realistic character of his grandfather's work, as well as the latter's uncompromising excellence of craftsmanship.

Mitchell Fields died after a short illness on October 6, 1966. He is buried in [[Kibbutz]] Hazorea, Israel; his statue Naomi, which twice enabled him to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship, is exhibited at the entrance to the kibbutz's [[Wilfrid Israel]] Museum.

== Themes and style ==
[[Image:Naomi statue.jpg|thumb|''Naomi'', Wilfrid Israel Museum, Hazorea, Israel]]
Fields's sculptural language was representational. Having been educated in the tradition of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], which subscribed to an ideology of objective reality and rejected what its practitioners saw as the exaggerated emotionalism of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]], he created life-size (and on occasion over-life-size) statues of the human body, both female and male. Fields depicted women as strong, capable figures, who were simultaneously feminine in a traditional sense. His [[portrait]] busts and bas [[relief]]s were articulated in a non-abstract idiom.

As was the case with many American artists from immigrant families who came of age during the Great Depression, some of his works may be seen as part of the [[Social Realist]] movement, one of whose aims was to depict the working class as heroic. Yet he did not accept the tenets of [[Socialist Realism]] (for whose practitioners the purpose of art was to forward the international agenda of [[socialism]] or [[communism]]). Indeed, despite his [[left-wing]] political views, the large majority of his works do not bear a political message.

Even after World War II, when many American artists moved in the direction of [[Abstract Expressionism]], Fields continued to create within the realist [[aesthetic canon|canon]]. During the early 1950s he began to work in ceramics, producing small tables and household items such as cups and vases. A short-lived attempt to sell the latter via a small business (Sculpture Products) did not succeed commercially. His [[ceramic art]] work, with its richly toned glazes and whimsical shapes, was his only attempt at adopting a semi-abstract idiom.

[[File:Correggio-(antonio-allegri)-madonna-del-latte-36018-p.jpg|thumb|300px|''Nursing Madonna with an Angel'']]
'''''Nursing Madonna with an Angel''''' is an oil on panel painting by [[Correggio]], painted around 1524 and now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 68.5 by 87 cm and belongs to the [[Nursing Madonna]] or 'Madonna Lactans' genre.

==History==
The painting's style places it around the same time as the commission of paintings for the Del Bono Chapel in [[San Giovanni Evangelista (Parma)|San Giovanni Evangelista]] abbey church, that is at the start of the 1530s. Nothing more is known about who commissioned it or when and the first documentary evidence for it is a 1603 inventory of the [[Aldobrandini]] collection in Rome, where it was probably admired by [[Federico Barocci]] and later by the young [[Antony van Dyck]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]]. It was praised by father Ottonelli in his ''Trattato della Pittura e della Scultura, uso et abuso loro'' as a model to explain how a religious subject could succeed unlike a secular one. According to Ottonelli, the main Roman cardinals of the 17th century competed to possess the ''Nursing Madonna''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">A national epic is an epic poem or a literary work of epic scope which seeks or is believed to capture and express the essence or spirit of a particular nation; not necessarily a nation state, but at least an ethnic or linguistic group with aspirations to independence or autonomy. National epics frequently recount the origin of a nation, a part of its history, or a crucial event in the development of national identity such as other national symbols.

==Supranational Epics==
*[[The Americas]] - ''[[The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' by [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]
*[[Indic Civilization]] – the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''
*[[Mesoamerican Civilization]] – the ''[[Popol Vuh]]''
*[[Sinic world]] – the [[Four Great Classical Novels]]: ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]],'' ''[[Water Margin]],'' ''[[Journey to the West]],'' and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]
*[[Western Civilization]] – the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' of Homer and the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of Vergil

==Language Epics==
{{see|National epic}}
For languages spread across various nations, earlier [[national epic]]s of the older nation work as language epics. For example, national epics of England, such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]],'' or the works of ''[[Shakespeare]]'' are used as language epics across the English-speaking world, and the ''[[Shahnameh]],'' the national epic of Iran (Persia) is used as a language epic by other [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking communities, in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. See [[national epic]]s for more examples.

Religious texts such as ''[[The King James Bible]]'' (English), ''[[Luther Bible]]'' (German), ''[[Quran]]'' (Arabic), and ''[[Tanakh]]'' (Hebrew) have similar impact within a specific language, while the Bible itself (in all translations) is instead a supranational epic of Western civilization.

'''Punishment of Luxury''', also known as '''Punilux''', are a four-man [[post-punk]] band from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], England, who still write songs and play gigs but were particularly active in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundaysun.co.uk/lifestyle-news/video-of-the-week/2009/01/18/ettrick-s-music-video-punishment-of-luxury-79310-22701465/ |title=Ettrick's music video - Punishment of Luxury - Sunday Sun |publisher=www.sundaysun.co.uk |accessdate=2010-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They released an album ''[[Laughing Academy]]'' on United Artists, and another on Red Rhino Records. They reformed in the late 1980s for a while and finally in 2007.

==History==
From a background working in left-wing English fringe theatre groups, Punishment Of Luxury were a four-man post-punk band formed in December 1976 in Newcastle.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; Taking their name from an 1891 painting by [[Giovanni Segantini]] in the [[Walker Art Gallery]], Liverpool, the band consisted initially of Brian Bond (born Brian Rapkin - vocals), Neville Luxury (born Neville Atkinson - guitar, vocals), Red Helmet (guitar, vocals), Jimi Giro (bass guitar, vocals), and "Liquid" Les Denham (drums).&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 122-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazell" /&gt; They released a single, "Puppet Life" on the [[Small Wonder Records|Small Wonder]] label in July 1978.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; In 1979 they signed to [[United Artists]] and released the singles "Engine Of Excess" with Mick Avery on drums, then with new drummer Steve Sekrit (born Steven Robson), made "Secrets", and the album ''[[Laughing Academy]]''.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; In the Summer of 1979 they played at the [[Reading Festival|Reading Rock Festival]] after Bostik Swastika and [[The Cure]] and before [[The Tourists]] and [[Motörhead]]. 1980 saw the release of the single "Laughing Academy". An extensive European tour followed and United Artists sent the band into the studio to record another album, a concept album to be called ''Gigantic Days''. However while the recording was still going on, United Artists were taken over by [[EMI]], who dropped the band. A final European tour was followed by Bond's departure.

Neville, Sekrit and Giro recruited guitarist Tim Magenta to a new lineup, now going by the name Punilux.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; They released a further album on the [[Red Rhino Records|Red Rhino]] label, ''7'' in 1983, with Magenta replaced by Rab Aitch, before Neville Luxury went solo, releasing the [[mini-album]] ''Feels Like Dancing Wartime'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; The album ''Gigantic Days'' was finally released, on CD, in 1998 by Overground Records.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;

==Recent==
In 2007 they reunited and played a few songs for the bassist Jimi Giro's 50th birthday party. A little more than a year later they landed a gig at a small pub in Gateshead, in the north-east of England called The Three Tuns. The gig was considered a success and was written about in ''The Guardian'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/17/popandrock.davesimpson |title=Glutton for punishment |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-01-09 | location=London | first=Dave | last=Simpson | date=2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band are planning on more gigs in the future and introducing more new material, of which a taster was given in the form of one song called ''Fracture'' at the Three Tuns.  On 12 June 2009 they played at the Luminaire in Kilburn, North London.

The band released a CD, '5', of new material in March/April 2012.

'''''Radetzky March''''' ({{lang-de|Radetzkymarsch}}) is a 1932 novel by [[Joseph Roth]] chronicling the decline and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire via the story of the Trotta family. ''Radetzkymarsch'' is an early example of a story that features the recurring participation of a historical figure, in this case the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] (1830–1916). Roth continues his account of the Trotta family to the time of the [[Anschluss]] in his ''[[The Emperor's Tomb]]'' (''Kapuzinergruft'', 1938). The novel was published in English translation in 1933, and in a new, more literal, translation in 1995.

==Plot==
''Radetzky March'' relates the stories of three [[generation]]s of the Trotta family, professional [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] soldiers and career bureaucrats of [[Slovenia]]n origin — from their zenith during the [[imperialism|empire]] to the nadir and breakup of that world during and after the [[World War I|First World War]]. In 1859, the [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–67) was fighting the [[Second War of Italian Independence]] (29 April – 11 July 1859), against French and Italian belligerents: [[Napoleon III of France]], the Emperor of the French, and the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_BD-rogiJkC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Friederike%20(Friedl)%20Reichler&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''A History of Austrian Literature 1918-2000''], edited by Katrin Kohl and Ritchie Robertson. Rochester, N.Y.: Camden House, 2006, p. 67. {{ISBN|1571132767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franz joseph1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''The Emperor:''' Franz Joseph in Austrian Field Marshal uniform.]]

In northern Italy, during the [[Battle of Solferino]] (24 June 1859), the well-intentioned, but blundering, Emperor Franz Joseph I, is almost killed. To thwart snipers, [[Infantry]] Lieutenant Trotta topples the [[Empire|Emperor]] from his horse. The Emperor awards Lt. Trotta the [[Order of Maria Theresa]] and ennobles him. Elevation to the [[nobility]] ultimately leads to the Trotta family’s ruination, paralleling the imperial collapse of Austria-Hungary (1867–1918).

Following his social elevation Lt. Trotta, now [[Baron]] Trotta, is regarded by his family — including his father — as a man of superior quality. Although he does not assume the airs of a social superior, everyone from the new baron’s old life perceives him as a changed person, as a [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The perceptions and expectations of society eventually compel his reluctant integration into the [[aristocracy]], a class amongst whom he feels temperamentally uncomfortable.

As a father, the first Baron Trotta is disgusted by the [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] that the national school system is teaching his son's generation. The school history textbook presents as fact a legend about his battlefield rescue of the Emperor. He finds especially galling the misrepresentation that [[infantry]] [[lieutenant]] Trotta was a [[cavalry]] officer.

The Baron appeals to the Emperor to have the school book corrected. The Emperor considers however that such a truth would yield an uninspiring, pedestrian history, useless to Austro-Hungarian [[patriotism]]. Therefore, whether or not history textbooks report Infantry Lt. Trotta’s battlefield heroism as [[legend]] or as fact, he orders the story deleted from the official history of Austria-Hungary. The subsequent Trotta family generations misunderstand the elder generation’s reverence for the [[legend]] of Lt. Trotta’s saving the life of the Emperor and consider themselves to be rightful aristocrats.

The disillusioned Baron Trotta opposes his son’s aspirations to a military career, insisting he prepare to become a government official, the second most respected career in the Austrian Empire; by [[Norm (sociology)|custom]], the German son was expected to obey. The son eventually becomes a district administrator in a Moravian town. As a father, the second Baron Trotta (still ignorant of why his war-hero father thwarted his military ambitions) sends his own son to become a [[cavalry]] officer; grandfather’s legend determines grandson’s life. The cavalry officer’s career of the third Baron Trotta comprises postings throughout the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and a dissipated life of wine, women, song, gambling, and [[duel]]ing, off-duty pursuits characteristic of the [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] class in peace-time. Following a fatal duel the young Trotta transfers from the socially elite [[Uhlan]]s to a less prestigious [[jager]] regiment. Baron Trotta’s infantry unit then suppresses an industrial strike in a garrison town. [[Existentialism|awareness]] of the aftermath of his professional brutality begins Lieutenant Trotta's disillusionment with [[imperialism|empire]]. He is killed, bravely but pointlessly, in a minor skirmish with Russian troops during the opening days of World War I. His lonely and grieving father, the District Commissioner, dies almost immediately after Franz Joseph two years later. Two mourners at the funeral conclude that the second von Trotta could not have survived the old Emperor, and that neither could have survived the dying Empire.

[[File:Radetzky-von-radetz.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The novel's namesake, Josef Graf Radetzky von Radetz.]]

''Radetzky March'' is [[Joseph Roth]]'s best-known work. It was critically acclaimed after being first published in German in 1932 and then translated to English in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Jonh Chamberlain. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/31/specials/roth-march.html Books of The Times: Radetzky March], ''The New York Times'', October 17, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the German literary critic [[Marcel Reich-Ranicki]] included it in ''[[Der Kanon]]'' ("The Canon") of the most important German-language literary novels. It is a novel of the ironies and humour inherent in the well-intentioned actions that led to the decline and fall of a family and an empire; the [[Emperor Franz Josef I]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] remains ignorant of the unintended, negative consequences of so rewarding his subjects, and he continues conferring great favors, as with Lt. Trotta, after the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859.

The novel's title derives from the ''[[Radetzky March]]'', Op. 228 (1848), by [[Johann Strauss Sr.]] (1804–49), which honors the Austrian [[Field Marshal]] [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] (1766–1858). It is a [[symbol]]ic [[musical composition]] heard at critical narrative junctures of the Trotta family history.

During an interview on the United States TV show ''Charlie Rose'', Peruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] ranked ''The Radetzky March'' as the best [[political fiction|political novel]] ever written.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/2802 Mario Vargas Llosa interview by Charlie Rose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121080559/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/2802 |date=2012-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When time passed, the multi-generation family saga ''Radetzky March'' brought its author an acclaim and recognition as "one of the greatest German-language writers of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Larry Rohter.

==Publication history==
The first German edition of the novel, ''Radetzkymarsch'', was published in 1932 by ''Verlag Kiepenheuer'' in Berlin. In 2010, it was re-issued with epilogue and commentary by Werner Bellmann, Stuttgart: Reclam, 2010 (540 pages). 

''Radetzky March'' has been translated into various languages. Geoffrey Dunlop translated it to English in 1933. Soffy Topsøe translated it into Danish in that same year, and Hugo Hultenberg into Swedish. The 1934 French edition was translated by Blanche Gidon. A Russian translation was published in 1939, a Spanish edition in 1950, Czech in 1961, Romanian in 1966, Polish in 1977, Portuguese in 1984, Croatian in 1991. A notable English translation was done by the poet [[Michael Hofmann]], who has translated a number of other works by Joseph Roth. 

The first Persian translation by Mohammad Hemmati was published in 2016.

==Response==
''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' described the format of ''Rendered'' in an article about Portland podcasts: "Destination DIY goes beyond the crafts 'n' home repair often associated with the term 'DIY' to encompass anything people can do themselves—from home funerals and taxidermy to representing yourself in court. Moreover, the show maintains an artful balance of general interest content and local events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/pump-up-the-volume/Content?oid=6511757|title=Pump Up the Volume|work=Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' named Sabatier "Portland's DIY Queen" and wrote that the show "taps into the zeitgeist that is red hot in the West."&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"/&gt; [[Radio Survivor]] reported on Destination DIY's crowd-funding strategy in 2013 and described the show as a "polished production on par with a national public radio program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2013/11/20/podcast-survivor-crowdfunding-destination-diy/|title=Podcast Survivor: Crowdfunding Destination DIY|work=Radio Survivor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland television station [[KGW]] has reported on two ''Rendered'' "Makin' It" parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kgw.com/thesquare/PDX-Tonight-Makin-It-with-Destination-DIY-148988305.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sustainable Business Oregon'' also reported on the "Makin' It" parties and featured an interview with Sabatier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2013/09/scrap-py-and-sustainable-makin-it.html?page=all|title=Behind the scenes at Destination DIY's Makin' It event - Portland Business Journal|date=24 September 2013|work=Portland Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
''Rendered'' is primarily listener-funded. In 2011, the show funded a year-long season with a [[Kickstarter]] campaign that raised $9,750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/destinationdiy/a-new-season-of-destination-diy?ref=live|title=A New Season of Destination DIY|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the show relaunched as a monthly podcast after raising $14,801 in an [[IndieGoGo]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/destination-diy-monthly/x/4899388|title=Destination DIY - Monthly!|work=Indiegogo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also lists several business and non-profit sponsors and received [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]] grants in 2011 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.racc.org/about/racc-awards-661543-nonprofit-organizations-schools-and-individual-artists-arts-related-project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://destinationdiy.org/supporters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racc.org/grants/2011-12-racc-professional-development-grants-cycle-1|title=2011-12 RACC Professional Development Grants (Cycle 1)|work=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222010409/http://www.racc.org/grants/2011-12-racc-professional-development-grants-cycle-1|archivedate=2014-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SAMUS: South African Music Studies''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] and the official journal of the [[South African Society for Research in Music]] (SASRIM). Contents and abstracts are listed in [[RILM]] Abstracts, The Music Index, Sabinet Online, and [[African Journals OnLine]].

'''''SAMUS''''' succeeds the now defunct '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' which was published by the former [[Musicological Society of Southern Africa]]. SASRIM is a post-apartheid amalgamation of the Musicological Society of Southern Africa and the Ethnomusicology Symposium. Consequently '''''SAMUS''''' is an interdisciplinary journal, which publishes an eclectic range of research in the disciplines of musicology, ethnomusicology, music theory and analysis, popular music, composition, performance, music therapy, and music education. The journal is published once a year.

Notable music researchers who have published in both the '''''South African Journal of Musicology''''' and '''''SAMUS''''' include Christopher Ballantine, [[John Blacking]], [[Michael Blake (composer)|Michael Blake]], Sylvia Bruinders, [[Nicholas Cook]], David Coplan, Lindelwa Dalamba, Chatradari Devroop, Michael Drewett, Veit Erlmann, [[Robert Fokkens]], Klaus Heimes, Marie Jorritsma, [[Clare Loveday]], Christine Lucia, Winfried Lüdemann, J.P Malan, James May, Stephanus Muller, Grant Olwage, Beverly Parker, [[Roger Parker]], Mary Rörich, Martin Scherzinger, Ruth A. Solie, Bertha Spies, Mareli Stolp, Barbara Titus, Heinrich van der Mescht and Martina Viljoen.

== History ==
Simple Grapher was released in 2013, it was very simple (that is why named Simple Grapher) and had very simple features (plotting functions and simple inequalities), it also had a very bad GUI. But in few next versions it grow very fast and the program could support lot of features, and in November 2015 the program changed its name to [[Simple Grapher Plus]], because it became very developed program and had a completely new interface.

In November 2015 the program was renamed Simple Grapher Plus, with changes to functionality and interface.

'''''Stretch Screamers''''' was a series of electronic toys by [[Manley Toys Limited]] of [[Hong Kong]].

==Design==
"Stretch Screamers" could be stretched, causing them to scream. They also were able to be squeezed and balls of colored liquid would pop out. Some models had gel inside the rubber, and others had liquid and floating objects.

At one point in the early 2000s, the toys were quite popular, so much so that they had their own [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]] toy line in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/mcstretch.php&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have since fallen into obscurity and have been discontinued and have been known to fetch high prices online.&lt;ref&gt;http://coolandcollected.com/yard-sale-finds-stretch-wolfman-dungeon-dice-and-pogs/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Supper''''' (1480) is a [[fresco]] depicting the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]]; it is located in the refectory of the Convent of the [[Ognissanti, Florence|Ognissanti]] on Borgo Ognissanti #42 in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It is one of three Last Supper frescoes painted by Ghirlandaio in Florence, the others being for the [[Badia di Passignano]] (1476) and for the ''Cenacolo di [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]]'' (1486).

==History==
The layout of the scene resembles that seen in the [[Last Supper (del Castagno)|Andrea del Castagno's ''Last Supper'']] frescoed some 3 to 4 decades earlier for the refectory of Sant'Apollonia in Florence, wherein the apostles sit in a shallow U-shaped setting, with only the two flanking apostles sitting at a 90 degree angle with the others. John the Apostle at Christ's left has fallen to sleep. Judas sits apart on the near side of the table, as is common in early depictions of the [[Last Supper in Christian art]].  However, in this depiction, the upper register is not interior, but opens up into the tree-line orchard with birds. The halos of the apostles have narrowed into thin circles; and the apostles cast shadows. St Peter and another apostle appear to challenge Judas.

[[File:Domenico ghirlandaio, cenacolo di ognissanti 04.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail of the fresco]]
Ghirlandaio was well known when he received the commission for this fresco, and soon after its completion, he was called to Rome to help decorate the walls Sistine Chapel. It is likely that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was familiar with this treatment of the subject, as well as that of [[Andrea del Castagno|Castagno]], and painted his own Last Supper in a more dramatic form to contrast with the stillness of these works, so that more emotion would be displayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a cosmic drama and an act of redemption'' by Michael Ladwein 2006 page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

During the restoration of this fresco later, a preliminary sketch of it was discovered on the left wall of the refectory in Cenacolo di Ognissanti.

'''''The Love Letter''''' ({{lang-nl|De liefdesbrief}}) is a 17th-century [[genre painting]] by [[Jan Vermeer]].  The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a [[cittern]].  The painting is in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

==Description==
The tied-up [[curtain]] in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene.  There is also an element of [[trompe l'oeil]] as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period.  The [[diagonal]]s on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensionality]]. The fact that it is a [[love letter]] that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a [[cittern]], a member of the lute/guitar family).  The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; ''luit'' was also a slang term for [[vagina]].  This idea is further reinforced by the [[slipper]]s at the very bottom of the picture.  The removed slipper was another symbol of sex.  The [[brush|floor brush]] would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.

The colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting - the gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace.

The two [[painting]]s on the wall are also significant.  The lower painting is of a stormy [[sea]], a clear metaphor for tempestuous love.  Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road.  This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick de Rynck, How to Read a Painting: Lessons from the Old Masters (Abrams: New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
In the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s monarch [[John III Sobieski]].&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt; The 1696 inventory of the [[Wilanów Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] lists among Dutch paintings "a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, grającej na lutni w złotej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)".&lt;ref name=Drecka/&gt;

==Theft==
On September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]], where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet till the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the strip in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase.

Roymans is thought to have been motivated by news of the bloodshed, rape, and murder in the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. On October 3, 1971, using the name "Tijl van Limburg" (a character similar to [[Robin Hood]]), Roymans contacted the Brussels newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' and asked for a reporter to meet him in a forest with a camera. He drove the reporter, blindfolded, to a church and unveiled the painting from a white cloth cover. After letting the reporter take photos of the canvas in the car's headlights, he drove him back. He told the reporter that he actually loved art, but also loved humanity. After the encounter, the pictures were published, alongside Roymans' conditions: 200 million Belgian francs to be given to famine-stricken Bengali refugees in East Pakistan. Roymans also requested the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels organize campaigns in their respective countries to raise money to combat world famine. Roymans set the deadline for Wednesday, October 6.

The police took the photographs as evidence and asked an art expert to validate that they were of the actual painting. It was confirmed they were, but immediately after the confirmation, the director of the Rijksmuseum, [[Arthur van Schendel]] said that the photos were not sufficient proof of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/fakes_thefts_school_of_delft_lost_sp/vermeer_theft_01.html#.WPUAG1MrLVo|title=Vermeer Thefts: The Love Letter|first=Jonathan|last=Janson|website=www.essentialvermeer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days Roymans continued to make contact with the media; when he was finally apprehended by police, on the day of his deadline, he was trying to call a news station. 

The painting was returned to the Rijksmuseum on October 8 but wasn't announced to the public until October 11. It was in very poor condition after being cut out of its stretcher bars and frame. The restoration took almost a year. Roymans was given a court fine and sentenced to two years in prison, but only served six months in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/wide-angle/vermeer-thefts-1971-the-love-letter-137680|title=Vermeer Thefts: 1971-The Love Letter|date=4 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The March of the Guards to Finchley''''', also known as '''''The March to Finchley''''' or '''''The March of the Guards''''', is a 1750 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by English artist [[William Hogarth]], owned by and on display at the [[Foundling Museum]]. Hogarth was well known for his satirical works, and ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' has been said to have given full scope to this sense of satire; it was described by Hogarth himself as "steeped in humour".&lt;ref name="hog"&gt;Hogarth, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is a depiction of a fictional mustering of troops on the [[Tottenham Court Road]] to march north to [[Finchley]] to defend the capital from the second [[Jacobite rebellion of 1745]], which was part of a series of uprisings that had been occurring since the late 17th century and were aimed at returning the [[Stuart Dynasty]] to the throne after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Scott, p.455&lt;/ref&gt; It portrays the soldiers in a humorous light, placing exaggerated emphasis on their lack of training and respect for discipline.

''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' was originally intended to be a gift to the incumbent King of England, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]. However, George II was insulted by the apparent jab at his best troops, and rejected it when it was offered to him. Upset at the King's spurning of his work, Hogarth opted to change the engraving and present the painting instead to the King of [[Prussia]], [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], who, being known for his skills as a soldier rather than an artist, was reportedly much more satisfied with the gift.

== Historical background ==
[[File:Prince Charles Edward Stuart.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Edward Stuart]] was the remaining member in the [[House of Stuart]], the line of descendants of [[James II of England|James II]], in 1745, when he headed the [[Second Jacobite Rebellion]].]]
The Jacobite risings were a series of rebellions affecting all of the British Isles except for [[Wales]] and that occurred between 1688 and 1746, four years before the painting of ''March of the Guards to Finchley''. Centred on attempts by Jacobites to restore [[James II of England|James II]] and his descendants, the [[House of Stuart]], to the throne, there were two major uprisings, referred to as the "First" and "Second" "Jacobite Rebellions" respectively, the first having taken place in 1715 and the second thirty years later in 1745.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt; This painting shows a fictional incident during the second rising.

The "'45" was the product of the disappointment of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], the exiled Jacobite [[pretender]], with the French's unwillingness to invade England to restore the [[House of Stuart]] to power. In 1744, Charles decided to finance the military and social costs of an uprising, believing that he would be able to take the kingdom. With the support of various Scottish [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] clans, Stuart was initially successful. The rebels defeated government forces at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]], and captured [[Edinburgh]]. The Stuart army invaded England, passing through [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and reaching [[Derby]] on 4 December. However, promised support from France failed to arrive, and, in the absence of an English popular uprising, Charles assented to the demand of his Council of War to return to Scotland. Eventually, the Stuart army was comprehensively defeated at [[Culloden Moor]] on 16 April 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/features_union_jacobites.shtml|title=Jacobites and the Union|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Gate of Calais]]]]
Hogarth completed ''March of the Guards to Finchley'' in 1750. The work was initially meant as a gift to George II, and a print was sent before the release of the painting to the Royal Palace for his approval. However, George II had been expecting an artwork that honoured his most favoured guards, not mocked them – accounts state he was offended by what he considered an insult on Hogarth's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The following dialogue is said to have taken place between George II and the deliverer of the portrait, the Earl of Harrington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1836|title=Tales of the Wars; Or, Naval and Military Chronicle|publisher=W.M. Clark|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the painting was taken to the King for inspection:
:"Pray, who is this Hogarth?"
:"A painter, my liege."
:"I hate painting and poetry too! Neither the one nor the other ever did any good!"
:"The picture, please your majesty, must undoubtedly be considered as a burlesque!"
:"What? A painter burlesque a soldier? He deserves to be [[picket (punishment)|picket]]ed  for his insolence! Take this trumpery out of my sight."
Soon thereafter, the painting was returned to Hogarth, who was reportedly mortified by the King's response to what he considered to be one of his finest works. Hogarth later modified the inscription to read "the King of Prussia", rather than "the King of England", before presenting the work to Frederick II of Prussia, who met the work with more enthusiasm and acknowledgement of its artistry.&lt;ref name="Clerk"&gt;Clerk, p.181&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick II was certainly no expert on the arts, and he was more known on the battlefield; some have speculated that this explains his positive reception to a work depicting the English military in poor form.&lt;ref name="Mag" /&gt;

The patriotism of the painting provides a satirical counterpoint to Hogarth's overt antipathy to the French, evident in his painting ''[[The Gate of Calais]]'', completed in 1748. Hogarth's later dedication of ''March'' to the King of Prussia further enforces this view; Frederick II was a renowned military strategist, but not an art connoisseur.&lt;ref name="Mag"&gt;Coleridge, p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the picture may have been inspired by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]]'s ''Départ de Garnison''.

An [[engraving|engraved]] version, by Hogarth's assistant, [[Luke Sullivan]],&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; was published shortly after the painting was completed, though Hogarth made further alterations to the engraving ten years later. The engraving was unusual in that it was not a reversed image of the original painting. Hogarth priced the published artwork for a price of seven shillings and sixpence each copy, rising to half a Guinea after the subscription closed. In advertisements for the painting, Hogarth referred to a subscription-based extra whereby buyers who deposited another three shillings on top of the seven and sixpence would be considered in a lottery for the ownership of the original copy, which would be delivered to the winning subscriber after the engraving had been finished. Hogarth's engraving of ''A Stand of Arms, Musical Instruments, Etc.'' served as the subscription and lottery ticket. As noted by Hogarth in the 1 May 1750 edition of ''The General Advertiser'', this subscription offer ended on 30 April 1750. At the day of closure, there were 1843 chances sold and 167 chances still remaining in Hogarth's lottery, and he gave this remainder to the [[Foundling Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anecdotes of Painting in England|year=1849|pages=735|publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; an establishment to which he had, in the past, been a lucrative donor.&lt;ref name="Clerk" /&gt; Holding almost 10% of the tickets, the Hospital won the lottery and the original; Hogarth scholar Ronald Paulson considers the lottery was rigged from the start. Today the painting is owned by and on display at the [[Foundling Museum]].

===Analysis===
The painting depicts a scene on [[Tottenham Court Road]], a bustling street on the north side of London. The King's guard have rendezvoused there on their way to Scotland to engage the rebels, and numerous soldiers are caught amongst the crowd. Orderly lines of soldiers march away in the distance; meanwhile, a disarrayed, misshapen mass of soldiers engaging in a range of unbecoming behaviours crowds the foreground.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; Paradoxically, the work both highlights the dissolute and disreputable nature of the guardsmen and shows that they can be transformed into a disciplined fighting force, with the drummer and boy fifer summoning the soldiers to their duty.
[[File:MOTGTFDetail1.png|left|thumb|A drunken soldier rejects water in favour of more alcohol]]
In the approximate centre of the piece, two women apparently quarrel fiercely over the [[courtship]] of a [[grenadier]]. The woman to his right, a pregnant ballad-seller, carries a basket full of copies of "[[God Save the King]]", while the older woman to his left, dressed in dark priest's robes with a [[crucifix]] swinging around the neck, holds a rolled Jacobite newspaper above her head.&lt;ref&gt;Branham, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have seen Hogarth's incorporation of the "God Save the King" text to represent public support for the Crown: English musician and author [[Percy Scholes]] said the painting symbolises the nation "wavering between the Hanoverian Protestant Succession and Stuart Romanist Succession", with "God Save the King" "thoroughly associated with the former."&lt;ref&gt;Branham, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the three, another soldier and a [[milkmaid]] are caught in a passionate embrace. A drummer standing to the left is similarly the centre of feminine attention – perhaps his wife and child; behind, a man urinates against the tavern wall, pained by his [[venereal infection]].&lt;ref name=McNeil122 /&gt; Further to the right, near the edge of the painting, a drunken soldier has collapsed to the ground from his own intoxication; despite his state, he rejects the water his comrade behind him is offering him, and instead reaches for another measure of [[gin]] from the woman to his left. Soldiers directly behind him – one of whom clenches an upturned knife – are robbing the civilians.&lt;ref name=McNeil122&gt;McNeil, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, a hungry guard gladly takes food from the platter of a [[pie]]man. To the left-hand-side of the middleground, a boxing match between two soldiers is underway, with an eager group of spectators onlooking.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt; Across the street, numerous prostitutes holler down to the men from open windows of [[Mother Douglas]]'s house, as do soldiers to their cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;Réveil, p.983&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hogarth, several of the more prominent soldiers featured in the painting – such as the grenadier, the drummer and the drunkard – were based from models observed before the creation of the artwork. Notable in particular among these is Lord Albemarle Bertie, who was used as the model for the man seen standing with fists clenched behind the two boxers.&lt;ref name="hog" /&gt;

=== Reception ===
Critics have likened the chaotic scene of ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' to the narrative of English satirist [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''. In his ''Hogarth's Literary Relationships'', Robert E. Moore states that the "elements" of comedy" in ''The March of the Guards to Finchley'' are "the very essence of Fielding's comedy as well":&lt;ref name=McNeil122 /&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;At a first hasty glance the multiplicity of characters and action in ''Tom Jones'', once the story has taken to the road, suggests a chaos just like the wild disorder of the "March to Finchley" [...] the structure of ''Tom Jones'' is well-nigh perfect, one of the marvels of English fiction. Likewise, in the field of painting, there has seldom been a more ordered chaos than that of the "March to Finchley".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Martyrdom of Saint Philip ''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Martirio de San Felipe'') is the title of a painting by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] from 1639.

It is considered one of his best works. The Spanish critic Eugenio d'Ors said of it " almost, almost like a Russian ballet." The painting is exhibited in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].

== Description ==
For a long time it was thought that this painting represented the martyrdom of the apostle [[Bartholomew]]; an event that Ribera had painted several times. Only in 1953 was it established that the subject is [[Philip the Apostle]] by the art historian Delphine Fitz Derby.&lt;ref name="Sánchez"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art| isbn = 978-0-87099-647-4| last1 = Sánchez| first1 = Alfonso E. Pérez| last2 = Spinosa| first2 = Nicola| last3 = Bayer| first3 = Andrea| title = Jusepe de Ribera 1591-1652 : [exhibition] the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [September 18 - November 29, 1992]| date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the resurrection of Jesus, Philip was and his sister Mariamne together with Bartholomew preached in [[Greece]], [[Phrygia]], and [[Syria]]. He was martyred in [[Hierapolis]] when he was crucified.

Ribera captures the moment when the preparations for the crucifixion are still in progress. He does so from a low perspective, giving the main characters monumentality and showing a large part of blue sky. Two executioners try to raise the apostle, while a third supports one of his legs. Bright sunlight illuminates his face that shows pain and resignation. The contrast of light en shadow enhances the dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="Cirlot"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Centro Editor PDA| isbn = 978-84-674-3809-3| last1 = Cirlot| first1 = Lourdes| last2 = Pou| first2 = Anna| title = Museo del Prado| location = Barcelona| date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the right there is a group of curious onlookers who appear to comment on the event. On the left, on the other hand, the people who appear are oblivious to what happens; there is a woman holding a little child in her arms and looking toward the viewer, putting a tender and delicate counterpoint to the cruelty that dominates the rest of the scene.&lt;ref name="Cirlot" /&gt; Some critics have wanted to see an allegory of Charity in this figure.

Judging by the treatment of color, the touches of brush and the splendid naked, this is a mature work by Ribera. It is less caravagesque than his previous works, showing the influence of Guido [[Guido Reni]] and [[Domenichino]].&lt;ref name="Cirlot" /&gt;

== History ==
''The Martyrdom of Saint Philip '' was likely commissioned by the II Duke of Medina de las Torres as a gift to [[Philip IV of Spain|King Philip IV of Spain]]; [[Philip the Apostle]] was his patron saint. For a long time, the painting was part of the royal collection. It survived the fire in de [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid|Royal Alcázar]] in 1734 was subsequently installed in the [[Buen Retiro Palace]] and the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/buen-retiro-el/631e6051-1f25-4723-850e-43ef35a980b3|title=Buen Retiro, El. - Museo Nacional del Prado|last=Simal López|first=Mercedes|date=|website=www.museodelprado.es|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after 1818 the painting was moved to the Prado.

'''''The Mays Literary Anthology''''' (or just '''''The Mays''''') is an anthology of new writing by students from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1992, when Peter Ho Davies, Adrian Woolfson, and Ron Dimant came up with the original concept for the ''Mays'', the publication was split into two separate anthologies; one devoted to prose and the other to poetry. In 2003 the ''Mays'' became a single publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the ''Mays'' receives hundreds of submissions from students at Oxford and Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 2006 the ''Mays'' received a record 1,100 entries. The Editorial Committee (composed of students from both universities) review the submissions during Lent Term.

''The Mays'' is broader in scope than most university literary projects: it is sold in bookstores and by delivery nationwide; it is distributed to every major literary agent; and each year a guest editor — usually a prominent author, poet, or artist — writes an introduction to the anthology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX|url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830224605/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/about|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 August 2011|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous guest editors include: [[Margaret Drabble]] and [[Jon Stallworthy]] (1992), [[Michael Dibdin]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] (1993), [[Stephen Fry]] (1994), [[Ted Hughes]] (1995), [[Penelope Fitzgerald]] (1996), [[Christopher Reid]] and [[Jill Paton Walsh]] (1997), [[Sebastian Faulks]] and [[J.H. Prynne]] (1998), [[Penelope Lively]] and John Kinsella (1999), [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Lawrence Norfolk]] (2000), [[Zadie Smith]] and [[Michael Donaghy]] (2001), [[Andrew Motion]] and [[Nick Cave]] (2002), [[Ali Smith]] (2003), [[Philip Pullman]] (2004), Robert Macfarlane (2005), [[Don Paterson]] and [[Jeanette Winterson]] (2006), [[Colm Toibin]] (2007), Ian Patterson (2008), [[Patti Smith]] (2009), [[Amit Chaudhuri]], [[Tom Raworth]] (2010), {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, [[Jarvis Cocker]] (2011), [[John Darnielle]], [[Tao Lin]], [[Toby Litt]] (2012), [[Michael Frayn]], [[David Harsent]], [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]] (2013), [[John Fuller (poet)|John Fuller]], [[Paul Farley]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Prajwal Parajuly]], [[Emma Chichester Clark]] and [[Alexander Gilkes]] (2014), Roger Mcgough and Rupi Kaur (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mays XIX |url=http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124923/http://themaysxix.tumblr.com/post/5744413958/poetry-jarvis-cocker-is-a-musician-actor-radio |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Mays'' is often noted for launching the career of novelist [[Zadie Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1560999,00.html "Learning Curve," ''The Guardian'', 3 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her work appears in two of the short story editions (1996 and 1997). Literary agencies first took notice of Smith after seeing her story "Mrs. Begum’s Son and the Private Tutor" in the 1997 collection. Smith guest edited the ''Mays'' in 2001. Her quip "maybe in a few years this lot will have me out of a job" has become a catch phrase for the publication.

''The Mays'' is associated with Varsity Publications Ltd, which publishes ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The cost of publication is funded in part by donations from various Oxford and Cambridge colleges.

'''''The Mentor Philosophers''''' was a series of six books each covering a period of philosophical thought, published by the [[New American Library]].   Each book was edited by an esteemed contemporary philosophy academic and contained analysis of a group of philosophers from a chosen period.

The series was very influential during the 1950s and 1960s and went a number of editions in paperback.  Literary historian [[Gilbert Highet]] called it a "very important and interesting series".

'''''The World Is the Home of Love and Death: Stories''''' is a collection of [[short stories]] written by [[Harold Brodkey]] and first published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] in 1997. Most of the stories were written to be part of his novel ''[[The Runaway Soul]]'' and concern its characters. Four of the eleven stories ("The Bullies", "Spring Fugue", "What I Do for Money", and "Dumbness is Everything") were originally printed in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and one ("Religion") in ''[[Glimmer Train]]'', from 1986 to 1996. The ''Runaway Soul'' stories are from the perspective of that novel's protagonist, Wiley Silenowicz. They detail his life from infancy, as a deathly ill child separated from his biological mother; through his childhood, living with stepparents Lila and S.L. and sister Nonie; adolescence, caring for the dying S.L.; and finally into adulthood, where he finds acceptance from the artistic community for his exceptional writing talents.

The '''Throne of Maximian''' (or Maximianus) is a throne that was made for [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Archbishop Maximianus of Ravenna]] and is now on display at the [[Archiepiscopal Museum, Ravenna]]. It is generally agreed that the throne was carved in the Greek East of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and shipped to [[Ravenna]], but there has long been scholarly debate over whether it was made in [[Constantinople]] or [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Smith E.|title=The Alexandrian Origin of the Chair of Maximianus|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=Jan–Mar 1917|volume=21|issue=1|pages=22–37|jstor=497156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Advent"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassett|first=Maurice|title=Cathedra|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03437a.htm|publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the throne is a mixture of [[Early Christian art]] and that of the First Golden Age of [[Byzantine art]]. It is made of [[ivory carving|carved ivory]] panels, with frames of winding vines and grapevines, on a wooden frame.&lt;ref name ="Rowland"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowland|first=Benjamin|title=Byzantine (330-1453)|url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753901|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The throne itself is large with a high semi-circular back and may have held a [[crux gemmata|jewelled cross]] or [[Gospel book]] for some of the time.&lt;ref name = "Penelope" &gt;{{cite book|first=Penelope J.E. |last=Davies|title=Janson's history of art : the western tradition|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0131934554|pages=545–553|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ivory carvings are done in [[relief]] and the panels depict important biblical figures. The back of the throne shows scenes of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]], the sides include scenes of the Story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] from the [[Book of Genesis]], and on the front of the throne are the [[Four evangelists]] around [[John the Baptist]], who is holding a medallion with the [[Lamb of God]] and Maximian’s name above him.&lt;ref name = "Lowden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowden|first=John|title=Early Christian and Byzantine art|year=1997|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|isbn=0714831689|pages=117|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detalle lado.JPG|thumb|Side view]]
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Detail of the [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale]] mosaic showing Maximian]] 
Maximian was "a poor [[deacon]] of [[Pula|Pola]] who rose to a high position through his political adroitness" as a protegé of [[Justinian I]].  He had not been wanted as archbishop by the people of Ravenna, but "by shrewd maneuvres he overcame their opposition, and won their respect by his discretion, generosity, and great enterprises of church building and decoration".&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  He is shown, and named in a large ''[[titulus (inscription)|titulus]]'', in the famous mosaic in the  [[Basilica of San Vitale]] of Justinian surrounded by his ministers and bodyguards (matched by a panel for the Empress).  His throne can be dated to about 545–553, and is believed to have been carved in Constantinople, and shipped to Ravenna. It was probably commissioned by Justinian as a gift for Maximianus for becoming the new archbishop and to encourage and strengthen his authority because he was not always popular.&lt;ref name ="Milburn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milburn|first=Robert|title=Early christian art and architecture.|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520074122|pages=247–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The throne portrays Justinian’s presence in Ravenna, which had been the western capital of the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. Maximian may well have acted as regent for the Emperor in the remaining Byzantine territory in Italy,&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 36-38&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that it was intended to be left as an [[empty throne]] symbolizing the authority of God or the Emperor, or both. Many had also believed that the throne was not intended to be of personal use by the Archbishop, but was to be an empty throne that symbolized the imperial or divine power.&lt;ref name ="mango"/&gt; The cathedra was positioned in the center of the apse in the cathedral with the benches of assisting priests on either side.&lt;ref name ="Penelope"/&gt; The throne was also carried during religious ceremonies. The decorated back and side of the throne suggested that the throne was designed to be moved out of the apse and placed near the chancel while the bishop addressed the congregation, instead of being left stationary against the wall.&lt;ref name="New Advent"/&gt;

The gift was also for the dedication of San Vitale;&lt;ref name="New Advent" /&gt; Justinian hired 6th-century Byzantine artists, who were summoned by the court to Constantinople from around the Empire, to create this piece.&lt;ref name ="Janson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Janson|first=H.W. Janson, Anthony F.|title=History of art : the Western tradition|year=2003|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0131828959|edition=Rev. 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the ivories and even the use of ivory itself suggest that the throne belongs to the School of Ivory Carving. It is also suggested, due to differing styles within the throne, that some components or even the entire throne was possibly carved in Alexandria.&lt;ref name ="mango"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mango|first=Marlia Mundell, ed.|title=Byzantine trade, 4th-12th centuries : the archaeology of local, regional and international exchange : papers of the thirty-eighth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, St John's College, University of Oxford, March 2004|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=0754663108|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is argued that the cult of St Menas was not just confined to Egypt, but there was a church dedicated to him in Constantinople.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt; One argument advanced for an origin in Egypt is the local relevance of the story of Joseph, which is given such prominence, but [[Meyer Schapiro]] demonstrates an artistic and literary tradition using Joseph, who rose to be minister to his [[pharaoh]], as a symbol for the role a bishop, which at this period typically involved a considerable role in civil government.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 35-43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical analysis ==
[[File:Nativity (Throne of Maximianus).jpg|thumb|left|Nativity scene]]

Ivory carving was used in many luxury Byzantine sculptures including [[diptych]]s such as that showing the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[Barberini Diptych]], representing Justinian as Holy Emperor. The throne is the largest single Late Antique work of art made of ivory, and derives attraction from its simple and proportionate lines along with its elaborate carvings.&lt;ref name= "Milburn"/&gt;

The size of the throne and clear stylistic variations between the panels suggest that it involved the work of several 6th century Byzantine artists. The technique of the panels suggests that at least two different artists of unequal skills had executed the carvings due to differing styles. Although the general style of the panels can be recognized, the panels on the front are sketchy compared to the scenes on the side and back of the chair, which are very bold and rather careless.&lt;ref name="Baldwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 94-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimensions are 22” (0.6m) wide x 4’11” (1.5m) high. Of the panels on the back of the throne, only 16 of the 24 panels have survived or been restored.&lt;ref name = "Baldwin"/&gt;  The piece is currently preserved and displayed in the Museo Arcivescovile, which also holds the Chapel of Sant’Adrea and works from the old cathedral.&lt;ref name = "Milburn"/&gt; The Byzantine Church did not favor sculpture in the round, fearing that it would recall idols from Greek and Roman pagan religion.&lt;ref name ="Rowland"/&gt; Thus, small carvings in relief were created and allowed.  This style of carving involves carving figures that project slightly from the background rather than free standing. This creates a piece with a mixture of 2 and 3 dimensionality.&lt;ref name = "Rowland"/&gt;

The two different techniques of two different artists could be possibly explained by the pandemic plague that raged that time (c.ad.540, the Plague of Justinian). The plague spread to the Roman Empire from the East Africa through the Ivory route and the ivory workshop artists could be among early victims of the disease. The deterioration of the technique therefore could be explained by the decease of the initial principal master and the possible desire of the Emperor to finish the piece as soon as possible anyway.

== Formal and stylistic analysis ==

The Throne of Maximianus is a key work in what has been called the "Justinianic style" of early Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, Chapter 5, with pp. 94-96 on the throne&lt;/ref&gt;   The ivory exterior of the throne is conceived as a series of framed panels, though the apparent structural roles of the sections does not entirely reflect their actual function.  An unusual feature is that the depth of the relief is generally deeper in the decorative "framing" sections than in the framed scenes. The overall scheme is extremely rich, if demonstrating a certain ''[[horror vacui]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, p. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;  The artists adapted complicated patterns and designs from textiles and carvings of the Near East and conveyed them in their artworks.&lt;ref name = "Rowland"/&gt; The framing elements of the throne are decorated with scrolling vines typical of Early Christian art,&lt;ref name = "Lowden"/&gt; "inhabited" with animals and birds within the curling branches of vines.&lt;ref name = "Milburn"/&gt;

Many scenes carved on the Throne of Maximianus, such as the miracle of Christ and the history of Joseph, can also be found in a variety of other works, including mosaics and manuscripts. The [[Four Evangelists]] portrayed on the front of the throne was also a very common motif used throughout the Medieval period. The figures show a strong preference for ''[[contrapposto]]'' poses, "an inheritance from Graeco-Roman art, but which here become a kind of mannerism".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconographical analysis ==
[[File:Catedra15.JPG|thumb|right|Scene from the story of Joseph]]
The Throne of Maximianus symbolizes a seat of authority and status. A throne is recognized as a seat for someone with power in the Medieval times. The chair not only signifies the resting of the body, but also the focusing of the mind. In a setting like a [[Cathedral]], the chair is given a role of reflecting the religious and spiritual attitudes of the attendants of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Paul|title=The Chair|url=http://www.visiblespace.com/poetics/paper/papertwo.html|publisher=The Poetics of Thresholds - Social Portrait as a Chair|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cathedra is the official seat of a bishop.

On the Throne of Maximianus, there are scenes of the Old and New Testament depicting the Story of Joseph and the Life of Christ. The scenes of the New Testament hold a peculiar resemblance to Egyptian examples of the New Testaments and they are continued in the seventh century on Coptic monuments.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;

=== Front of the seat ===

At the front of the seat, there are a total of five panels. Four of the panels portray the Evangelists holding their Gospel books. The last panel illustrates John the Baptist, holding his emblem of the lamb.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt; This is a very common theme that is depicted in many manuscripts and mosaics.

The designs of the throne's front include the vine-stem design, which was heavily used in Early Christian art.&lt;ref name = "Lowden"/&gt; The artists that created the throne incorporated animals and birds within the vines.&lt;ref name="New Advent" /&gt; On the lower border of the front of the seat contains two lion guards guarding the vase from which the vines emerge. On the top border, there are a pair of peacocks surrounding the monogram of Archbishop Maximianus. The peacocks symbolize birds of immortality.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;

=== Side of the seat ===
[[File:Catedra14.JPG|thumb|left|Another Joseph scene]]
On the side of the throne, there are 10 panels representing the events from the Story of Joseph in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt; The artistic style of these scenes is a Sixth-century style, which can be distinguished by the sketchiness of the carving.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt; Scenes of the Life of Joseph, the choice of costumes, decoration and technique are consistently analogous to the Christian art of Egypt.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;

=== Back of the seat ===

The back of the throne consisted of 24 panels depicting the New Testament and more specifically, the Life of Christ and apocryphal scenes from the [[Life of the Virgin]].&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;

==== Individual scenes ====

*The Alexandrian-Coptic version of the [[nativity of Christ]], depicted on the Throne of Maximian, shows the Virgin lying on a mattress, which is more of an Oriental theme. While the Western Nativities have the Virgin seated in a chair.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;
*The scene of Annunciation depicts the Virgin sitting to the left on a wicker chair spinning the purple garment for the temple. Other than the examples stated from above, this type of scene occurs only on monuments of the Coptic origin.&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;
*The scene of the Story of Bethlehem, Joseph helping the pregnant Virgin onto the animal, which is led by an angel, is very rare of a scene in Early Christian art. This type of scene is most likely made in Alexandria whence it became a characteristic type in [[Coptic art]].&lt;ref name = "Baldwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Milburn" /&gt;

A '''''vedette''''' is the main female artist of a show derived from [[cabaret]] and its genres ([[revue]], [[vaudeville]], [[music hall]] or [[burlesque]]). 

The purpose of the vedette in a cabaret or nightclub show is to entertain the public. The vedette has to know how to [[triple threat (entertainer)|sing, dance and act]] on stage. Depending on the quality of its show, career or mastery of one or more stage talents, can be considered a ''super vedette'' or ''first vedette''. Generally a vedette is a woman with physical presence, personality and charisma that captivates the public. In addition to singing, dancing and acting, vedettes often included groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, and even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage.

In the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. [[Paris]] and [[Las Vegas]] were considered the main cradle of the vedettes.

==Etymology==
''Vedette'' is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le-dictionnaire.com/definition.php?mot=vedette|title=Le Dictionnaire - Définition vedette|website=www.le-dictionnaire.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.

The vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with  so-called [[showgirl]]s. Venues such as [[Le Lido]], the [[Moulin Rouge]], and the [[Crazy Horse]] in France. The [[Teatro Maipo]] and the [[Teatro El Nacional]] in Argentina, and the [[Teatro de la Ciudad |Teatro de la Ciudad "Esperanza Iris"]] in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows.

==Europe==

===France===
[[File:Le Lido.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Lido]] of Paris]]
France is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, [[Paris]], has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the [[Moulin Rouge]] and the [[Folies Bergère de Paris]], pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing [[Tableau vivant]]. Other famous venues are the [[Le Lido]] and [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]], also famous for their vaudeville and Revues. In more recent times, this group of entertainment centers would be joined by [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse]].

Among the main vedettes of France are considered the "Three Graces" of Belle Époque: [[Émilienne d'Alençon]], [[Liane de Pougy]], and [[La Bella Otero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardianpromenade.com/sex/the-courtesan/|title=The Courtesan|date=14 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Mistinguett]] became one of the most popular French artists of her time and the most important woman in the world of the spectacle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/m/mistinguett.htm|title=Biografia de Mistinguett|website=www.biografiasyvidas.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was [[Gina Palerme]].

At the beginning of the century, the novelist [[Colette]] was also distinguished by acting in shows of magazine. Another prominent figure at that time is the world-famous Dutch spy [[Mata Hari]].

The legendary [[Cléo de Mérode]] of the Folies Bergère was another of the great stars of the Parisian nightlife of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portalsolidario.net/ocio/visu/biografia.php?rowid=10182|title=Biografía insólita.

[[File:Mistinguett Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mistinguett]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]]]]

[[Joséphine Baker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|title=Biography - The Official Licensing Website of Josephine Baker|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[United States|American]] origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes of the twentieth century. Her "Revue Nègre", which included a [[jazz]] orchestra, caused a sensation in the Parisian cabarets. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made with bananas) were more attractive to [[Europe]]ans than to [[United States|Americans]]. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez ''Josephine''.

Another important figure was [[Coccinelle]], considered the first transsexual vedette in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20161228073700/http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 December 2016|title=''Biography of Coccinelle in her official web page''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actress and singer [[Liliane Montevecchi]] stood out as vedette in the Folies Bergère in the 1970s, and eventually conquered [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty.

In recent times the vedette shows emphasize figures like [[Arielle Dombasle]] (known as the vedette-like Dolorès Sugar Rose) and Marlène Mourreau.

Conesa, Montalván and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous [[foxtrot]] called ''Mi querido capitán (My dear captain)''.


In the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1090805/0/eujenia-arenas/cabarets/mexico/|title=Los últimos cabarets mexicanos|last=20Minutos|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikikí, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro Lírico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/|title=''Article about the Teatro Lírico''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224958/http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/#|archive-date=2017-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the ''Exoticas'', a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These "Exoticas" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859|title=Tongolele y las "exóticas" en Magazine de Policía y VEA|first=Gabriela Pulido|last=Llano|date=1 October 2013|journal=Diario de Campo|issue=13|pages=32–36|accessdate=2 July 2018|via=www.revistas.inah.gob.mx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702093257/https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859#|archive-date=2018-07-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the "Exoticas" was [[Tongolele|Yolanda Montes "Tongolele"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivelohoy.com/entretenimiento/8041423/perfume-de-gardenia-arranca-gira-en-la|title=Perfume de Gardenia arranca gira en LA|first=Tommy|last=Calle|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with ''Tongolele'', the most famous were [[Su Muy Key]] ''The Chinese Doll'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miguelangelmoralex-bitacora.blogspot.com/2010/05/su-muy-key.html|title=Bitácora: SU-MUY-KEY|first=Miguel Angel|last=Morales|date=1 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Ellen Bromfield|Kalantan]]. Another famous "Exóticas" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Naná.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poresto.net/ver_nota.php?zona=yucatan&amp;idSeccion=33&amp;idTitulo=94881|title=''Por esto Yucatán: The Amazing World of the Exoticas''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous "Rumberas", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The [[Rumberas film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html|title=1946-1950: Rumberas y Arrabal|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222034740/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html#|archive-date=2012-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the called [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]]. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans [[María Antonieta Pons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690512/bio|title=María Antonieta Pons|website=IMDb|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amalia Aguilar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amaliaaguilar.com/history_1.html|title=Amalia Aguilar - Beginnings|website=www.amaliaaguilar.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ninón Sevilla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/entretenimiento/biografias/022450/ninon-sevilla|title=Ninón Sevilla|last=Espectáculos|date=2 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rosa Carmina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/search?q=rosa+carmina|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the Mexican [[Meche Barba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/2008/09/las-rumberas-parte-4-la-rumbera.html|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza: LAS RUMBERAS parte 4: LA RUMBERA MEXICANA... MECHE BARBA|first=René Muñoz|last=López|date=1 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America.
The Cuban [[Rosita Fornés]] deserves special mention.

The 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Clóset, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the [[Teatro Fru Fru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistacinefagia.com/2004/07/tivoli/|title=Tívoli - revistacinefagia.com|first=Revista|last=Cinefagia|website=www.revistacinefagia.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called [[Mexican sex comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html|title=1976-1982: Los años de las "Ficheras"|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011320/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html#|archive-date=2013-08-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wedding Bible''' is a [[Bible]] either used for officiating in some [[wedding]] ceremonies,&lt;ref&gt;An ethnographic survey of South Ibie clan I. B. Bello-Imam - 1995 "A white Holy Bible generally termed Wedding Bible is usually presented, too. This is used by the officiating lady for prayers during the ceremonies."&lt;/ref&gt; or a special edition gift presented to the couple. [[Oxford University Press]] produced ''The Oxford Wedding Bible'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Report of the American Bible Society - Volume 156 - Page 85 American Bible Society - 1971 "Special editions of Scriptures were produced for evangelistic and other programs, and a wedding Bible was made available for presentation by ministers at marriage services. A special appeal for funds promoted during the middle of the year ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hudson ''The Christian Writer's Manual of Style'' 2004 - Page 310 "A wedding Bible or a graduation gift book should almost certainly include a presentation page."&lt;/ref&gt;
