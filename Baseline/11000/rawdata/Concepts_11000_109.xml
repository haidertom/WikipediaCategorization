'''''$pread''''' was a quarterly [[magazine]] by and for [[sex worker]]s and those who support their rights. The magazine's focus was: "personal experiences and political insights" and it "contain(ed) practical information like news, features, health columns, and resources related to the sex industry".&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About |url=http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |publisher=$pread Magazine |accessdate=April 2, 2015|date=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528104430/http://www.spreadmagazine.org/ |archivedate=May 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Articles were written by readers as well as by figures from academic, cultural, and literary backgrounds, most of whom are current or former sex workers. The magazine was launched on March 15, 2005 by Rachel Aimee, Rebecca Lynn, and Raven Strega.&lt;ref name="Rough Trade"/&gt; ''$pread'' was based in New York City, and was sold throughout the United States and Canada at [[independent bookstore]]s and via national distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/pread-magazine-provided-a-smart-funny-lifeline-for-sex-workers-around-the-world-069|title=Remembering '$pread,' the Magazine That Gave Sex Workers a Voice - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-editor said, "We want the general public to become aware of issues such as the physical working conditions of sex workers and their health care and housing needs, and to start considering sex workers as real people rather than mythical beasts who only come to life when someone drops a quarter into a slot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-01-11/people/whore-pride/2 ''Whore Pride''], Rachel Kramer Bussel, The Village Voice, January 11, 2005 Accessed March 26, 2009.

''$pread'' published personal experiences, political insights, and contained practical information, such as news, features, health columns, and sex industry resources. ''$pread'' supported the sex work community by donating 15% of each print run to the workplaces of and the outreach organizations utilized by sex workers. The tax outreach program "helps sex workers who don't know they can and should file taxes", said [[Audacia Ray]], an executive editor at the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/05/nyregion/05sex.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Federal%20Taxes%20(US) An Old Profession That's New to Doing Taxes]. Corey Kilgannon, ''The New York Times''. April 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 30, 2010, ''$pread'' has ceased printed publication due to both financial issues and not having enough people to keep the operation running, even if "there was $100k made available".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spreadmagazine.org/2010/08/30/pread-is-dead-really/ $pread is Dead, Really] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 |date=April 18, 2009 }}. Retrieved September 6, 2010.  $pread Blog, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Because ''$pread'' was part of the [[sex workers rights]] movement, it was criticized by some branches of feminism that believe that sex work is inherently degrading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among feminists, perceptions are no less polarized – sex workers are either fully empowered agents using their sexuality in unassailably positive ways, or victims of a job that degrades them by its very nature. Most feminist dialogues about sex work sound more like monologues; defensiveness, mischaracterizations, and willful ignorance abound, making casualties of complexity and nuance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 ''Hot &amp; Bothered'', Bitch Magazine, Issue 33, Fall 2006 ] Accessed March 26, 2009.[https://www.webcitation.org/5g86YpQZk?url=http://bitchmagazine.org/issue/33 Archived] April 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''$pread'' Book==
[[The Feminist Press]] released a collection of some of the articles and essays from the original publications of the magazine into a 368-page book on the 15th March 2015 entitled ''$pread : The Best of the Magazine that Illuminated the Sex Industry and Started a Media Revolution''.&lt;ref name="$pread book publication from The Feminist Press"&gt;{{cite web |title=$pread book publication by The Feminist Press |url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XfDSTm1n?url=http://www.feministpress.org/books/pread |archivedate=April 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]], the Law on Access to Official Documents was enacted in 2010. The law repealed and superseded various other legislation and administrative orders that were previously in force.&lt;ref name=K2.0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/kosovar-journalists-need-demand-implementation-access-information-rights |title=Kosovar journalists need to demand implementation of their access to information rights|last=Sheremeti |first=Furtuna |date=31 January 2017 |website=Kosovotwopointzero.com |publisher=Kosovo 2.0 |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution. Several secondary acts aims at realizing the right and implement the 2010 Law. However, full implementation is lacking, the courts are slow to respond to appeals due to persistent backlogs in the judicial system.&lt;ref name=FH2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/kosovo |title=Kosovo. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date= 2015 |website=FreedomHouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the appeals process work, the institutions appear willing to ignore the rulings of the court when it comes to transparency and access to public information.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in 2016, the law on access to public documents is undergoing a procedure of amendment together with other laws to which it should be harmonized.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

==Legal framework==
In Kosovo [[Access to public information in Europe|access to public information]] is a right guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution which establishes that every person is entitled of the right of access to public information and that documents held by public institutions and organs of state authorities are public, except for information that can be concealed by law for reasons due to privacy, business trade secrets or public security.&lt;ref name=kryeministri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Besim M. Kajtazi |date=2013 |title= Legislation Summary on the Right of Access to Public Documents |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/II.__SUMMARY_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_ACCESS_TO_PUBLIC_DOCUMENTS.pdf |publisher=the Republic of Kosovo. The Office of the Prime Minister |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the right of access to official documents is guaranteed by many international agreements and declarations, such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] and Protocols which are directly applicable in the Republic of Kosovo and have priority in case of conflict of applicable laws.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

There are also special laws regulating the application of the right of access to public information, such as the Law on Administrative procedure and the Law on Civil Service of the Republic of Kosovo.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

Specifically, to implement the constitutional right of every person to have access, upon request, to documents of public interest held by public authorities, in 2010 the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo approved the '''Law no. 03/L-215 on Access to Public Documents (LAPD).''' The LAPD Law applies to all documents maintained, drafted and received by public institutions and is based on ten principles:
* everyone has the right of access to information;
* access is the rule, secret is the exception;
* the law applies to all public bodies;
* the request should be simple, fast and free for the requester;
* officials have the duty to support the applicants in their search for information;
* the refusal should be justified;
* public interest is more important than secret;
* the right to appeal is guaranteed in case of negative reply;
* public authorities should proactively publish basic information;
* the right to information should be guaranteed by an independent body.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

===Procedures for exercising the right of access to information===
Requesting and obtaining public information is free of charge. A fee may only be charged to applicants for copies of the document requested and have to be reasonable and aiming at only covering the actual costs of reproduction and document delivery.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt; Exceptions to the right of access to public information can be applied and are defined by law.

According to the relevant law, access to public information may be restricted only for the purpose of protecting the public legitimate interests of life or other legitimate private interests, such as the right to privacy and for public security reasons.&lt;ref name="kryeministri" /&gt;  Other reasons for exceptions include: defence and international relations; detection and investigation of criminal activities, disciplinary investigations, atc.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

The request can be made in writing or orally.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

Public institutions have to respond to citizens' requests within seven days with their decision to fully or partially grant the access. The deadline for review may be exceptionally extended to 15 days.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

The respect of the right of access to public information is guaranteed by the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson Institution]], an independent body supporting citizens to realize the right of access to documents that have been denied, according to the Law on Ombudsperson.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

In case of rejection of the applicant's request, and non-response by the relevant authority within the deadline, the applicant can start an appeal procedure in front of the Ombudsperson Institutions or the competent courts, in accordance with applicable law.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

The implementation of the laws on access to public information is problematic.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report, in practice the right of access to public information is “undermined by the authorities’ fragmented and unclear approach”.&lt;ref name=CE2016&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=9 November 2016 |title= Commission staff working Document Kosovo* 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_kosovo.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, according to the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)]]  the realization of the right is hindered by a secretive mentality and culture of many public authorities in the country.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drejtesianekosove.com/repository/docs/report_on_access_to_public_documents_2013-2014_824655.pdf |title=Report on Access to Public Documents 2013-2014 |last= |first= |date=June 2014 |website= |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, According to the news portal [[Kosovo 2.0]], institutions tend to disclose information on less important issues and when lower level institutions, such as municipalities, are involved.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Other flaws in the application of the law consists in its misinterpretation, for instance in distinguishing between what to consider private and what a public interest, and the application of ''ad hoc'' administrative measures by certain institutions. According to Kosovo 2.0, even when the law is very clear in specifying procedures, certain institutions have created their own procedures which are not always in line with the law, resulting in barriers for interested applicants. For instance, there are numerous institutions requiring the payment of 1 euro when filling a freedom of information request, which is in contradiction with the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Another problem concerns the officials who are responsible for receiving and processing freedom of information requests. According to Kosovo 2.0 in many cases they are not properly trained to effectively execute the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

In Kosovo, the majority of requests for accessing public information are submitted by journalists, activists and civil society organizations, and very few by citizens that are not fully aware of their right of access to public information.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to a survey carried out in 2012, the level of knowledge about the content of the law on access to public information among citizens was extremely deficient, as well as their interest in making requests for access to public documents.&lt;ref name=FOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://levizjafol.org/folnew/kosovo-with-a-low-level-of-implementation-of-the-law-on-access-to-public-documents/?lang=en   |title=Kosovo with a low level of implementation of the law on access to public documents |last= |first= |date= 28 September 2012 |website=Levizjafol.org |publisher=Lëvizja FOL Movement |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test and monitor the implementation of the law, BIRN has submitted a series of requests for information to the majority of public institutions, at all levels, in Kosovo. From June 2013 to May 2014, it submitted a total of 125 official requests: of the requests submitted, 68 were denied, 50 approved and 7 partially denied, meaning that requested documents were received in only 40 per cent of cases. This result is considered as “rather poor” by the organisation.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; During the same monitoring period, one of the major problems observed by BIRN concerned access to courts information, in particular indictments.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; Another common problem highlighted by the organization is that, in practice and despite the law’s provisions, the institution that does not have the information requested usually rejects the requests, rather than forwarding it to another  institution that may have it as required by the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; According to another test, implemented between October 2013 to April 2016, only 25 per cent of BIRN’s requests were approved and 38 were rejected.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11919">'''Ban the Box''' is the name of an international campaign by [[civil rights]] groups and advocates for ex-offenders, aimed at persuading employers to remove from their [[Application for employment|hiring applications]] the [[check box]] that asks if applicants have a [[criminal record]]. Its purpose is to enable ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring process before being asked about their criminal records. The premise of the campaign is that anything that makes it harder for ex-offenders to find a job makes it likelier that they will re-offend, which is bad for society.

== History ==
The campaign began in Hawaii in the late 1990s, and has gained strength in other U.S. states following the [[United States recession of 2007-2009|2007–2009 recession]]. Its advocates say it is necessary because a growing number of Americans have criminal records due to tougher sentencing laws particularly for drug crimes,&lt;ref name=Harless/&gt; and are having difficulty finding work because of high [[unemployment]] and a rise in [[background checks]] that followed the [[September 11 terror attacks]] on the United States.&lt;ref name=Marois/&gt;

As of July 2015, 52 U.S. municipalities and 18 states had in place [[legislation]] that "banned the box" for government job applications and also in some cases those of their private contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865631622/The-main-reason-ex-offenders-wind-up-breaking-the-law-again.html|title=Even the smallest record can be a life sentence of poverty|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|work=Deseret News|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such ordinances exempt applications for "sensitive" positions, such as those involving work with children.&lt;ref name=Harless/&gt; [[Target Corporation]] "banned the box" in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, Brent (29 October 2013). "Target Bans the Box". New York Times. Retrieved 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, [[corporate social responsibility]] advocacy charity [[Business in the Community]] launched a "ban the box" campaign in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Stephen (17 October 2013). "'Ban the Box' campaign asks employers to give ex-offenders a chance". the Guardian. Retrieved 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign has been criticized by U.S. industry group the [[National Retail Federation]] for exposing companies, their customers and employees to potential crime,&lt;ref name=Harless&gt;Harless, William (3 August 2013). "'Ban the Box' Laws Make Criminal Pasts Off-Limits". Wall Street Journal.

In June 2016, a large experimental study was published by Amanda Agan and Sonja Starr on the racial gap in callback rates of employers to job applicants of different racial backgrounds in [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]] before and after Ban the Box laws went into effect. Agan and Starr sent out 15,000 fictitious online job applications to companies in those areas with racially stereotypical names on the job applications. Prior to the implementation of Ban the Box laws in New Jersey and New York City, the gap in the callback rate between the job applications with stereotypically black names and stereotypically white names was 7 percent. After the implementation of Ban the Box laws, the racial gap in the callback rate increased to 45 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Amanda Y.|last1=Agan|first2=Sonja B.|last2=Starr|title=Ban the Box, Criminal Records, and Statistical Discrimination: A Field Experiment|ssrn=2795795|journal=University of Michigan Law &amp; Economics Working Papers|volume=16-012|date=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|interviewer=[[Steve Inskeep]]|title='Ban The Box' Laws,' Do They Help Job Applicants With Criminal Histories?|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/19/486571633/are-ban-the-box-laws-helping-job-applicants-with-criminal-histories|publisher=''[[NPR]]''|date=July 19, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Ban the Box' leads to increase in employer racial discrimination|work=Michigan News|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/23982-ban-the-box-leads-to-increase-in-employer-racial-discrimination|date=June 15, 2016|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic Media"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Semuels|first1=Alana|title=The Unforeseen Consequences of Banning the Box|work=[[The Atlantic]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/08/consequences-of-ban-the-box/494435/|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Massey|first1=Wyatt|title=Ban the Box increases racial discrimination, study says|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[tronc]]|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-ban-the-box-study-20160730-story.html|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2016 study by Jennifer L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30561">'''Bateman's principle''', in [[evolutionary biology]], is that in most species, variability in [[reproductive success]] (or reproductive variance) is greater in males than in females. It was first proposed by [[Angus John Bateman]] (1919–1996), an English geneticist. Bateman suggested that, since males are capable of producing millions of sperm cells with little effort, while females invest much higher levels of energy in order to nurture a relatively small number of eggs, the female plays a significantly larger role in their offspring's reproductive success. Bateman’s paradigm thus views females as the limiting factor of parental investment, over which males will compete in order to [[copulate]] successfully.

Although Bateman's principle served as a cornerstone for the study of [[sexual selection]] for many decades, it has recently been subject to criticism. Attempts to reproduce Bateman's experiments in 2012 and 2013 were unable to support his conclusions. Some scientists have criticized Bateman's experimental and statistical methods, or pointed out conflicting evidence, while others have defended the veracity of the principle and cited evidence in support of it.

== Description ==
Typically it is the [[female]]s who have a relatively larger investment in producing each offspring. Bateman attributed the origin of the unequal investment to the differences in the production of gametes: sperm are cheaper than eggs. A single [[male]] can easily fertilize all females' eggs; she will not produce more offspring by mating with more than one male.  A male is capable of fathering more offspring if he mates with several females.  By and large, a male's potential reproductive success is limited by the number of females he mates with, whereas a female's potential reproductive success is limited by how many eggs she can produce. According to Bateman's principle, this results in [[sexual selection]], in which males compete with each other, and females become choosy in which males to mate with. Thus, as a result of being [[anisogamy|anisogamous]], males are fundamentally promiscuous, and females are fundamentally selective.

== History ==
Bateman initially published his review in 1948. He was a botanist, contributing to the literature of sexual selection only once in his lifetime. Bateman initially saw his study on Drosophila to be a test of Charles Darwin’s doctrine of sexual selection. He saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection not as flawed, but as incomplete. He felt that if he were to provide a concrete demonstration of how sexual selection played a role in the reproductive success of certain species, he could explain the gap between Darwin’s ideas and sexual dimorphism.

Although it is common to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his principle can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.

== Bateman's study ==
Throughout his research, Bateman conducted experiments using fruit flies in order to observe their copulation and sexual behavior. A total of six series of experiments were conducted with the fruit fly ''Drosophila melanogaster'', using three to five individuals of each sex. Each trial ran for three or four days. Some ran to completion without the transfer of the Drosophila from one environment (bottle) to another. In the others, Bateman transferred the flies and their eggs to a new bottle every day. Bateman also varied the age of the flies depending on the experiment, with an age gap between one and six days total. He never watched the flies' copulations. The flies used were from several inbred strains, which meant they could be identified by their specific inbred strain. Therefore, he inferred the number of involved mates based on the number of offspring that were later found to have mutations from both a male and a female. The difficulty that arose was that if a female Drosophila had copulated with five males and only one larva survived, Bateman would not be able to account for the other four copulations.

Analysis of the data collected in sets one through four showed that the males' reproductive success, estimated as the number of sired offspring, increased at a steady rate until a total of three mates were reached. It is important to note that Bateman kept the sex ratio of males to females completely even throughout his trials. But after surpassing three mates, male reproductive success began to fall. Female reproductive success also increased with number of mates, but much more gradually than that of the males. The second series of data collected in sets five and six illustrated a dramatically different outcome. Male reproductive success increased at a steady and steep rate, never dropping. Female reproductive success, on the other hand, plateaued after a single mate. Bateman focused mainly on the second series of data when discussing his results. His main conclusion was that the reproductive success of females does not increase with an influx of mates, as one fit mate was enough to successfully complete fertilization. This is often referred to as Bateman’s Gradient.

== Replication of Bateman's experiments ==
Throughout 2012 and 2013, Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson took it upon themselves to repeat Bateman's experiment in its entirety. While reproducing his tests, the same fly strains and mutations were used in order to maintain the same methodology. However, one of the 11 strains that Bateman used had gone extinct, and was thus replaced. (Tang-Martinez 2012)

Gowaty, Kim, and Anderson found that upon combining certain strains with one another, the offspring were unable to survive to adulthood. (Gowaty, Kim, &amp; Anderson 2012) Thus, Bateman’s numbers regarding the number of individuals not having mated was higher than the actual number. Likewise, his estimate of those that mated with one or more mates was too low. This was valid for both the males and females of this species.

Gowaty desired to further explore the reasoning behind the premature death of the Drosophila. She began doing so by running monogamy trials between different strains of flies and found that 25% of the offspring died due to becoming double mutants. (Gowaty 2013) Bateman thought his work fit within the lines of Mendel’s laws of genetics, while Gowaty proved otherwise. The 1948 experiments inferred reproductive success based on the number of adults living by the end of the trial. In reality, many factors were left out of the equation when calculating reproductive success as a function of the number of mates, which had the ability to completely dislodge the accuracy behind Bateman's results. Gowaty was not able to confirm Bateman's conclusions and found no evidence for sexual selection in the experiment. (Gowaty 2013; Tang-Martinez 2012)&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;

== Related experiments ==
Nevertheless, some modern experiments between the relationship of number of mates and the reproductive success of males and females support Bateman's principle. Julie Collet conducted an experiment with a population of red jungle fowl. A total of thirteen replicate groups of three males and four females were monitored for ten days. In this experiment, the sex ratio was biased toward females. A male's reproductive success was calculated using the proportion of embryos fathered to the total number of embryos produced by all the females he mated with. The total sexual selection opportunity was calculated using the following formula.

The ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents the variance in RS, while the{{clarify|date=December 2016}} is the square mean of reproductive success of members of one sex in a group.

In 2013, Fritzsche and Arnqvist tested Bateman's principle by estimating sexual selection between males and females in four seed beetles. They used a unique experimental design that showed sexual selection to be greater in males than in females. In contrast, sexual selection was also shown to be stronger for females in role-reversed species. They suggested that the Bateman gradient is typically the most accurate and informative measure of sexual selection between different sexes and species (Fritzsche, K. &amp; Arnqvist, G).{{full|date=June 2018}}

== Modern criticism ==
More than 60 years later, Bateman's principle has received considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success may result from random mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive success can be greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies are subject to change depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Newcomer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newcomer|first=Scott D.|last2=Zeh|first2=Jeanne A.|last3=Zeh|first3=David W.|date=1999-08-31|title=Genetic benefits enhance the reproductive success of polyandrous females|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/96/18/10236|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=96|issue=18|pages=10236–10241|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.18.10236|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10468592|pmc=17872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental and statistical criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model focused on his experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental and statistical calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, ''Drosophila melanogaster'', may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty conducted the first in-depth analysis of the data in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found sampling biases, mathematical errors, and selective presentation of data.&lt;ref name="Snyder2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=Brian F. |last2=Gowaty |first2=Patricia Adair |title=A Reappraisal of Bateman's Classic Study of Intrasexual Selection |journal=Evolution |date=November 2007 |volume=61 |issue=11 |pages=2457–2468 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00212.x|pmid=17725639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 review by [[Zuleyma Tang-Martinez|Zuleyma Tang-Martínez]] concluded that various empirical and theoretical studies, especially Gowaty's reproduction of Bateman's original experiment, pose a major challenge to Bateman's conclusions, and that Bateman's principle should be considered an unproven hypothesis in need of further reexamination.&lt;ref name="Tang-Martinez"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tang-Martinez|first1=Zuleyma|title=Repetition of Bateman challenges the paradigm|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=6 July 2012|volume=109|issue=29|pages=11476–11477|doi=10.1073/pnas.1209394109|pmid=22773808|pmc=3406825}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tang-Martínez, "modern data simply don't support most of Bateman's and [[Robert Trivers|Trivers']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s predictions and assumptions."&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tang-Martinez |first1=Zuleyma |title=Data Should Smash the Biological Myth of Promiscuous Males and Sexually Coy Females |url=http://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665 |website=The Conversation |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en |date=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 review confirmed Darwinian sex roles across the animal kingdom, concluding that "sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500983|title=Darwinian sex roles confirmed across the animal kingdom|first1=Tim|last1=Janicke|first2=Ines K.|last2=Häderer|first3=Marc J.|last3=Lajeunesse|first4=Nils|last4=Anthes|date=1 February 2016|journal=Science Advances|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e1500983|accessdate=17 April 2018|via=advances.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500983|pmid=26933680|pmc=4758741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One error source that have been shown to give an illusion of greater differential in reproductive success in males than in females genetically is that chromosome effects cause a greater percentage of mutations to be lethal before even reaching sexual maturity in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gowaty | first=P. A. | last2=Kim | first2=Y.-K. | last3=Anderson | first3=W. W. | title=No evidence of sexual selection in a repetition of Bateman's classic study of Drosophila melanogaster | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=109 | issue=29 | date=11 June 2012 | issn=0027-8424 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1207851109 | pmid=22689966 | pmc=3406809 | pages=11740–11745 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/06/1207851109.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumption that any differential in reproductive success between males and females among the individuals that do reach sexual maturity must be due to sexual selection in the current population is also subject to criticism, such as the possibility of remnants of sexually selected traits in a previous species from which a new species have evolved can be negatively selected due to costs in nutrients and weakened immune systems and that such negative selection would cause a higher difference in reproductive success in males than in females even without any still ongoing sexual selection. Since lower degrees of selection during times of stable environment allows genetic variation to build up by random mutations and allow some individuals in a population to survive environmental change while strong constant selection offsets the effect and increases the risk of the entire population dying out during catastrophic environmental change due to less genetic variation, constant loss of genetic variation caused by sexual selection have been suggested as a factor contributing to higher [[extinction]] rates in more sexually dimorphic species besides the nutrient, immunity and other costs of the ornaments themselves. While the ornament cost risk would only be removed when the ornaments have been eliminated by selection, the genetic variation model predicts that the species ability to survive would improve significantly even at an early stage of reduction of sexual dimorphism due to other adaptive mutations arising and surviving due to minimal selection during times of stable environment while the genes causing sexually dimorphic anatomy have only in small part been affected by the mutations. Applied to human evolution, this model can explain why early [[Homo sapiens]] display a significantly increased adaptability to environmental change already at its early divergence from [[Homo erectus]] that had a high muscular sexual dimorphism, as well as why human anatomy through the history of Homo sapiens show a diversification during times of stable climate and a selective loss of the more robust male forms during environmental change that does not recover during later stability, continuing through the loss of many robust characteristics in regional bottlenecks as recent as the end of the Ice Age and the time around the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]. It also explains genetic evidence of human genetic diversity increasing during stable environmental periods and being reduced during bottlenecks related to changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Anthes | first=Nils | last2=Häderer | first2=Ines K. | last3=Michiels | first3=Nico K. | last4=Janicke | first4=Tim | editor-last=Schielzeth | editor-first=Holger | title=Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and guidelines | journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution | volume=8 | issue=8 | date=20 December 2016 | issn=2041-210X | doi=10.1111/2041-210x.12707 | pages=918–931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Zuk | first=Marlene | last2=Garcia-Gonzalez | first2=Francisco | last3=Herberstein | first3=Marie Elisabeth | last4=Simmons | first4=Leigh W. | title=Model Systems, Taxonomic Bias, and Sexual Selection: Beyond Drosophila | journal=Annual Review of Entomology | volume=59 | issue=1 | date=7 January 2014 | issn=0066-4170 | doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-011613-162014 | pmid=24160422 | pages=321–338 | hdl=10261/90632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicting evidence ==
Recently, DNA testing has permitted more detailed investigation of mating behavior in numerous species. The results, in many cases, have been cited as evidence against Bateman's principle.&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TangMartinez2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tang-Martínez | first=Zuleyma | title=Rethinking Bateman's Principles: Challenging Persistent Myths of Sexually Reluctant Females and Promiscuous Males | journal=The Journal of Sex Research | volume=53 | issue=4–5 | date=13 April 2016 | issn=0022-4499 | doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1150938 | pmid=27074147 | pages=532–559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incompatibility with other sex difference claims ==
There are a number of claims about sex differences in humans said by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] to be well supported that are not logically predicted by Bateman's principle. One example that have been pointed out is [[language]] ability that is said to be more developed in women than in men. It is argued that language, being a [[origin of language|derived human trait]], is not predicted by a model that assumes males to be more selected than females to be present to a higher degree in women than in men but the opposite. The objection about a trade-off between [[spatial ability]] and language is found lacking due to the existence of animals that outperform humans on spatial tasks such as [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] and [[bat]]s while having much smaller and more rapidly maturing brains than humans, while [[great ape language]] is limited and ungrammatical at best despite great apes being much closer to humans in brain capacity than bats or birds of prey are, showing that the system requirements for spatial ability are much lower than those for language and therefore not a serious trade-off for them. The generalization of Bateman's principle to societies lacking modern [[birth control]] is also argued to be incompatible with such generalization of the "nuns more successful at [[celibacy]] than monks" clause of the female [[erotic plasticity]] model, as absence of modern contraceptives would mean that absence of reproduction for many men required that many men had no sexual relationships with women while male sexual exclusivity to a particular gender, if present, would have precluded same-sex relationships as a form of non-celibacy for men who could not find a female mate as well. It is also mentioned that the evolutionary psychologists themselves claim that women are sexually picky due to an evolutionary history without modern contraception, while it is pointed out that the notion of celibacy being impossible for men in general with only a small number of individual exceptions is incompatible with the notion of evolution making celibacy inevitable for a significant percentage of men.&lt;ref&gt;PD Lorch, L Bussière, DT Gwynne (2008) "Quantifying the potential for sexual dimorphism using upper limits on Bateman gradients"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Ah-King, I Ahnesjö - Evolutionary biology (2013) "The “sex role” concept: an overview and evaluation"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-role reversed species ==
The most well-known exceptions to Bateman's principle are the existence of sex-role reversed species such as pipefish ([[seahorse]]s), [[phalarope]]s and [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s in which the males perform the majority of the parental care, and are cryptic while the females are highly ornamented and territorially aggressive ({{Harvcolnb|Emlen|Oring|1977}}; {{Harvcolnb|Knowlton|1982}}; {{Harvcolnb|Berglund|Widemo|Rosenqvist|2005}}). 

In these species, however, the typical fundamental sex differences are reversed: females have a faster reproductive rate than males (and thus greater reproductive variance), and males have greater assurance of genetic parentage than do females {{Harv|Flinn|2004}}. Consequently, reversals in sex roles and reproductive variance are consistent with Bateman's principle, and with Robert Trivers's [[parental investment]] theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Climate resilience''' can be generally defined as the capacity for a [[socio-ecological system]] to: (1) absorb stresses and maintain function in the face of external stresses imposed upon it by [[climate change]] and (2) adapt, reorganize, and evolve into more desirable configurations that improve the [[sustainability]] of the system, leaving it better prepared for future climate change impacts.

With the rising awareness of climate change impacts by both national and international bodies, building climate resilience has become a major goal for these institutions. The key focus of climate resilience efforts is to address the vulnerability that communities, states, and countries currently have with regards to the environmental consequences of climate change. Currently, climate resilience efforts encompass social, economic, technological, and political strategies that are being implemented at all scales of society. From local community action to global treaties, addressing climate resilience is becoming a priority, although it could be argued that a significant amount of the theory has yet to be translated into practice. Despite this, there is a robust and ever-growing movement fueled by local  and national bodies alike geared towards building and improving climate resilience.

== Introduction==

=== Definition of climate resilience===
In actuality, there is still a great deal of abstract discussion and debate regarding a number of subtle nuances associated with the precise definition of the climate resilience perspective, such as its relation to [[climate change adaptation]], the extent to which it should encompass actor-based versus systems-based approaches to improving stability, and its relationship with the [[balance of nature]] theory or [[homeostatic]] equilibrium view of ecological systems. 
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
Currently, the majority of work regarding climate resilience has been centered around examining the capacity for social-ecological systems to sustain shocks and maintain the integrity of functional relationships in the face of external forces. However, there is a growing consensus in academic literature which argues that greater attention needs to be focused on investigating the other critical aspect of climate resilience, which is the capacity for social-ecological systems to renew and develop, and to utilize disturbances as opportunities for innovation and evolution of new pathways that improve the system’s ability to adapt to macroscopic changes.
&lt;ref name="folke"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="tomkins"&gt;Tompkins, Emma L., and W. Neil Adger. 2004. "Does Adaptive Management of Natural Resources Enhance Resilience to Climate Change?" Ecology &amp; Society. http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/202863/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|last2=Yamagata|first2=Yoshiki|title=Principles and criteria for assessing urban energy resilience: A literature review|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=July 2016|volume=60|pages=1654–1677|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=A critical review of selected tools for assessing community resilience|journal=Ecological Indicators|date=October 2016|volume=69|pages=629–647|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.05.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate resilience vs. climate adaptation===

The fact that climate resilience encompasses a dual function, to absorb shock as well as to self-renew, is the primary means by which it can be differentiated from the concept of climate adaptation. In general, [[adaptation]] is viewed as a group of processes and actions that help a system absorb changes that have already occurred, or may be predicted to occur in the future. For the specific case of environmental change and climate adaptation, it is argued by many that adaptation should be defined strictly as encompassing only active decision-making processes and actions - in other words, deliberate changes made in response to climate change.
&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
Of course, this characterization is highly debatable: after all, adaptation can also be used to describe natural, involuntary processes by which [[organisms]], [[populations]], [[ecosystems]] and perhaps even social-ecological systems evolve after the application of certain external stresses. However, for the purposes of differentiating climate adaptation and climate resilience from a policymaking standpoint, we can contrast the active, actor-centric notion of adaptation with resilience, which would be a more systems-based approach to building social-ecological networks that are inherently capable of not only absorbing change, but utilizing those changes to develop into more efficient configurations.

===Inter-connectivity between climate resilience, climate change, adaptability, and vulnerability===
[[File:Climate Resilience Model.PNG|thumb|A graphic displaying the inter-connectivity between climate change, adaptability, vulnerability, and resilience.]]
A conversation about climate resilience is incomplete without also incorporating the concepts of adaptations, vulnerability, and [[global warming|climate change]]. If the definition of resiliency is the ability to recover from a negative event, in this case climate change, then talking about preparations beforehand and strategies for recovery (aka adaptations), as well as populations that are more less capable of developing and implementing a resiliency strategy (aka vulnerable populations) are essential. This is framed under the assumed detrimental impacts of climate change to ecosystems and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref&gt;Smit, Barry, and Johanna Wandel. "Adaptation, adaptive capacity and vulnerability." Global environmental change 16.3 (2006): 282-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical overview of climate resilience===

Climate resilience is a relatively novel concept that is still in the process of being established by academia and policymaking institutions. However, the theoretical basis for many of the ideas central to climate resilience have actually existed since the 1960s. Originally an idea defined for strictly ecological systems, [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] was initially outlined by C.S. Holling as the capacity for ecological systems and relationships within those systems to persist and absorb changes to “state variables, driving variables, and parameters.”
&lt;ref name="holling"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holling | first1 = CS | year = 1973| title = Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.04.110173.000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition helped form the foundation for the notion of ecological [[Island biogeography|equilibrium]]: the idea that the behavior of natural ecosystems is dictated by a homeostatic drive towards some stable set point. Under this school of thought (which maintained quite a dominant status during this time period), ecosystems were perceived to respond to disturbances largely through [[negative feedback]] systems – if there is a change, the ecosystem would act to mitigate that change as much as possible and attempt to return to its prior state. However, the idea of resilience began evolving relatively quickly in the coming years.

As greater amounts of scientific research in ecological adaptation and natural resource management was conducted, it became clear that oftentimes, natural systems were subjected to dynamic, transient behaviors that changed how they reacted to significant changes in state variables: rather than work back towards a predetermined equilibrium, the absorbed change was harnessed to establish a new baseline to operate under.  Rather than minimizes imposed changes, ecosystems could integrate and manage those changes, and use them fuel the evolution of novel characteristics. This new perspective of resilience as a concept that inherently works synergistically with elements of [[uncertainty]] and [[entropy]] first began to facilitate changes in the field of [[adaptive management]] and environmental resources, through work whose basis was built by Holling and colleagues yet again.
&lt;ref name="folke" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="schoon"&gt;Schoon, M. (2005, 2 21). A short historical overview of the concepts of resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation . Retrieved from http://michaelschoon.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/historical_critique-of-resilience-working-paper.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1970s, resilience began gaining momentum as an idea in [[anthropology]], [[culture theory]], and other [[social sciences]]. Even more compelling is the fact that there was significant work in these relatively non-traditional fields that helped facilitate the evolution of the resilience perspective as a whole. Part of the reason resilience began moving away from an equilibrium-centric view and towards a more flexible, malleable description of social-ecological systems was due to work such as that of Andrew Vayda and [[Bonnie McCay]] in the field of social anthropology, where more modern versions of resilience were deployed to challenge traditional ideals of cultural dynamics.
&lt;ref name="vayda"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vayda | first1 = Andrew P. | authorlink2 = Bonnie McCay | last2 = McCay | first2 = Bonnie J. | year = 1975 | title = New Directions in Ecology and Ecological Anthropology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 293–306 | doi=10.1146/annurev.an.04.100175.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually by the late 1980s and early 1990s, resilience had fundamentally changed as a theoretical framework. Not only was it now applicable to social-ecological systems, but more importantly, resilience now incorporated and emphasized ideas of management, integration, and utilization of change rather than simply describing reactions to change. Resilience was no longer just about absorbing shocks, but also about harnessing the changes triggered by external stresses to catalyze the evolution the social-ecological system in question.

As the issues of [[global warming]] and climate change have gained traction and become more prominent since the early 1990s, the question of climate resilience has also emerged. Considering the global implications of the impacts induced by climate change, climate resilience has become a critical concept that scientific institutions, policymakers, governments, and international organizations have begun to rally around as a framework for designing the solutions that will be needed to address the [[effects of global warming]].

==Climate resilience and environmental justice==

=== Applications of a resilience framework: addressing vulnerability===

A climate resilience framework offers a rich plethora of contributions that can improve our understanding of environmental processes, and better equip governments and policymakers to develop sustainable solutions that combat the effects of climate change. To begin with, climate resilience establishes the idea of multi-stable socio-ecological systems. As discussed earlier, resilience originally began as an idea that extended from the stable equilibrium view – systems only acted to return to their pre-existing states when exposed to a disturbance. But with modern interpretations of resilience, it is now established that socio-ecological systems can actually stabilize around a multitude of possible states. Secondly, climate resilience has played a critical role in emphasizing the importance of [[preventive action]] when assessing the effects of climate change. Although adaptation is always going to be a key consideration, making changes after the fact has a limited capability to help communities and nations deal with climate change. By working to build climate resilience, policymakers and governments can take a more comprehensive stance that works to mitigate the harms of global warming impacts before they happen.&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; 
&lt;ref name="tschakert"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tschakert | first1 = P | last2 = Dietrich | first2 = K A | year = 2010 | title = Anticipatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience | url = | journal = Ecology and Society | volume = 15 | issue = | page = 11 | doi=10.5751/es-03335-150211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, a climate resilience perspective encourages greater cross-scale connectedness of systems. Climate change scholars have argued that solely relying on theories of adaptation is also limiting because inherently, this perspective does not necessitate as much full-system cohesion as a resilience perspective would. Creating mechanisms of adaptation that occur in isolation at local, state, or national levels may leave the overall social-ecological system vulnerable. A resilience-based framework would require far more cross-talk, and the creation of environmental protections that are more holistically generated and implemented.

===Vulnerability=== 
Negative impacts of climate change are those that are least capable of developing robust and comprehensive climate resiliency infrastructure and response systems. However what exactly constitutes a vulnerable community is still open to debate. 
The International Panel on Climate Change has defined vulnerability using three characteristics: the “adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure” to the effects of climate change.  The adaptive capacity refers to a community’s capacity to create resiliency infrastructure, while the sensitivity and exposure elements are both tied to economic and geographic elements that vary widely in differing communities. There are, however, many commonalities between vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. McCarthy, O.F. Canziani, N.A. Leary, D.J. Dokken, K.S. White (Eds.), Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into 2 major categories, economic vulnerability, based on [[socioeconomic]] factors, and geographic vulnerability. Neither are mutually exclusive.

====Economic vulnerability====

[[File:GNI PPP Per Capita.png|thumb|World gross national income per capita.]]

At its basic level, a community that is economically vulnerable is one that is ill-prepared for the effects of climate change because it lacks the needed financial resources. Preparing a climate resilient society will require huge investments in infrastructure, city planning, engineering sustainable energy sources, and preparedness systems. From a global perspective, it is more likely that people living at or below poverty will be affected the most by climate change and are thus the most vulnerable, because they will have the least amount of resource dollars to invest in resiliency infrastructure.   They will also have the least amount of resource dollars for cleanup efforts after more frequently occurring natural climate change related disasters.&lt;ref&gt;M.J. Collier et al. "Transitioning to resilience and sustainability in urban communities" Cities 2013. 32:21–S28&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geographic vulnerability====
A second definition of vulnerability relates to geographic vulnerability. The most geographically vulnerable locations to climate change are those that will be impacted by side effects of natural hazards, such as rising sea levels and by dramatic changes in ecosystem services, including access to food.  Island nations are usually noted as more vulnerable but communities that rely heavily on a sustenance based lifestyle are also at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;K. Hewitt (Ed.), Interpretations of Calamity for the Viewpoint of Human Ecology, Allen and Unwin, Boston (1983), pp. 231–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abaco Islands 15ft 4p572 shaded.png|thumb|Abaco Islands- An example of a low elevation island community likely to be impacted by rising sea level associated with changing climate.]]

Roger E. Kasperson and Jeanne X. Kasperson of the Stockholm Environmental Institute compiled a list of vulnerable communities as having one or more of these characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Kasperson, Roger E., and Jeanne X. Kasperson. Climate change, vulnerability, and social justice. Stockholm: Stockholm Environment Institute, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*food insecure 
*water scarce
*delicate marine ecosystem 
*fish dependent
*small island community

===Vulnerability and equity:  environmental justice and climate justice===
Equity is another essential component of vulnerability and is closely tied to issues of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]].   Who participates in and who has access to climate resiliency services and infrastructure are more than likely going to fall along historically unequitable patterns of distribution.  As the most vulnerable communities are likely to be the most heavily impacted, a [[climate justice]] movement is coalescing in response. There are many aspects of climate justice that relate to resiliency and many climate justice advocates argue that justice should be an essential component of resiliency strategies.  
Similar frameworks that have been applied to the [[Climate Justice]] movement can be utilized to address some of these equity issues.  The frameworks are similar to other types of justice movements and include- contractariansim which attempts to allocate the most benefits for the poor, utilitarianism which seeks to find the most benefits for the most people, egalitarianism which attempts to reduce inequality, and libertarianism which emphasizes a fair share of burden but also individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, F. (2000). Environmental justice analysis: Theories, methods and practice. Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act for Climate Justice Campaign [http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/] has defined climate justice as “a vision to dissolve and alleviate the unequal burdens created by climate change. As a form of environmental justice, climate justice is the fair treatment of all people and freedom from discrimination with the creation of policies and projects that address climate change and the systems that create climate change and perpetuate discrimination”.&lt;ref&gt;Act for Climate Justice. (February 2014)  What Is Climate Justice.  Retrieved from http://www.actforclimatejustice.org/about/what-is-climate-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate Justice can incorporate both grassroots as well as international and national level organizing movements.

====Local level issues of equity====
Many indigenous peoples live sustenance based lifestyles, relying heavily on local ecosystem services for their livelihoods. According to some definitions, indigenous peoples are often some of the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and advocating for participation of marginalized groups is one goal of the indigenous people’s climate justice movement. Climate change will likely dramatically alter local food production capacity, which will impact those people who are more dependent on local food sources and less dependent on global or regional food supplies. The greatest injustice is that people living this type of lifestyle are least likely to have contributed to the causes of global climate change in the first place.  Indigenous peoples movements often involve protests and calling on action from world leaders to address climate change concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Chwala, A. Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength. Climate Connections. State of the World. (2009). 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another local level climate justice movement is the adaptation finance approach  which has been found in some studies to be a positive solution by providing resource dollars directly to communities in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = Sam | year = 2013 | title = Local Level Climate Justice? Adaptation Finance and Vulnerability Reduction | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 1819–29 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====International and national climate justice ====
The [[carbon market]] approach is one international and national concept proposed that tries to solve the issue by using market forces to make carbon use less affordable, but vulnerable host communities that are the intended beneficiaries have been found to receive little to no benefit.&lt;ref name="Mather"&gt;Mathur, Vivek N., et al. "Experiences of Host Communities with Carbon Market Projects: Towards Multi-Level Climate Justice." Climate Policy 14.1 (2014): 42-62. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  One problem noted with the carbon market approach is the inherent conflict of interest embedded between developed and sustenance based communities.  Developed nations that have often prioritized growth of their own [[gross national product]] over implementing changes that would address climate change concerns by taxing carbon which might damage GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Towers | first1 = G | year = 2000 | title = Applying the political geography of scale: Grassroots strategies and environmental justice | url = | journal = Professional Geographer | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 23–36 | doi=10.1111/0033-0124.00202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the pace of change necessary to implement a carbon market approach is too slow to be effective at most international and national policy levels.&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;

Alternatively, a study by V.N Mather, et al. proposes a multi-level approach that focuses on addressing some primary issues concerning climate justice at local and international levels.  The approach includes:&lt;ref name="Mather"/&gt;
*developing the capacity for a carbon market approach
*focusing on power dynamics within local and regional government
*managing businesses in regard to carbon practices
*special attention given to developing countries

====Climate justice, environmental justice, and the United States====

The issue of [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]] is relevant within the United States because historically communities of color and low socioeconomic communities have been under served and underrepresented in terms of distribution and participation.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of color, environmental justice, and ecofeminism."Ecofeminism: Women, culture, nature (1997): 38-81&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of “by and for whom” resiliency strategies are targeted and implemented is of great concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friend | first1 = R. | last2 = Moench | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = What is the purpose of urban climate resilience? Implications for addressing poverty and vulnerability | url = | journal = Urban Climate | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 98–113 | doi=10.1016/j.uclim.2013.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inadequate response and resiliency strategies to recent natural disasters in communities of color, such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], are examples of environmental injustices and inadequate resilience strategies in already vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cutter | first1 = Susan L.|author1-link= Susan Cutter | last2 = Emrich | first2 = Christopher T. | last3 = Mitchell | first3 = Jerry T. | last4 = Boruff | first4 = Bryan J. | last5 = Gall | first5 = Melanie | last6 = Schmidtlein | first6 = Mathew C. | last7 = Burton | first7 = Christopher G. | last8 = Melton | first8 = Ginni | year = 2006 | title = The Long Road Home: Race, Class, and Recovery from Hurricane Katrina | url = | journal = Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 8–20 | doi = 10.3200/ENVT.48.2.8-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Orleans USACE-17th Canal-A-09-04-05 0004.JPG|thumb|New Orleans post Hurricane Katrina levee damage.]]

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People[[NAACP]] has recently begun a Climate Justice campaign&lt;ref name=NAACP&gt;[http://www.naacp.org/programs/entry/climate-justice Climate Justice: NAACP]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to  events such as Hurricane Katrina and in preparation for future climate change related natural disasters.  The goal of this campaign is to address the 3 R’s of climate justice: resilience, resistance, and revisioning.   The NAACP’s climate justice initiative will address climate resilience through advocacy, outreach, political actions, research and education.&lt;ref name=NAACP/&gt;

=====Climate gap=====

Another concept important for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the [[climate gap]].  The climate gap is the inequitably negative impact on poor people and people of color due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience [[urban heat island]] effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color.  Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing [[carbon emissions]] with the emphasis of reductions in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] and toxic [[air pollution]] in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers.  Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, preparedness planning for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that are most likely to be impacted, investing in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.&lt;ref name= "Schonkoff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shonkoff | first1 = Seth B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2011 | title = The climate gap: environmental health and equity implications of climate change and mitigation policies in California—a review of the literature | url = http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 485–503 | doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical foundations for building climate resilience==
As the threat of environmental disturbances due to [[climate change]] becomes more and more relevant, so does the need for strategies to build a more resilient society. As climate resiliency literature has revealed, there are different strategies and suggestions that all work towards the overarching goal of building and maintaining societal resiliency.

===Urban resilience===
There is increasing concern on an international level with regards to addressing and combating the impending implications of [[climate change]] for urban areas, where populations of these cities around the world are growing disproportionately high. There is even more concern for the rapidly growing urban centers in developing countries, where the majority of urban inhabitants are poor or “otherwise vulnerable to climate-related disturbances.”&lt;ref name=Moench&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moench | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Tyler | first2 = Stephen | year = 2012 | title = A Framework for Urban Climate Resilience | url = | journal = Climate and Development | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Urban centers around the world house important societal and economic sectors, so resiliency framework has been augmented to specifically include and focus on protecting these urban systems.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) defines resilience as “the ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning, the capacity of self-organization, and the capacity to adapt to stress and change.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  One of the most important notions emphasized in urban resiliency theory is the need for urban systems to increase their capacity to absorb environmental disturbances. By focusing on three generalizable elements of the resiliency movement, Tyler and Moench’s urban resiliency framework serves as a model that can be implemented for local planning on an international scale.

The first element of urban climate resiliency focuses on “systems’ or the physical infrastructure embedded in urban systems. A critical concern of urban resiliency is linked to the idea of maintaining support systems that in turn enable the networks of provisioning and exchange for populations in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  These systems concern both physical infrastructure in the city and ecosystems within or surrounding the urban center; while working to provide essential services like food production, flood control, or runoff management.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  For example, city electricity, a necessity of urban life, depends on the performance of generators, grids, and distant reservoirs. The failure of these core systems jeopardizes human well-being in these urban areas, with that being said, it is crucial to maintain them in the face of impending environmental disturbances. Societies need to build resiliency into these systems in order to achieve such a feat. Resilient systems work to “ensure that functionality is retained and can be re-instated through system linkages”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt; despite some failures or operational disturbances. Ensuring the functionality of these important systems is achieved through instilling and maintaining flexibility in the presence of a “safe failure.”&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Resilient systems achieve flexibility by making sure that key functions are distributed in a way that they would not all be affected by a given event at one time, what is often referred to as spatial diversity, and has multiple methods for meeting a given need, what is often referred to as functional diversity.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  The presence of safe failures also plays a critical role in maintaining these systems, which work by absorbing sudden shocks that may even exceed design thresholds.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Environmental disturbances are certainly expected to challenge the dexterity of these systems, so the presence of safe failures almost certainly appears to be a necessity.

Further, another important component of these systems is bounce-back ability. In the instance where dangerous climatic events affect these urban centers, recovering or "bouncing-back" is of great importance. In fact, in most disaster studies, urban resilience is often defined as "the capacity of a city to rebound from destruction." This idea of bounce-back for urban systems is also engrained in governmental literature of the same topic. For example, the former government's first Intelligence and Security Coordinator of the United States described urban resilience as "the capacity to absorb shocks and to bounce back into functioning shape, or at the least, sufficient resilience to prevent...system collapse." Keeping these quotations in mind, bounce-back discourse has been and should continue to be an important part of urban climate resiliency framework.&lt;ref&gt;Coaffee, Jon. "Towards Next-Generation Urban Resilience in Planning Practice: From Securitization to Integrated Place Making." Planning Practice and Research 28:3. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists have critiqued this idea of bounce-back, citing this as privileging the status quo, rather advocating the notion of ‘bouncing forward’, permitting system evolution and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the ‘business as usual’ paradox|url = http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 0263774X15602022|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|language = en|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next element of urban climate resiliency focuses on the social agents (also described as social actors) present in urban centers. Many of these agents depend on the urban centers for their very existence, so they share a common interest of working towards protecting and maintaining their urban surroundings.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Agents in urban centers have the capacity to deliberate and rationally make decisions, which plays an important role in climate resiliency theory. One cannot overlook the role of local governments and community organizations, which will be forced to make key decisions with regards to organizing and delivering key services and plans for combating the impending effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Perhaps most importantly, these social agents must increase their capacities with regards to the notions of “resourcefulness and responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Responsiveness refers to the capacity of social actors and groups to organize and re-organize, as well as the ability to anticipate and plan for disruptive events. Resourcefulness refers to the capacity of social actors in urban centers to mobilize varying assets and resources in order to take action.&lt;ref name=Moench/&gt;  Urban centers will be able to better fend for themselves in the heat of climatic disturbances when responsiveness and resourcefulness is collectively achieved in an effective manner.

The final component of urban climate resiliency concerns the social and political institutions present in urban environments. Governance, the process of decision making, is a critical element affecting climate resiliency. As climate justice has revealed, the individual areas and countries that are least responsible for the phenomenon of climate change are also the ones who are going to be most negatively affected by future environmental disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Timmons | year = 2009 | title = The International Dimension of Climate Justice and the Need for International Adaptation Funding | url = | journal = Environmental Justice | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true in urban centers. Those who are most responsible for climate change are going to disproportionately feel the negative effects of climatic disturbances when compared to their poorer, more vulnerable counterparts in society. Just like the wealthier countries have worked to create the most pollution, the wealthier subpopulations of society who can afford carbon-emitting luxuries like cars and homes undoubtedly produce a much more significant carbon footprint. It is also important to note that these more vulnerable populations, because of their inferior social statuses, are unable to participate in the decision-making processes with regards to these issues. Decision-making processes must be augmented to be more participatory and inclusive, allowing those individuals and groups most affected by environmental disturbances to play an active role in determining how to best avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lebel | first1 = L. | last2 = Anderies | first2 = J.

Individual communities who have access to timely information with regards to hazards are better able to respond to these threats.&lt;ref&gt;Satterthwaite, D., Huq, S., Pelling, M., Reid, H., &amp; Lankao, P.R. (2007). Adapting to Climate Change in Urban Areas: The Possibilities and Constraints in Low- and Middle-Income Nations. International Institute for Environment and Development, Discussion Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resilience===
Global climate change is going to increase the probability of extreme weather events and environmental disturbances around the world, needless to say, future human populations are going to have to confront this issue. Every society around the world differs in its capacity with regards to combating climate change because of certain pre-existing factors such as having the proper monetary and institutional mechanisms in place to execute preparedness and recovery plans. Despite these differences, communities around the world are on a level-playing field with regards to building and maintaining at least some degree “human resilience”.&lt;ref name=Keim&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keim | first1 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Building Human Resilience: The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response As an Adaptation to Climate Change | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.022 | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages=508–516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resilience has two components: that provided by nature, and that provided through human action and interaction. An example of climate resilience provided by nature is the manner in which porous soil more effectively allows for the drainage of flood water than more compact soil. An example of human action that affects climate resilience would be the facilitation of response and recovery procedures by social institutions or organizations. This theory of human resilience largely focuses on the human populations and calls for building towards the overall goal of decreasing human vulnerability in the face of climate change and extreme weather events. Vulnerability to climatic disturbances has two sides: the first deals with the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards, which one can effectively identify as susceptibility. The second side deals with the capacity to recover from disaster consequences, or resilience in other words.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The looming threat of environmental disturbances and extreme weather events certainly calls for some action, and human resiliency theory seeks to solve the issue by largely focusing on decreasing the vulnerability of human populations.

How do human populations work to decrease their vulnerability to impending and dangerous climatic events? Up until recently, the international approach to environmental emergencies focused largely on post-impact activities such as reconstruction and recovery.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  However, the international approach is changing to a more comprehensive risk assessment that includes “pre-impact disaster risk reduction - prevention, preparedness, and mitigation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woodruff | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Climate Change and Human Health: Review of the Evidence | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health | volume = 30 | issue = | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of human resiliency, preparedness can largely be defined as the measures taken in advance to ensure an effective response to the impact of environmental hazards.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  Mitigation, when viewed in this context, refers to the structural and nonstructural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impacts of climatic disturbances.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  This is not to be confused to mitigation with regards to the overall topic of climate change, which refers to reduction of carbon or greenhouse emissions. By accounting for these impending climate disasters both before and after the occur, human populations are able to decrease their vulnerability to these disturbances.

A major element of building and maintaining human resilience is public health.&lt;ref name=Keim/&gt;  The institution of public health as a whole is uniquely placed at the community level to foster human resilience to climate-related disturbances. As an institution, public health can play an active part in reducing human vulnerability by promoting “healthy people and healthy homes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Srinivasan | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Creating Healthy Communities, Healthy Homes, Healthy People: Initiating a Research Agenda on the Built Environment and Public Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = | year = 2003 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1446 | pages=1446–1450| pmc = 1447991}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Healthy people are less likely to suffer from disaster-related mortality and are therefore viewed as more disaster-resilient. Healthy homes are designed and built to maintain its structure and withstand extreme climate events. By merely focusing on the individual health of populations and assuring the durability of the homes that house these populations, at least some degree human resiliency towards climate change can be achieved.

==Climate resilience in practice==
The building of climate resilience is a highly comprehensive undertaking that involves of an eclectic array of actors and agents: individuals, [[community organizations]], micropolitical bodies, [[corporations]], [[governments]] at local, state, and national levels as well as [[international organizations]]. In essence, actions that bolster climate resilience are ones that will enhance the adaptive capacity of social, industrial, and environmental infrastructures that can mitigate the effects of climate change.
&lt;ref name="adger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adger | first1 = W. N. | last2 = Arnell | first2 = N. W. | last3 = Tompkins | first3 = E. L. | year = 2005 | title = Successful adaptation to climate change across scales | url = | journal = Global Environmental Change | volume =  15| issue = | pages =  77–86| doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2004.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, research indicates that the strongest indicator of successful climate resilience efforts at all scales is a well-developed, pre-existing network of social, political, economic and financial institutions that is already positioned to effectively take on the work of identifying and addressing the risks posed by climate change. Cities, states, and nations that have already developed such networks are, as expected, to generally have far higher net incomes and GDP. 
&lt;ref name="sather"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Satterthwaite | first1 = D | year = 2013 | title = The political underpinnings of cities' accumulated resilience to climate change | url = | journal = Environment and Urbanization | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 381–391 | doi = 10.1177/0956247813500902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it can be seen that embedded within the task of building climate resilience at any scale will be the overcoming of macroscopic [[socioeconomic]] inequities: in many ways, truly facilitating the construction of climate resilient communities worldwide will require national and international agencies to address issues of global [[poverty]], [[industrial development]], and [[food justice]]. However, this does not mean that actions to improve climate resilience cannot be taken in real time at all levels, although evidence suggests that the most climate resilient cities and nations have accumulated this resilience through their responses to previous weather-based disasters. Perhaps even more importantly, empirical evidence suggests that the creation of the climate resilient structures is dependent upon an array of social and environmental reforms that were only successfully passed due to the presence of certain sociopolitical structures such as [[democracy]], activist movements, and [[decentralization]] of government.
&lt;ref name="berkhout"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berkhout | first1 = Frans | last2 = Hertin | first2 = Julia | last3 = Gann | first3 = David M. | year = 2006 | title = Learning to Adapt: Organisational Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts | url = | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 135–56 | doi=10.1007/s10584-006-9089-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Thus it can be seen that to build climate resilience one must work within a network of related social and economic decisions that can have adverse effects on the success of a resilience effort given the competing interests participating in the discussion. Given this, it is clear that the social and economic scale play a vital role in shaping the [[feasibility study|feasibility]], [[cost]]s, empirical success, and [[efficiency]] of climate resilience initiatives. There is a wide variety of actions that can be pursued to improve climate resilience at multiple scales – the following subsections we will review a series of illustrative case studies and strategies from a broad diversity of societal contexts that are currently being implemented to strengthen climate resilience.

===Local and community level===

====Housing and workplace conditions====

[[File:Housing, Kenya 2006. Photo- AusAID (10704025714).jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Improving housing conditions in Kenya is a prime target for local climate resilience efforts]]

[[Housing inequality]] is directly related to the ability for individuals and communities to sustain adverse impacts brought on by extreme weather events that are triggered by climate change, such as severe winds, storms, and flooding. Especially for communities in developing nations and the Third World, the integrity of housing structures is one of the most significant sources of vulnerability currently. 
&lt;ref name="mertz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mertz | first1 = Ole | last2 = Halsnaes | first2 = Kirsten | last3 = Olesen | first3 = Jørgen E | last4 = Rasmussen | first4 = Kjeld | year = 2009 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change in Developing Countries | url = | journal = Environmental management | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1007/s00267-008-9259-3| bibcode = 2009EnMan..43..743M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in more developed nations such as the US, there are still multitudes of socioeconomically disadvantaged areas where outdated housing infrastructure is estimated to provide poor climate resilience at best, as well as numerous negative health outcomes.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

Efforts to improve the resiliency of housing and workplace buildings involves not only fortifying these buildings through use of updated materials and foundation, but also establishing better standards that ensure safer and health conditions for occupants. Better housing standards are in the course of being established through calls for sufficient space, natural lighting, provision for heating or cooling, insulation, and ventilation. Another major issue faced more commonly by communities in the [[Third World]] are highly disorganized and inconsistently enforced housing rights systems. In countries such as [[Kenya]] and [[Nicaragua]], local [[militias]] or corrupted government bodies that have reserved the right to seizure of any housing properties as needed: the end result is the degradation of any ability for citizens to develop climate resilient housing – without property rights for their own homes, the people are powerless to make changes to their housing situation without facing potentially harmful consequences.

====Grassroots community organizing and micropolitical action====

Modern climate resilience scholars have noted that contrary to conventional beliefs, the communities that have been most effective in establishing high levels of climate resilience have actually done so through “bottom-up” political pressures. “Top-down” approaches involving state or federal level decisions have empirically been marred with dysfunction across different levels of government due to internal mismanagement and political gridlock.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="berkhout" /&gt; As a result, in many ways it is being found that the most efficient responses to climate change have actually been initiated and mobilized at local levels. Particularly compelling has been the ability of bottom-up pressures from local civil society to fuel the creation of micropolitical institutions that have compartmentalized the tasks necessary for building climate resilience. For example, the city of [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] has developed a robust network of micropolitical agencies all dedicated to building resilience in specific industrial sectors: [[transportation]], workplace conditions, emergency shelters, and more.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;
Due to their compact size, local level micropolitical bodies can act quickly without much stagnation and resistance from larger special interests that can generate bureaucratic dysfunction at higher levels of government.

====Low-cost engineering solutions====
Equally important to building climate resilience has been the wide array of basic technological solutions have been developed and implemented at community levels. In developing countries such as [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]], the construction of [[concrete]] “breaker” walls and concentrated use of sandbags in key areas such as housing entrances and doorways has improved the ability of communities to sustain the damages yielded by extreme weather events. Additional strategies have included digging homemade drainage systems to protect local infrastructure of extensive water damage and flooding. 
&lt;ref name="mertz" /&gt;

[[File:Delhi Aerial View, Satellite Image, India September 2003.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text|An aerial view of Dehli, India where urban forests are being developed to improve the weather resistance and climate resilience of the city]]

In more urban areas, construction of a “[[green belt]]” on the peripheries of cities has become increasingly common. Green belts are being used as means of improving climate resilience – in addition to provide natural air filtering, these belts of trees have proven to be a healthier and sustainable means of mitigating the damages created by heavy winds and storms.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oak"&gt;adaptOakland. "CA Proposition 84 Urban Greening Planning Grant for Adapt Oakland." Web. 12 Mar 2014. {{cite web |url=http://adaptoakland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2PageLongProjectBrief- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140409072046/http://adaptoakland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2PageLongProjectBrief- |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}ForYouToKnow.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and national level===
{{Missing information|section=yes|Dominica's new goal to become the world's first climate resilient nation|date=March 2018}}
====Infrastructural development disaster preparedness protocols====

At larger governmental levels, general programs to improve climate resiliency through greater [[disaster]] preparedness are being implemented. For example, in cases such as [[Norway]], this includes the development of more sensitive and far-reaching early warning systems for extreme weather events, creation of emergency [[electricity]] power sources, enhanced public transportation systems, and more. 
&lt;ref name ="obrien"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = Karen | last2 = Eriksen | first2 = Siri | last3 = Sygna | first3 = Linda | last4 = Otto Naess | first4 = Lars | year = 2006 | title = Questioning Complacency: Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation in Norway | url = | journal = Ambio | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 50–56 | doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2006)35[50:qccciv]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To examine another case study, the state [[California]] in the US has been pursuing more comprehensive federal financial aid systems for communities afflicted by natural disaster, spurred in part by the large amounts of criticism that was placed on the US federal government after what was perceived by many to be a mishandling of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief.

Additionally, a key focus of action at state and federal levels is in improving water management infrastructure and access. Strategies include the creation of [[emergency]] drinking water supplies, stronger [[sanitation]] technology and standards, as well as more extensive and efficient networks of water delivery.

====Social services====

Climate resilience literature has also noted that one of the more indirect sources of resilience actually lies in the strength of the [[social services]] and [[social safety net]] that is provided for citizens by public institutions. This is an especially critical aspect of climate resilience in more socioeconomically disadvantaged communities, cities, and nations. It has been empirically found that places with stronger systems of [[social security]] and [[pensions]] oftentimes have better climate resiliency.
&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt; This is reasoning in the following manner: first of all, better social services for citizens translates to better access to [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[life insurance]], and emergency services. Secondly, stronger systems of social services also generally increase the overall ownership of relevant economic assets that are correlated with better quality of life such as savings, house ownership, and more. Nations where residents are on more stable economic footing are in situations where there is a far higher incentive for private investment into climate resilience efforts.&lt;ref name="sather" /&gt;

===Global level===

====International treaties====

At the global level, most action towards climate resilience has been manifested in the signing of international agreements that set up guidelines and frameworks to address the impacts of climate change. Notable examples include the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the UNFCCC, and the 2010 Cancun Agreement.&lt;ref name="unfcc"&gt;
Unfccc. 2007. "Climate Change: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation in Developing Countries." United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 68. http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/impacts.pdf.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, as is the case with the Kyoto Protocol for example, these international treaties involve placing legally binding requirements on participant nations to reduce processes that contribute to global warming such as greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prins | first1 = Gwyn | year = 2011 | title = Climate Change: Beyond Kyoto | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 474 | issue = | pages = 576–77 | doi=10.1038/474576a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rabe | first1 = Barry G | year = 2007 | title = Beyond Kyoto: Climate Change Policy in Multilevel Governance Systems | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0491.2007.00365.x | journal = Governance | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 423–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In other cases, such as the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Cancun, proposals for the creation of international funding pools to assist developing nations in combating climate change are seen.&lt;ref name="raj"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rajamani | first1 = Lavanya | year = 2011 | title = The Cancun Climate Agreements: Reading the Text, Subtext and Tea Leaves | url = | journal = International and Comparative Law Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 499–519 | doi=10.1017/s0020589311000078}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, that enforcement of any of the requirements or principles that are established in such international treaties has ambiguous: for example, although the 2010 Cancun conference called for the creation of a 100 billion dollar “Green Climate Fund” for developing nations, if and how this fund will actually be created still remains unclear.&lt;ref name="ober"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oberthür | first1 = Sebastian | year = 2011 | title = Global Climate Governance after Cancun: Options for EU Leadership | url = | journal = The International Spectator | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 5–13 | doi=10.1080/03932729.2011.567900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===
As the looming threat of [[climate change]] and environmental disturbances becomes more and more immediate, so does the need for policy to combat the issue. As a relatively new phenomenon, climate change has yet to receive the political attention it deserves. However, the climate justice and [[climate change]] movements are gaining momentum on an international scale as both grass roots campaigns and supranational organizations begin to gain influence.&lt;ref&gt;Chawla, Ambika, “Climate Justice Movements Gather Strength,” WorldWatch, State of the World. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most significant and impacting changes come from national and state governments around the world, as they have the political and monetary power to more effectively enforce their proposals.

====United States (as a country)====
As it stands today, there is no country-wide legislation with regards to the topic of climate resiliency in the United States. However, in mid February 2014, President [[Barack Obama]] announced his plan to propose a $1 billion “Climate Resilience Fund”.&lt;ref name=News&gt;Malakoff, David. "Obama to Propose $1 Billion Climate Resilience Fund." Sciencemag.org. http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/02/obama-propose-1-billion-climate-resilience-fund. 15, February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The details of exactly what the fund will seek to accomplish are vague since the fund is only in the stage of being proposed for Congress’s approval in 2015. However, in the speech given the day of the announcement of this proposal, Obama claimed he will request “...new funding for new technologies to help communities prepare for a changing climate, set up incentives to build smarter, more resilient infrastructure. And finally, my administration will work with tech innovators and launch new challenges under our [[Climate Data Initiative]], focused initially on rising sea levels and their impact on the coasts, but ultimately focused on how all these changes in weather patterns are going to have an impact up and down the United States - not just on the coast but inland as well - and how do we start preparing for that.”&lt;ref name=News/&gt;  Obama’s fund incorporates facets of both urban resiliency and human resiliency theories, by necessarily improving communal infrastructure and by focusing on societal preparation to decrease the country’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.

====Phoenix, Arizona====
Phoenix’s large population and extremely dry climate make the city particularly vulnerable to the threats of drought and extreme heat. However, the city has recently incorporated climate change into current (and future) water management and urban design. And by doing so, [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] has taken steps to ensure sustainable water supplies and to protect populations that are vulnerable to extreme heat, largely through improving the sustainability and efficiency of communal infrastructure. For example, Phoenix uses renewable surface water supplies and reserves groundwater for use during the instance when extended droughts arise. The city is also creating a task force to redesign the downtown core to minimize the way buildings trap heat and increase local temperatures.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;EPA. “Climate Impacts and Adaptation Examples in the Southwest.” http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts-adaptation/southwest-adaptation.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Phoenix skyline Arizona USA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=alt text| The outdated infrastructure pictured here in the Phoenix downtown will be undergoing drastic changes geared towards improvements in efficiency.]]

====Denver, Colorado====
The city of [[Denver]] has made recent strides to combat the threat of extreme wildfires and precipitation events. In the year 1996, a fire burned nearly 12,000 acres around [[Buffalo Creek, Colorado|Buffalo Creek]], which serves as the main source of the city’s water supply. Two months following this devastating wildfire, heavy thunderstorms caused flash floods in the burned area, having the effect of washing sediment into the city’s reservoir. In fact, this event washed more sediment into the reservoir than had accumulated in the 13 years prior. Water treatment costs were estimated to be $20 million over the next decade following the event. Denver needed a plan to make sure that the city would not be devastated by future wildfire and flash flood events. DenverWater and the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region are working together to restore more than 40,000 acres of [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s lands through processes like reforestation, erosion control, and the decommissioning of roads. Further, [[Denver]] has installed sensors in the reservoirs in order to monitor the quality of the water and quantity of debris or sediment. These accomplishments will have the effect of building a more resilient Denver, Colorado towards the impending increase of extreme weather events such as wildfire and flooding.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt;

====China====
[[File:Juncture of three main rivers in Ningbo China.jpg|thumb|right|alt=alt text| Pictured here is the conversion of three large rivers in Ningbo, China. The country is taking substantial measures to combat the flash floods predicted to intensify in the future.]]
[[China]] has been rapidly emerging as a new superpower, rivaling the [[United States]]. As the most populated country in the world, and one of the leaders of the global economy, China’s response to the impending effects of climate change is of great concern for the entire world. A number of significant changes are expected to affect China as the looming threat of [[climate change]] becomes more and more imminent. Here’s just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms. In the country’s [[National Climate Change Policy Program]], one of the goals specifically set out is to enhance the ability to bear the impacts of climate change, as well as to raise the public awareness on climate change. China’s National Climate Change Policy states that it will integrate climate change policies into the national development strategy. In China, this national policy comes in the form of its "Five Year Plans for Economic and Social Development". China’s Five Year Plans serve as the strategic road maps for the country’s development. The goals spelled out in the Five Year Plans are mandatory as government officials are held responsible for meeting the targets.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;King et al. 2012.

University of Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
As the world’s second most populous country, [[India]] is taking action on a number of fronts in order to address [[poverty]], natural resource management, as well as preparing for the inevitable effects of [[climate change]]. India has made significant strides in the energy sector and the country is now a global leader in renewable energy.  In 2011 India achieved a record $10.3 billion (USD) in clean energy investments, which the country is now using to fund solar, wind, and hydropower projects around the country. In 2008, India published its National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which contains several goals for the country. These goals include but are not limited to: covering one third of the country with forests and trees, increasing renewable energy supply to 6% of total energy mix by 2022, and the further maintenance of disaster management. All of the actions work to improve the resiliency of the country as a whole, and this proves to be important because India has an economy closely tied to its natural resource base and climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and forestry.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

In standard [[mathematics]], propositions can typically be considered unambiguously true or false. For instance, the proposition ''zero belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply false; while the proposition ''one belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply true. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be ''more or less'' true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider ''My coffee is hot''.

In [[mathematics]], this idea can be developed in terms of [[fuzzy logic]]. In [[computer science]], it has found application in [[artificial intelligence]]. In [[philosophy]], the idea has proved particularly appealing in the case of [[vagueness]]. Degrees of truth is an important concept in law.

In [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and [[literary theory]], the concepts of '''deictic field''' and '''deictic shift''' are sometimes deployed in the study of narrative media. These terms provide a theoretical framework for helping literary analysts to conceptualize the ways in which readers redirect their attention away from their immediate surroundings as they become immersed in the reality generated by the text.

==Deixis==
The term "[[deixis]]" refers to the ways in which language encodes contextual information into its [[grammatical]] system. More broadly, deixis refers to the inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs.  To understand deixis, one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the "here" and "now" (proximal deixis) from the "then" and "there" (distal deixis). According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of deixis, "When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion-specific considerations."&lt;ref name="MG2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deixis in Narrative: A Cognitive Science Perspective|date=1995|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|isbn=9780203052907|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|pages=19; 59|last1=Galbraith|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of narrative, deixis reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story's characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. "Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Deixis is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.

==Labov's narrative model==
When examining perspectives on narration in [[natural language|natural-language]] environments, one must not ignore [[William Labov]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} who argues that stories of personal experience can be divided into distinct sections, each of which serves a unique function within the narrative progression. Labov schematizes the organization of natural narrative using the following conceptual units: abstract, orientation, complicating action, resolution, evaluation, and coda. Generally, anecdotal narratives tend to arrange these units in the order outlined; however, this is not an inflexible, structural progression that defines how every narrative must develop. For instance, sentences and phrasal items that serve an evaluative function can be interspersed throughout a narrative. Some stretches of narrative discourse also feature overlap among these Labovian categories. Each of Labov's narrative divisions serves a characteristic purpose typified by a particular section's grammatical construction and functional role within the unfolding narrative, but the boundaries of such divisions are not always clear-cut.

As a feature of natural language, deixis is an important element of oral narrative and can be realized in different ways in each of Labov's categories. According to Galbraith, "All language use depends on some felt relevance to situation, on the attention of participants, and their ability to lift out the topic....Like zero in mathematics and the dark space in the theater, deixis orients us within a situation without calling attention to itself".&lt;ref name="MG2" /&gt; Two of Labov's categories that often feature deixis prominently are the "orientation" and the "coda". The orientation typically occurs near the beginning of a narrative and serves to introduce the characters, settings, and events. Given its presentative quality, the orientation shifts the deictic center away from the speaker's here-and-now into the spatiotemporal coordinates of the story, which logically must occur at a time prior to the story's enunciation. The coda occurs toward the end of a narrative and functions as a means of terminating the flow of story events. By doing so, the coda reorients the speakers and listeners out of the story world and back into the communicative present.

== Deictic center ==
The deictic center—sometimes called the "origo" or zero-point—represents the originating source in relation to which deictic expressions gain their context-dependent meaning. Often the deictic center is the speaker: thus, any tokens of "I" in the speaker's discourse must deictically refer back to the speaker as center; likewise, the word "you" must project outward from this center toward the addressee. Any participants not part of this communicative channel will be referred to in the third person. The theory of deixis is therefore egocentric in that the indexical anchorage of deictic expressions is a function of this zero-point of subjectivity. The "I"-center serves as the perceptual vantage point that surveys relations among salient contextual entities and events. Such a center, therefore, determines which deictic expressions are pragmatically licensed by a context that has been naturally delimited through this perceptual and evaluative locus. Thus, the appropriateness of a proximal "this" over a distal "that" is determined by the nearness of an object or a location in relation to the deictic zero-point.

A deictic field contains the range of bounded participants and objects, spatial locations and landmarks, and temporal frames that point back to some deictic center as the source for their pragmatic demarcation. The deictic field radiates out from the deictic center, and the boundaries of such a field enclose the scope of objects, spaces, and events that constitute a set from which deictic expressions might seek out a potential referent. These fields function as cognitive frames that participants in a discourse can use to conceptualize their contextual surroundings in relation to each interlocutor's (alternating) function as deictic center across communicative turns. Within the context of literature, the presence of multiple deictic fields in a text can be fruitfully analyzed using the cognitive principle of deictic shift (discussed below).

== Deictic shift theory ==
Deictic shift theory (DST) refers to a range of immersion processes by which readers imaginatively project hypothetical deictic centers that are anchored to communicative and experiential loci within a narrative. Such cognitive framing, theorists of DST argue, form a necessary part of the reader's involvement in narrative, whereby through a process of frame shifting the reader constructs a story world by interpreting the (deictic) cues instantiated in the text. Deictic shifting can be accomplished in several ways. The most basic shift involves the reader's initial immersion into the world of the story. Here the deictic center moves out of the here-and-now of the reader's physical environment and becomes anchored to some text-internal perceptual or presentative instance, in most cases the deictic center of a character or a narrator. Deictic shifts at the level of narration include those cues that implicate a covert or overt narrator—specifically, story commentary or instances when the narrator refers to himself or herself as an "I." Such instances of commentary and evaluation often reflect the perceptual field, as well as the interpretive and ideological stance, of the narrator as he or she presents the story's events.

Within the world of the story, deictic shifts occur in a number of ways. A fundamental shift occurs when the deictic center moves from one character to another—for instance, in cases of omniscient thought report. Here the reader must adjust the deictic center accordingly and interprets the lens of the current focal window through the experiential subjectivity of the character-locus. Other forms of story-internal deictic shifts involve the cognitive framing associated with embedded narratives and other discourse-types: stories-within-stories, letters in epistolary fiction, diary entries, hypertext ruptures, etc.
  
"Within literary scholarship, it is often noted that first and second person pronouns (and less so, and differently, third) facilitate readerly identification with the textually inscribed position (the position of the character or narrator designated by that pronoun), and evoke a sense of readerly conceptual immersion in the fictional world of the story, contributing to the ways in which the scene is imaginatively 'realized' in the mind of the reader, particularly the perspective from which the scene is conceptually visualized. Cognitive poetics and cognitive narratology have employed deictic shift theory, largely based on the work of Duchan, Bruder and Hewitt, to attempt to offer a cognitive account of how these interpretative effects are created. DST proposes that readers conceptually project to the contextual locus of the speaker of deictic cues in order to comprehend them, offering a model of how the deictic referents determining such contextual coordinates are processed by readers, and how this contributes to readers' conceptualization of the world of the story" (Deictic shifting in literature: Experimental analysis&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;).

== Deixis in narratology ==
Buhler applied the theory of deixis to narratives. He proposed the concept of Zeigfeld, or deictic field, which operates in three modes:&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; the first, ''ad oculos'', "operates in the here-and-now of the speaker's sensible environment;" the second, anaphora, "operates in the context of the discourse itself considered as a structured environment;" and the third, what Buhler calls ''deixis at phantasma'', operates in the context "of imagination and long-term memory."&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Buhler's model attempts "to describe the psychological and physical process whereby the live deictic field of our own bodily orientation and experience" is "transposed into an imaginative construction." According to Buhler, "the body-feeling representation, or Korspertastbild (what psychologists would probably now call the body schema), becomes loosened from its involvement with the HERE//NOW/I deictic coordinates of waking life in our immediate environment, and becomes available to translation into an environment we construct both conceptually and orientationally"; this deictic coordinate system is used "in the constructive environment to orient ourselves within 'the somewhere-realm of pure imagination and the there-and-there in memory'".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

Katie Hamburger, a German narrative theorist, studied and theorized how deictic words are used in literature. In her work ''The Logic of Literature'', she argued that there are two realms of language act: reality statement and fiction (Galbraith, 24-25). Reality statements are by someone and about something.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; "Acts of fictional narration, on the other hand, transfer their referentiality from the actuality of the historical world to the entertained reality of the fictive world, and transfer the subjectivity of the speaker to the subjectivity of the story world characters".&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt; Hamburger argued that this transfer occurs due to the use of deictic adverbs, and psychological verbs.&lt;ref name="MG2"/&gt;

According to [[Rudolf Carnap]], in [[logic]], an interpretation is a '''descriptive interpretation''' (also called a '''factual interpretation''') if at least one of the undefined symbols of its [[formal system]] becomes, in the interpretation, a ''[[descriptive sign]]'' (i.e., the name of single objects, or observable properties).&lt;ref name="itslaia"&gt;[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap, Rudolf]], ''Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications''&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Introduction to Semantics'' (Harvard Uni. Press, 1942) he makes a distinction between formal interpretations which are ''[[logical interpretation]]s'' (also called ''mathematical interpretation'' or ''logico-mathematical interpretation'') and ''descriptive interpretations'': a formal interpretation is a ''descriptive interpretation'' if it is not a ''logical interpretation''.&lt;ref name="itslaia"/&gt;

Attempts to [[Axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[empirical science]]s, Carnap said, use a ''descriptive interpretation'' to model reality.:&lt;ref name="itslaia"/&gt;  the aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] for which [[reality]] is the only interpretation.&lt;ref name="tcarotmim"&gt;The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; - the world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmim"/&gt;

Any non-empty set may be chosen as the domain of a descriptive interpretation, and all n-ary relations among the elements of the domain are candidates for assignment to any predicate of degree n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Examples==

A sentence is either ''true'' or ''false'' under an ''interpretation'' which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments:

'''Individual constants'''
* a: Socrates
* b: Plato
* c: Aristotle
'''Predicates''':
* Fα:  α is sleeping
* Gαβ:  α hates β
* Hαβγ: α made β hit γ

'''Sentential variables:'''
* ''p''  "It is raining."

Under this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:
* ''p'': "It is raining."
* ''F''(''a''): "Socrates is sleeping."
* ''H''(''b'',''a'',''c''):  "Plato made Socrates hit Aristotle."
* {{all}}''x''(''F''(''x'')): "Everybody is sleeping."
* {{exist}}''z''(''G''(''a'',''z'')):  "Socrates hates somebody."
* {{exist}}''x''{{all}}''y''{{exist}}''z''(''H''(''x'',''y'',''z'')):  "Somebody made everybody hit somebody."
* {{all}}''x''{{exist}}''z''(''F''(''x''){{and}}''G''(''a'',''z'')): Everybody is sleeping and Socrates hates somebody.
* {{exist}}''x''{{all}}''y''{{exist}}''z'' (''G''(''a'',''z''){{or-}}''H''(''x'',''y'',''z'')): Either Socrates hates somebody or somebody made everybody hit somebody.

'''Distrust''' is a formal way of not [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]ing any one [[party]] too much in a situation of grave [[risk]] or deep [[doubt]]. It is commonly expressed in [[civics]] as a division or balance of powers, or in politics as means of validating [[treaty]] terms. Systems based on distrust simply divide the [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] so that [[checks and balances]] can operate. The phrase "[[Trust, but verify]]" refers specifically to distrust.

An [[electoral system]] or [[adversarial process]] inevitably is based on distrust, but not on mistrust. Parties [[compete]] in the system, but they do not compete to [[Subversion (politics)|subvert]] the system itself, or gain bad faith advantage through it - if they do they are easily caught by the others. Much mistrust does exist between parties, and it is exactly this which motivates putting in place a [[formal system]] of distrust. [[Diplomatic protocol]] for instance, which applies between [[Sovereign state|states]], relies on such means as [[formal disapproval]] which in effect say "we do not trust that person". It also tends to rely on a strict etiquette - distrusting each person's habits to signal their intent, and instead relying on a global standard for [[behaviour]] in sensitive social settings.

A [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] as defined in [[computer science]] uses a more formal idea of distrust itself. Different parts of a system are not supposed to "trust" each other but rather perform specific assertions, [[Object (computer science)|requests]] and [[Verification and Validation (software)|validations]]. Once these are passed, the responsibility for [[error]]s lies strictly with the receiving part of the system, not that which sent the original information. Applying this principle inside one program is called contract-based design.

[[Corporate governance]] relies on distrust insofar as the board is not to trust the reports it receives from [[management]], but is empowered to investigate them, challenge them, and otherwise act on behalf of [[shareholder]]s vs. [[Management|managers]]. The fact that they rarely or never do so in most American companies is a sign that the distrust relationship has broken down - [[accounting scandal]]s and calls for [[accounting reform]] are the inevitable result. It is precisely to avoid such larger crises of trust in "the [[system]]" that formal distrust measures are put in place to begin with.

== Study ==
[[Neuroeconomics]] explain how economists are attempting to understand why humans trust or distrust others by recording physiological measurements during trust experiments.&lt;ref name="The Neuroeconomics of Distrust"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|author2=Karla Borja|author3=William T. Matzner|author4=Robert Kurzban|date=|year=2005|title=The Neuroeconomics of Distrust: Sex Differences in Behavior and Physiology|url=http://www.nexthumanproject.com/references/Neuroeconomics_of_Distrust.pdf|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=95|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists conducted an experiment observing distrust through a trust game. Subjects were asked to anonymously donate various amounts of money to other anonymous subjects with no guarantee of receiving money in return. Various conditions were run of the experiment and after each decision, subjects' levels of DHT were measured. The results of this experiment suggest men and women respond to distrust physiologically differently; a heightened level of the hormone [[Dihydrotestosterone|Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)]] in men is associated with distrust. However, more experiments need to be conducted and more results need to be obtained to accurately state the relationship between the amount of DHT present in males and responses to distrust.&lt;ref name="The Neuroeconomics of Distrust" /&gt;

Distrust has also been shown to increase the speed and performance of individuals and groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowry|first=Paul Benjamin|author2=Justin Scott Giboney|author3=Ryan Schuetzler|author4=Jacob Richardson|author5=Tom Gregory|author6=John Romney|author7=Bonnie Anderson|title=The Value of Distrust in Computer-Based Decision-Making Groups|journal=43rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|date=5–8 January 2009|ssrn=1487345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  at certain tasks. One way to classify tasks is to split them into routine (normal, usual) and nonroutine (creative, unusual, undefined). In experiments distrust has been shown to increase performance in nonroutine tasks while decreasing performance in routine tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schul|first=Y.|author2=Mayo, R. |author3= Burnstein, E. |title=The value of distrust|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1293–1302|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on high risk settings such as oil platforms, investment banking, medical surgery, aircraft piloting and nuclear powerplants has related distrust to failure avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;Conchie, S.

(2006). Explicit and Implicit Trust Within Safety Culture. Risk Analysis, 26(5), 1139-1150.&lt;/ref&gt; When non-routine strategies are needed, distrusting persons perform better, while when routine strategies are needed trusting persons perform better.&lt;ref&gt;Schul, Y., Mayo, R., &amp; Burnstein, E. (2008). The Value of Distrust. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 44, 1293–1302.&lt;/ref&gt; This research was extended to entrepreneurial firms by Gudmundsson and Lechner.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"&gt;GUDMUNDSSON, S.V. and LECHNER, C. (2013) Cognitive Biases, Organization, and Entrepreneurial Firm Survival. European Management Journal, 31(3), 278-294&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that in entrepreneurial firms the threat of failure is ever present resembling non-routine situations in high risk settings. They found that the firms of distrusting entrepreneurs were more likely to survive than the firms of optimistic or overconfident entrepreneurs. The reasons were that distrusting entrepreneurs would emphasize failure avoidance through sensible task selection, and more analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Teach, R.D., Schwartz, R.G., &amp; Tarpley, F.A. (1989). The recognition and exploitation of opportunity in the software industry: a study of surviving firms. Frontiers of Entrepreneurship Research. Wellesley, MA: Babson College, 383–397.&lt;/ref&gt; Kets de Vries has pointed out that distrusting entrepreneurs are more alert about their external environment.&lt;ref name="Vries, M. 2003"&gt;Kets de Vries, M. (2003). The entrepreneur on the couch. INSEAD Quarterly, 5, 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, distrusting entrepreneurs are less likely to discount negative events, and are more likely to engage control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, J. H., Schoorman, F. D., &amp; Donaldson, L. (1997). Toward a stewardship theory of management.

Trust and distrust: New relationships and realities. Academy of Management Review, 23, 438 – 458.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to Gudmundsson and Lechner distrust leads to higher precaution and therefore increases chances of entrepreneurial firm survival.&lt;ref name="GUDMUNDSSON, S.V 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18325">The '''Earth Charter''' is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/What-is-the-Earth-Charter%3F.html "What is the Earth Charter?"].&lt;/ref&gt; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that [[environmental protection]], [[human rights]], equitable [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and [[world peace|peace]] are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The [[Earth Charter Initiative]] organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by [[Maurice Strong]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as members of The [[Club of Rome]], when the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] called for a new charter to guide the transition to [[sustainable development]]. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-[[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Earth Summit]], but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The [[Rio Declaration]] became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, [[Maurice Strong]] (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], working through organizations they each founded (the [[Earth Council]] and [[Green Cross International]] respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a [[civil society]] initiative, with the help of the government of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="mstrong"&gt;Maurice Strong: [http://www.mauricestrong.net/2009013070/earth-charter.html "History of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong died in November 2015.&lt;ref name="mstrong" /&gt;

"The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkofhope.org|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.arkofhope.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at [[Middlebury College]] and an advisory trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven C. Rockefeller |url=http://earthcharter.org/about/steven-c-rockefeller/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|title=Charting a New Course: An Interview with Steven Rockefeller|last=Schwarz|first=Sherry|date=2001|website=abroadview.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502055548/http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee". Other members included [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] (Mali), [[Princess Basma bint Talal]] (Jordan), [[Mohamed Sahnoun]] (Algeria), [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] (Sri Lanka), [[Wakako Hironaka]] (Japan), [[Erna Witoelar]] (Indonesia), [[Ruud Lubbers]] (The Netherlands), [[Federico Mayor]] (Spain), [[Mercedes Sosa]] (Argentina), [[Leonardo Boff]] (Brazil), [[Yolanda Kakabadse]] (Ecuador), [[Shridath Ramphal]] (Guyana), [[Elizabeth May]] (Canada), [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] (Canada), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission |url=http://earthcharter.org/about-eci/commission/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

{{cquote|We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations.&lt;ref name="ECdoc"&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html "Text of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:&lt;ref name="ECdoc" /&gt;

'''I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life'''
:1. Respect Earth and life in all its diversity.
:2. Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love.
:3. Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable and peaceful.
:4. Secure Earth's bounty and beauty for present and future generations.

'''II. Ecological Integrity'''
:5. Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life.
:6. Prevent harm as the best method of environmental protection and, when knowledge is limited, apply a precautionary approach.
:7. Adopt patterns of production, consumption and reproduction that safeguard Earth's regenerative capacities, human rights and community well-being.
:8. Advance the study of ecological sustainability and promote the open exchange and wide application of the knowledge acquired.

'''III. Social and Economic Justice'''
:9. Eradicate poverty as an ethical, social and environmental imperative.
:10. Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner.
:11. Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care and economic opportunity.
:12. Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.

'''IV. Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace'''
:13. Strengthen democratic institutions at all levels, and provide transparency and accountability in governance, inclusive participation in decision-making, and access to justice.
:14. Integrate into formal education and lifelong learning the knowledge, values and skills needed for a sustainable way of life.
:15. Treat all living beings with respect and consideration.
:16. Promote a culture of tolerance, nonviolence and peace.

Various religious groups from a wide range of religions support the Earth Charter. The [[Soka Gakkai International]], representing more than 12 million Buddhists worldwide, has supported the Earth Charter since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgi.org/resources/ngo-resources/education-for-sustainable-development/sgi-and-the-earth-charter.html "SGI and the Earth Charter"], ''SGI Resources'', May 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] representing over 1000 Unitarian Universalist congregations in the United States supports the measure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/13992.shtml "Endorse the Earth Charter, 2002 Action of Immediate Witness"], Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations&lt;/ref&gt;  The official body of the [[Baha'i Faith]] religion reacted by saying "While not officially endorsing the Earth Charter, the Baha'i International Community considers the effort toward drafting it and activities in support of its essential objectives to be highly commendable, and it will continue to participate in related activities, such as conferences, forums and the like."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bahai.org/story/139 "Baha'is participate in interreligious dialogue on faith and ecology"], Baha'i World News Service, September 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Pantheist Movement]], which supports a naturalistic view of religion, endorses the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/help/?file=2003083005 "World Pantheist Movement’s Help Centre"], World Pantheist Movement website, retrieved March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Leadership Conference of Women Religious]], a Catholic organization in the United States approved the measure in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership Conference of Women Religious (August 24, 2004): [http://www.lcwr.org/lcwrannualassembly/2004assembly/resolutions2004.html "2004 Resolutions"] (press release)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Episcopal Diocese of Newark]] (New Jersey), an Episcopalian Christian organization, endorsed the Earth Charter in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Diocese of Newark |url=http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/convention/resolutions09.pdf |title=135th Annual Convention Resolutions |page=7 |date=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021050516/http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/convention/resolutions09.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, Bournemouth Borough Council endorsed the Charter in 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the [[United States]], members of religious groups, such as the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] have objected to the document on the grounds that it is [[secularism|secular]], and espouses [[socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009| reason=Please, provide a reliable source for this assertion. Nowhere on the Internet, I could find the mentioned objections.}} In addition, some conservatives{{Who|date=November 2009}} cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is "a kind of [[Ten Commandments]]" and point to the fact that at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an "Ark of Hope" — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world's religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative.

The '''ecological footprint''' measures human demand on nature, i.e., the quantity of nature it takes to support people or an economy. It tracks this demand through an [[ecological accounting]] system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use for their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region or the world ([[biocapacity]], the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature). In short, it is a measure of [[Human impact on the environment|human impact on Earth's ecosystem]] and reveals the dependence of the human economy on [[natural capital]].

The ecological footprint is defined as the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use: fruits and vegetables, fish, wood, fibers, absorption of carbon dioxide from [[fossil fuel]] use, and space for buildings and roads.

Footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale. Both footprint and biocapacity change every year with number of people, per person consumption, efficiency of production, and productivity of ecosystems. At a global scale, footprint assessments show how big humanity's demand is compared to what planet [[Earth]] can renew. Since 2003, [[Global Footprint Network]] has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations (known as the National Footprint Accounts). Every year the calculations are updated with the newest data. The time series are recalculated with every update since UN statistics also change historical data sets. As shown in Lin et al (2018)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt; the time trends for countries and the world have stayed consistent despite data updates. Also, a recent study by the Swiss Ministry of Environment independently recalculated the Swiss trends and reproduced them within 1-4% for the time period that they studied (1996-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Footprints of Switzerland|last=|first=|publisher=Federal Office for the Environment|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global Footprint Network estimates that, as of 2014, humanity has been using [[natural capital]] 1.7 times as fast as Earth can renew it.&lt;ref name="Data Sources"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/|title=Data Sources|date=2017-04-17|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"&gt;Lin, D; Hanscom, L; Murthy, A; Galli, A; Evans, M; Neill, E; Mancini, MS; Martindill, J; Medouar, F-Z; Huang, S; Wackernagel, M.

Ecological footprint analysis is widely used around the Earth in support of [[sustainability]] assessments.&lt;ref name="London Ecological Footprint 2003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyndhurst|first1=Brook|title=London’s Ecological Footprint A review|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ecological_footprint.pdf|website=Mayor of London|publisher=Greater London Authority (commissioned by GLA Economics)|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables people to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s, [[goods and services]], organizations, [[industry sector]]s, neighborhoods, cities, regions and nations.&lt;ref&gt;Global Footprint Network [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/ "Ecological Footprint: Overview."] Retrieved on April 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. The latest version are the updated standards from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Global Footprint Network |title=Ecological Footprint Standards 2009 |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/ |website=Global Footprint Network |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Footprint measurements and methodology==
[[File:Blue Marble Western Hemisphere.jpg|thumb|The [[natural resource]]s of [[Earth]] are [[non-renewable resource|finite]], and unsustainably strained by current levels of human activity.]] For 2014, Global Footprint Network estimated humanity's ecological footprint as 1.7 planet Earths. This means that, according to their calculations, humanity's demands were 1.7 times faster than what the planet's ecosystems renewed.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org|title=Open Data Platform|website=data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a community, a city, a town, a region, a nation, or humanity as a whole. Cities, due to their [[population density|population concentration]], have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8154513/Architecture_of_the_Anthropocene|work=academia.edu|title=Most poignantly... cities in the Anthropocene will remain the ‘ground zero'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the web page of Global Footprint Network &lt;ref name="Methodology and Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Methodology and Data |url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/resources/data/|publisher=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=15 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in greater detail in academic papers, including Borucke et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borucke |first1=M |last2=Moore |first2=D |last3=Cranston |first3=G |last4=Gracey |first4=K |last5=Lazarus |first5=E |last6=Morales |first6=J.C. |last7=Wackernagel |first7=M. |title=Accounting for demand and supply of the biosphere’s regenerative capacity: The National Footprint Accounts’ underlying methodology and framework |journal=Ecological Indicators |date=2013 |volume=24 |pages=518–533 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Accounts Review Committee has also published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf A Research Agenda for Improving National Ecological Footprint Accounts] Retrieved: 2007-11-11 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128200301/http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/uploads/fullpapers/Kitzes_et_al_M65.pdf |date=November 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The first academic publication about ecological footprints was by [[William Rees (academic)|William Rees]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rees |first=William E. |authorlink=William Rees (academic) |date=October 1992 |title=Ecological footprints and appropriated carrying capacity: what urban economics leaves out |journal=Environment and Urbanisation |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121–130 |doi=10.1177/095624789200400212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of [[Mathis Wackernagel]], under Rees' supervision at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990–1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |degree=PhD |title=Ecological Footprint and Appropriated Carrying Capacity: A Tool for Planning Toward Sustainability |author=Wackernagel, M. |year=1994 |publisher=School of Community and Regional Planning. The University of British Columbia |location=Vancouver, Canada |url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/7132/ubc_1994-954027.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |oclc=41839429 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept "appropriated carrying capacity".&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, Mathis, 1991. "Land Use: Measuring a Community's Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator for Sustainability"; and "Using Appropriated Carrying Capacity as an Indicator, Measuring the Sustainability of a Community." Report I &amp; II to the UBC Task Force on Healthy and Sustainable Communities, Vancouver.&lt;/ref&gt; To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term "ecological footprint", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's "small footprint on the desk".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/magazine/17wwln-safire-t.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1229007727-rHeHNAWQ6qCKYwJ6WbOsVg William Safire, On Language]: Footprint, New York Times Magazine, February 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth'' with illustrations by Phil Testemale.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees" /&gt;

Footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for Carbon, Food, Housing, and Goods and Services as well as the total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption. This approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to [[life-cycle assessment|life-cycle analysis]] wherein the consumption of [[energy]], [[biomass]] ([[food]], [[fiber]]), [[building material]], [[water]] and other [[natural resource|resources]] are converted into a normalized measure of land area called [[global hectare]]s (gha).

Per capita ecological footprint (EF), or ecological footprint analysis (EFA), is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against nature's ability to provide for this consumption. The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about [[carrying capacity]] and [[overconsumption]], with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not [[sustainable development|sustainable]]. Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 [[global hectare]]s (gha) per capita. The [[United States|U.S.]] footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of [[Switzerland]] was 5.6 gha, while [[China]]'s was 1.8 gha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/footprint_for_nations] or [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129104811/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/newsletter/bv/new_data_shows_humanitys_ecological_debt_compounding |date=2009-01-29 }} Living Planet Report 2008 outlines scenarios for humanity's future.

Retrieved: 2007-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas.&lt;ref name="Wackernagel &amp; Rees"&gt;Wackernagel, Mathis &amp; Rees, William (1996)"Our Ecological Footprint" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of NGOs offer ecological footprint calculators (''see'' [[#External links|Footprint Calculator]], below).

== Global trends in humanity's ecological footprint ==
According to the 2018 edition of the National Footprint Accounts, humanity’s total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Humanity’s ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity’s total ecological footprint&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;.

The Earth’s biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7)&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. Because of agricultural intensification, biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2014&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. 

Therefore, the Earth has been in ecological overshoot (where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can’t renew) since the 1970’s&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org" /&gt;. In 2018, [[Earth Overshoot Day]], the date where humanity has used more from nature then the planet can renew in the entire year, was estimated to be August 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/earth-overshoot-day/|title=Earth Overshoot Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Now more than 85% of humanity live in countries that run an ecological deficit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|title=Ecological Footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This means their ecological footprint for consumption exceeds the biocapacity of that country. 

==Studies in the United Kingdom==
The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 [[global hectare]]s per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England).&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;

Two recent studies{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} have examined relatively low-impact small communities. [[BedZED]], a 96-home [[mixed-income housing]] development in South [[London]], was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the [[Peabody Trust]]. Despite being populated by relatively "mainstream" home-buyers, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site London's first [[carsharing]] club. The report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured BedZED since its completion in 2002. [[Findhorn Ecovillage]], a rural [[intentional community]] in [[Moray]], [[Scotland]], had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of [[Cluny Hill]] College. However, the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php Findhorn eco-footprint is ‘world’s smallest’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123092120/http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1596647.0.findhorn_ecofootprint_is_worlds_smallest.php |date=2009-01-23 }} ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', August 11, 2008.

Grazi et al. (2007) have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental [[externality|externalities]], agglomeration effects and trade advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=F. Grazi |author2=J.C.J.M. van den Bergh |author3=P. Rietveld |title=Welfare economics versus ecological footprint: modeling agglomeration, externalities and trade |journal=Environmental and Resource Economics |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=135–153 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10640-006-9067-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that the two methods can lead to very distinct, and even opposite, rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity. However this should not be surprising, since the two methods address different research questions.

[[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Newman]] (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Peter|date=October 2006|title=The environmental impact of cities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247806069599|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=275–295|doi=10.1177/0956247806069599|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as "parasitic". This is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large ''[[hinterland]]s''. Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of [[economies of scale]]. Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for [[autarky]]. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the Footprint denies the benefits of trade. &lt;!-- which it does not, I'll try to track down Wackernagel's piece on this, it's somewhere on my hard drive. belg4mit --&gt; Therefore, the critics argue that the Footprint can only be applied globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-pam.usc.edu/volume1/v1i1a2print.html |title=Planning and Markets: Peter Gordon and Harry W. Richardson |publisher=Pam.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Something about per capita EF of a nation vs. fairshare should be mentioned here as a counterpoint. i.e; it can provide a frame of reference as to justness --&gt;

The method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural [[monoculture]]s by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint. Similarly, if [[organic farming]] yields were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being "penalized" with a larger ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen, M., C. Borgstrom Hansson and S. Bond (2006) [http://www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au/publications/documents/ISA&amp;WWF_Bioproductivity&amp;LandDisturbance.pdf On the bioproductivity and land-disturbance metrics of the Ecological Footprint]. University of Sydney, ISA Research Paper, June, 06, in collaboration with WWF. Retrieved: 2007-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this insight, while valid, stems from the idea of using the footprint as one's only metric. If the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators, such as one for [[biodiversity]], the problem might be solved. Indeed, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]'s [[Living Planet Index|Living Planet Report]] complements the biennial Footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loh, J., R.

[[Image:Greenhouse emissions by electricity source.PNG|500px|right|The Vattenfall study found Nuclear, Hydro, and Wind to have far less greenhouse emissions than other sources represented.]]

The Swedish utility [[Vattenfall]] did a study of full [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]] the utility uses to produce electricity, namely: Nuclear, Hydro, Coal, Gas, Solar Cell, Peat and Wind. The net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide per kW⋅h of produced power. This compares to 400 for [[natural gas]] and 700 for [[coal]] (according to this study). The study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of any of their electricity sources.&lt;ref&gt;nuclearinfo.net.

The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person.&lt;ref name="data.footprintnetwork.org"/&gt; The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities.&lt;ref name="Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanity Now Demanding 1.6 Earths|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/|website=Global Footprint Network|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GHG footprint]] or the more narrow [[carbon footprint]] are a component of the ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of CO2 (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people or whole societies.&lt;ref name="Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benn|first1=Hilary|last2=Milliband|first2=Ed|title=Guidance on how to measure and report your greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/69282/pb13309-ghg-guidance-0909011.pdf|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12387">'''Equipotentiality''' refers to a [[psychological]] theory in both [[neuropsychology]] and [[behaviorism]]. [[Karl Spencer Lashley]] defined equipotentiality as "The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out… the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]".&lt;ref name="Fancher"&gt;Fancher, R.E., &amp; Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of Psychology. New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the brain can co-opt other areas to take over the role of the damaged part.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Garrett, H. (1941). R. Elliott (Ed.), Great experiments in psychology, New York: D. Appleton-century Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined, the law of [[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]]. The law of mass action says that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex.

==Historical context==
In the 1800s brain localization theories were the popular theories on how the brain functioned.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; The [[Broca's area]] of speech was discovered in 1861, in 1870 the cerebral cortex was marked as the motor center of the brain, and the general visual and auditory areas were defined in the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref name="Hearst"&gt;Hearst, E. (1979). The first century of experimental psychology. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviorism]] at the time would also say that learned responses were series of specific connections in the cerebral cortex. Lashley argued that one would then be able to locate these connections in part of the brain and he systematically looked for where learning was localized.

==Experiments==
While working on his PhD in genetics, Lashley began a number of tests on brain tissue and the idea of localization.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley wanted to focus mainly on behaviors that could be observed and an easy way to do that was to study white rats in a controlled setting. A fellow researcher, [[Shepherd Ivory Franz]], also shared the common interest of studying localization and studying only things that could be observed. Franz had already done previous work with lesions in cat brains and puzzle boxes so Lashley and Franz decided to team up and work with rats.

In their first experiments, Lashley was in charge of building different mazes for the rats to go through and Franz was in charge of making the lesions in the rats' brains.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; What Lashley and Franz had both observed before the lesions was that their rats became better and better at getting through the mazes to find food and they were testing if lesions had an influence on the rats' memory and ability to get through the mazes. Franz made multiple lesions in specific parts of the brains and after they healed, put them through the maze to see if they had deficits in finding the food. What they found was that the mice had no deficits finding the food if the lesions were in a specific part of the brain but if the lesions damaged a large portion of the brain, they did have troubles finding food.

This would suggest that just one part of the brain is not responsible for memory and localization was totally ruled out.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; What they concluded was that multiple parts of the brain work together for memory and retention. They also found that rats with lesions in a small specific area had functioning sensory systems and it seemed that when parts of the brain were damaged for a certain action, other parts of the brain were compensating so those actions could be carried out. Lashley coined the term equipotentiality to define the idea that if one part of the brain is damaged, other parts of the brain will carry out the memory functions for that damaged part.

"The apparent capacity of any intact part of a functional brain to carry out… the [memory] functions which are lost by the destruction of [other parts]".&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Another way of putting this is, the brain has the ability to use any functioning part of the brain to do what a damaged part of the brain no longer can do.&lt;ref name="Garrett" /&gt; Equipotentiality is subject to the other term Lashley coined, the law of mass action. The law of mass action says that the efficiency of any complex function of the brain is reduced proportionately to how much damage the brain as a whole has sustained, but not to the damage of any particular area of the brain. In this context when we use brain we are referring to the cortex.

Ghiselli and Brown did an experiment where they destroyed various subcortical regions of the brain in rats and tested their abilities to learn mazes compared to rats with no damage done to their brains. The rats with damaged brains didn't learn as well as the control rats, but no particular region seemed to be necessary to learn the mazes. There has also been experimental work done on higher apes and also studies done on humans who have suffered brain damage in various ways. The data gathered from these tend to confirm Lashley's theories.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury"&gt;Dewsbury, D. A. (2006). Monkey farm: a history of the yerkes laboratories of primate biology, orange park, florida 1930-1965. Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pGo606UrQhgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=yerkes laboratories&amp;ots=FPcTjpGCwA&amp;sig=wkwPpFDSPI20sYC-feSaPG8oswE&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the idea of equipotentiality we can explain how someone who's received damage to a specific part of their brain can relearn how to perform actions that were lost due to brain damage. Since the area of the brain that was originally performing this function is damaged and unusable, the brain compensates and can code that information in other parts of the brain. Through Lashley's ideas of equipotentiality and the law of mass action, he is saying that the brain is functioning as a whole unit and that over all damage to the brain effects it's over all functioning. This starts to go against localization theories which would say that the brain is only functioning in specific regions and the brain's ability to perform at any given task is only effected by the overall damage to that area of the brain and damage to an unrelated area shouldn't affect the task. However, equipotentiality and the law of mass action don't mean that there is no localization.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt; There are certain functions that have been pinned to specific parts of the brain, language and the senses for example, but for things like learning or behavior there is no specific area identified yet, and these are the brain activities that have the flexibility to be coded in different areas of the brain after damage has been sustained.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt;

===In neuropsychology===
In [[neuropsychology]], equipotentiality is a [[neurological]] principle that describes a [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] mechanism, first identified by [[Jean Pierre Flourens]] and later revisited by [[Karl Lashley]] in the 1950s. The principle of equipotentiality is the idea that the rate of learning is independent of the combination of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli that are used in classical conditioning.

After performing [[ablation]] experiments on birds, and seeing that they could still fly, peck, mate, sleep, and perform a range of other regular behaviors, Flourens concluded that every area of the brain was capable of doing what every other area of the brain could, but only for higher-level functions which he called "perception". He also argued that elementary sensory input was localized, which is supported by current research. The famous saying that we only use 10% of our brains originates from Flourens, back about a century and a half ago.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Lashley offered two generalizations from his research, that recently have been successfully challenged but nonetheless represent important milestones in the development of neurological theory:
# Although surgical removal of a portion of the cortex can produce significant behavioral deficits, those deficits can be recovered through additional training and time, by way of the development of new [[neuronal]] connections. Lashley argued that the brain is sufficiently plastic, such that when one region of the brain is surgically removed (or damaged through injury) another region takes over the damaged region's function. This is the principle Lashley referred to as equipotentiality. Extensive regions of the [[cerebral cortex]] have the potentiality for mediating specific learning and memory functions.
# His principle of "[[Mass Action Principle (neuroscience)|mass action]]" stated that the cerebral cortex acts as one—as a whole—in many types of learning.

===In behaviorism===
In [[behaviorism]], the theory of equipotentiality suggests that any two stimuli can be associated in the brain, regardless of their nature. It proposes that all forms of [[associative learning]], both classical ([[Pavlovian]]) and [[operant]] ([[B.F. Skinner|Skinnerian]]) involve the same underlying mechanisms. However, food avoidance experiments have questioned its application.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Contributions==
Lashley contributed to psychology and neuropsychology in a number of ways. First, his publication, ''Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence: A Quantitative Study of Injuries to the Brain'' (1929) disproved the idea of localization and brought to life the idea that the brain and its multiple parts work together for memory and other functions.&lt;ref name=" Encyclopædia Britannica "&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. (2013). Karl S. Lashley. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 21, 2013 from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/330978/Karl-S-Lashley&lt;/ref&gt; Second, researchers began to copy his studies and also started to investigate what parts of the brain work together. They also began studying deficits people may have along with parts of their brain that may be damaged to see if there is a correlation between them.

Lashley was also a pioneer in challenging the way we think about human and animal behavior in terms of our biology.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley found with further experimentation that behavior is not just a reaction to a stimulus but a large and complicated series of connections made in the brain. An input of information or stimuli occurs and connections occur in the brain which leads to the output or behavior. Researchers also expanded the study of working memory, central executive, and further research on memory deficits and learning.

Lashley did not find a central place for stored memories, which suggests that stored memories are not localized but stored and retrieved in multiple areas.&lt;ref name="Fancher" /&gt; Lashley contributed to studies on [[Alzheimer's disease]] and deficits in memory, behavior, and thinking in those who have Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="B. Davis"&gt;B. Davis. (2008). Karl Spencer Lashley. Encyclopedia.com. Retrieved November 21, 2013 from http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Karl_Spencer_Lashley.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-to-cell communication slowly degrades in Alzheimer's disease and Lashley's contributions to psychology, neuropsychology and biology have helped with the understanding of this and many other diseases and disorders.

Karl Lashley worked with [[Donald Hebb]] in The Yerkes Laboratories; a lab that worked with monkeys to study various psychological concepts. Another man that Lashley influenced was [[Roger Sperry]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt; He also studied with Lashley in the lab and eventually received the Karl Lashley Award of the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name="Hergenhahn"&gt;Hergenhahn, B.

The '''Filipino value system''' or '''Filipino values''' refers to the set of [[values (heritage)|values]] or the [[value system]] that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. This Philippine values system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent [[ideologies]], [[moral codes]], [[ethics|ethical practices]], [[etiquette]] and [[personal and cultural values|cultural and personal values]] that are promoted by their society. As with any society though, the values that an individual holds sacred can differ on the basis of religion, upbringing and other factors.

As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly [[Christianity]]) and commercial relationships.&lt;ref name=CAPH&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm ''Social Values and Organization''], Philippines, country studies.us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical basis==

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered at maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of "''Hiya''", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and "''Amor propio''" or 'self-esteem'.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chris Rowthorn |author2=Greg Bloom |title=Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaUR07G0yAcC |year=2006 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74104-289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache&gt;Hallig, Jason V. [http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid ''Communicating Holiness to the Filipinos: Challenges and Needs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015814/http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid |date=2011-07-20 }}, The Path to a Filipino Theology of Holiness, on pages 2 and 10, http://didache.nts.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologist Leonardo Mercado, the Filipino worldview is basically 'nondualistic'. Based on his linguistic analyses of Filipino value terms like ''[[loob]]'' (Cebuano ''buot''), he concludes that Filipinos desire harmony, not only in interpersonal relationships, but also with nature and religion, while still remaining nondichotomous.&lt;ref name="FCT"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando M. Gripaldo|title=Filipino cultural traits: Claro R. Ceniza lectures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXJe6vKMjroC|year=2005|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-225-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|text= "The Filipino wants to harmonize the object and the subject, while at the same time holding both as distinct."
|sign= ''Elements of Filipino Philosophy'' (1974), Leonardo Mercado, [[Divine Word Missionaries|SVD]]
}}

Florentino Timbreza, a cultural philosopher, concludes in his book ''Pilosopiyang Pilipino'' (1982) that Filipino values are based on the significance of the world to man. Life experiences dictate the philosophy of the Filipino, augmented by other sources like proverbs, folk sayings, folk tales, and the like.&lt;ref name="FCT" /&gt;

==Models of the Filipino values==

F. Landa Jocano identified two models of the Filipino value system. The first is the '''exogenous model''' or the '''foreign model''', while the second is the '''indigenous model''' or the '''traditional model'''. The foreign model is described to be a "legal and formal" model. The indigenous model is described as a "traditional and non-formal" model or guide but is deeply embedded in the [[subconscious]] of the Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

The foreign model was inherited by Filipinos from [[Western cultures]], particularly from the [[Spaniards]] and the [[United States|Americans]]. An example of a foreign or exogenous influence is [[bureaucracy]] exhibited in the [[government of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

==Elements and composition of Filipino values==
Based on studies, surveys, opinions, anecdotes, and other literatures made by experts and researchers in relation to '''Filipino social values''' or '''Filipino core values''', along with the [[Filipino character]] or [[Filipino identity]] of a person or an individual known as the Filipino, the Filipino value system are found to possess inherent key elements.

One can note how ''Hiya'' (propriety/dignity)'', [https://tl.wiktionary.org/wiki/pakikisama Pakikisama]''(companionship/esteem)'','' and ''[[Utang na loob]]''(gratitude/solidarity), are merely '''Surface Values'''—readily seen and observed values exhibited and esteemed by many Filipinos. These three values are considered branches from a single origin—the actual '''Core Value''' of the Filipino Personality—''Kapwa''. It means 'togetherness', and refers to community, or not doing things alone. ''Kapwa'' has two categories, ''Ibang Tao'' (other people) and ''Hindi Ibang Tao'' (not other people). The Surface Values spin off of the Core Value through the '''Pivotal Aspect''' of ''Pakikiramdam,'' or shared inner perception ("Feeling for another").

Other notable key elements or motivations are [[optimism]] about the future, [[pessimism]] with regards to present situations and events, the concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"&gt;Talisayon, Serafin. [http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm ''Filipino Values''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164213/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm |date=2016-04-17 }}, Chapeter XIII, Teaching Values in the Natural and Physical Sc54654
iences in the Philippines, crvp.orgp&lt;/ref&gt;

The values of Filipinos specifically upholds the following items: solidarity of the family unit, security of the Philippine economy, orientation to small-groups, personalism, the concepts of "''[[loob]]''" or "''[[kalooban]]''" (meaning "what’s inside the self", the "inner-self", or the "actual personal feelings of the self"), existence and maintenance of smooth [[interpersonal relationships]], and the sensing of the feelings or needs of others (known as ''pakikiramdam''). In a larger picture, these values are grouped into general clusters or "macroclusters": namely, the relationship cluster, the social cluster, the livelihood cluster, the inwardness cluster, and the optimism cluster.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"/&gt;

==Enumeration of Filipino values==

=== Human activities ===

This is the shared sense of identity and consciousness of the 'other'. It means treating others with respect and dignity as an equal, not someone below the individual.

=== Family orientation ===

The basic and most important unit of a Filipino's life is the family. Unlike in Western countries, young Filipinos who turn 18 are not expected to move out of their parents' home. When a Filipino's parents are old and cannot take care of themselves, they are cared for in their children's homes and are very rarely brought by their children to Homes for the Aged. The practice of separating the elderly from the rest of the family, while common in Western countries, is often looked down upon in Filipino society. Family lunches with the whole clan with up to 50 people, extending until the line of second cousins, are not unusual. The Filipino puts a great emphasis on the value of family and being close to one's family members.

=== Joy and humor ===

This famous trait is the ability of Filipinos to find humour in everything. It sheds light on the optimism and positivity of Filipinos in whatever situation they are in so as to remain determined in going through struggles or challenges. It serves as a coping technique, the same way a child who has fallen laughs at himself/herself to hide his/her embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pagbabalik-Loob|last = Maggay|first = Melba|date = 1993|journal = Moral Recovery and Cultural Reaffirmation|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexibility, adaptability, and creativity ===

Studies show that Filipinos often have an aversion to a set of standardised rules or procedures; They are known to follow a "natural clock" or organic sense of time—doing things in the time they feel is right. They are present-oriented: which means that one attends to a task or requirement at the time it is needed and does not worry much about future engagements. This allows the Filipino to adapt and be flexible in doing the tasks at times not bound to a particular schedule or timeframe. This allows them think on their feet and be creative in facing whatever challenge or task they have even when it is already right in front of them.

=== Faith and religiosity ===

The Philippines is approximately 85 percent Christians (mostly Roman Catholics ), 10 percent Muslim, and 5 percent 'other' religions, including the Taoist-Buddhist religious beliefs of Chinese and the 'indigenous' animistic beliefs of some peoples in upland areas that resisted 300 years of Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christianity in the Philippines|url = http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/christianity.htm|website = www.seasite.niu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reflection of the Filipinos' strong faith in God as seen in their various practices. This includes the numerous church holidays they observe, the customary (and obligatory) Sunday Mass, the individual's basis of their moral standpoints, the influence of the Church on the minds, actions, and opinions of the majority, importance of the Sacraments, praying at almost any possible time of the day, the extreme practices during Holy Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will these 10 traditional Holy Week practices survive? |work=The Philippine Star |url = http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2015/04/03/1440221/will-these-10-traditional-holy-week-practices-survive|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ability to survive ===

The Filipinos as a people who have been constantly under the rule of numerous powerful countries has over time, developed a sense of resourcefulness or the ability to survive with whatever they have. They have the extraordinary ability to make something out of almost nothing. If a Filipino was given just a screwdriver, plastic bagseut, and some tape, he would still be able to build a bird tree, especially for the sake of survival, and provided that he be allowed to hunt for some needed surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life and Times of the Filipino-American: The Resourcefulness of the Filipino|url = http://filipinoamericanpinay.blogspot.com/2012/07/resourcefulness-of-filipino.html|website = Life and Times of the Filipino-American|date = 2012-07-10|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard work And Industriousness ===

With resourcefulness comes hard work. Filipinos are very determined and persevering in accomplishing whatever they set their minds to. &lt;blockquote&gt;Filipinos over the years have proven time and time again that they are a people with an industrious attitude. Sadly, this is seen by others as Filipinos being only useful as domestic helpers, working abroad to help their families in the country. This is also present in the country’s workforce particularly the farmers. Even with little support, technological weaknesses and the country’s seasonal typhoons, the Filipino farmer still strives to earn their daily meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASIAN JOURNAL {{!}} The best traits of Filipinos that we should be proud of|url = http://asianjournalusa.com/the-best-traits-of-filipinos-that-we-should-be-proud-of-p10881-67.htm|website = asianjournalusa.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hospitality ===
[[Alien (law)|Foreigners]] who come to visit the Philippines speak of Filipinos going out of their way to help them when lost, or the heartwarming generosity of a Filipino family hosting a visitor in their poverty-stricken home. Meanwhile, most foreigners who attend Filipino gatherings abroad (which are frequently organized for hundreds of reasons) testify to the warmth and friendliness of Filipinos as they experience that feeling of “belongingness.” Indeed, the legendary Filipino hospitality is not limited to the Philippines. It is everywhere wherever there are Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global nation Inquirer: What Filipinos can be proud of|url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/45875/what-filipinos-can-be-proud-of|website = globalnation.inquirer.net|accessdate = 2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-specific values==

In relation to parenthood, bearing male and female children depends on the preferences of the parents based on the expected roles that each gender would assume once grown up. Both genders are expected to become responsible members of the family and their society. [[Women in the Philippines]] are expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children.&lt;ref name=CCSF&gt;MLY. [http://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Philippine_Studies/event2.html ''Keynote Speech''], City College of San Francisco in the Conference on "''The Filipino Family in the 21st Century: Issues and Challenges''", ccsf.edu, October 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Filipinos are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, [[men in the Philippines|Filipino men]] are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applying at all levels of scale in biological organisms.

The theory asserts that energy and structure (also information) become synonymous in complex biological structures via a self-organizing, multiple-scale catalytic process (thus: bioenergetics = bioinformatics) – the proposed mechanism involving the catalytic action of [[soliton]] propagation in (biological) [[excitable media]].&lt;ref name="Davia2006"/&gt; The theory resolves problems (particularly problems associated with brain function) arising from an assumed distinction between function and metabolism. The theory attempts to show that no such distinction exists; thus: FUNCTION = METABOLISM = CATALYSIS.&lt;ref name="Davia2006"/&gt;

In [[behaviorism|behavioral]] [[psychology]], the '''assumption of generality''' is the assumption that the results of [[experimental analysis of behavior|experiments]] involving schedules of [[reinforcement]], conducted on non-human subjects (often pigeons), can be generalized to apply to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, D.L &amp; Mallott, R.W. (1971). ''Elementary Principles of Behavior''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morse W.H. (1966). Intermittent reinforcement. In W.K. Honig (ed.), ''Operant Behavior: areas of research and application'' (pp. 52–108). New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1969). ''Contingencies of Reinforcement: A theoretical analysis.'' New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; If the assumption holds, many aspects of daily human life can be understood in terms of these results. The naturalization of sunlight helps our bodies to stay awake and keep motivated. The darkness that comes with night tells our body to slow down for the day and get some rest. The ability to survive comes with generality. Experiments have been done to test inescapability and [[insolubility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroto|first=Donald S.|author2=Seligman, Martin E.|title=Generality of learned helplessness in man.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=31|issue=2|pages=311–327|doi=10.1037/h0076270|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/31/2/311/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fergus Lowe has questioned the generality of schedule effects in cases of fixed-interval performance among humans and non-humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, F.C. (1979) Determinants of human operant behavior. In M.D. Zeiler &amp; P. Harzem (Eds), ''Reinforcement and the organization of behavior'' (pp. 159–192). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to generalize information from one situation to another is a function of several factors: the [[reliability (research methods)|reliability]] of the original information; the [[paradigm]]'s [[Validity (logic)|validity]]; one's understanding of the paradigm, the true determinants of the behavior, and the relevant details of the situations in question; and the similarity between the original source of the data and the situation to which it is to be applied.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsu.edu/depart/psychology/sebac/fac-sch/rm/Ch5-2.html |title=Generality Maximization |publisher=Jsu.edu |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are both similarities and differences between the terms "[[stimulus generalization]]" and "generality of a [[functional relationship]]." Stimulus generalization is the description of the fact that an [[organism]] behaves in a similar way to similar [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and that the more different the stimuli, the more different the behavior. The generality of a finding refers to the degree to which a functional relationship obtained in one situation is able to predict the obtained relationship in a new situation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

"Generality" refers more to functional relationships than individual events. That responses occur to X about the same as to Z is irrelevant; rather, that [[distributed practice]] helps in learning [[nonsense syllable]]s and in learning other tasks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Gross National Wellness or Well-being''' ('''GNW''') is a socioeconomic development and measurement framework. The GNW / GNH Index consists of 7 dimensions: economic, environmental, physical, mental, work, social, and political. Most wellness areas include both subjective results (via survey) and objective data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/grossnationalhappiness/ "Global GNW / GNH Index"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192803/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf "National Indicators for a New Era (page 81), Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[https://dugi-doc.udg.edu/bitstream/handle/10256/15117/ortuzar-fernandez.pdf?sequence=1 "Empirical Study of Healthcare and Life Satisfaction in Spain at University De Girona"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
The GNW Index is also known as the first GNH Index or [[Gross National Happiness]] Index, not to be confused with Bhutan's GNH Index. Both econometric frameworks are different in authorship, creation dates, and geographic scope. The GNW / GNH index is a global development measurement framework published in 2005 by the International Institute of Management in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;H A Hellyer, [http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter "UAE National Newspaper on Happiness Ministry Background"].&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=20R9_6rC-LoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=GNH "Ecological Economics Book - page 274"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gross National Happiness]] phrase was coined in 1972 by [[Sicco Mansholt]], one of the founders of the [[European Union]] and the fourth President of the [[European Commission]], and was later popularized by [[Bhutan]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-gnh-origin.htm "The Origin of Gross National Happiness - The European GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, no GNH Index existed until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness "The History of Gross National Happiness, Professor Monica Correa, Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNH philosophy suggested that the ideal purpose of governments is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness and the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/papers/mcdonald.pdf "McDonald, Ross (2005). "Rethinking Development. Local Pathways to Global Wellbeing". St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. p. 3."]&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of economic policies on the subjective well-being of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/bitstream/10071/13633/1/HappinessSeekingThesis_AnaRodrigues.pdf  Selling Happiness - Lisbon University"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index paper proposed the first GNH Index as a solution to help with the implementation of the GHN philosophy and was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political mission statement into a second generation implementation holistic (objective and subjective) concept and by treating happiness as a socioeconomic development metric that word provide an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrates subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-research-library/happiness-economics-history-milestones-timeline.htm "Happiness Economics Timeline and Milestones - GNH Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316091499_A_Modern_History_of_Happiness_as_Economic_Policy "A Modern History of Happiness as Economic Policy Dr Deidre Rose, University of Guelph"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNW Index is a secular econometric model that tracks 7 subjective and objective development areas with no religious measurement components. On the other hand, Bhutan's GNH Index is a local development framework and measurement index, published by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH Research|Centre for Bhutan Studies]] in 2012 based on 2011 Index function designed by Alkire-Foster at [[Oxford University]]. The Bhutan's GNH Index is customized to the country's Buddhist cultural and spiritual values, it tracks 9 subjective happiness areas including spiritual measurement such as prayers recitation and other Karma indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|author1=Karma Ura|author2=Sabina Alkire|author3=Tshoki Zangmo|author4=Karma Wangdi|title=A Short Summary of Bhutan GNH Index|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|year=2012|isbn=978-99936-14-66-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and issues at the heart of Bhutanese approach are similar to the secular GNH Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSy7Ubd-PX8C&amp;pg=PA31|author=Alastair Campbell|title=The Happy Depressive: In Pursuit of Personal and Political Happiness|publisher=Arrow Books|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a policy white paper providing recommendations for implementing the GNW Index metric was published by the International Institute of Management. The paper is widely referenced by academic and policy maker citing the GNW / GNH index as a potential model for local socioeconomic development and measurement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.medjones.com/happiness-economics-gross-national-wellbeing-happiness-index.htm "Happiness Economics - GNH Index Research Citations"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==GNW survey components==
The subjective survey part of the GNW measurement system is structured into seven areas or dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iim-edu.org/polls/GrossNationalHappinessSurvey.htm "The Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey - Global GNH Index Survey"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Each area or dimension satisfaction rating is scaled from 0–10: 0 being very dissatisfied, 5 being neutral, and 10 is very satisfied.

#Mental &amp; Emotional Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Frequency and levels of positive vs. negative thoughts and feelings over the past year
#Physical &amp; Health Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Physical safety and health, including risk to life, body and property and the cost and quality of healthcare, if one gets sick
#Work &amp; Income Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Job and income to support essential living expenses, including shelter, food, transportation, and education. If a head of household, the expenses to support household/family is included
#Social Relations Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Relations with the significant other, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and community
#Economic &amp; Retirement Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Disposable (extra) income, which is the remaining money after paying for essential living expenses. This money can be used for leisure activities, retirement savings, investments, or charity.
#Political &amp; Government Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;Political rights, privacy and personal freedom as well the performance of the government (including socioeconomic development policies effectiveness and efficiency) 
#Living Environment Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):&lt;br&gt;City/urban planning, utilities, infrastructure, traffic, architecture, landscaping and nature's pollution (including noise, air, water, and soil)

The survey also asks four qualitative questions to identify key causes of happiness and unhappiness:

#What are the top positive things in your life that make you happy?
#What are the top challenges and causes of stress in your life?
#What would you advise your government to increase your well-being and happiness?
#What are the most influential city, state, federal or international projects? How are they impacting your well-being and happiness (positively or negatively)?

==Criticism==
One major criticism is that the use of subjective surveys can lead to unreliable conclusions{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}.

'''Habituation''' is a form of learning in which an organism decreases or ceases its responses to a [[stimulation|stimulus]] after repeated or prolonged presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bouton|first=M.E.|title=Learning and behavior: A contemporary synthesis|year=2007|publisher=Sunderland|location=MA Sinauer|url=http://www.sinauer.com/bouton/glossary.html#Habituation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the organism learns to stop responding to a stimulus which is no longer biologically relevant.  For example, organisms may habituate to repeated sudden loud noises when they learn these have no consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cherry, K.|title=What is habituation.|publisher=About.com.|accessdate=December 27, 2013|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/hindex/g/def_habituation.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Habituation usually refers to a reduction in innate behaviours, rather than behaviours acquired during conditioning (in which case the process is termed [[Extinction (psychology)|"extinction"]]). A progressive decline of a behavior in a habituation procedure may also reflect nonspecific effects such as [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], which must be ruled out when the interest is in habituation as a learning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/48/14443312/1444331248-20.pdf|title=Research methods in child language: A practical guide|last=Fennel|first=C. T.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|location=Hoboken, NJ|contribution=Habituation procedures|editor=E. Hoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The habituation process is a form of adaptive behavior (or [[neuroplasticity]]) that is classified as non-[[associative learning]]. Non-[[associative learning]] is a change in a response to a stimulus that does not involve associating the presented stimulus with another stimulus or event such as a reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1349539/animal-learning|title=animal learning|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Examples of [[associative learning]] include [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]]). Habituation is the decrease of a response to a repeated eliciting stimulus that is not due to sensory adaptation or motor fatigue. Sensory adaptation (or [[neural adaptation]]) occurs when an organism can no longer detect the stimulus as efficiently as when first presented and motor fatigue occurs when an organism is able to detect the stimulus but can no longer respond efficiently. In contrast, habituation is a learned adaptation to the repeated presentation of a stimulus, not a reduction in sensory or motor ability.

Some related phenomena to habituation include sensitization and stimulus generalization/discrimination. [[Sensitization]] is the opposite process to habituation, i.e. an increase in the elicited behavior from repeated presentation of a stimulus. There may also be an initial increase in response immediately prior to the decline (a sensitization process followed by a habituation process).&lt;ref name="domjan2010"&gt;Domjan, M. (2010). [http://www.cengage.com/search/productOverview.do?N=0&amp;Ntk=P_Isbn13&amp;Ntt=9780495601999 Principles of learning and behavior, 6th edition], Cengage/Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related phenomenon is [[Classical conditioning|stimulus generalization]], when habituation occurs in response to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1966"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Richard|author2=Spencer, William|title=Habituation: a model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior|journal=Psychological Review|year=1966|volume=73|series=No.1|pages=16–43|doi=10.1037/h0022681|pmid=5324565}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposing process, [[Classical conditioning|stimulus discrimination]], is when habituation does not occur to other stimuli that are dissimilar to the original stimulus. Habituation may also be clinically relevant, as a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including Autism, Schizophrenia, Migraine, and Tourette's, show reductions in habituation to a variety of stimulus-types both simple (tone) and complex (faces).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDiarmid|first=T.A.|author2=Bernardos, A.C..|title=Habituation is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders—a comprehensive review with recommendations for experimental design and analysis.|journal=Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2017|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–43|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.05.028|pmid=28579490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug habituation==
There is an additional connotation to the term habituation which applies to psychological dependency on drugs, and is included in several online dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=habituation|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/habituation|publisher=Merriam-webster|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of specialist from the World Health Organization assembled in 1957 to address the problem of drug addiction and adopted  the term "drug habituation" to distinguish some drug-use behaviors from drug addiction. According to the WHO lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, habituation is defined as "becoming accustomed to any behavior or condition, including psychoactive substance use".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms published by the world health organization|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/who_lexicon/en|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964 the America Surgeon's General report on smoking and health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.|title=Smoking and health: Report of the advisory committee to the surgeon general of the public health service. No. 1103|year=1964|publisher=U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; Public Health Service; Center for Disease Control.|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBNK.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; included four features that characterize drug habituation according to WHO: 1) "a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders"; 2) "little or no tendency to increase the dose"; 3) "some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome"; 4)"detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual". However, also in 1964, a committee from the World Health Organization once again convened and decided the definitions of drug habituation and drug addiction were insufficient, replacing the two terms with "drug dependence". [[Substance dependence]] is the preferred term today when describing drug-related disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DSM-IV &amp; DSM-IV-TR: Substance Dependence|url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm|publisher=BehaveNet|accessdate=September 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024534/http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/subdep.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the use of the term drug habituation has declined substantially. This is not to be confused with true habituation to drugs, wherein repeated doses have an increasingly diminished effect, as is often seen in addicts or persons taking painkillers frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Timothy B.|last2=Tiffany|first2=Stephen T.|title=Morphine tolerance as habituation.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.1.78|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=92|issue=1|pages=78–108|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.1.78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Habituation as a form of non-[[associative learning]] can be distinguished from other behavioral changes  (e.g., sensory adaptation, fatigue) by considering the characteristics of habituation that have been identified over several decades of research. The characteristics first described by [[Richard F. Thompson|Thompson]] and Spencer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thopmson|first=R.F.|author2=Spencer, W.A.|title=Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior|journal=Psychological Review|year=1966|volume=73|issue=1|pages=16–43|doi=10.1037/h0022681|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1979/A1979HF82000001.pdf|pmid=5324565}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recently been updated and include the following:&lt;ref name="rankin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Habituation revisited: An updated and revised description of the behavioral characteristics of habituation.|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|volume=92|issue=2|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.09.012|pmc=2754195|pmid=18854219|authors=Rankin, H. A.; Abrams, T., Barry, R. J., Bhatnagar, S., Clayton, D. F., Colombo, J., . . . Thompson, R. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeated presentation of a stimulus will cause a decrease in reaction to the stimulus. Habituation is also proclaimed to be a form of implicit learning, which is commonly the case with continually repeated stimuli. This characteristic is consistent with the definition of habituation as a procedure, but to confirm habituation as a process, additional characteristics must be demonstrated. Also observed is spontaneous recovery. That is, a habituated response to a stimulus recovers (increases in magnitude) when a significant amount of time (hours, days, weeks) passes between stimulus presentations.

"Potentiation of habituation" is observed when tests of spontaneous recovery are given repeatedly. In this phenomenon, the decrease in responding that follows spontaneous recovery becomes more rapid with each test of spontaneous recovery. Also noted was that an increase in the frequency of stimulus presentation (i.e., shorter [[interstimulus interval]]) will increase the rate of habituation. Furthermore, continued exposure to the stimulus after the habituated response has plateaued (i.e., show no further decrement) may have additional effects on subsequent tests of behavior such as delaying spontaneous recovery. The concepts of stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination will be observed. Habituation to an original stimulus will also occur to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus (''stimulus generalization'').  The more similar the new stimulus is to the original stimulus, the greater the habituation that will be observed. When a subject shows habituation to a new stimulus that is similar to the original stimulus but not to a stimulus that is different from the original stimulus, then the subject is showing ''stimulus discrimination''. (For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime). Stimulus discrimination can be used to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as an alternative explanation of the habituation process.

Another observation mentioned is when a single introduction of a different stimulus late in the habituation procedure when responding to the eliciting stimulus has declined can cause an increase in the habituated response. This increase in responding is temporary and is called "[[dishabituation]]" and always occurs to the original eliciting stimulus (not to the added stimulus). Researchers also use evidence of dishabituation to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as alternative explanations of the habituation process. Habituation of dishabituation can occur. The amount of dishabituation that occurs as a result of the introduction of a different stimulus can decrease after repeated presentation of the "dishabituating" stimulus.

Some habituation procedures appear to result in a habituation process that last days or weeks. This is considered long-term habituation. It persists over long durations of time (i.e., shows little or no spontaneous recovery). Long-term habituation can be distinguished from short-term habituation which is identified by the nine characteristics listed above.

Habituation can refer to a decrease in behavior, subjective experience, or synaptic transmission&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=j9jIJxhT39MC&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=Habituation+can+refer+to+a+decrease+in+behavior,+subjective+experience,+or+synaptic+transmission.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t9tO0h5-lF&amp;sig=JWRrdOoC1qXLiRFiNODhVpJN540&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCs8zs6dvdAhXSm-AKHZxFDHYQ6AEwAnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Habituation%20can%20refer%20to%20a%20decrease%20in%20behavior,%20subjective%20experience,%20or%20synaptic%20transmission.&amp;f=false|title=The World of Psychology|last=Reviews|first=C. T. I.|date=2016-09-26|publisher=Cram101 Textbook Reviews|isbn=9781619069558|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The changes in synaptic transmission that occur during habituation have been well-characterized in the [[Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex|''Aplysia'' gill and siphon withdrawal reflex]].

Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal and at least, in one species of plants (Mimosa pudica).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagliano|first=Monica|last2=Renton|first2=Michael|last3=Depczynski|first3=Martial|last4=Mancuso|first4=Stefano|date=2014-05-01|title=Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=175|issue=1|pages=63–72|doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7|issn=0029-8549}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental investigation of simple organisms such as the large protozoan ''[[Stentor coeruleus]]'' provides an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that are involved in the habituation process.&lt;ref name="wood1988"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1988|title=Habituation in ''Stentor'' produced by mechanoreceptor channel modification|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/8/7/2254|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=7|pages=2254–2258|last1=Wood|first1=D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroimaging===
Within psychology, habituation has been studied through different forms of neuroimaging like [[Positron emission tomography|PET scan]] and [[fMRI]]. Habituation is observed after repeated presentations of stimuli. Within fMRI, the stimuli's effect is measured using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Long-term decreases of the BOLD signal are interpreted as habituation, and long-term increases of the BOLD signal are interpreted as sensitization.&lt;ref name="2010 Mutschler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mutschler|first=Isabella|date=November 2010|title=Time Scales of Auditory Habituation in the Amygdala and Cerebral Cortex|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=20|pages=2531–2539|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhq001|author2=B. Wieckhorst|author3=O. Speck|author4=A. Schulze-Bonhage|author5=J. Hennig|author6=E.Seifritz|author7=T.Ball|pmid=20118185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[amygdala]] is one of the most-studied areas of the brain in relation to habituation. A common approach is to observe the visual processing of facial expressions. A study by Breiter and colleagues used fMRI scans to identify which areas of the brain habituate and at what rate.&lt;ref name="Breiter 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breiter|first=Hans|date=November 1996|title=Response and Habituation of the Human Amygdala during Visual Processing of Facial Expression|journal=Neuron|volume=17|issue=5|pages=875–887|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80219-6|pmid=8938120|author2=N. Etcoff|author3=P.Whalen|author4=W. Kennedy|author5=S.Rauch|author6=R. Buckner|author7=M. Srauss|author8=S. Hyman|author9=B.Rosen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their results showed that the human amygdala responds and rapidly habituates preferentially to fearful facial expressions over neutral ones. They also observed significant amygdala signal changes in response to happy faces over neutral faces.

Blackford, Allen, Cowan, and Avery (2012) compared the effect of an extremely inhibited temperament and an extremely uninhibited temperament on habituation. Their study found that over repeated presentations individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, whereas participants with an inhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in neither brain region. The researchers suggest that this failure to habituate reflects a social learning deficit in individuals with an extremely inhibited temperament, which is a possible mechanism for a higher risk of social anxiety.&lt;ref name="Blackford 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackford|first=Jennifer|date=January 2012|title=Amygdala and hippocampus fail to habituate to faces in individuals with an inhibited temperament|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=143–150|doi=10.1093/scan/nsr078|author2=A. Allen|author3=R. Cowan|author4=S. Avery|pmc=3575717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early studies relied on the demonstration of dishabituation (the brief recovery of the response to the eliciting stimulus when another stimulus is added) to distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation and fatigue. More recently, stimulus specificity and frequency-dependent spontaneous recovery have been identified as experimental evidence for the habituation process.&lt;ref name="rankin2009" /&gt; Sensitization is also conceptualized as a nonassociative process because it involves an increase in responding with repeated presentations to a single stimulus. Much less is understood about sensitization than habituation, but the sensitization process is often observed along with the habituation process.

==Theories==
In an article written 20 years after his initial research with Groves, renowned authority on the behavioral habituation, Richard F. Thompson, reviews several theories of the process of habituation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.F.|title=Habituation: A history|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=2009|volume=92|issue=2|pages=127–134|pmc=2714193|pmid=18703156|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2008.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include the Stimulus-Model Comparator theory formulated by Evgeny Sokolov&lt;ref name="sokolov"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sokolov|first=Y.N.|title=Sokolov, Y. N. (1963). Higher nervous functions: The orienting reflex. Annual|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|year=1963|volume=25|pages=545–580|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ph.25.030163.002553?journalCode=physiol|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.25.030163.002553}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Groves and Thompson dual-process theory.&lt;ref name="G&amp;t1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groves|first=P.M.|author2=Thompson, R. F.|title=Habituation: A dual-process theory.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1970|volume=77|issue=5|pages=419–450|doi=10.1037/h0029810|url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1980/A1980KM40400001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stimulus-model comparator theory ===
The stimulus-model comparator theory emerged from the research of Sokolov  who used the [[orienting response]] as the cornerstone of his studies, and operationally defining the orienting response as EEG activity. Orienting responses are heightened sensitivity experienced by an organism when exposed to a new or changing stimulus. Orienting responses can result in overt, observable behaviors as well as psychophysiological responses such as  EEG activity and undergo habituation with repeated presentation of the eliciting stimulus.  The Sokolov  model&lt;ref name=sokolov /&gt;  assumes that when a stimulus is experienced several times, the nervous system creates a model of the expected stimulus (a stimulus model). With additional presentations of the stimulus the experienced stimulus is compared with the stimulus model. If the experienced stimulus matches the stimulus model, responding is inhibited. At first the stimulus model is not a very good representation of the presented stimulus, and thus responding continues because of this mismatch. With additional presentations the stimulus model is improved, there is no longer a mismatch, and responding is inhibited causing habituation. However, if the stimulus is changed so that it no longer matches the stimulus model, the orienting response is no longer inhibited. Sokolov locates the stimulus model in the cerebral cortex.

=== Dual-process theory ===
The Groves and Thompson dual-process theory of habituation posits that two separate processes exist in the central nervous system that interacts to produce habituation. The two distinct processes  are a habituation process  and a sensitization process. The dual-process theory argues that  all noticeable stimuli will elicit both of these processes and that the behavioral output will reflect  a summation of both processes. The habituation process is decremental, whereas the sensitization process is incremental enhancing the tendency to respond. Thus when the habituation process exceeds the sensitization process behavior shows habituation, but if the sensitization process exceeds the habituation process, behavior shows sensitization. Groves and Thompson hypothesize  the existence of two neural pathways: an "S-R pathway" involved with the habituation process, and a "state pathway" involved with sensitization. The state system is seen as equivalent to a general state of arousal.&lt;ref name="G&amp;t1970" /&gt;

==Examples of the habituation process in animals and humans==
Habituation has been observed in an enormously wide range of species from motile single-celled organisms such as the amoeba&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/behavioroflowero00jenn|title=Behavior of the lower organisms|last=Jennings|first=H. S.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1906|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Stentor coeruleus''&lt;ref name="wood1988" /&gt; to sea slugs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinsker|first=Harold|last2=Kupfermann|first2=Irving|last3=Castellucci|first3=Vincent|last4=Kandel|first4=Eric|date=1970|title=Habituation and Dishabituation of the Gill-Withdrawal Reflex in Aplysia|jstor=1728291|journal=Science|volume=167|issue=3926|pages=1740–1742|doi=10.2307/1728291}}&lt;/ref&gt; to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pellegrino|first=R.|last2=Sinding|first2=C.|last3=Wijk|first3=R.A. de|last4=Hummel|first4=T.|title=Habituation and adaptation to odors in humans|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.04.006|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=177|pages=13–19|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Habituation processes are adaptive, allowing animals to adjust their innate behaviors to changes in their natural world. A natural animal instinct, for example,  is to protect themselves and their territory from any danger and potential predators. An animal needs to respond quickly to the sudden appearance of a predator. What may be less obvious is the importance of defensive responses to the sudden appearance of any new, unfamiliar stimulus, whether it is dangerous or not. An initial defensive response to a new stimulus is important because if an animal fails to respond to a potentially dangerous unknown stimulus, the results could be deadly. Despite this initial, innate defensive response to an unfamiliar stimulus, the response becomes habituated if the stimulus repeatedly occurs but causes no harm.  An example of this is the prairie dog habituating to humans. Prairie dogs give alarm calls when they detect a potentially dangerous stimulus.  This defensive call occurs when any mammal, snake, or large bird approaches them. However, they habituate to noises, such as human footsteps, that occur repeatedly but result in no harm to them. If prairie dogs never habituate to nonthreatening stimuli, they would be constantly sending out alarm calls and wasting their time and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/tofc1.html|title=Habituation|last=Breed|first=M.D.|work=Animal Behavior Online|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the habituation process in prairie dogs  may depend on several factors including the particular defensive response. In one study that measured several different responses to the repeated presence of humans, the alarm calls of prairie dogs showed habituation whereas the behavior of escaping into their burrows showed sensitization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magle|first=S.|year=2005|title=Behavioral responses to repeated human intrusions by black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys Ludovicianus)|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=86|issue=3|pages=524–530|doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2005)86[524:brtrhi]2.0.co;2|jstor=4094320|author2=Zhu, J.|author3=Crooks, K.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the importance of habituation in the animal world is provided by a study with harbor seals. In one study researchers measured the responses of harbor seals to underwater calls of different types of killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deecke|first=V. B.|year=2002|title=Selective habituation shapes acoustic predatory recognition in harbour seals|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6912/full/nature01030.html|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=171–173|doi=10.1038/nature01030|author2=Slater, P. J. B.|author3=Ford, J. K. B.|pmid=12432391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seals showed a strong response when they heard the calls of mammal-eating killer whales. However, they did not respond strongly when hearing familiar calls of the local fish-eating population.  The seals, therefore, are capable of habituating to the calls of harmless predators, in this case harmless killer whales. While some researchers prefer to simply describe the adaptive value of observable habituated behavior others find it useful to infer psychological processes from the observed behavior change. For example, habituation of aggressive responses in male bullfrogs has been explained as "an attentional or learning process that allows animals to form enduring mental representations of the physical properties of a repeated stimulus and to shift their focus of attention away from sources of irrelevant or unimportant stimulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bee|first=M.A.|year=2001|title=Habituation as a mechanism of reduced aggression between neighboring territorial male bullfrogs (rana catesbeiana)|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=115|issue=1|pages=68–82|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.115.1.68|pmid=11334221|author2=Gerhardt, H. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habituation of innate defensive behaviors is also adaptive in humans, such as habituation of a startle response to a sudden loud noise. But habituation is much more ubiquitous even in humans. An example of habituation that is an essential element of everyone's life is the changing response to food as it is repeatedly experienced during a meal. When people eat the same food during a meal, they begin to respond less to the food as they become habituated to the motivating properties of the food and decrease their consumption. Eating less during a meal is usually interpreted as reaching satiety or "getting full", but experiments suggest that habituation also plays an important role.  Many experiments with animals and humans have shown that providing variety in a meal increases the amount that is consumed in a meal, most likely because habituation is stimulus specific and because variety may introduce dishabituation effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raynor|first=H. A.|year=2001|title=Dietary variety, energy regulation, and obesity|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2001-17499-002|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=127|issue=3|pages=325–341|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.3.325|author2=Epstein, L. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Food variety also slows the rate of habituation in children and may be an important contributing factor to the recent increases in obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Temple|first=J.L.|date=January 2008|title=Dietary variety impairs habituation in children|journal=Health Psychology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=S10-S19|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.27.1.S10|pmc=2291292|pmid=18248101|author2=Giacomelli, A. M.|author3=Roemmich, J. N.|author4=Epstein, L. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We also find that habituation is found in our emotional responses, called the Opponent-Process Theory, proposed by researchers Richard Solomon and John Corbit (1974). It is known that responses by the subject tends to change by repetitively presenting certain stimuli. But concerning the opponent-process theory, some emotional reactions to the stimuli weaken (decrease) while others reactions are strengthened (increase). Take for example, that is the end of the semester at your university. You have been worried about your grade for the entire semester and you need to make  an A on the final in order to pass the course. You study efficiently for the test and after taking it, you feel that you will receive a very high grade. But once you check the gradebook, you see that you did not get an A on your exam. Instead you received a C+. Now you are distraught and know that there is no other way to pass the course for the semester. After a few minutes you begin to calm down and by the next hour you are back to your normal emotional state. This is an example of an emotional response explained by the opponent-process theory. It begins with an outside stimulus provoking an emotional reaction that increases rapidly until it is at its most intense (presumably after you learned that you did not receive a high letter grade). Gradually, your emotional state declines to a level lower than normal and eventually returns to neutral. This pattern coincides with two internal processes referred to as the a-process and b-process. The a-process, or "affective" response to a stimulus, is the initial emotional response one has and can be pleasant or unpleasant. The b-process is the after reaction and has a lower intensity than the a-process. The a-process is very fast-acting and ends as soon as the stimulus ends or is removed. Unlike the a-process, b-process is much slower in returning to baseline. Concerning the definition of the opponent process theory—repeated presentations present habituation—the a-process does not necessarily change. It is the b-process that is strengthened instead and rises more quickly to reach the highest intensity, and much slower in attempting to return to baseline after the stimulus is removed. To sum it all up, with the opponent-process theory, repeated presentations of the same stimulus will result in habituation, where subjects show little to no reaction. It is the after-reaction that is much larger and prolonged, than if an initial reaction to a stimulus occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, J. E. (2012). Learning &amp; Behavior (7/E). Pearson. 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of the habituation procedure==
Habituation procedures are used by researchers for many reasons. For example, in a study on aggression in female chimpanzees from a group known as the "''[[Kasakela Chimpanzee Community]]''", researchers habituated the chimpanzees by repeatedly exposing them to the presence of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pusey|first=A.|year=2008|title=Severe aggression among female pan troglodytes schweinfurthii at Gombe National Park, Tanzania|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/a285m61402186518/|journal=International Journal of Primatology|volume=29|issue=4|pages=949–973|doi=10.1007/s10764-008-9281-6|author2=Murray, C.|author3=Wallauer, W.|author4=Wilson, M.|author5=Wroblewski, E.|author6=Goodall, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts to habituate the chimpanzees before the field researchers studied the animal's behavior was necessary in order for them to eventually be able to note the natural behavior of the chimpanzees, instead of simply noting chimpanzee behavior as a response to the presence of the researchers. In another study, Mitumba chimpanzees in the Gombe National Park were habituated for at least four years before the introduction of systematic data collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=M. L.|year=2004|title=New cases of intergroup violence among chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania.|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/ijop/2004/00000025/00000003/00482810|journal=International Journal of Primatology|volume=2|pages=523–549|doi=10.1023/B:IJOP.0000023574.38219.92|author2=Wallauer, W. R.|author3=Pusey, A. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also use habituation and dishabituation procedures in the laboratory to study the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of human infants. The presentation of a visual stimulus to an infant elicits  looking behavior that habituates with repeated presentations of the stimulus. When changes to the habituated stimulus are made (or a new stimulus is introduced) the looking behavior returns (dishabituates). A recent fMRI study revealed  that the presentation of a dishabituating stimulus  has an observable, physical effect upon the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turk-Browne|first=N. B.|year=2008|title=Babies and brains: Habituation in infant cognition and functional neuroimaging|url=http://www.princeton.edu/ntblab/pdfs/Turk-Browne_FHN_2008.pdf|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=2|pages=1–11|doi=10.3389/neuro.09.016.2008|author2=Scholl, B. J.|author3=Chun, M. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study the mental spatial representations of infants were assessed using the phenomenon of dishabituation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=J.|year=1999|title=Objective spatial coding by 6.5-month-old infants in a visual dishabituation task|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7687.00087/abstract|journal=Developmental Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=432–441|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00087|author2=Needham, A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants were presented repeatedly with an object in the same position on a table. Once the infants habituated to the object (i.e., spent less time looking at it) either the object was spatially moved while the infant remained at the same place near the table or the object was left in the same place but the infant was moved to the opposite side of the table. In both cases the spatial relationship between the object and the infant had changed, but only in the former case did the object itself move. Would the infants know the difference? Or would they treat both cases as if the object itself moved?  The results revealed a return of looking behavior (dishabituation) when the object's position was changed, but not when the infant's position was changed.   Dishabituation indicates that infants perceived a significant change in the stimulus. Therefore, the infants understood when the object itself moved  and when it did not. Only when the object itself moved were they interested in it again (dishabituation), When the object remained in the same position as before it was perceived as the same old boring thing (habituation). In general, habituation/dishabituation procedures help researchers determine the way infants perceive their environments.

The habituation/dishabituation procedure is also used to discover the resolution of perceptual systems. For instance, by habituating someone to one stimulus, and then observing responses to similar ones, one can detect the smallest degree of difference that is detectable.

Behavioral homologies have been considered since at least 1958, when [[Konrad Lorenz]] studied the evolution of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |authorlink=Konrad Lorenz |title=The Evolution of Behavior |journal=Scientific American |year=1958 |volume=199 |issue=6 |pages=67–78 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1258-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the question of behavioral homologies has been addressed by [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] such as [[Marc Ereshefsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ereshefsky|first=Marc|title=Psychological categories as homologies: Lessons from ethology |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |year=2007|volume=22 |pages=659–674 |doi=10.1007/s10539-007-9091-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |title=Homology thinking |journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=March 2012 |doi=10.1007/s10539-012-9313-7 |volume=27 |pages=381–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychologists such as Drew Rendall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rendall |first=Drew |author2=Di Fiore |title=Homoplasy, homology, and the perceived special status of behavior in evolution |journal=Journal of Human Evolution|year=2007 |volume=52 |pages=504–521|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2006.11.014 |pmid=17383711}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neuroscientist]]s such as Georg Striedter and Glenn Northcutt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Striedter|first=Georg |author2=Northcutt |title=Biological hierarchies and the concept of homology|journal=Brain, Behavior and Evolution |year=1991 |volume=38 |pages=177–189 |doi=10.1159/000114387}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is debatable whether the concept of homology is useful in [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blumberg|first=Mark S.|title=Homology, correspondence, and continuity across development: The case of sleep |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |year=2013|volume=55 |issue=1|pages=92–100 |doi=10.1002/dev.21024 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21024/full |pmid=22711221 |pmc=3459138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop: Homology in Developmental Psychology|url=http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/homology/|accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore|first1=David S. |title=Importing the homology concept from biology into developmental psychology |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |date=January 2013|volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=13–21 |doi=10.1002/dev.21015|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21015/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman [[primates]], argue that patterns of behaviour in [[dominance hierarchies]] are homologous across the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajecki, D.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights City initiative emerged from the global [[human rights movement]], and it reflects efforts of activist groups to improve respect for human rights principles by governments and other powerful actors who operate at the local/community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social, and cultural rights]] as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy [[Civil and political rights|civil and political human rights]].

Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as “One whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.”&lt;ref&gt;''Human Rights Learning and Human Rights Cities: Achievements Report''.

== History of the Human Rights Cities movement ==
The Human Rights City initiative is the result of long-standing efforts of popular groups to defend and promote human rights, and thus represents an aspect of [[Human rights movement#Global human rights struggles|global human rights struggles]].

===Origins: From the Right to the City to the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning===

Contemporary human rights city initiatives grow directly from earlier organizing around rights claims in urban settings. The widespread nature of [[Urban Decay#urban problems|urban problems]] affecting peoples’ everyday lives and survival have generated similar types of responses in places around the world, helping account for the simultaneous emergence and consolidation of popular claims to the “[[right to the city]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The ‘Right to the City’ in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements|last = Meyer|first = Margit|date = 2009|journal = City|doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 13|issue = 2-3|pages = 362–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David Harvey]], “to invoke rights to the city means ‘to claim some kind of shaping power over the processes of urbanization, over the ways in which our cities are made and remade and to do so in a fundamental and radical way’."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rebel Cities: From the Right to the City to the Urban Revolution|last = Harvey|first = David|publisher = Verso|year = 2012|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas inspiring this movement first emerged in the 1970s, with many influenced by [[Henri Lefebvre|Henri Lefebvre’s]] 1968 book, ''Le Droit à la ville''. The movement has expanded and gained momentum around the world since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proliferation of [[Global Financial Crisis#global financial crises|global financial crises]], urban [[austerity]], and [[environmental damage]] has contributed to the rise of a growing number of cities around the world that are referring more explicitly to international human rights in their policies, statements, and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Austerity Urbanism: The Neoliberal Crisis of American Cities|last = Peck|first = Jamie|publisher = Rosa Luxemburg Foundation|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/austerity-urbanism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formally named “Human Rights Cities” initiative was launched by the People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning (PDHRE), which was formerly known as People’s Decade for Human Rights Education, in the wake of the 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna, Austria. The initiative aims to mobilize people in communities to “pursue a community-wide dialogue and to launch actions to improve the life and security of women, men and children based on human rights norms and standards.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights Cities: Civic Engagement for Societal Development|last = Marks|first = Stephen P.|publisher = People’s Movement for Human Rights Learning &amp; UN Habitat|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Modrowski|last3 = Lichem|first2 = Kathleen A.|first3 = Walther|url = http://www.pdhre.org/Human_Rights_Cities_Book.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is different from the traditional way that human rights are enforced and applied because of its emphasis on popular education, engagement, and culture as a necessary complement to government enforcement.

Human Rights Cities have grown in part because of the enhanced efforts by international agencies like [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Habitat]] to connect international legal regimes with municipal programs. As a result of globalized economic development processes, cities around the world are facing a similar host of urban problems, including a lack of [[affordable housing]], [[traffic congestion]] and [[Human Security#insufficient public services|insufficient public services]]. Cities have looked to international forums like the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN Conferences on Human Settlements]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the World Associations of Cities and Local Authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Human Rights Cities international consolidation (1998 - today)===
[[File:Korea-Gwangju 5392-06.JPG|thumb|336x336px|The city of [[Gwangju]] has been a pioneer in the implementation of the human rights cities framework in [[South Korea]]n and Asia, and has coorganized since 2011 the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].]]
1998 would suppose a breakthrough for the human rights movement both in terms of institutional consolidation as well as global outreach. At the European level, the Barcelona [[Conference Cities for Human Rights]] gathered more than 400 hundred local authorities uniting their voice and calling for a stronger political acknowledgment as key actors in safeguarding human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/right-to-the-city/european-charter |website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference process would culminate in 2 years after in the French city of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint Denis]]&lt;!--Most likely Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis - which is not a city--&gt; by the adoption of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] (2000). By the same time, the movement of human rights cities was also taking ground in Asia, as regional civil society organizations were about to launch the [[Asia Human Rights Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asia Human Rights Charter |url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/sites/default/files/Asian%20Human%20Rights%20Charter%20%281998%29.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gwangju]], 1998). Both charters would highlight the increasing role of local actors in promoting human rights as a way to reinforce local democracy and the place of human rights in the city in an increasingly urbanized world.

After the establishment of [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] as the first Human Rights City back in 1997, other local authorities in South America effectively embraced the human rights-based approach by placing a special emphasis on its link with the notion of [[right to the city]]. In 2001, the [[City Statute|City Statue]] of Brazil offered a renewed framework for promoting human rights and the social function of the city at a national scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/node/1947|title=The City Statute of Brazil: A Commentary {{!}} Cities Alliance|date=2011-08-09|website=www.citiesalliance.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico City]] is also among the pioneers in the development of the human rights cities notion: in the last decade, it has promoted the [[Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hic-gs.org/content/Mexico_Charter_R2C_2010.pdf|title=Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City|last=|first=|date=|website=UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; created mechanisms to monitor human rights at the local level and adopted a new constitution specifically based on the human rights approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/es/2017/02/04/ciudad-de-mexico-aprueba-su-primera-constitucion-y-estrena-nuevos-poderes/|title=Ciudad de México aprueba su primera constitución y estrena nuevos poderes|last=Linares|first=Marina Franco y Albinson|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Bogotá]] was also at the forefront in the implementation of the human rights approach, with the implementation of the [[Bogotá Humana]] policy (2013-2016) which took a specific emphasis on the rights of homeless people, women and elderly population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elespectador.com/opinion/opinion/el-adios-de-gustavo-petro-y-la-bogota-humana-columna-607861|title=El adiós de Gustavo Petro y la Bogotá Humana|date=2015-12-27|work=ELESPECTADOR.COM|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gustavopetroblog.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/estos-son-los-colegios-de-la-bogota-humana-una-politica-educativa-que-es-hito-mundial/comment-page-1/|title=Estos son los colegios de la Bogota Humana, Una política educativa que es hito mundial.|date=2016-07-04|work=Gustavo Petro Blog|access-date=2018-06-13|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/reports/rights-approach-through-bogot%C3%A1-humana-development-plan|title=The Rights Approach through the "Bogotá Humana" Development Plan {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, [[Montreal]] was a regional pioneer with the establishment of its local [[Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/charte_mtl_fr/media/documents/charte_montrealaise_english.pdf|title=Montreal City Charter of Rights and Responsibilities|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Monreal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Francisco]] has implemented policy translates and implements locally the rights of women as defined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/observatory/implementing-un-convention-women%E2%80%99s-rights-locally|title=Implementing the UN convention on women’s rights locally {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights in the United States|Human rights organizers in United States]] have nonetheless faced particular challenges due to the role of the U.S. in the world and to the U.S. failure to ratify most major [[International human rights instruments#international human rights treaties|international human rights treaties]]. However, in the 2000s, more U.S.-based activists have been working to raise international awareness of U.S. human rights violations, including [[racial discrimination in jury selection#racial discrimination|racial discrimination]] in the criminal justice system, [[Economic, social and cultural rights#economic human rights|economic human rights]] violations, and the [[Children's rights#rights of children|rights of children]]. In 2014 residents of Detroit who were losing access to clean water brought their case to the United Nations, which sent a Special Rapporteur&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/SRWaterIndex.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the city and issued a statement condemning practices that inhibited residents’ [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/detroit-and-the-evaporating-right-to-running-water/381731/|title=Detroit and the Evaporating Right to Running Water|last=Graham|first=David A.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue and others have encouraged more U.S. cities, including Baltimore Maryland, Mountain View California,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mv-voice.com/news/2015/07/19/dispute-over-human-rights-measure-in-mountain-view&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia South Carolina, to consider the human rights city model.

Throughout the last years, several examples around the world show a deepening on the concept and implications of human rights cities. In South Korea, Gwangju pioneered the establishment of a human rights municipal system (2009)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whrcf.org/E_index.php|title=세계인권도시포럼|last=세계인권도시포럼|website=www.whrcf.org|language=ko|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was quickly followed by cities such as [[Seoul]] (2012)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/news/latest-news/seoul-municipal-government-division-works-mainstream-rights-approach-local-public|title=In Seoul, a municipal government division works to mainstream the rights approach in local public action {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Busan]]. Gwangju has also been the main organizer of a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]] that has gathered hundreds of human rights cities on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/international-meetings/World-Human-Rights-Cities-Forum-of-Gwangju|title=World Human Rights Cities Forum (WHRCF) of Gwangju, South Korea {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All around Europe, cities such as Barcelona, [[Madrid]], [[Graz]] or [[Utrecht]] have established mechanisms to guarantee human rights and monitor their responsibilities under international human rights standards. Particular examples in this regard can be found in local government measures such as Barcelona’s “City of Rights” programme (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/premsa/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MesuraGovernBCDrets.pdf|title=Mesura de govern "Barcelona Ciutat de Drets"|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Barcelona|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Madrid’s “Strategic Plan for Human Rights Cities” (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diario.madrid.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PlanDDHH_PDF.pdf|title=Plan Estratégico de Derechos Humanos de Madrid|last=|first=|date=|website=City Council of Madrid|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cities and international law ==
All [[international human rights law]] is based in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which was adopted in 1948. This document outlines the inalienable and fundamental rights of humankind that are protected regardless of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, or any other social, economic, or political factor. The articles in the UDHR are not legally binding, but they are recognized as part of customary international law, and they authorize the development of binding international treaties, which countries may choose to sign and ratify. International human rights treaties and monitoring processes, however, privileges national governments and limits the role of local officials, whose cooperation in the implementation of international law is critical. The day-to-day work of implementing human rights standards often rests on the shoulders of local and regional authorities. They too are bound by these agreements. Local and regional authorities are often directly responsible for services related to health care, education, housing, water supply, environment, policing and also, in many cases, taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meyer | first1 = Margit | year = 2009 | title = The 'Right to the City' in the Context of Shifting Mottos of Urban Social Movements | url = | journal = City | volume = 13 | issue = 2-3| pages = 362–74 | doi = 10.1080/13604810902982755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

How cities implement human rights ideals varies from city to city. This allows for each city to develop a plan that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ips-dc.org/human_rights_city_toolkit/|title = Human Rights City Toolkit|date = March 2009|access-date = 2016-02-23|website = Institute for Policy Studies|publisher = |last = Karen|first = Dolan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

San Francisco is another such example, since its 1998 adoption of a city ordinance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the last years, the advance of the human rights cities movement has been assessed by several resolutions and statements of international organizations such as the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]] or the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/local-and-regional-authorities-speeches/-/asset_publisher/igylP6fCBzxu/content/respecting-and-fulfilling-human-rights-at-the-local-level?inheritRedirect=false&amp;desktop=true|title=Respecting and fulfilling human rights at the local level|work=Commissioner for Human Rights|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in this regard was the adoption by the Human Rights Council of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Advisory Committee|Advisory Committee]] Report A/HRC/30/49 on the “Role of local governments in the promotion and the protection of human rights”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/AdvisoryCommittee/Pages/LocalGovernmentAndHR.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} AdvisoryCommittee Local government and human rights|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed local governments responsibilities in the light of international human rights law, but most importantly, emphasized the opportunities posed by the human rights cities movement in promoting and protecting human rights due to their close relation with the needs and aspirations of city inhabitants. The Report promoted local governments participation in the drafting of national human rights strategies, and called to secure the necessary powers and financial resources for local administration to be able to comply with their human rights responsibilities. It enshrined as best practices the initiatives of various local governments and promoted networking as a way to advance the human rights cities movement, including some examples and best practices such as the [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju]] or the [[Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/activities/human-rights-cities/advocacy|title=International advocacy: Local governments are key for the promotion and the protection of human rights {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=Local authorities are close to citizens’ everyday needs and they deal with human right issues on an everyday basis. Therefore, there exists a clear and strong connection between human rights and local government. When performing their functions, local authorities take decisions relating in particular to education, housing, health, the environment, and law and order, which are directly connected with the implementation of human rights and which may enforce or weaken the possibilities of its inhabitants to enjoy their human rights. Furthermore, local government is always facing the risk of discriminatory practices against perceived outsiders, such as immigrants or ethnic minorities, to the local community.

}}The 2015 Report has received an intense follow up by the Human Rights Council constituency and other international and local governments organizations working for the advance of the human rights cities movement. As the world representative of local and regional governments, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] has for instance presented various statements to the Council and shared the Report’s recommendations among its constituency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2016, the Human Rights Council adopted a resolution (A/HRC/RES/33/8) “Recognizing the role of local government in the promotion and protection of human rights” and that “given its proximity to people and being at the grass-roots level, one of the important functions of local government is to provide public services that address local needs and priorities related to the realization of human rights at the local level”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session33/Pages/ResDecStat.aspx|title=OHCHR - Session 33: Resolutions, decisions and President’s statements|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2017, the same Council organized an intersessional panel discussion on the Report and the most recent advances in its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/PanelRoleLocalGovernment.aspx|title=OHCHR - HRC: Panel discussion on role of local government, 4 September 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by international human rights activists and by policymakers in the United Nations has helped spread ideas about how city governments can improve human rights implementation. In 2004, UNESCO helped establish the International Coalition of Cities against Racism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/fight-against-discrimination/coalition-of-cities/|title=International Coalition of Cities against Racism {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help municipal leaders exchange ideas and improve policies to fight [[racism]], [[discrimination]], [[xenophobia]] and [[social exclusion#exclusion|exclusion]]. The European Coalition of Cities against Racism (ECCAR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/|title=ECCAR|website=ECCAR|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of that effort, and it now has more than 104 municipalities in its membership and has adopted a ten-point action plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccar.info/10-point-plan-action|title=10 Points Action Plan|last=|website=ECCAR|language=en|access-date=2016-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Committee on Social Inclusion, Participative Democracy and Human Rights|UCLG Committee on Social Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights]] was created in the framework of the largest organization and world representative of local governments: [[United Cities and Local Governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uclg-cisdp.org/en/committee/strategic-plan/background|title=Background {{!}} CISDP|website=www.uclg-cisdp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee represents and facilitates the exchange between worldwide local authorities having a strong agenda on human rights ([[Mexico City]] and [[Gwangju]] were for instance two of its co-chairs in 2018). As relevant outcomes of more than 10 years of work for advancing the notion and recognition of human rights cities, the Committee has been in charge of the follow-up of the [[European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City]] and has created and promoted the [[Global Charter Agenda for Human Rights in the City]]. It has also carried out a strong political advocacy at a UN level for the recognition of local governments as key actors in the promotion and protection of human rights, and co-organized yearly a [[World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju|World Human Rights Cities Forum]].

Another relevant example in regards to concrete partnerships for advancing the human rights cities agenda are the so-called “action-research centers”. In this case, a local research center is generally at the forefront of mobilizing local authorities for the implementation of human rights at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kks.verdus.nl/upload/documents/HRC-Book.pdf|title=Human rights cities: Motivations, mechanisms and implications|last=|first=|date=|website=Kennis voor Krachtige Steden (KKS)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relevant examples in this regard can be found at a European&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yorkhumanrights.org/|title=York: Human Rights City - York Human Rights City|website=York Human Rights City|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/2016/09/lund-can-become-swedens-first-human-rights-city/|title=Lund Can Become Sweden’s First Human Rights City|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etc-graz.at/typo3/index.php?id=1011|title=ETC Graz: Human Rights City of Graz|website=www.etc-graz.at|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/netherlands-institute-of-human-rights-sim|title=Netherlands Institute of Human Rights (SIM)|date=2017-05-03|work=Utrecht University|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and North American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/our-work/project/national-human-rights-cities-alliance|title=National Human Rights Cities Alliance|date=2016-02-26|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ushrnetwork.org/resources-media/pittsburgh-human-rights-city-alliance-website|title=Pittsburgh Human Rights City Alliance Website|date=2015-09-15|work=US Human Rights Network|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; levels. One of the most advanced examples on how can a local research center scale up and become a global actor in the promotion of the human rights agenda is the [[Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law|Raoul Wallenberg Institute]]. Although being affiliated to [[Lund University]] since 1984, the Institute's outreach has nonetheless gone beyond its local or even national level, as it now carries out projects in different regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rwi.lu.se/|title=Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights|website=rwi.lu.se|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. These "definition languages" were developed under funding from [[U.S. Air Force]] and although still most commonly used by them, as well as other military and [[United States Department of Defense|United States Department of Defense (DoD)]] agencies, are in the [[public domain]].

The most-widely recognized and used components of the IDEF family are [[IDEF0]], a [[functional model]]ing language building on [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|SADT]], and [[IDEF1X]], which addresses [[Data model|information models]] and [[database design]] issues.

== Overview of IDEF methods ==
IDEF refers to a family of [[modeling language]], which cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design and knowledge acquisition. Eventually the IDEF methods have been defined up to IDEF14:

* IDEF10 : Implementation architecture modeling
* IDEF11 : Information artifact modeling
* IDEF12 : Organization modeling
* IDEF13 : Three schema mapping design
* [[IDEF14]] : Network design

In 1995 only the [[IDEF0]], [[IDEF1X]], [[IDEF2]], [[IDEF3]] and [[IDEF4]] had been developed in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Hanrahan [http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp The IDEF Process Modeling Methodology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126094915/http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/1995/06/IDEF.asp |date=2007-01-26 }}. Software Technology Support Center. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other IDEF concepts had some preliminary design. Some of the last efforts were new IDEF developments in 1995 toward establishing reliable methods for business constraint discovery [[IDEF9]], design rationale capture [[IDEF6]], human system, interaction design [[IDEF8]], and network design [[IDEF14]].&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

The methods IDEF7, IDEF10, IDEF11, IDEF 12 and IDEF13 haven't been developed any further than their initial definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/idef-standards-overview-18730 Observations from a Tech Architect: Enterprise Implementation Issues &amp; Solutions] Craig Borysowich.

== History ==
IDEF originally stood for ''[[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] Definition'', initiated in the 1970s at the US Air Force Materials Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio by [[Dennis E. Wisnosky]], Dan L. Shunk and others.&lt;ref name="Sav96"&gt;Charles M. Savage (1996). ''Fifth Generation Management : Co-creating Through Virtual Enterprising, Dynamic Teaming, and Knowledge Networking'' Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7506-9701-6}}. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and completed in the 1980s. IDEF was a product of the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) initiative of the [[United States Air Force]]. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] recast the IDEF abbreviation as "Integration DEFinition."&lt;ref name="IEEE IDEF Ref"/&gt;

The specific projects that produced IDEF were ICAM project priorities 111 and 112 (later renumbered 1102). The subsequent Integrated Information Support System (IISS) project priorities 6201, 6202, and 6203 attempted to create an [[information processing]] environment that could be run in [[heterogeneous]] physical computing environments. Further development of IDEF occurred under those projects as a result of the experience gained from applications of the new modeling techniques. The intent of the IISS efforts was to create 'generic subsystems' that could be used by a large number of collaborating enterprises, such as U.S. [[defense contractor]]s and the armed forces of friendly nations.

At the time of the ICAM 1102 effort there were numerous, mostly incompatible, [[data model]] methods for storing computer data &amp;mdash; [[Sequential access|sequential]] ([[VSAM]]), [[Hierarchical model|hierarchical]] ([[Information Management System|IMS]]), [[Network model|network]] ([[Cincom]]'s TOTAL and [[CODASYL]], and [[Cullinet]]'s [[IDMS]]). The [[relational data model]] was just emerging as a promising way of thinking about structuring data for easy, efficient, and accurate access. [[Relational database management system|Relational database management systems]] had not yet emerged as a general standard for data management.

The ICAM program office deemed it valuable to create a "neutral" way of describing the data content of large-scale systems. The emerging academic literature suggested that methods were needed to process [[Data independence|data independently]] of the way it was [[data structure|physically stored]]. Thus the IDEF1 language was created to allow a neutral description of data structures that could be applied regardless of the storage method or file access method.

IDEF1 was developed under ICAM program priority 1102 by Dr Robert R. Brown of the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]], under contract to [[SofTech, Inc.]] Dr Brown had previously been responsible for the development of [[Information Management System|IMS]] while working at [[Rockwell International]]. Rockwell chose not to pursue IMS as a marketable product but [[International Business Machines|IBM]], which had served as a support contractor during development, subsequently took over the product and was successful in further developing it for market. Dr Brown credits his Hughes' colleague Mr Timothy Ramey as the inventor of IDEF1 as a viable formalism for modeling information structures. The two Hughes' researchers built on ideas from and interactions with many luminaries in the field at the time. In particular, IDEF1 draws on the following techniques:
* the evolving natural language information model ([[NIAM|ENALIM]]) technique of [[G. M. Nijssen|Dr G. M. Nijssen]] ([[Control Data Corporation]]) — this technique is now more widely known as [[NIAM]] or the object-role model [[Object-role modeling|ORM]];
* the network data structures technique, popularly called the [[CODASYL]] approach, of [[Charles Bachman|Dr Charles Bachman]] ([[Honeywell Information Systems]]);
* the hierarchical data management technique, implemented in IBM's IMS data management system, developed by [[R. R. Brown|Dr R. R. Brown]] ([[Rockwell International]]);

The effort to develop IDEF1 resulted in both a new method for information modeling and an example of its use in the form of a "reference information model of manufacturing." This latter artifact was developed by D. S. Coleman of the D. Appleton Company (DACOM) acting as a sub-contractor to Hughes and under the direction of Mr Ramey. Personnel at DACOM became quite expert at IDEF1 modeling and subsequently produced a training course and accompanying materials for the IDEF1 modeling technique.

Experience with IDEF1 revealed that the translation of ''information requirements'' into ''database designs'' was more difficult than had originally been anticipated. The most beneficial value of the IDEF1 information modeling technique was its ability to represent data independent of how those data were to be stored and used. It provided data modelers and data analysts with a way to represent ''data requirements'' during the requirements-gathering process. This allowed designers to decide which DBMS to use after the nature of the data requirements was understood and thus reduced the "misfit" between data requirements and the capabilities and limitations of the DBMS. The translation of IDEF1 models to database designs, however, proved to be difficult.

{{main|IDEF0}}
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|280px|thumb|Example of an [[IDEF0]] diagram: a [[function model]] of the process of maintaining reparable spares]]

The IDEF0 functional modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique|structured analysis and design technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]]. In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a [[function model]] method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;

=== IDEF1X ===
{{main|IDEF1X}}
[[Image:B 5 1 IDEF1X Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Example of an [[IDEF1X]] diagram]]

To satisfy the [[data modeling]] enhancement requirements that were identified in the IISS-6202 project, a sub-contractor, [[DACOM]], obtained a license to the [[logical database design technique]] (LDDT) and its supporting software (ADAM). LDDT had been developed in 1982 by Robert G. Brown of The Database Design Group entirely outside the IDEF program and with no knowledge of IDEF1. LDDT combined elements of the relational data model, the E-R model, and generalization in a way specifically intended to support data modeling and the transformation of the data models into database designs. The graphic syntax of LDDT differed from that of IDEF1 and, more importantly, LDDT contained interrelated modeling concepts not present in IDEF1. Mary E. Loomis wrote a concise summary of the syntax and semantics of a substantial subset of LDDT, using terminology compatible with IDEF1 wherever possible. DACOM labeled the result [[IDEF1X]] and supplied it to the ICAM program.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE (1998). ''IEEE Std 1320.2-1998. IEEE Standard for Conceptual Modeling Language Syntax and Semantics for IDEF1X''. New York. p. iii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Thomas A. (1992), Designing Quality Databases with IDEF1X Information Models, {{ISBN|0-932633-18-8}} p=xii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because the IDEF program was funded by the government, the techniques are in the [[public domain]]. In addition to the ADAM software, sold by DACOM under the name Leverage, a number of [[Computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tools use [[IDEF1X]] as their representation technique for data modeling. 

The IISS projects actually produced working prototypes of an information processing environment that would run in heterogeneous computing environments. Current advancements in such techniques as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[JDBC]] are now achieving the goals of ubiquity and versatility across computing environments which was first demonstrated by IISS.

=== IDEF2 and IDEF3 ===
{{main|IDEF3}}
[[File:2-03 Example of an Enhanced Transition Schematic.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of an enhanced transition schematic, modelled with [[IDEF3]]]]

The third IDEF (IDEF2) was originally intended as a user interface modeling method. However, since the [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) program needed a simulation modeling tool, the resulting IDEF2 was a method for representing the time varying behavior of resources in a manufacturing system, providing a framework for specification of math model based simulations. It was the intent of the methodology program within [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing|ICAM]] to rectify this situation but limitation of funding did not allow this to happen. As a result, the lack of a method which would support the structuring of descriptions of the [[user view]] of a system has been a major shortcoming of the IDEF system. The basic problem from a methodology point of view is the need to distinguish between a description of what a system (existing or proposed) is supposed to do and a representative simulation model that will predict what a system will do. The latter was the focus of [[IDEF2]], the former is the focus of [[IDEF3]].&lt;ref name="FB89"&gt;Patricia Griffith Friel and Thomas M. Blinn (1989). [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910023489_1991023489.pdf "Automated IDEF3 and IDEF4 Systems Design Specification Document"]. Technical report. NASA Johnson Space Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF4 ===
{{main|IDEF4}}
[[File:118 The Behavior Diagram for methods Implementing Louder.jpg|thumb|left|210px|[[IDEF4]] behavior diagram]]

The development of [[IDEF4]] came from the recognition that the modularity, maintainability and code reusability that results from the [[object-oriented programming]] paradigm can be realized in traditional [[data processing]] applications. The proven ability of the object-oriented programming paradigm to support data level integration in large complex [[distributed system]]s is also a major factor in the widespread interest in this technology from the traditional data processing community.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

[[IDEF4]] was developed as a design tool for software designers who use object-oriented languages such as the [[Common Lisp Object System]], [[Flavors (programming language)|Flavors]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Objective-C]], [[C++]], and others. Since effective usage of the object-oriented paradigm requires a different thought process than used with conventional procedural or [[database language]]s, standard methodologies such as [[structure chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, and traditional [[database model|data design model]]s (hierarchical, relational, and network) are not sufficient. IDEF4 seeks to provide the necessary facilities to support the object-oriented design decision making process.&lt;ref name="FB89"/&gt;

=== IDEF5 ===
{{main|IDEF5}}
[[Image:4-54 Composition Schematic for Ballpoint.jpg|thumb|240px|Example of an [[IDEF5]] composition schematic for a ballpoint pen]]

[[IDEF5]], or ''integrated definition for ontology description capture method'', is a software engineering method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].&lt;ref name="PCB94"&gt;Perakath C. Benjamin et al. (1994). [http://www.idef.com/pdf/Idef5.pdf ''IDEF5 Method Report'']. Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of computer science ontologies are used to capture the [[concept and object]]s in a specific [[Domain analysis|domain]], along with associated relationships and meanings. In addition, ontology capture helps coordinate projects by standardizing [[terminology]] and creates opportunities for [[information]] reuse. The IDEF5 Ontology Capture Method has been developed to reliably construct ontologies in a way that closely reflects human [[understanding]] of the specific domain.&lt;ref name="PCB94"/&gt;

In the IDEF5 method, an ontology is constructed by capturing the content of certain assertions about real-world objects, their properties and their interrelationships, and representing that content in an intuitive and natural form. The IDEF5 method has three main components: A graphical language to support conceptual ontology analysis, a structured text language for detailed ontology characterization, and a systematic procedure that provides guidelines for effective ontology capture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Varun Grover, William J. Kettinger (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.176-178&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF6 ===
{{main|IDEF6}}
[[File:IIDEF4 Design Activities.jpg|thumb|210px|left|IDEF6 model of IDEF4 design activities]]

[[IDEF6]], or ''integrated definition for design rationale capture'', is a method to facilitate the acquisition, representation, and manipulation of the [[design rationale]] used in the development of [[enterprise systems]]. Rationale is the reason, justification, underlying motivation, or excuse that moved the designer to select a particular strategy or design feature. More simply, rationale is interpreted as the answer to the question, “Why is this design being done in this manner?” Most design methods focus on what the design is (i.e. on the final product, rather than why the design is the way it is).&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt; 

IDEF6 will be a method that possesses the conceptual resources and linguistic capabilities needed
# to represent the nature and structure of the information that constitutes design rationale within a given system, and
# to associate that rationale with design specifications, models, and documentation for the system.
IDEF6 is applicable to all phases of the information system development process, from initial conceptualization through both preliminary and detailed design activities. To the extent that detailed design decisions for software systems are relegated to the coding phase, the IDEF6 technique should be usable during the software construction process as well.&lt;ref name= "MGM90"&gt;[[Richard J. Mayer|Mayer, Richard J.]] ; Griffith, Patricia A. ; Menzel, Christopher P. (1990-91) [http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&amp;verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA261594 "IDEF6: A Design Rationale Capture Method Concept Paper"] Defense Technical Information Center&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IDEF8 ===
IDEF8, or ''integrated definition for human-system interaction design'', is a method for producing high-quality designs of interactions between users and the systems they operate. Systems are characterized as a collection of objects that perform functions to accomplish a particular goal. The system with which the user interacts can be any system, not necessarily a computer program. Human-system interactions are designed at three levels of specification within the IDEF8 method. The first level defines the philosophy of system operation and produces a set of models and textual descriptions of overall system processes. The second level of design specifies role-centered scenarios of system use. The third level of IDEF8 design is for human-system design detailing. At this level of design, IDEF8 provides a library of metaphors to help users and designers specify the desired behavior in terms of other objects whose behavior is more familiar. Metaphors provide a model of abstract concepts in terms of familiar, concrete objects and experiences.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF9 ===
[[File:Typical business systems.jpg|thumb|320px|Typical business systems]]

IDEF9, or ''integrated definition for business constraint discovery'', is designed to assist in the discovery and analysis of constraints in a [[business system]]. A primary motivation driving the development of IDEF9 was an acknowledgment that the collection of constraints that forge an enterprise system is generally poorly defined. The knowledge of what constraints exist and how those constraints interact is incomplete, disjoint, distributed, and often completely unknown. This situation is not necessarily alarming. Just as living organisms do not need to be aware of the genetic or autonomous constraints that govern certain behaviors, organizations can (and most do) perform well without explicit knowledge of the glue that structures the system. In order to modify business in a predictable manner, however, the knowledge of these constraints is as critical as knowledge of genetics is to the genetic engineer.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

=== IDEF14 ===
IDEF14, or ''integrated definition for network design method'', is a method that targets the modeling and design of [[computer network|computer]] and [[communication network]]s. It can be used to model existing ("as is") or envisioned ("to be") networks. It helps the network designer to investigate potential network designs and to document design rationale. The fundamental goals of the IDEF14 research project developed from a perceived need for good network designs that can be implemented quickly and accurately.&lt;ref name="May05"/&gt;

'''Kammapatha''', in [[Buddhism]], refers to the ten wholesome and unwholesome courses of action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]).

Among the ten in the two sets, three are bodily, four are verbal, and three are mental. The ten courses of unwholesome kamma may be listed as follows, divided by way of their doors of expression: 

# Destroying life
# Taking what is not given
# Wrong conduct in regard to sense pleasures
# False speech
# Slanderous speech
# Harsh speech
# Idle chatter
# Covetousness
# Ill will
# Wrong view

The ten courses of wholesome kamma are the opposites of these: abstaining from the first seven courses of unwholesome kamma, being free from covetousness and ill will, and holding right view. Though the seven cases of abstinence are exercised entirely by the mind and do not necessarily entail overt action, they are still designated wholesome bodily and verbal action because they center on the control of the faculties of body and speech. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html The Noble Eightfold Path by Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kees Boeke (1939).jpg|right|thumb]]
'''Cornelis Boeke''' (25 September 1884, [[Alkmaar]] – 3 July 1966, [[Abcoude]]), usually known as '''Kees Boeke''', was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] reformist [[educator]], [[Quaker]] [[missionary]] and [[pacifist]]. He is best known for his popular essay/book ''[[Cosmic View]]'' (1957) which presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale, and which inspired several films.

Boeke tried to reform education by allowing  the children to contribute their ideas. He called this process [[sociocracy]] and regarded schools as  workshops, with pupils as workers, and teachers as co-workers.  Based on [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] ideas, he wanted the  children  to respect  [[democracy]].  In 1926, he founded a school  in [[Bilthoven]], which he led until 1954. As a child, the later Dutch [[Queen Beatrix]]  attended the school.

==Biography==
Kees Boeke grew up in a [[Mennonite]] family in Alkmaar. He studied [[architecture]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]]. As a student, he spent a year in [[England]], where he met the Quakers. He became a Quaker and attended [[Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre]], a college in [[Selly Oak]], [[Birmingham]]. There, he found inspiration in [[Bournville]], the garden village which the [[Cadbury]] family (owners of the chocolate factory) had built for their workers. He met and married Beatrice (Betty) Cadbury. The couple went to [[Syria]] in 1912 as Quaker missionaries. In 1914, after the outbreak of [[World War I]], they returned to England. They became active in peace work, the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] having come into being in 1914 through [[Henry Hodgkin]]. In 1915 Boeke traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]], with whom Hodgkin had been working at the outbreak of war. Boeke began to speak publicly in England: "The Germans are our brothers; God did not create man that he might kill; the war will find its quickest end when all soldiers lay down their weapons." He was deported from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and returned to the Netherlands. His family followed; there they lived in Bilthoven, near [[Utrecht]]. Their home soon became a pacifist centre. Later in the Second World War Boeke took part in the underground Dutch resistance movement against the same Germans, he called brothers before. This was, however, in line with his ideas of anti-authority and his disapproval of war and prosecution.

After the First World War, Boeke erected a large conference centre in Bilthoven, which he called "Brotherhood House." The first international peace conference took place there between 4 and 11 October 1919. Present at the conference were [[Leon Revoyne]], [[Mathilda Wrede]], [[Leonard Ragaz]], [[Pierre Ceresole]], as well as Hodgkin and Schultze. Boeke and Ceresole became the secretaries of this movement, which initially called itself "Christian International", later the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]]. Together with [[Helene Stöcker]],  and [[Wilfred Wellock]], they founded the [[Service Civil International]] and in 1921 "Paco" (the [[Esperanto]] word for peace), which in 1923 became [[War Resisters' International]] (WRI).

Kees and Betty Boeke considered war to be rooted in the entanglement of the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]]. As Betty was a Cadbury, she inherited large shares in her family's firm. She transferred this money to various charitable organizations such as the Quaker-Help Organisation in Russia in 1920. Later, she gave the shares to a trust for the workers of the Cadbury factory. For a while, the Boekes abstained from using money, so as to avoid contributing to the state — since public funds are also spent on weapons. They never used public transport, nor did they pay postage, tolls, or taxes. As a result, they were imprisoned several times. On one occasion the Dutch tax authorities auctioned off the estate in order to recover taxes. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] was in attendance at the auction, and purchased Kees' favorite violin, only to return it to him on the spot. Boeke supported his family by working in Utrecht in a building association which he had founded; he did not work as an architect (which was his training), but as a simple worker.
 
In the late 1920s Boeke increasingly withdrew from international peace movements. Believing he could build a better society through educating children, he started a school called "De werkplaats" (the workshop). He founded his school in 1926 when all private schools, including the [[Montessori school]] his children attended, started receiving an equal amount of money per child from the state, to which he objected.
[[File:Kees Boeke (1946).jpg|thumb|Kees Boeke with [[Beatrix of the Netherlands]] (right) in 1946]]
His school, which uses [[Montessori method|Maria Montessori's methods]], extended by Boeke's own educational ideas, became nationally known; even the Dutch queen Juliana sent her daughters there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/40041487/ (Dutch) De school van Beatrix.] [[Andere Tijden]], 25 september 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The school has been hugely influential for its creative way of making the students co-responsible for their own curriculum, together with the teachers; many students who failed in regular schools have blossomed at "De werkplaats", but on the other hand many talented children could not reach a high level in this school.

Co-responsibility in school did not mean a freewheeling life at "the Werkplaats". Children had to perform tasks such as cleaning the school, growing vegetables and fruits, and helping with lunch cooking. Boeke's notion of sociocracy was, in effect, a secular implementation of the Quaker ideals applied to education in such a way that children were treated as adults, and were on  first-name terms with their teachers.

Boeke wrote a major book on education[what is its title, etc.?!]. One of his last works was [[Cosmic View]] (New York 1957). He died in 1966 in the company of his family.

==Legacy==
Boeke's system of [[sociocracy]] survives today and was expanded upon in the work of a well-known student of the school, Dr. [[Gerard Endenburg]], who in the 1960s and '70s developed a governance and decision-making methodology by the same name while directing the [[Endenburg Electrotechniek]] company.

Boeke's essay/book [[Cosmic View]] (1957) presents a seminal view of the universe, from the galactic to the microscopic scale. It inspired several films:

* ''[[Cosmic Zoom]]'' (1968) produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] 
* ''[[Powers of Ten (film)|Powers of Ten]]'' (1968; new version in 1977) by [[Charles and Ray Eames]] 
* The [[IMAX]] film ''[[Cosmic Voyage]]'' (1996) produced for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].
* "Superpowers of Ten" (2013), a theater piece produced by [[Andrés Jaque]] and performed at the Lisbon Triennial, the Chicago Architectural Biennial, [[Museo Jumex]] in Mexico and [[ZKM]] in Karlsruhe 
''Cosmic View'' is mentioned as an inspiration by [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of a [[video game]], ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/14/games Cosmic view, inspiration for a video game.] The Guardian, 14 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kunkunshi''' ({{native name|ryu|工工四}} {{IPA-ryu|kuŋkunshiː|pron}}) is the traditional notation system by which music is recorded in the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The term ''kunkunshi'' originally referred to the first three notes of a widely known Chinese melody, although today it is used almost exclusively in reference to the sheet music.{{sfn|Garfias|1993|p=117}}

Kunkunshi is believed to have been first developed by [[Mongaku Terukina]] or by his student {{ill|Choki Yakabi|ja|屋嘉比朝寄}} in the early to mid-1700s. However, it was not until the end of the 19th century that the form became standardized for writing [[sanshin]] music.{{sfn|Thompson|2008|p=317}} Yakabi is attributed to having written the earliest known, surviving collection of kunkunshi. The ''Yakabi Kunkunshi'' consists of 117 compositions written in the ''kaki nagashi'' style. In this form, the sanshin finger positions are written in a flowing style with no indication of rhythm. {{sfnm|Thompson|2008|1p=317|Garfias|1993|2p=117}}

In 2017, Southern supported the white [[identitarian]] group [[Defend Europe]] opposing the action of non-governmental organizations involved in [[search-and-rescue]] operations in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Political career==
In 2015, Southern was a candidate in the [[2015 Canadian federal election]] representing the [[Libertarian Party of Canada|Libertarian Party]] in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|district]] of [[Langley—Aldergrove]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/lauren-southern-libertarian/|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|title=Meet the Canadian college student who's about to be the next enemy of the feminist movement|first=Marisa|last=Kabas|date=15 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728105328/http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/lauren-southern-libertarian/|archivedate=28 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was briefly removed by the party as a candidate, but was eventually reinstated with support from [[Breitbart News]] and [[The Rebel Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Claxton|first1=Matthew|title=Former Langley Libertarian candidate detained in Italy - Abbotsford News|url=http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy/|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Abbotsford News|date=17 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517213951/http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy/|archivedate=17 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was eventually won by [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate [[Mark Warawa]]. Southern finished last, having received 535 votes, or 0.9% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Voting Results {{!}} British Columbia, Langley—Aldergrove {{!}} Forty-second General Election, 2015|url=http://www.elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2015app/41/9800e.html|website=www.elections.ca|accessdate=13 December 2017|language=en-ca|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815205225/http://elections.ca/res/rep/off/ovr2015app/41/9800e.html|archivedate=15 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
In June 2015 while reporting on the [[Vancouver]] [[SlutWalk]] for [[Rebel Media]], Southern's cameraman was shoved and Southern's protest sign stating "There Is No Rape Culture In The West" was torn up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-triggering-is-dumb/|last=Lachenal|first=Jessica|date=9 March 2016|website=TheMarySue|access-date=3 September 2016|title=Internet Jerks Pledge to Make Internet Even Worse in #TheTriggering|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923230529/http://www.themarysue.com/the-triggering-is-dumb|archivedate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Cloutier: ''[http://www.tvqc.com/2015/06/lauren-southern-troll-la-slutwalk-en-disant-il-ny-a-pas-de-culture-du-viol-en-occident Lauren Southern troll la SlutWalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701003911/http://www.tvqc.com/2015/06/lauren-southern-troll-la-slutwalk-en-disant-il-ny-a-pas-de-culture-du-viol-en-occident|date=1 July 2017}}'' (in French). In: TVQC, 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, a protester in Vancouver poured a container of urine over Southern's head while she was engaging with LGBTQ protesters at a rally in Vancouver, arguing for [[gender binary|two human genders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/activist-pours-bottle-of-urine-on-rebel-reporter-during-anti-fascist-in-vancouver|title=Activist accused of pouring bottle of urine on Rebel reporter during 'anti-fascist' rally in Vancouver|last=Raptis|first=Mike|date=7 March 2016|website=[[National Post]]|access-date=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Raptis: ''[http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/07/activist-pours-urine-onto-reporters-head Activist pours urine]'' In: [[Toronto Sun]], 2016/03/07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/31043202/protester-pours-urine-on-journalist-for-hateful-comments|title=Protester pours urine on journalist for 'hateful' comments|last=Christian|first=Natasha|date=8 March 2016|website=Yahoo7|access-date=21 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611014851/https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/31043202/protester-pours-urine-on-journalist-for-hateful-comments|archivedate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern was mistakenly suspended from [[Facebook]], having criticized the site for banning several conservative commentators. She later received an email apology from Facebook saying the suspension was an "error".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3603345/Conservative-activist-Lauren-Southern-banned-Facebook-mentioning-censorship.html Trump supporter BLOCKED by Facebook for complaining about site's censorship of right-wing activists] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20160522160537/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3603345/Conservative-activist-Lauren-Southern-banned-Facebook-mentioning-censorship.html|date=22 May 2016}}{{better source|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-troll-booth-1464026102|title=The Troll Booth|last=Taranto|first=James|date=23 May 2016|website=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=3 September 2016|subscription=yes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827113820/http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-troll-booth-1464026102|archivedate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please discuss on the talkpage before editing this section --&gt;

In May 2017, Southern took part in an attempt organized by the identitarian group ''[[Les Identitaires#G.C3.A9n.C3.A9ration Identitaire|Génération identitare]]'' to block the passage of an [[NGO]] ship, the [[Aquarius (NGO ship)|''Aquarius'']] (co-owned by SOS Mediterranée and by [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]]), which was leaving Sicily to start a search-and-rescue mission for ship-wrecked migrants off the shores of Northern Africa. Claiming that the goal of the activists "was to stop an empty boat from going down to Libya and filling up with illegal migrants", Southern was briefly detained by the [[Italian Coast Guard]]. NGO ships often rescue migrants and refugees, who disembark from Libyan shores on unsafe makeshift rafts, and bring them to Sicily.&lt;ref name="abbynews"&gt;Matthew Claxton: ''[http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy  Former Langley Libertarian candidate detained in Italy] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170517213951/http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy|date= 17 May 2017}}.''

In: ''[[il Giornale]]'', 13 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to her actions, Southern stated that "if the politicians won't stop the boats, we'll stop the boats."&lt;ref name="Claxton2017"/&gt;

Southern supported similar actions by identitarian group [[Defend Europe]], which chartered a vessel in order to track and stop what it called collusion between NGOs and human traffickers. The group has been accused{{by whom|date= March 2018}} of intending to obstruct the rescue of migrants and refugees in distress at sea. In July 2017, Southern revealed that [[Patreon]] had deleted her account out of concerns about her "raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|title= PATREON BANNED MY ACCOUNT??|last= Lauren Southern|date= 21 July 2017|publisher= YouTube|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170723023740/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|archivedate= 23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern denied these allegations, stating that Defend Europe's actions were likely to save lives and that none of her funding went towards the group.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news

===United Kingdom-related events===
In February 2018, Southern, along with Brittany Pettibone and Caolan Robertson, distributed flyers in the English town of [[Luton]]  describing Allah as "gay".&lt;ref name="BBC_Entry"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43393035|title=Why 3 anti-Islam activists were refused entry to the UK|work=[[BBC News]]|date=14 March 2018|accessdate=3 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318142459/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43393035|archivedate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Southern, Pettibone, and Pettibone's boyfriend, [[Martin Sellner]], were all denied entry to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Bachmann"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lutz Bachmann: Founder of far-right anti-Islam group Pegida barred from entry to UK and deported|work=[[The Independent|Independent]]|first=Maya|last=Oppenheim|date=18 March 2018|accessdate=17 April 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lutz-bachmann-pegida-detained-stansted-deported-a8262131.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319180728/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lutz-bachmann-pegida-detained-stansted-deported-a8262131.html|archivedate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern was also questioned under the Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC_Entry"/&gt; Her denial of entry was due to her intentions during her March visit&lt;ref name=NationalPost/&gt; and on the same grounds as Pettibone and [[Martin Sellner|Sellner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British authorities ban three foreign right-wing activists|work=[[Reuters]]|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|date=12 March 2018|accessdate=3 April 2018|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-deportations/british-authorities-ban-three-foreign-right-wing-activists-idUSKCN1GO2LN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320082821/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-security-deportations/british-authorities-ban-three-foreign-right-wing-activists-idUSKCN1GO2LN|archivedate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 Australian tour===
Shortly before a planned speaking tour of Australia in July 2018, Australia's Department of Home Affairs denied Lauren Southern an Electronic Travel Authority visa, saying it was "not a working visa".&lt;ref name="workvisa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Visa approved for Canadian who warns Australian way of life is under threat |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/visa-approved-for-canadian-who-warns-australian-way-of-life-is-under-threat |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |accessdate=10 July 2018 |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She intended to charge $79 for a basic ticket and up to $749 for an "intimate dinner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chung |first1=Frank |title=Australian government declines visa for right-wing activist Lauren Southern ahead of speaking tour |url=https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/australian-government-declines-visa-for-rightwing-activist-lauren-southern-ahead-of-speaking-tour/news-story/7b9a15a56981e4508e5305887f85c0e3 |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=news.com.au |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government allowed her to enter the country once she had the correct visa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/rightwing-activist-lauren-southerns-australian-visa-approved-after-unusually-prolonged-process/news-story/5e3611992c9edfeb2c65b9db47d901d0&lt;/ref&gt; Arriving at [[Brisbane]] airport, she was wearing an "[[It's OK to be white]]" shirt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/it-s-ok-to-be-white-far-right-youtuber-lauren-southern-lands-in-australia-20180714-p4zrgq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/rightwing-activist-lauren-southern-touches-down-in-brisbane-wearing-its-okay-to-be-white-tshirt/news-story/d750c1b70a5e969ad4190540909ac75d&lt;/ref&gt;

When she asked people on the street in [[Melbourne]] "Should we kill Lauren Southern?", many had never heard of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘You’re not welcome’: Southern’s run-in with police |url=https://www.qt.com.au/news/youre-not-welcome-southerns-runin-with-sydney-poli/3478516/ |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=Queensland Times |date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speaking event in Melbourne was opposed by more than 100 protestors.&lt;ref name="Melbourne_protests"&gt;{{cite news |title=Protesters disrupt Lauren Southern event in Melbourne |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/protesters-disrupt-lauren-southern-event-in-melbourne |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |accessdate=31 July 2018 |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no protestors at her event in [[Sydney]], where ticket holders were notified of the venue by receiving a text on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo’s vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=sbs.com.au |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney event included a $200 meet-and-greet, a $500 VIP meet-and-greet and a $750 dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=1 August 2018 |publisher=news.com.au |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brisbane]], Lauren Southern supported bombing the Australian city of [[Melbourne]], quoting the [[Bible]], as a joke.&lt;ref name="not_yet_joke"/&gt; She was opposed by around 60 protesters.&lt;ref name="Brisbane_protests"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chirgwin |first1=Sophie |title=Alt right activist Lauren Southern targeted in Brisbane |url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/alt-right-activist-lauren-southern-targeted-in-brisbane/news-story/8ba241e85a0a8dbdfe95cededab53406 |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=The Courier Mail |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 New Zealand tour===
In August 2018, Southern's attempted speaking tour of New Zealand was unsuccessful. [[Auckland Council]] cancelled her booking and blocked her from using its venues to "stir up ethnic or religious tensions".&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt; For agreeing with the cancellation, an MP received violent threats.&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"&gt;{{cite news |title=Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson receives death threats |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/green-party-co-leader-marama-davidson-receives-death-threats.html |accessdate=4 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent booking of a private venue was revoked by its owners, one of whom said "The minute I heard who it was I cancelled".&lt;ref name="The_minute_I_heard_who_it_was_I_cancelled"/&gt; In retaliation, their venue was vandalised.&lt;ref name=vandalised/&gt;

The failure to find a venue was celebrated by around 1,000 protestors, who said the planned event had nothing to do with freedom of speech. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] said Southern's views "are not those that are shared by this country".&lt;ref name="NZ_Hostile_to_Southern"/&gt;

====Auckland Council venue cancellation====
Southern and Canadian [[podcast]]er and [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] [[Stefan Molyneux]] were scheduled to speak in [[Auckland]] on 3 August 2018, at an [[Auckland Council]]-owned theatre. However, Auckland Live, the Council agency responsible for the theatre, cancelled the venue booking on the grounds of concerns around "the health and safety of the presenters, staff and patrons". The [[Mayor of Auckland]] [[Phil Goff]] then tweeted that Council venues should not be used to "stir up ethnic or religious tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Controversial Canadian speaker denied visa as Auckland agency cancels booking |first=Todd |last=Niall |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105302179/controversial-canadian-speaker-denied-visa-as-auckland-agency-cancels-booking |newspaper=Stuff |date=6 July 2018 |accessdate=29 September 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; He later said "we've got no obligation at all" to provide a venue for "hate speech".&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; In response, Southern denied assertions that her views were "hate speech" and warned about the danger of "progressivism".&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor bans controversial Canadian pair from talking in Auckland Council venues|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12084381|accessdate=9 July 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Winston Peters]] and National Party leader [[Simon Bridges]] said they would have supported her right to speak, while [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Marama Davidson]] said she supported the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government divided over far right speakers |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/government-divided-over-far-right-speakers.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Winston Peters would've let far-right activists speak |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/361448/winston-peters-would-ve-let-far-right-activists-speak |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For saying so, Davidson's family was sent degrading messages of a sexual nature and death threats by supporters of Lauren Southern.&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; Human rights lawyer Craig Tuck criticized Mayor Goff's decision as a violation of free speech, while the cancellation of Southern and Molyneux's tour was welcomed by the [[Auckland Peace Action]] activist group and the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]] (FIANZ).&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt; By contrast, ''[[The Spinoff]]'' contributor Ali Shakir said that while he disagreed with many of Southern's views, he thought she and Molyneux should be welcomed to New Zealand and said that barring them damaged the country's commitment to [[freedom of expression]] and raised "serious concerns about the process." Shakir also questioned FIANZ's claim to speak for all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shakir |first1=Ali |title=To ban, or not to ban: an (agnostic) Muslim's view |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/to-ban-or-not-to-ban-an-agnostic-muslim-s-view.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group called the Free Speech Coalition advocated for a [[judicial review]] of the cancellation and raised NZ$50,000 in less than 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whyte |first1=Anna |title=$50K raised for judicial review after controversial speakers banned from Auckland Council venues 37 min ago |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/-50k-raised-judicial-review-after-controversial-speakers-banned-auckland-council-venues |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's supporters included former Labour Party cabinet minister [[Michael Bassett]], former National and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] parties leader [[Don Brash]], Property Institute chief executive Ashley Church, [[Auckland University of Technology]] historian [[Paul Moon]], broadcaster Lindsay Perrigo, political commentator [[Chris Trotter]], and [[New Zealand Taxpayers' Union]] director Jordan Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |last2=Niall |first2=Todd |title=Call for judicial review of Auckland Council agency's blocking of far-right speakers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105349668/call-for-judicial-review-of-auckland-council-agencys-blocking-of-farright-speakers |accessdate=10 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visa granted====
On 20 July, [[Immigration New Zealand]] granted visas for Southern and Molyneux to visit New Zealand. While describing their views as "repugnant" and "counter to the kind and tolerant values of the vast majority of New Zealanders", [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Immigration Minister]] [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] cleared their entry on the grounds that the duo had met immigration character requirements including not having prior criminal convictions. He added that they were never banned from Australia or the United Kingdom as previously reported.&lt;ref name="Satherley"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Protests outside Lauren Southern speaking gig in Melbourne |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/protests-outside-lauren-southern-speaking-gig-in-melbourne.html |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern welcomed the news and tweeted that she hoped that she and Molyneux could be "unbarred" from their venue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Lucy |title=Alt right speakers Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux granted entry to NZ |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12092243 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fonseka |first1=Dileepa |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux have 'visas in hand' and will come to NZ, organiser says |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105625016/Lauren-Southern-and-Stefan-Molyneux-have-visas-in-hand-and-will-come-to-NZ-organiser-says |accessdate=20 July 2018 |agency=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=Auckland Now |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair McCylmont, a leading immigration lawyer, later said there were "plenty" of grounds to stop the two coming into the country. He cited the visa cancellation of a rapper in 2014 using a law usually reserved for white supremacists, and suggested the grounds of a risk to order or the public interest. "Considering the amount of information out there in the public forum about the views held by the different people and what they've been talking, they would be plenty of grounds that could have been applied to declining visas." However, the minister took the view that denying entry would not be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern, Stefan Molyneux could still have visas cancelled |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/controversial-speakers-lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-could-still-be-banned-from-nz/ |accessdate=5 August 2018 |publisher=''[[Newstalk ZB]]'' |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Law, Legislation and Liberty''''' is the 1973 work in three volumes by Nobel laureate economist and political philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]]. In it, Hayek further develops the philosophical principles he discussed earlier in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'', and other writings. ''Law, Legislation and Liberty'' is more abstract than Hayek's earlier work, and it focuses on the conflicting views of society as either a design, a made order ("taxis"), on the one hand, or an emergent system, a grown order ("cosmos"), on the other. These ideas are then connected to two different forms of law: law proper, or "nomos" coinciding more or less with the traditional concept of [[natural law]], which is an [[emergent property]] of social interaction, and legislation, or "thesis", which is properly confined to the administration of non-coercive government services, but is easily confused with the occasional acts of legislature that do actually straighten out flaws in the nomos.

A '''libertine''' is one devoid of most moral principles, a sense of responsibility, or [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/libertine "Libertine" at the Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=libertine "libertine"] at [[WordNet]]&lt;/ref&gt; Libertinism is described as an extreme form of [[hedonism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vSU2xOR7a4oC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=libertine+extreme+hedonist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wwH1ILqrbO&amp;sig=B07mMtdciiO_aOVrTVpEY7zb8u0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf6Ku2vbLKAhXESCYKHfoxDrcQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=libertine%20extreme%20hedonist&amp;f=false The Origins of Jewish Secularization in 18th Century Europe by Schmuel Feiner]&lt;/ref&gt; Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]] and the [[Marquis de Sade]].

== History of the term ==
{{Individualism sidebar}}
The word "Libertine" was originally coined by [[John Calvin]] to negatively describe opponents of his policies in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Libertines |volume=16 |page=543 |first=Alexander |last=Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group, led by [[Ami Perrin]], argued against Calvin's "insistence that church discipline should be enforced uniformly against all members of Genevan society".&lt;ref name=zophy&gt;{{cite book |last=Zophy |first=Johnathan W. |title=A Short History of Renaissance and Reformation Europe: Dances Over Fire and Water |edition=Third |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-097764-9 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perrin and his allies were elected to the town council in 1548, and "broadened their support base in [[Geneva]] by stirring up resentment among the older inhabitants against the increasing number of religious refugees who were fleeing France in even greater numbers".&lt;ref name=zophy /&gt; By 1555, [[Calvinist]]s were firmly in place on the Genevan town council, so the Libertines, led by Perrin, responded with an "attempted coup against the government and called for the massacre of the French. This was the last great political challenge Calvin had to face in Geneva".&lt;ref name=zophy /&gt;

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the term became more associated with debauchery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Michel Delon  |authorlink= |title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location= |pages=2362–2363 |quote= |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=rElJAgAAQBAJ |page=2363 }} |isbn=978-1-135-96005-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]] wrote that [[Joseph Bonaparte]] "sought only life's pleasures and easy access to libertinism" while on the throne of Naples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles-Maurice de |last=Talleyrand |chapter=Napoleon's European Legacy, 1853 |title=Napoleon: Symbol for an Age, A Brief History with Documents |editor-first=Rafe |editor-last=Blaufarb |location=New York |publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-312-43110-5 |page=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (''Dangerous Liaisons'', 1782), an [[epistolary novel]] by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], is a trenchant description of sexual libertinism. [[Wayland Young]] argues:
{{quote|...the mere analysis of libertinism... carried out by a novelist with such a prodigious command of his medium... was enough to condemn it and play a large part in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Young | first=Wayland | title=Eros Denied | publisher=Grove | year=1966 | location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Agreeable to Calvin's emphasis on the need for uniformity of discipline in Geneva, [[Samuel Rutherford]] (Professor of Divinity in the University of St. Andrews, and Christian minister in 17th Century Scotland) offered a rigorous treatment of "Libertinism" in his polemical work "A Free Disputation against pretended Liberty of Conscience"  (1649).

''[[A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind]]'' is a poem by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester which addresses the question of the proper use of [[reason]], and is generally assumed to be a [[Hobbesian]] critique of [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Nicholas |title=The Contemporary Reception of Rochester's A Satyr against Mankind |journal=[[The Review of English Studies]] |year=2006 |volume=57 |issue=229 |pages=185–220 |doi=10.1093/res/hgl035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator subordinates reason to sense.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson101"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkinson|first=Matthew|title=Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II, 1660–1685 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8-sGu6QN_CcC |page=99 }} |year=2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-590-5|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based to some extent on [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s version of [[Juvenal]]'s eighth or fifteenth satire, and is also indebted to Hobbes, [[Montaigne]], [[Lucretius]] and [[Epicurus]], as well as the general libertine tradition.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson2010" /&gt; Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself, or a satirised persona.&lt;ref name="Thormählen1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thormählen |first=Marianne |title=Rochester |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=cxLBy2XR_H0C |page=190 }} |accessdate=4 April 2013 |date=25 June 1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44042-4 |page=191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II.&lt;ref name="Jenkinson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkinson|first=Matthew|title=Culture and Politics at the Court of Charles II: 1660–1685 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8-sGu6QN_CcC |page=99 }} |accessdate=4 April 2013|year=2010|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-1-84383-590-5|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[libertine novel]] was an [[18th century in literature|18th century literary genre]] of which the roots lay in the European but mainly French libertine tradition. The genre effectively ended with the [[French Revolution]]. Themes of libertine novels were [[anti-clericalism]], [[anti-establishment]] and [[erotic literature|eroticism]].

Authors include [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon]] (''[[Les Égarements du cœur et de l'esprit]]'', 1736; ''[[Le Sopha, conte moral]]'', 1742), [[Denis Diderot]] (''[[Les bijoux indiscrets]]'', 1748), [[Marquis de Sade]] (''[[L'Histoire de Juliette]]'', 1797–1801), [[Choderlos de Laclos]] (''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'', 1782), [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]] (''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'', 1684).

Other famous titles are ''[[Histoire de Dom Bougre, Portier des Chartreux]]'' (1741) and ''[[Thérèse Philosophe]]'' (1748).

Precursors to the libertine writers were [[Théophile de Viau]] (1590–1626) and [[Charles de Saint-Evremond]] (1610–1703), who were inspired by [[Epicurus]] and the publication of [[Petronius]].

[[Robert Darnton]] is a cultural historian who has covered this genre extensively.

Critics have been divided as to the literary merits of [[William Hazlitt]]'s ''Liber Amoris'', a deeply personal account of frustrated [[Lolita]]-like love that is quite unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, pp. 363–65. Wardle was writing in 1971; twenty-first-century critics continue to be sharply divided. David Armitage has assessed the book disparagingly as "the result of a tormented mind grasping literary motifs in a desperate and increasingly unsuccessful (and self indulgent) attempt to communicate its descent into incoherence...", while Gregory Dart has acclaimed it "the most powerful account of unrequited love in English literature". To James Ley, "It is ... an unsparing account of the psychology of obsession, the way a mind in the grip of an all-consuming passion can distort reality to its own detriment". Armitage, p. 223; Dart 2012, p. 85; Ley p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One or two positive reviews appeared, such as the one in the ''Globe'', 7 June 1823: "The ''Liber Amoris'' is unique in the English language; and as, possibly, the first book in its fervour, its vehemency, and its careless exposure of passion and weakness—of sentiments and sensations which the common race of mankind seek most studiously to mystify or conceal—that exhibits a portion of the most distinguishing characteristics of Rousseau, it ought to be generally praised".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jones, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Cruickshank]] in his book ''London's Sinful Secret'' summarized Hazlitt's infatuation stating: "Decades after her death Batsy (Careless) still haunted the imagination of the essayist William Hazlitt, a man who lodged near Covent Garden during the 1820s, where he became unpleasantly intimate with the social consequences of unconventional sexual obsession that he revealed in his ''Liber Amoris'' of 1823, in which he candidly confessed to his infatuation with his landlord's young daughter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Cruickshank]], ''London's Sinful Secret'', p.92. St. Martin's Press, New York (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
During the [[Baroque era]] in France, there existed a [[Freethought|freethinking]] circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as ''libertinage érudit'' and which included [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Élie Diodati]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=René Pintard |title=Le Libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IeL29wMqdbgC |page=11 }} |accessdate=24 July 2012 |year=2000 |publisher=Slatkine |isbn=978-2-05-101818-0 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/ |title=Fideism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s libertinism to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html |title=A Martyr to Sin |date=September 15, 1974 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his work, Peinovich ridicules African Americans and other racial minorities, advocates racial separation and a revival of explicit racial discrimination (of the sort practiced in the Jim Crow South and Nazi Germany), and promotes conspiracy theories such as [[Holocaust denial]] and [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]].

== Early life==

Peinovich grew up in suburban Pennsylvania, in an upper-middle class family; he was raised by his father, a college professor, and his stepmother.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/birth-of-a-white-supremacist |title=Birth of a White Supremacist |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced at a young age. He is of Serbian and Norwegian descent. After graduating high school, he attended and dropped out of several universities before being hired as a computer programmer.{{Cn|date=July 2018}}

Peinovich's father has disowned him and asked him to change his surname, in light of his neo-Nazi political activities as "Mike Enoch."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;

==Political activities==

After [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Steve King]] tweeted praise for Netherlands [[Parliamentary group leader|political candidate]] [[Geert Wilders]]'s strong stance against [[Opposition to immigration#Europe|further immigration to Europe]], Peinovich joined other alt-right voices in approval of King's position, stating "King doubles down.

He had expressed support for [[Donald Trump]] during the presidential election and the first months of his term, but has disavowed him after Donald Trump ordered airstrikes in Syria. On March 9, Enoch took part in an [[anti-war movement|anti-war protest]] opposing the [[2017 Shayrat missile strike]], in which 59 [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]] [[Cruise missile]]s were launched by the United States against the [[Shayrat Airbase]] controlled by [[Bashar al-Assad]] and his forces.&lt;ref name="altr_Anti"&gt;{{cite web | title = Antifa Protest Alt-Right For Protesting Trump's Syrian Intervention | last = Wallace | first = Hunter | work = AltRight.com | date = April 9, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | url = https://altright.com/2017/04/09/antifa-protest-alt-right-for-protesting-trumps-syrian-intervention/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest, organized by [[Richard B.

On April 18, 2017, Enoch joined Richard B. Spencer in giving a talk at [[Auburn University]] where he expressed that he and the movement were breaking away from the new direction that the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] was taking.&lt;ref name=newrepublic&gt;{{cite web | title = The Alt-Right and Donald Trump Get a Divorce | author =  | work = New Republic | date = April 26, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/142276/alt-right-donald-trump-get-divorce | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Auburn administration had initially cancelled the planned event, citing safety concerns, Enoch assisted Spencer in filing a lawsuit on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; [[United States federal judge]] [[William Keith Watkins]] issued a ruling requiring Auburn to allow Spencer and Enoch to speak.&lt;ref name=auburnwapo&gt;{{cite web | title = Federal judge stops Auburn from canceling white nationalist Richard Spencer speech.

==Social media==
In April 2018, he was [[retweet]]ed by [[Ann Coulter]]. After ''[[Newsweek]]'' reached out to [[Twitter]] asking for a comment, his [[Twitter suspensions|account was suspended]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/ann-coulter-trump-white-nationalist-887699 |newspaper=[[Newsweek]] |title=Ann Coulter retweets White Nationalist Charlotesville Leader who attacked Trump with Syria Conspiracy Theory |author=Michael Edison Hayden |date=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">In mathematics, a '''monotonically normal space''' is a particular kind of [[normal space]], with some special characteristics, and is such that it is hereditarily normal, and any two separated subsets are strongly separated. They are defined in terms of a monotone normality operator.

A &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; [[topological space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal T)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''monotonically normal'' if the following condition holds:

For every &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where G is open, there is an open set &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)&lt;/math&gt; such that
#&lt;math&gt;x\in\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;
#if &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)\neq\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then either &lt;math&gt;x\in H&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

There are some equivalent criteria of monotone normality.

==Equivalent definitions==
===Definition 2===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and for each pair of disjoint closed subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; there is an open set &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; with the properties

# &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq G(A,B)\subseteq G(A,B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;G(A,B)\subseteq G(A',B')&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B ' \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;. 

This operator &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called '''monotone normality operator'''. 

Note that if G is a monotone normality operator, then &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde G(A,B)=G(A,B)\backslash G(B,A)^{-}&lt;/math&gt; is also a monotone normality operator; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; satisfies 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \tilde G(A,B)\cap \tilde G(B,A)=\emptyset
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason we some time take the monotone normality operator so as to satisfy the above requirement; and that facilitates the proof of some theorems and of the equivalence of the definitions as well.

===Definition 3===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;,and to each pair (A, B) of subsets of X, with &lt;math&gt;A\cap B^{-}=\emptyset=B\cap A^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, one can assign an open subset G(A, B) of X such that
# &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq G ( A , B) \subseteq G ( A , B)^{-}\subseteq X\backslash B,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;G(A, B) \subseteq G(A', B') \mbox{ whenever }A \subseteq A' \mbox{ and } B'\subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;.

===Definition 4===

A space X is called monotonically normal if it is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and there is a function H that assigns to each ordered pair (p,C) where C is closed and p is without C, an open set H(p,C) satisfying:
# &lt;math&gt;p\in H(p,C)\subseteq X\backslash C&lt;/math&gt;
# if D is closed and &lt;math&gt;p\not\in C\supseteq D&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;H(p,C)\subseteq H(p,D)&lt;/math&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;p\neq q&lt;/math&gt; are points in X, then &lt;math&gt;H(p,\{q\})\cap H(q,\{p\})=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
An important example of these spaces would be, assuming Axiom of Choice, the linearly ordered spaces; however, it really needs [[axiom of choice]] for an arbitrary linear order to be [[normal space|normal]] (see van Douwen's paper). Any [[generalised metric]] is monotonically normal even without choice. An important property of monotonically normal spaces is that any two separated subsets are strongly separated there. Monotone normality is hereditary property and a monotonically normal space is always normal by the first condition of the second equivalent definition.

We list up some of the properties :
# A [[closed map]] preserves monotone normality. 
# A monotonically normal space is hereditarily [[collectionwise normal]].
# Elastic spaces are monotonically normal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22123">[[Music]] has been used in [[psychological operations]]. The term '''music torture''' is sometimes used by critics of the practice of playing [[loud music]] incessantly to prisoners or people besieged.

The [[United Nations]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] have banned the use of loud music in [[interrogation]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The term [[torture]] is sometimes used to describe the practice. While it is acknowledged by US interrogation experts that it causes discomfort, it has also been characterized by them as causing no "long-term effects".&lt;ref name=BbcMusicTorture20030523&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music and sound have been usually used as part of a combination of interrogation methods, today recognized by international bodies as amounting to torture.&lt;ref&gt;UN Committee Against Torture 1997 "Concluding observations: Israel. 09/05/1997."  {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728224401/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking all senses without leaving any visible traces, they have formed the basis of the widely discussed torture in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]]. They were, however, devised much earlier in the 1950s and early 1960s, as a way to counter so-called Soviet "brainwashing".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W (2006). ''A Question of Torture.

"Detainees have reported being routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during arrest and detention. Many have told Amnesty International that they were tortured and ill-treated by US and UK troops during interrogation. Methods often reported include prolonged sleep deprivation; beatings; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights.

==Popular culture==

In the book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and the subsequent [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] based upon it, a rebellious teenager is subjected to brutal experimental brain-washing techniques that cause him to feel physical pain if he has similar violent thoughts to those that sent him to jail in the first place; as an accidental side-effect, he has the same response if he hears [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].  Later, a man tortures him by locking him in a room where the symphony is played loudly.

In ''[[Back to the Future]]'', Marty used music made by [[Van Halen]] to scare his dad, George McFly, awake, implying that since that kind of music did not exist in that time, it would scare him.

In ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a helicopter squadron plays classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'', over loudspeakers on-board their helicopters while attacking a Viet Cong village, as a form of psychological warfare.

In [[Woody Allen]]'s early film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', a prisoner is tortured by being tied up in a room while operetta, featuring an annoying coluratora soprano, is played over and over on a cheap record-player. 

In ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Mimi played "[[Panama (song)|Panama]]" by Van Halen repeatedly to drive Drew and friends from his house.

In an episode of the U.S. television show ''[[Burn Notice]]'' Sam Axe plays loud music to a prisoner to break his will.

In the film ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', a take-off of the [[Barney &amp; Friends]] ending song "I Love You" is played in the cells of Iraqi detainees as a form of torture.

In the TV series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', [[Grindcore]] is used to keep a prisoner awake.

In ''Power Rangers Megaforce'', Emma sings a song to help the rangers defeat Dischord.

In the series 'Lost', [[drum and bass]] music is used to keep an islander's boyfriend awake and indoctrinated and tortured.

In one episode of 'The Flash' Cisco plays 'Never Gonna Give You Up' on repeat to Hartley get him to reveal information they need.

Public awareness of the use of this technique is widespread enough that it can be used in satirical attacks on popular culture:

Zero dB is an initiative against music torture set up by legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents over thirty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Zero dB aims to stop torture music by encouraging widespread condemnation of the practice and by calling on governments and the UN to uphold and enforce the Convention Against Torture and other relevant treaties. The initiative is backed by the Musicians Union which is calling on British musicians to voice their outrage against the use of music to torture.

Musicians and the wider public are making their own silent protests against music torture which are being shown on Zero dB. A series of silent protests and actions are planned through 2009. Participating musicians will include minutes of silence in their concerts to draw their audience's attention to the USA's use of deafening music against captives.

According to the ''Associated Press'' [[FBI]] agents stationed at Guantanamo Bay reported that the use of deafening music was common.&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Guantanamo Bay spokesmen [[Commander]] [[Pauline Storum]]:

Among the musicians united in their objections were [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]], a composer for the children's show [[Sesame Street]], and [[Tom Morello]]

{{Criminal defenses}}

In the [[criminal law]] of many nations, '''necessity''' may be either a possible [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or an exculpation for breaking the [[law]]. [[Defendant]]s seeking to rely on this [[defense (legal)|defense]] argue that they should not be held [[liable]] for their [[action (philosophy)|actions]] as a [[crime]] because their conduct was ''necessary'' to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as [[self defense]]. Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases&lt;ref&gt;See Re A (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) [2001] Fam 147&lt;/ref&gt; there is no corresponding defense in [[Necessity in English law#History|English law]] for murder.&lt;ref&gt;See [[R v Dudley and Stephens]] [1884] 14 QBD 273 and R v Howe [1987] 1 AC 417&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from a [[kidnap]] (cf. ''[[North by Northwest#Plot|North by Northwest]]'').  Most [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid.  Thus, with the "drunk driver" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.

==General discussion==
As a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the [[fire service]]s and other [[civil defence]] [[organization]]s have a general duty to keep the [[community]] safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a [[fire break]], or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, [[parent]]s who lack the financial means to feed their [[child]]ren cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of [[cost–benefit analysis]].

===Denmark and Norway===
Emergency law/right (''nødret'', ''nødrett'') is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401 Straffeloven] på [[Retsinformation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-20050520-028.html#17 Straffeloven av 2005 § 17]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by ''nødret''. ''Nødret'' can only be invoked though when no other option is available.

===International law===

====Customary international law====
Under international law, an obligation of [[customary international law]] or an obligation granted under a bilateral investment treaty may be suspended under the doctrine of necessity. It is "an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility." ''See Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/03/09.'' 
In order to invoke the doctrine of necessity:
(1) The invoking State must not have contributed to the state of necessity,
(2) Actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.
''Id. at page 72, paragraph 165.''

===Taiwan, Republic of China===
Necessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0000001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=24 Article 24 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Administrative Penalty Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=A0030210&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=13 Article 13 of Administrative Penalty Act].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Necessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of ''United States v. Schoon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The demise of the political necessity defense: indirect civil  disobedience and United States v. Schoon|year=1993|author=Cavallaro, James L., Jr.|publisher=University of California Press|issn=0008-1221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] office  in Tucson, where they chanted "keep America's tax dollars out of El  Salvador," splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and  carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Schoon|reporter=F2d|vol=939|opinion=826|date=July 29, 1991|url=http://openjurist.org/939/f2d/826/united-states-v-d-schoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In specific states====

===Singapore===
Necessity is a defence per the Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=85fe891c-9489-47a0-a0c2-15a8a9fb92c9;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr81-he-. Section 81 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
This requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=4933180d-0e2b-4808-bcb8-1e276b9522b4;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr52-he-. Section 52 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.

==Canada==

In Canada, Necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. 

Three Requirements for defence of necessity:
(1) Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger 
(2) No reasonable legal alternative
(3) Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided

It should also be noted that the first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard. The third element is evaluated on a purely objective standard. [[R v Latimer]], 2001 SCC 1

== In religious law ==
In Judaism, the principle of ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' allows any law to be broken to save a life, except laws against murder, adultery/incest and idolatry.

{{Planned World Trade Center}}
'''Park51''' (originally named '''Cordoba House''') is a development that was originally envisioned as a 13-story [[Islamic]] [[community center]] and [[mosque]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. The developers hoped to promote an [[interfaith dialog]]ue within the greater community. Due to its proposed location two blocks from the [[World Trade Center site]], it was widely and controversially referred to as the "'''Ground Zero mosque'''".&lt;ref name=CSM2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zraick|first1=Karen|last2=Dobnik|first2=Verena|title=Ground zero mosque opened to public Wednesday|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|accessdate=19 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=September 22, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221130220/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0922/Ground-zero-mosque-opened-to-public-Wednesday|archivedate=21 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project would replace an existing 1850s building of [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] that was damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The original design was by [[Michel Abboud]], principal of SOMA Architects, who wrestled for months with the challenge of making the building fit naturally into its lower Manhattan surroundings: on the one hand, it should have a contemporary design, and, at the same time, it should look Islamic. His design included a 500-seat auditorium, theater, [[performing arts center]], [[fitness center]], swimming pool, basketball court, childcare area, bookstore, [[culinary school]], art studio, food court, and memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks. It also included a prayer space for the Muslim community, which would accommodate 1,000–2,000 people.

In late September 2011, a temporary {{convert|4000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} Islamic center opened in renovated space at the Park51 location. In summer 2014, it was announced that there would instead be a 3-story museum with a prayer space, as well as condos, at 49-51 Park Place. The plans were changed again in September 2015, when the owner announced a {{convert|667|ft|m|adj=on}}, 70-story luxury condominium building at the site. In May 2016, financing was secured for a 43-story condominium building with room for an Islamic cultural museum.

[[File:Park51 location map.png|thumb|The proposed location of Park51 is indicated by a red dot.]]
The project was originally called Cordoba House, then renamed Park51, in reference to the street address on Park Place.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt; Later, the Imam leading the project introduced some ambiguity by again referring to the project as "Cordoba House".&lt;ref name="nytimes7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|title=Building on Faith|author=Feisal Abdul Rauf|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506002307/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08mosque.html|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Park51 website then clarified that Park51 is the community center, while Cordoba House is the "interfaith and religious component of the center".&lt;ref name="amira1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan Amira |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |title=Ground Zero Mosque Gets Less Muslim-Invasion-Sounding Name |work=New York |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719020940/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/ground_zero_mosque_gets_lets_m.html |archivedate=July 19, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes7"/&gt;

Cordoba Initiative said the name "Cordoba House" was meant to invoke [[Caliphate of Córdoba|8th–11th century]] [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], Spain, which they called a model of [[La Convivencia|peaceful coexistence]] among [[Al-Andalus|Muslims]], [[Mozarab|Christians]], and [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews]].&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lexington-5Aug"&gt;{{cite news|author=Editorial|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16743239|title=Build that mosque: The campaign against the proposed Cordoba centre in New York is unjust and dangerous|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2010|work=The Economist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819033331/http://economist.com/node/16743239|archivedate=August 19, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the name was chosen because Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a center of learning in Córdoba together.&lt;ref name="Lexington-5Aug"/&gt; The name was criticized; for example, [[Newt Gingrich]] said that it was "a deliberately insulting term" that symbolizes the Muslim conquerors' victory over Christian Spaniards, and noted that the Muslims had converted a Cordoba church into the third largest [[mosque]] in the world.&lt;ref name="foxnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newt.org/newt-direct/newt-gingrich-statement-proposed-mosqueislamic-community-center-near-ground-zero |title=Newt Gingrich Statement on Proposed Mosque/Islamic Community Center near Ground Zero |work=Newt Direct|date=July 21, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820114339/http://www.newt.org/newt-direct/newt-gingrich-statement-proposed-mosqueislamic-community-center-near-ground-zero|archivedate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Raymond Ibrahim]], a former associate director of the [[Middle East Forum]], said the project and name were not "a gesture of peace and interfaith dialogue" but were "allusive of Islamic conquest and consolidation" and that Americans should realize that mosques are not "Muslim counterparts to Christian churches" but rather, "are symbols of domination and centers of radicalization".

The board's chairwoman, [[Julie Menin]], supported deletion of references to the building as a mosque and interfaith center that were in an earlier draft of the resolution, saying: "I personally was uncomfortable with the language that talked about the religious institution. I believe it's not the purview of a city agency to be weighing in on the siting of any religious institution, be it a mosque, synagogue, or church."&lt;ref name="tribecatrib1"/&gt;

The meeting where the vote was held was contentious. Some of the speakers supporting the project were Muslims who lost family members in the attacks, and were booed by protesters. Some non-Muslim relatives of 9/11 victims also spoke in support, but other family members objected to the project, claiming the location is insensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/26/2010-05-26_clash_over_mosque_heated_debate_on_a_house_of_worship_near_ground_zero.html |title=Supporters, opponents debate merits of controversial plan to build mosque near Ground Zero |author1=Rob Sgobbo |author2=Samuel Goldsmith |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529163645/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/26/2010-05-26_clash_over_mosque_heated_debate_on_a_house_of_worship_near_ground_zero.html |archivedate=May 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Julie Shapiro | title = Community Board Approves Mosque Near World Trade Center Site After Emotional Meeting | publisher = DNAinfo New York | location = Manhattan | date = May 26, 2010 | url = http://dnainfo.com/20100525/manhattan/meeting-on-planned-mosque-near-world-trade-center-site-draws-hundreds-of-people | accessdate = August 26, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100821210740/http://dnainfo.com/20100525/manhattan/meeting-on-planned-mosque-near-world-trade-center-site-draws-hundreds-of-people | archivedate = August 21, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landmark status declined and litigation===
As the controversy grew New York City's [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] agreed to reconsider the 1980s landmark application which it had not acted on previously. On August 3, 2010, it voted 9–0 against granting landmark status and historic protection to the building. That cleared the way for it to be demolished, and the new Cordoba House to be built in its place.&lt;ref name=poll/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="observer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boston1"/&gt;

On July 10, 2011, Justice Paul G. Feinman of the [[New York State Supreme Court]] dismissed Brown's case, writing that the firefighter was "an individual with a strong interest in preservation of the building", but added that he lacked any special legal standing regarding its fate. [[Adam Leitman Bailey]], the lawyer who represented the Islamic center's developer [[pro bono]], called the decision "a victory for America" and said, "Despite the tempest of religious hatred, the judge flexed our Constitution's muscles enforcing the very bedrock of our democracy." Jack Lester, a lawyer for Brown, said, "We believe the brave men and women who risked their lives have standing to preserve the monuments and historic buildings at ground zero." &lt;ref name=NYTPark51&gt;{{cite news|last=Moynihan|first=Colin|title=Judge Rules Ex-Firefighter Can't Sue Over Mosque|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/nyregion/ex-firefighter-cant-sue-to-bar-mosque-near-ground-zero.html?_r=1|accessdate=July 19, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 10, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627073844/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/nyregion/ex-firefighter-cant-sue-to-bar-mosque-near-ground-zero.html?_r=1|archivedate=June 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2014, the ''Times'' announced that the original mosque plans would not proceed. Instead, a three-story Islamic museum with a prayer space and condos would be built at 49-51 Park Place, which at the time was the location of a [[Con Edison]] building.

In an interview September 8, 2010 Abdul Rauf was asked if he would have done anything differently had he known the controversy would erupt. His answer: "If I knew this would happen, this would cause this kind of pain, I wouldn't have done it.

===Effects on recruitment of radical Islamists===
Counterterrorism analysts have noted that the developing controversy over Park51 has provided a "recruitment opportunity" for radical Islamist groups. According to Evan Kohlmann, the senior partner in the New York-based security firm Flashpoint Global Partners, "[t]he reaction is, at least on the part of extremists, fairly gleeful – that America is playing into our hands, that America is revealing its ugly face, and that even if it doesn't further radicalize people in the Middle East, there's no doubt that it will radicalize a kind of a key constituency that al-Qaida and other extremists are seeking to covet{{Sic}}, seeking to court, which is the small number of homegrown extremists here in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gary Thomas |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |title=Radical Islamists Try to Exploit Islamophobia |publisher=Voice of America |date=August 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830202224/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Radical-Islamists-Try-to-Exploit-Islamophobia-101592048.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' quotes a [[Taliban]] operative as explicitly connecting increased opposition to the project with increased support for the Taliban's cause. "By preventing this mosque from being built, America is doing us a big favor," the Taliban operative stated. "It's providing us with more recruits, donations, and popular support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Sami Yousafzai |author2=Ron Moreau |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |title=The Taliban vs. the Mosque |work=Newsweek |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=September 5, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902031055/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/30/taliban-using-mosque-controversy-to-recruit.html |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary===
In 2012, filmmaker David Osit produced a documentary about the Park51 controversy, specifically following the story through the experiences of developer Sharif El-Gamal. The film aired on [[Public Broadcasting System|PBS]] in the fall of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.itvs.org/films/building-babel |title='Building Babel – ITVS' |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062836/http://www.itvs.org/films/building-babel |archivedate=2014-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
===Polls===
[[File:Ground Zero Mosque Protesters 10.jpg|thumb|Opponents of Park51 protest on August 22, 2010.]]
Polls showed that the majority of Americans, New York State residents, and New York City residents opposed building the center near Ground Zero, although a plurality or majority of Manhattanites supported construction. In July 2010, the majority of Americans were opposed to the Islamic center.&lt;ref name="nytimes4"/&gt; By a margin of 54–20%, American adults were opposed to a mosque being built near Ground Zero, a national [[Rasmussen Reports]] poll found that month.&lt;ref&gt;

Some polls tried to gauge public opinion of Muslims' right to build Park51 near ground zero. The [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll of New York State residents released August 31, 2010 found a 54–40 percent majority of voters agreeing 'that because of American freedom of religion, Muslims have the right to build the mosque near Ground Zero'.&lt;ref name="quinn"/&gt; A Fox News national poll taken August 10–11, 2010 found that 61% felt that the project developers had a right to build a mosque there (a majority of Democrats (63–32%), Republicans (57–36%), and Independents (69–29%).&lt;ref name="foxpolldata"/&gt; The [[Economist]]/YouGov poll taken the week of August 19, 2010 concurred that Democrats (57.5–24.9%) and Independents (62.3–25.2%) believed Muslims had a "constitutional right" to build a mosque at the site, but found that Republicans (31.8–53.2%) did not believe that Muslims had such a right. The poll found that 50.2%, overall, supported the constitutional right to build at the site, 32.7% were opposed and 17.1% had no opinion.&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

The Economist/YouGov poll also noted that 52% of Americans believe that "Muslims should be able to build mosques in the United States wherever other religions can build houses of worship", as opposed to 34% who believe that "there are some places in the United States where it is not appropriate to build mosques, though it would be appropriate to build other houses of worship" and 14% who believe "mosques should not be permitted anywhere in the United States".&lt;ref name="econyougov \" /&gt;

===Opposition===

The prospect of building a mosque close to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] was offensive to some opponents of the construction project, since the hijackers in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] identified as Muslim.&lt;ref name="Stanford University Press"/&gt;  [[Newt Gingrich]] declared: "There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt;

====9/11 families====
Some relatives of victims of the September 11 attacks said they found the proposal offensive because the perpetrators who committed the attacks did so in the name of Islam.&lt;ref name="nydailynews2"/&gt; A number said that it was not an issue of freedom of religion, property rights, or racism, but rather one of sensitivity to the families of those killed, in choosing the specific location of the center.

A group of victims' relatives, 9/11 Families for a Safe &amp; Strong America, called the proposal "a gross insult to the memory of those who were killed on that terrible day".&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; [[Debra Burlingame]], a co-founder of the group whose brother died in the attacks, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a place which is {{convert|600|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} from where almost 3,000 people were torn to pieces by Islamic extremists... it is incredibly insensitive and audacious ... for them to build a mosque ... so that they could be in proximity to where that atrocity happened ...

[[Sally Regenhard]], whose son was a firefighter who was killed in the attacks, and who has testified before Congress on 9/11, said that the center would be "sacrilege on sacred ground", and that "People are being accused of being anti-Muslim and racist, but this is simply a matter of sensitivity."&lt;ref name="nyt-2010-07-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek1"&gt;{{cite news |author=Lisa Miller |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |title=War Over Ground Zero |magazine=Newsweek |date=August 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811004701/http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/08/war-over-ground-zero.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Fire Department of New York|NY Fire Department]] Deputy Chief Jim Riches, whose son Jim was killed, said: "I don't want to have to go down to a memorial where my son died on 9/11, and look at a mosque," adding "this is all about location, location, location.

====Muslims====
The building of an Islamic community center near Ground Zero has been criticized by some Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] does not directly oppose the building of a mosque near ground zero but views that the sentiments of non-Muslims should not be unduly hurt. They state that there are other places where mosques can be built and they do not see why that particular location has been chosen.&lt;ref name="movemosque"/&gt; The head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]] in London, stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a mosque is built at the proposed site, then the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community would like to see churches, synagogues, Hindu places of worship and places of worship of all other religions also built near Ground Zero.

Another founding member of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, Zuhdi Jasser, who is also the founder of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], a group of Muslim professionals in the Phoenix Valley of Arizona, strongly opposed the project, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For us, a mosque was always a place to pray...not a way to make an ostentatious architectural statement. ''Ground Zero'' shouldn't be about promoting Islam. It's the place where war was declared on us as Americans."&lt;ref name="boston2"/&gt; ... American freedom of religion is a right, but … it is not right to make one's religion a global political statement with a towering Islamic edifice that casts a shadow over the memorials of Ground Zero. … Islamists in 'moderate' disguise are still Islamists. In their own more subtle ways, the WTC mosque organizers end up serving the same aims (as) separatist and supremacist wings of political Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Scholar: Don't Build Islamic Center |publisher=CBS News |date=September 11, 2010 |url=http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821235121/http://www.insideedition.com/news/4904/miss-usa-weighs-in-on-mosque-controversy.aspx |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neda Bolourchi, a Muslim whose mother died in 9/11, said: "I fear it would become a symbol of victory for militant Muslims around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |author=Neda Bolourchi |title=A Muslim Victim of 9/11: 'Build your Mosque Somewhere Else{{'-}} |work=The Washington Post |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811032547/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080603006.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors [[Raheel Raza]] and [[Tarek Fatah]], board members of the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]], said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New York currently boasts at least 30 mosques so it's not as if there is pressing need to find space for worshipers. [W]e Muslims know ... [this] mosque is meant to be a deliberate provocation to thumb our noses at the infidel. The proposal has been made in bad faith, ... as ''[[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]'', meaning "mischief-making" that is clearly forbidden in the Koran.... As Muslims we are dismayed that our co-religionists have such little consideration for their fellow citizens, and wish to rub salt in their wounds and pretend they are applying a balm to soothe the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Raheel Raza |author2=Tarek Fatah |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief+Manhattan/3370303/story.html |title=Mischief in Manhattan |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=August 9, 2010 |archivedate=August 18, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818091927/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Mischief%2BManhattan/3370303/story.html |accessdate=January 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Akbar Ahmed]], Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies at [[American University]], while noting that blaming all Muslims for 9/11 was "ridiculous", said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; I don't think the Muslim leadership has fully appreciated the impact of 9/11 on America. They assume Americans have forgotten 9/11 and even, in a profound way, forgiven 9/11, and that has not happened. The wounds remain largely open [...] and when wounds are raw, an episode like constructing a house of worship – even one protected by the Constitution, protected by law – becomes like salt in the wounds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |title=U.S. Muslims underestimate 9/11 effect, Muslim thinker warns |publisher=CNN |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806125639/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/05/u-s-muslims-underestimate-911-effect-muslim-thinker-warns/ |archivedate=August 6, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid, general manager of [[Al-Arabiya]] television, also criticized the project in a column titled "A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction?" in the Arab daily A-Sharq Al-Awsat, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Muslims do not aspire for a mosque next to the September 11 cemetery...the mosque is not an issue for Muslims, and they have not heard of it until the shouting became loud between the supporters and the objectors, which is mostly an argument between non-Muslim US citizens! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid |url=http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |title=A House of Worship or a Symbol of Destruction? |work=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]] |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511083703/http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=21980 |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |title=Ground Zero mosque debate swirls in world capitals |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902162513/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2010/0818/Ground-Zero-mosque-debate-swirls-in-world-capitals |archivedate=September 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Rima Fakih]], the first Muslim-American crowned [[Miss USA]] as [[Miss USA 2010]], opposed the project on the grounds of it being insensitive to families of 9/11 victims, telling ''[[Inside Edition]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I totally agree with President Obama with the statement on the constitutional rights of freedom of religion. [But] it shouldn't be so close to the World Trade Center.

Democratic Representative Mike McMahon of New York's 13 District provided a written statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have seen very clearly in the past weeks that building a mosque two blocks from ground zero will not promote necessary interfaith dialogue, but will continue to fracture the faiths and citizens of our city and this country.

Democratic Representative Tim Bishop of New York's 1st District also disagrees with the location, "As a New Yorker, I believe Ground Zero is sacred ground and should unite us.

New York City fireman Tim Brown opposed the project, saying: "A mosque ... that's using foreign money from countries with ''[[shariah]]'' law is unacceptable, especially in this neighborhood".

Project supporters have argued that the Park51 building would not be visible from the World Trade Center site,&lt;ref name="NewYorker-16Aug"/&gt; and that some victims and victims' families have expressed support for the Park51 project, as well as acknowledging the fact that victims of the 9/11 attacks also included Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-09-03-1Amuslims911_CV_N.htm |title=For families of Muslim 9/11 victims, a new pain |author=Rick Hampton |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some relatives of victims of the 9/11 attacks expressed support for the project. Colleen Kelley, who lost her brother William on 9/11, says, the "irony in the debate over the section of the building that would house a mosque is that one might assume that God (the same God to Jews-Christians-Muslims) would be pleased with any type of effort that involves prayer and service to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |title=Not All 9-11 Families Oppose The Mosque |date=August 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821185609/http://www.citylimits.org/conversations/111/mosque-debate-religious-intolerance |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herb Ouida, whose son Todd died, said: "To say that we're going to condemn a religion and castigate a billion people in the world because they're Muslims, to say that they shouldn't have the ability to pray near the World Trade Center – I don't think that's going to bring people together and cross the divide."&lt;ref name="aolnews1"/&gt;

Marvin Bethea, a former EMS worker who was forced to retire in 2004 because of breathing problems caused by working at the 9/11 site, believes racism is a factor in the controversy, He said "even though my life has changed, I don't hate the Muslims. Especially being a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against. I've lived with that."&lt;ref name="aolnews1" /&gt;

And to scapegoat the Muslims for the acts of a foreign terrorist, that is – that is hatred." She went on "...&amp;nbsp;if that argument is valid, then, by that token, [[Timothy McVeigh]]'s actions also makes all Christians terrorists.

Former [[US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] also supported Park51, after noting that many Muslims were also killed on September 11.

Former Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] gave his support to Park51, arguing that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] allows for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero. Ventura also argued that denying the right for a mosque to be built near Ground Zero would be similar to removing churches from [[Oklahoma City]], where the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] occurred (the deadliest act of terrorism in the United States prior to 9/11), if [[Timothy McVeigh]], the man who perpetrated the attack, was a Christian. Ventura also demanded that opposition to the Ground Zero Mosque should be ignored because "people need to remember, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights should be written in stone. You cannot subject them to the popularity. They are there to protect unpopular things, like the First Amendment. The First Amendment is to protect unpopular speech simply because popular speech doesn't need to be protected. It's as simple as that. And you can't, you know, bend the Constitution to the blowing winds of whatever polls might say, otherwise it's a worthless, useless document which in many ways they're turning it to that anyway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcripts |url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=18 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061424/http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/15/cnr.08.html |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For any [[complex number]] written in polar form (such as ''r''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]&lt;sup&gt;[[imaginary unit|i]]''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;), the '''phase factor''' is the [[complex exponential]] factor (e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt;).  As such, the term "phase factor" is related to the more general term [[phasor]], which may have any magnitude (i.e., not necessarily part of the [[circle group]]).  The phase factor is a [[unit complex number]], i.e., of [[absolute value]] [[1 (number)|1]].  It is commonly used in quantum mechanics.  

The variable ''θ'' appearing in such an expression is generally referred to as the [[phase (waves)|phase]].  Multiplying the equation of a [[plane wave]] ''A''e&lt;sup&gt;i('''k·r'''−''ωt'')&lt;/sup&gt; by a phase factor [[phase shift|shifts the phase]] of the wave by ''θ'':
:&lt;math&gt;\text{e}^{i\theta}A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t}\right)} = A\text{e}^{i\left({\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t + \theta}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[quantum mechanics]], a phase factor is a complex coefficient e&lt;sup&gt;i''θ''&lt;/sup&gt; that multiplies a [[Bra-ket notation|ket]] &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or [[bra–ket notation|bra]] &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|&lt;/math&gt;. It does not, in itself, have any physical meaning, since the introduction of a phase factor does not change the expectation values of a [[Hermitian operator]].  That is, the values of &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|A|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\langle\phi|e^{-i\theta} A e^{i\theta}|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Messiah|1999|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''differences'' in phase factors between two interacting [[quantum state]]s can sometimes be measurable (such as in the [[Berry phase]]) and this can have important consequences.

In [[optics]], the phase factor is an important quantity in the treatment of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], '''quantum suicide''' is a [[thought experiment]], originally published independently by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/ManyMinds.html |title=The Many Minds Approach |date=25 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |quote=This idea was first proposed by Austrian mathematician Hans Moravec in 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moravec1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moravec |first=Hans |year=1988 |title=Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence |chapter=The Doomsday Device |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |page=188 |isbn=978-0-674-57618-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=56mb7XuSx3QC&amp;lpg=PP188&amp;pg=PA188}} (If MWI is true, apocalyptic particle accelerators won't function as advertised).&lt;/ref&gt; and Bruno Marchal in 1988&lt;ref name="Marchal1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1988 |title=Informatique théorique et philosophie de l'esprit |journal=Acte du 3ème colloque international Cognition et Connaissance  [Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference Cognition and Knowledge] |location=Toulouse |pages=193–227 |trans-title=Theoretical Computer Science and Philosophy of Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchal1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marchal |first=Bruno |year=1991 |title=Mechanism and personal identity |editor1-last=De Glas |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Gabbay |editor2-first=D. |journal=Proceedings of WOCFAI 91 |pages=335–345 |location=Paris. Angkor. |url=http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/M&amp;PI_15-MAI-91.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently developed further by [[Max Tegmark]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark, Max [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9709032/ The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Many Worlds or Many Words?], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to distinguish between the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics and the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] by means of a variation of the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], from the cat's point of view. '''Quantum immortality''' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality|title=Quantum immortality|last=Tegmark|first=Max|date=November 1998|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Lynch recalls that [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]] took great delight in paradoxes such as the [[unexpected hanging paradox|unexpected hanging]]. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: his consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death";&lt;ref&gt;See Eugene Shikhovtsev's Biography of Everett: [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett.html#e23 Keith Lynch remembers 1979–1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment.&lt;ref name="mit_edu"/&gt;

==Thought experiment==
The quantum suicide thought experiment involves the same apparatus as [[Schrödinger's cat]] – a box which kills the occupant in a given time frame with probability one half due to [[quantum uncertainty]].&lt;ref&gt;The simplest example of this is a weapon triggered by a [[two level system]]. Schrödinger described his as a radioactive decay detector while Moravec's was a device measuring the [[spin (physics)|spin value]] of protons.&lt;/ref&gt; The only difference is to have the experimenter recording observations be the one inside the box. The significance of this is that someone whose life or death depends on a [[qubit]] can distinguish between [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]. By definition, fixed observers cannot.

At the start of the first iteration, under both interpretations, the probability of surviving the experiment is 50%, as given by the squared norm of the [[wave function]]. At the start of the second iteration, assuming the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is true, the [[Wave function collapse|wave function has already collapsed]]; thus, since the experimenter is already dead, there is a 0% chance of survival for any further iterations. However, if the [[many-worlds interpretation]] is true, a superposition of the live experimenter ''necessarily'' exists (as also does the one who dies). Now, barring the possibility of [[afterlife|life after death]], after every iteration only one of the two experimenter superpositions – the live one – is capable of having any sort of conscious experience. Putting aside the philosophical problems associated with [[Identity (philosophy)|individual identity and its persistence]], we may assert that, under the many-worlds interpretation, the experimenter, or at least a version of them, continues to exist through all of their superpositions where the outcome of the experiment is that they live. In other words, we may say that a version of the experimenter survives all iterations of the experiment, whichever its number. Since the superpositions where the experimenter lives occur by quantum necessity (again, under the many-worlds interpretation), it follows that their survival, after any realizable number of iterations, is physically necessary; hence, the notion of quantum ''immortality''.

A version of the experimenter surviving stands in stark contrast to the implications of the Copenhagen interpretation, according to which, although the survival outcome is possible in every iteration, its probability tends towards zero as the number of iterations increases. Due to the many-worlds interpretation, the above scenario has the opposite property: the probability of a version of the experimenter living is necessarily one for any number of iterations.

==Real-world feasibility==
In response to questions about "subjective immortality", [[Max Tegmark]] made some brief comments: He acknowledged the argument that "everyone will be immortal" may follow if a survivor outcome is possible for all life-threatening events. The flaw in that argument, he suggests, is that dying is rarely a binary event; it is a progressive process. The quantum suicide thought experiment attempts to isolate all possible outcomes for the duration of the thought experiment. That isolation delays [[decoherence]] in such a way that the subjective experience of the superposition is illustrated. It is only within the confines of such an abstract quantum scenario that an observer finds they defy all odds.

Physicist [[David Deutsch]], though a proponent of the MWI, states regarding quantum suicide that "that way of applying probabilities does not follow directly from quantum theory, as the usual one does. It requires an additional assumption, namely that when making decisions one should ignore the histories in which the decision-maker is absent....[M]y guess is that the assumption is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Beginning of Infinity |publisher=Penguin Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tegmark also believes experimenters will only expect a normal probability of survival, not immortality. The experimenter's [[probability amplitude]] in the wavefunction decreases significantly, meaning they exist with a much lower measure than they had before. Per the [[anthropic principle]], a person is less likely to find themselves in a world where they are less likely to exist, that is, a world with a lower measure has a lower probability of being observed. Therefore, the experimenter will have a lower probability of observing a world in which they survive than the world in which they set up the experiment.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegmark |first=Max |year=2014 |title=Our Mathematical Universe |publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same problem of reduced measure was pointed out by [[Lev Vaidman]] in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reservoir sampling''' is a family of [[randomized algorithm]]s for randomly choosing a [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; items from a list &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is either a very large or unknown number. Typically, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is too large to fit the whole list into [[main memory]].

== Example: Sample size 10 ==
Suppose we see a sequence of items, one at a time. We want to keep ten items in memory, and we want them to be selected at random from the sequence. If we know the total number of items &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution is easy: select 10 distinct indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with equal probability, and keep the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th elements. The problem is that we do not always know the exact &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in advance. A possible solution is the following:
* Keep the first ten items in memory.
* When the {{mvar|i}}-th item arrives (for &lt;math&gt;i&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;):
** with probability &lt;math&gt;10/i&lt;/math&gt;, keep the new item (discard an old one, selecting which to replace at random, each with chance 1/10)
** with probability &lt;math&gt;1-10/i&lt;/math&gt;, keep the old items (ignore the new one)

Thus,
* when there are 10 items or fewer, each is kept with probability 1; 
* when there are 11 items, each of them is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/11&lt;/math&gt;; for the old items, that is &lt;math&gt;(1)(1/11 + (10/11)(9/10)) = 1/11 + 9/11 = 10/11&lt;/math&gt;
**In other words, the 10 old items are kept either if the new one is not selected &lt;math&gt;1/11&lt;/math&gt; or the new one is selected to replace one of the other 9 items &lt;math&gt;10/11 \times 9/10&lt;/math&gt;, and since "or" is represented with addition, we derive &lt;math&gt;(1/11 + (10/11)(9/10))&lt;/math&gt;.
* when there are 12 items, the twelfth item is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/12&lt;/math&gt;, and each of the previous 11 items are also kept with probability &lt;math&gt;(10/11)(2/12 + (10/12)(9/10)) = (10/11)(11/12) = 10/12 &lt;/math&gt;;
* by induction, it is easy to prove that when there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, each item is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algorithm R ==
The most common example was labelled ''Algorithm R'' by [[Jeffrey Vitter]] in his paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitter|first1=Jeffrey S.|title=Random sampling with a reservoir|journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|date=1 March 1985|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–57|doi=10.1145/3147.3165|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple O(''n'') algorithm as described in the ''Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Reservoir sampling
|work=Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures
|first=Paul E.
|last=Black
|date= 26 January 2015
|accessdate=2017-02-09
|url= https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/reservoirSampling.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the following steps (assuming ''k &lt; n'' and using one-based array [[Zero-based numbering|indexing]]):

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]

  // replace elements with gradually decreasing probability
  for i = k+1 to n
    j := random(1, i)   // important: inclusive range
    if j &lt;= k
        R[j] := S[i]
&lt;/source&gt;

The algorithm creates a "reservoir" array of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and populates it with the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; items of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. It then iterates through the remaining elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; until &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is exhausted. At the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm generates a random number &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; between 1 and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of the reservoir array is replaced with the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In effect, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be included in the reservoir with probability &lt;math&gt;k/i&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, at each iteration the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of the reservoir array is chosen to be replaced with probability &lt;math&gt;1/k * k/i&lt;/math&gt;, which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;1/i&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that when the algorithm has finished executing, each item in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has equal probability (i.e. &lt;math&gt;k/length(S)&lt;/math&gt;) of being chosen for the reservoir.

To see this, consider the following proof by [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. After the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round, let us assume, the probability of a number being in the reservoir array is &lt;math&gt;k/(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the probability of the number being replaced in the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is &lt;math&gt;1/i&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that it survives the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is &lt;math&gt;(i-1)/i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the probability that a given number is in the reservoir after the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is the product of these two probabilities, i.e. the probability of being in the reservoir after the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round, and surviving replacement in the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round. This is &lt;math&gt;(k/(i-1)) * ((i-1)/i)=k/i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the result holds for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and is therefore true by induction.

== Reservoir with Random Sort ==
A simple reservoir-based algorithm can be designed using random sort&lt;ref name=Sunter1977&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunter|first1=A. B.|title=List Sequential Sampling with Equal or Unequal Probabilities without Replacement|journal=Applied Statistics|date=1977|volume=26|issue=3|pages=261|doi=10.2307/2346966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using priority queue data structure. This algorithm assigns random number as keys to each item and maintain k items with minimum value for keys. In essence, this is equivalent to assigning a random number to each item as key, sorting items using these keys and taking top k items. The worse case run time of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(n \log k)&lt;/math&gt; while the best case runtime is &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Even though the worse case runtime is not as good as Algorithm R, this algorithm can easily be extended to weighted sampling. Note that both algorithms can operate on streams of unspecified lengths.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S is a stream of items to sample, R will contain the result
  S.Current returns current item in stream
  S.Next advances stream to next position
  min-priority-queue supports:
    Count -&gt; number of items in priority queue
    Minimum -&gt; returns minimum key value of all items
    Extract-Min() -&gt; Remove the item with min key
    Insert(key, Item) -&gt; Adds item with specified key
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..?], R[1..k])
  H = new min-priority-queue
  while S has data
    r = Random(0,1)
    if H.Count &lt; k
      H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    else
      if H.Minimum &lt; r
        H.Extract-Min()
        H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    S.Next
&lt;/source&gt;

== Weighted Random Sampling using Reservoir ==
In many applications sampling is required to be according to the weights that are assigned to each items available in set. For example, it might be required to sample queries in a search engine with weight as number of times they were performed so that the sample can be analyzed for overall impact on user experience. There are two ways to interpret weights assigned to each item in the set:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weighted random sampling with a reservoir|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002001900500298X|journal = Information Processing Letters|date = 2006-03-16|pages = 181–185|volume = 97|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.ipl.2005.11.003|first = Pavlos S.|last = Efraimidis|first2 = Paul G.|last2 = Spirakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Let the weight of each item be &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and sum of all weights be {{mvar|W}}. We can convert weight to probability of item getting selected in sample as &lt;math&gt;P_i = w_i / W&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let the weight of two items {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} be &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;. Let the probability of item {{mvar|i}} getting selected in sample be &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, then we give &lt;math&gt;p_j = \min(1, p_i \frac{w_j}{w_i})&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Algorithm A-Res ===
The following algorithm was given by Efraimidis and Spirakis that uses interpretation 1:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S is a stream of items to sample, R will contain the result
  S.Current returns current item in stream
  S.Weight  returns weight of current item in stream
  S.Next advances stream to next position
  The power operator is represented by ^
  min-priority-queue supports:
    Count -&gt; number of items in priority queue
    Minimum() -&gt; returns minimum key value of all items
    Extract-Min() -&gt; Remove the item with minimum key
    Insert(key, Item) -&gt; Adds item with specified key
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..?], R[1..k])
  H = new min-priority-queue
  while S has data
    r = Random(0,1) ^ (1/S.Weight)  // important: inclusive range
    if H.Count &lt; k
      H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    else
      if H.Minimum &lt; r
        H.Extract-Min()
        H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    S.Next
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;This algorithm is identical to the algorithm given in [[Reservoir sampling#Reservoir with Random Sort|Reservoir Sampling with Random Sort]] except for the line how we generate the key using random number generator. The algorithm is equivalent to assigning each item a key &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|r}} is the random number and then sort items using these keys and finally select top k items for the sample.

=== Algorithm A-Chao ===
Following algorithm was given by M. T. Chao uses interpretation 2:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
  S[i].Weight contains weight for each item
 *)
WeightedReservoir-Chao(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  WSum = 0
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]
      WSum = WSum + S[i].Weight/k
  for i = k+1 to n
    WSum = WSum + S[i].Weight/k
    p = S[i].Weight / WSum // probability for this item
    j := random(0, 1);     // important: inclusive range
    if j &lt;= p              // select item according to probability
        R[random(1,k)] := S[i]  //uniform selection in reservoir for replacement

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;For each item, its relative weight is calculated and used to randomly decide if the item will be added into the reservoir. If the item is selected, then one of the existing items of the reservoir is uniformly selected and replaced with the new item. The trick here is that, if the probabilities of all items in the reservoir are already proportional to their weights, then by selecting uniformly which item to replace, the probabilities of all items remain proportional to their weight after the replacement.

== Distributed Reservoir Sampling ==
In many applications, amount of data from which a small sample is needed is too large and it is desirable to distribute sampling tasks among many machines in parallel to speed up the process. A simple approach that is often used, although less performant, is to assign a random number as key to each item and then perform a distributed sort and finally obtain a sample of desired size from top k items. If weighted sample is desired then key is computed using &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|r}} is the random number and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of an item. The inefficiency in this approach obviously arises from required distributed sort on very large amount of data.

Another more efficient approach for distributed weighted random sampling is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gregable: Reservoir Sampling - Sampling from a stream of elements|url = http://gregable.com/2007/10/reservoir-sampling.html|website = gregable.com|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Distribute data among m machines.
# Each machine does its own weighted sampling using key &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; as described in previous section and produces a sample of size &lt;= k items. 
# Collects all m samples of size &lt;= k. We should have total items &lt;math&gt;n' &lt;= mk&lt;/math&gt;.
# Now sample k items from &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; items from step 3 using key that was already computed in Step 2. This means instead of re-generating key using random number generator in sampling algorithm, we use the key we already had assigned in step 2.
The Step 4 uses keys from Step 2 because we might have unbalanced data distribution on machines. For example, lets say k = 1, machine m1 only gets 1 item with weight 10 while machine m2 gets 2 items each with weight 100. Intuitively probability for items from m1 getting in final sample is 10/210. In Step 3, we will get 1 item from m1 as well as m2. If we recalculate keys in step 4 then the probability that item from m1 will be in final sample is 10/110 instead of required 10/210. Now observe that weighted reservoir sampling algorithm from previous section decreases max key value in priority queue as it processes more items. Therefore, items sampled from machine with larger chunk will have lower key values and thus higher chance of getting selected.

== Relation to Fisher-Yates shuffle ==
Suppose one wanted to draw ''k'' random cards from a deck of playing cards (i.e., ''n=52'').
A natural approach would be to shuffle the deck and then take the top ''k'' cards.
In the general case, the shuffle also needs to work even if the number of cards in the deck is not known in advance, a condition which is satisfied by the inside-out version of the [[Fisher-Yates shuffle]]:

   To initialize an array ''a'' of ''n'' elements to a randomly shuffled copy of ''S'', both 0-based: &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[0] &amp;#8592; ''S''[0] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 1 '''to''' ''n'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''i''] &amp;#8592; ''a''[''r''] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']

Note that although the rest of the cards are shuffled, only the top ''k'' are important in the present context.
Therefore, the array ''a'' need only track the cards in the top ''k'' positions while performing the shuffle, reducing the amount of memory needed.
Truncating ''a'' to length ''k'', the algorithm is modified accordingly:
   To initialize an array ''a'' to ''k'' random elements of ''S'' (which is of length ''n''), both 0-based: &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[0] &amp;#8592; ''S''[0] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 1 '''to''' ''k'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''i''] &amp;#8592; ''a''[''r''] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']  &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' k '''to''' ''n'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''if''' (''r'' &lt; ''k'') '''then''' ''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']

Since the order of the first ''k'' cards is immaterial, the first loop can be removed and ''a'' can be initialized to be the first ''k'' items of ''S''.
This yields ''Algorithm R''.

== Fast Approximation ==

A [https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/11/20/very-fast-reservoir-sampling/ fast approximation] to reservoir sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/11/20/very-fast-reservoir-sampling/ |title = Very Fast Reservoir Sampling |last1 = Erlandson |first1 = Erik J. |date = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Uses a good-quality approximation to the sampling-gap distribution to skip over the gaps; i.e. consecutive runs of data that
are not sampled.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
  The reservoir size is (k)
 *)
FastApproximateReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]

  // Threshold (t) determines when to start fast sampling logic
  // The optimal value for (t) may vary depending on RNG performance characteristics
  t := 4 * k

  // Normal reservoir sampling is fastest up to (t) samples
  i := 1 + k
  while (i &lt;= n  &amp;&amp;  i &lt;= t)
    j := random(1, i)  // integer from 1 to i, inclusive
    if j &lt;= k
        R[j] := S[i]
    i := i + 1

  // Once gap sizes become significant, it pays to use
  // fast sampling using an approximate sampling gap distribution
  while (i &lt;= n)
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = k / i
    p := k / i
    u := randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0.0 and &lt;= 1.0
    g := floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    // advance over the gap, and assign next element to the reservoir
    i := i + g
    if (i &lt;= n)
      j := random(1, k)  // integer 1 to k, inclusive
      R[j] := S[i]
      i := i + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example implementation ==
The following is a simple implementation of the algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] that samples the set of English Wikipedia page titles:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import random
SAMPLE_COUNT = 10

# Force the value of the seed so the results are repeatable
random.seed(12345)

sample_titles = []
for index, line in enumerate(open("enwiki-20091103-all-titles-in-ns0")):
        # Generate the reservoir
        if index &lt; SAMPLE_COUNT:
                sample_titles.append(line)
        else:
                # Randomly replace elements in the reservoir
                # with a decreasing probability.
                # Choose an integer between 0 and index (inclusive)
                r = random.randint(0, index)
                if r &lt; SAMPLE_COUNT:
                        sample_titles[r] = line
print sample_titles
&lt;/source&gt;

== Statistical properties ==
Probabilities of selection of the reservoir methods are discussed in Chao (1982)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/69/3/653.abstract Chao, M.T. (1982) A general purpose unequal probability sampling plan. Biometrika, 69 (3): 653-656.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Tillé (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Sampling-Algorithms-Springer-Series-Statistics/dp/0387308148 Tillé, Y. (2006). Sampling Algorithms. Springer]&lt;/ref&gt; While the first-order selection probabilities are equal to &lt;math&gt;k/n&lt;/math&gt; (or, in case of Chao's procedure, to an arbitrary set of unequal probabilities), the second order selection probabilities depend on the order in which the records are sorted in the original reservoir. The problem is overcome by the [[cube sampling]] method of Deville and Tillé (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/4/893.short Deville, J.-C., and Y. Tillé (2004). Efficient balanced sampling: The cube method. Biometrika 91 (4): 893-912.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Reservoir sampling makes the assumption that the desired sample fits into [[main memory]], often implying that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant independent of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In applications where we would like to select a large subset of the input list (say a third, i.e. &lt;math&gt;k=n/3&lt;/math&gt;), other methods need to be adopted. Distributed implementations for this problem have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://had00b.blogspot.com/2013/07/random-subset-in-mapreduce.html Reservoir Sampling in MapReduce]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11260">'''Secondary Causation'''&lt;ref&gt;“Causality Primary and Secondary”, Mariano Artigas, Encyclopedia of Science and Religion, ©2003 Gale Cengage; online at http://www.enotes.com/causality-primary-secondary-reference/causality-primary-secondary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Kant’s Theory of Divine and Secondary Causation”, Des Hogan, University of California at San Diego; online at http://philosophy.ucsd.edu/_files/facultysites/watkins-conference/hogan.pdf;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Causation as a Secondary Quality”, Peter Menzies and Huw Price, Br. J. Philos. Sci., 44 (1993), 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; is the philosophical proposition that all material and corporeal objects, having been created by God with their own intrinsic potentialities, are subsequently empowered to evolve independently in accordance with natural law.  Traditional Christians would slightly modify this injunction to allow for the occasional miracle as well as the exercise of free will.  Deists who deny any divine interference past the creation event would only accept free will exceptions.  That the physical universe is consequentially well-ordered, consistent, and knowable subject to human observation and reason, was a primary theme of [[Scholasticism]] and further molded into the philosophy of the Western Tradition by [[Augustine]] and later by [[Aquinas]].

Secondary causation has been suggested as a necessary precursor for scientific inquiry into an established order of natural laws which are not entirely predicated on the changeable whims of a supernatural Being.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby E. The Rise of Early Modem Science: Islam, China and the West, Cambridge University Press, (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor does this create a conflict between science and religion for, given a Creator, it is not inconsistent with the paradigm of a [[clockwork universe]].   It does however remove logical contradictions concerning the unfettered expression of man’s free will which would otherwise require not just God’s acquiescence but rather His direct intervention to implement.

==Opposing Philosophies of Volunteerism and Occasionalism against Secondary Causation==

According to the Jewish Torah which brought down the original idea in Genesis, the phrase "free will" is a mistranslation from the Torah, rather what humans are given is "freedom to choose".
Freedom to choose to do God's Will at all times even though God gave us a good inclination and a not-good inclination to use in choosing, we are told "Therefore choose life".

Occasionalism itself was derived from the earlier school of thought of “volunteerism” emanating from [[Al-Ash'ari]] who held that every particle in the universe must be constantly recreated each instant by God’s direct intervention.

==Kabbalahistic Interpretation==

According to the Kabbalah and brought down in Chasidic philosophy in the book "[[Tanya|Tania]], the Book of Intermediates" composed by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (Russia) at the beginning of the 19th century, 
the will and desire to create the universe is integral to the Creator's very essence &amp; thought this being the source for all the physical and spiritual worlds.

Once the Creator has created the universe and God knows &amp; wants the Creation as the One who created it in His very essence, God then enlivens and vivifies all parts of the universe at every moment or the physical universe &amp; the many spiritual worlds would revert instantly to their source in the Creator from where they came.
At the same time as molecules move, human cells divide the Creator must know the Creation as it was a moment ago and makes allowance for the finite Creations to grow  and later slowly wither, and by the evaporation of water, the wearing down of rocks and soil, the birth, growth and weakening of the flesh of fish, animals and humans all Creations as they are built from the 4 main spiritual worlds which also break down, they have a mirror on earth of air, fire, water, dust and slowly all created beings wear down by God's constant  enlivening of them until each of the 4 elements return to their spiritual source which mirror the 4 elements. This is not an independent of God  activity, rather it is all controlled by God's Will.

Torah explains that before Creation there was only God and nothing else as is seen in  the highest Name the letter "Yud".
When it came time for Creation the want and will of God to Create a universe
which meant expansion of the Holy Name the Holy Name Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey  how this Creation came about by G-D's use of the 10 Sefirot would be too great a task to explain here but basically we find "And God said let there be..."

The Creation made no change in the Creator God was, is and always will be but the Creation is available to those Created as an order always vivified by God since God must know the Creation in order to keep it as it is, yet allow for His change according to his will. The body sees a Creation while the soul sees only The Infinite One God.

Having the gift from God, "the Freedom to choose" to serve God and always do God's Will here on earth makes us partners in creation. Being that God's Will was revealed to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai and spread to the world in the Torah we have Freedom to choose to do so.  If a human does the opposite of God's Will it is in God's realm to alter the cosmic plan of Creation that He Himself devised, that He Himself wants but since nothing exists but God, including the universe and this "nothing" is not above the knowledge that "nothing is too hard for God" and "Our wisdom is not His Wisdom",  it is a fundamental theme in Torah that we must do God's will yet we have Freedom to serve or not and if we go against God's will, it is still a lack on our part as partners with God here on earth but this itself is God's Will and will not upset the cosmic original plan.

We see this when Shimi cursed King David and threw stones at him that King David did not get angry since he realized that Shimi was an agent from God himself or Shimi could not possibly use his physical God given talents to speak or throw stones if God did not want. Even though Shimi was not told by God,  Shimi used his Freedom to Serve in the wrong way, but if Shimi had not cursed David at God's Will, "God has many messengers to do His will"

In fact, with Adam and Eve there in, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil was created before Adam himself by God and this is all part of His plan, to turn away from evil.

==Opposing Philosophy of  ”Dual Truth” against Secondary Causation==
The concept of there being two distinct truths, even concerning the same object or phenomena, was most notably developed by [[Averroes]] (1126-1198 from Spain).  By thus separating the sanctity of religious revelation from the practical world of physical observation, it was an attempt to circumvent proscriptions on the discredited rationalist heresy of [[Muʿtazila]], which had heretofore not gained traction in any venue.

Following [[Augustine]] and many others, this concept of [[double truth]] was soundly rejected by Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae which reiterated the long established view in the West that there can be only one truth.   The original quote from Augustine was
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In matters that are obscure and far beyond our vision, even in such as we may find treated in Holy Scripture, different Interpretations are sometimes possible without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such a case, we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture."&lt;ref&gt;“St. Augustine, the Literal Meaning of Genesis”. vol. 1, Ancient Christian Writers., vol. 41. Translated and annotated by John Hammond Taylor, S.J. New York: Paulist Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Development of Philosophy in Support of Secondary Causation==
The assignment of intrinsic qualities to objects which can mutate and evolve of their own accord without divine intervention was a crucial step in the transformation of the rational logic of the Greeks into the scientific method&lt;ref&gt;“The Origin of Science”, by Stanley L. Jaki.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Western Tradition of the late Middle Ages.   Because man could thus observe and characterize the natural flow of events without impugning the prerogatives of supernatural forces, burgeoning philosopher-scientists became free to experiment and especially to question and debate the results.

In Western Europe this rationale was further strengthened by the motivation that science was uniquely able not only to efficiently manage the world as charged to do so in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] but also to be able to distinguish miracles from natural occurrences.

One of the first to take advantage of this opportunity was [[Albertus Magnus]] of Cologne (1193-1206), who wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In studying nature we have not to inquire how God the Creator may, as He freely wills, use His creatures to work miracles and thereby show forth His power; we have rather to inquire what Nature with its immanent causes can naturally bring to pass."&lt;ref&gt;“De vegetabilibus etplantis”, by Albertus Magnus(1193-1206)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This sentiment was echoed in various European forums of the day notably by the secular Professor of Theology at the University of Paris, John [[Buridan]] (1300-1361) who liberally commented on the works of Aristotle.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“It should also be noted that [when we ask whether metaphysics is the same as wisdom,] we are not comparing metaphysics to theology, which proceeds from beliefs that are not known, because although these beliefs are not known per se and most evident, we hold without doubt that theology is the more principal discipline and that it is wisdom most properly speaking. In this question, however, we are merely asking about intellectual habits based on human reason, [i.e.,] those discovered by the process of reasoning, which are deduced from what is evident to us. For it is in this sense that Aristotle calls metaphysics ‘theology’ and ‘the divine science’. Accordingly, metaphysics differs from theology in the fact that although each considers God and those things that pertain to divinity, metaphysics only considers them as regards what can be proved and implied, or inductively inferred, by demonstrative reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Compendium of Dialectic [Summulae de dialectica]. by Buridan (&lt;1300-1361)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, John Buridan online at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular area of work is the concept of fully or partially self-powered dynamic systems requiring zero or reduced external [[energy]] inputs. The exploited technologies are particularly associated with self-powered [[sensors]], regenerative [[actuators]], [[human power]]ed devices, and dynamic systems powered by [[renewable resources]] (e.g. [[solar-powered]] [[airships]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fBr7l-Lrw] Brunel Solar Powered Robotic Airship - Octoship.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0TMFUxOiFM] Brunel Solar Powered Autonomous Airship.&lt;/ref&gt;) as self-sustained systems. Various strategies can be employed to improve the design of a self-powered system and among them adopting a bio-inspired design is investigated to demonstrate the advantage of [[biomimetics]] in improving power density.

[[File:The concept of Self-powered Dynamic Systems.png|thumb|400px|The concept of self-powered dynamic systems]]

The concept of "self-powered dynamic systems" in the figure is described as follows.

I.	Input power (e.g. fuel energy powering a vehicle engine or propulsion system), or input excitation (e.g. vibration excitation to a structure) to the system. The source of this input energy can be of renewable energy source (e.g. solar power to a dynamic system).

II.	The kinetic energy in the direction of motion of a dynamic system is only recovered if the system is stationary (e.g. a bridge structure), or the recoverable energy is negligible in comparison with the power required for motion (e.g. a low powered sensor).

III.	The movement of the dynamic system perpendicular to the desired direction of the motion is usually the wasted kinetic energy in the system (e.g. the vertical motion of an automobile suspension is wasted to heat energy in the shock absorbers, or vibration of an aircraft wing is converted into heat energy through structural damping).

IV.	The vertical movement of the dynamic system is a source of recoverable kinetic energy.

V.	The recoverable kinetic energy can be converted to electrical energy through an energy conversion mechanism such as an electromagnetic scheme (e.g. replacing the viscous damper of a car shock absorber with regenerative actuator), piezoelectric (e.g. embedding piezoelectric material in aircraft wings), or electrostatic (e.g. vibration of a micro cantilever in a MEMS sensor).

VI.	The recovered electrical power can be stored or used as a power source.

VII.	The recovered electrical energy can power subsystems of the dynamic system such as sensors and actuators.

VIII.	The recovered electrical power can be realized as an input to the dynamic system itself.

Such self-powered schemes are particularly beneficial in development of self-powered sensors&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mestffk/] Farbod Khoshnoud, Houman Owhadi, Clarence W. de Silva, Weidong Zhu and Carlos E.

A self-sustained system does not required maintenance (e.g. replacing the battery of the sensor at the end of the battery life). This is particularly beneficial in remote sensing and applications in hostile or inaccessible environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">The '''simple theorems in the algebra of sets''' are some of the elementary properties of the [[algebraic structure|algebra]] of [[Union (set theory)|union]] ([[infix]] ∪), [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] ([[infix]] ∩), and [[set complement]] ([[postfix (linguistics)|postfix]] ') of sets.

These properties assume the existence of at least two sets: a given [[universal set]], denoted '''U''', and the [[empty set]], denoted {}. The algebra of sets describes the properties of all possible [[subset]]s of  '''U''', called the [[power set]] of '''U''' and denoted  ''P''('''U'''). ''P''('''U''') is assumed [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under union, intersection, and set complement. The algebra of sets is an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or [[model theory|model]] of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], with union, intersection, set complement, '''U''', and {} interpreting Boolean [[logical disjunction|sum]], [[logical conjunction|product]], [[logical negation|complement]], 1, and 0, respectively.

The properties below are stated without [[Mathematical proof|proof]], but can be derived from a small number of properties taken as [[axiom]]s. A "*" follows the algebra of sets interpretation of [[Edward V. Huntington|Huntington's]] (1904) classic postulate set for [[Boolean algebra]]. These properties can be visualized with [[Venn diagram]]s. They also follow from the fact that ''P''('''U''') is a [[Boolean lattice]]. The properties followed by "L" interpret the [[lattice (order)|lattice]] axioms.

Elementary [[discrete mathematics]] courses sometimes leave students with the impression that the subject matter of [[set theory]] is no more than these properties. For more about elementary set theory, see [[Set (mathematics)|set]], [[set theory]], [[algebra of sets]], and [[naive set theory]]. For an introduction to set theory at a higher level, see also [[axiomatic set theory]], [[cardinal number]], [[ordinal number]], [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]], [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]], [[Cantor's theorem]], [[well-ordering theorem]], [[axiom of choice]], and [[Zorn's lemma]].

The properties below include a defined binary operation, [[relative complement]], denoted by infix "\". The "relative complement of ''A'' in ''B''," denoted ''B''&amp;nbsp;\''A'', is defined as (''A''&amp;nbsp;∪''B''&amp;prime;)&amp;prime; and as ''A''&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;∩''B''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1328">'''Social Nature''' is the core concept of a geographical work on the [[social construction]] of [[nature]], entitled ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', which has been published by [[Noel Castree]] and [[Bruce Braun]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, B., ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford and New York: Blackwell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It says that the concept of Social Nature was created by [[Critical geography|critical geographers]] and embraces the idea of a [[socialize]]d [[nature]]. Critical geographers like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] "insisted that nature is social in three related ways":&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, Bruce (Eds.), ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2001, pp.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge "of nature is invariably inflected with the biases of the" knowers,
*"Though knowledges of nature are social through and through, the social dimensions of nature are not reducible to knowledge alone",
*Societies "''physically reconstitute'' nature, both intentionally and unintentionally", to the point of internalizing nature into social processes (particularly in advanced Western societies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1225">'''Transferable utility''' is a concept in [[Cooperative game|cooperative]] [[game theory]] and in [[economics]]. [[Utility]] is ''transferable'' if one player can losslessly transfer part of its utility to another player. Such transfers are possible if the players have a common [[currency]] that is valued equally by all. Note that being able to transfer [[cash]] [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] does not imply that utility is transferable: wealthy and poor players may derive a different utility from the same amount of money.

Transferable utility is assumed in many [[cooperative game]]s, where the [[Payoff matrix|payoffs]] are not given for individual players, but only for coalitions. In this case the assumption implies that irrespective of the division of the coalitional payoff, members of the coalition enjoy the same total [[utility]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36908">'''Transformative learning''' theory says that the process of "perspective transformation" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning is the expansion of consciousness through the transformation of basic worldview and specific capacities of the self; transformative learning is facilitated through consciously directed processes such as appreciatively accessing and receiving the symbolic contents of the unconscious and critically analyzing underlying premises.&lt;ref&gt;Elias, 1997, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. [[Jack Mezirow]] believes that it usually results from a "disorienting dilemma" which is triggered by a [[identity crisis (psychology)|life crisis]] or major life transition—although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1995, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher, also promote transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Torosyan, 2007, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of transformative learning is for individuals to change their frames of reference by critically reflecting on their assumptions and beliefs and consciously making and implementing plans that bring about new ways of defining their worlds. This process is fundamentally rational and analytical.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997"&gt;Mezirow, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grabove 1997, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jack Mezirow==
[[Jack Mezirow]] developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2014/october/jack-mezirow-who-transformed-the-field-of-adult-learning-d/|title=Jack Mezirow, Who Transformed the Field of Adult Learning, Dies at 91|website=Teachers College - Columbia University|language=en|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the theory has evolved "into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and reformulate the meaning of their experience."&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), "they must engage in critical reflection on their experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation."&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1991, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning schemes that make up meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning.

{{quote|A defining condition of being human is that we have to understand the meaning of our experience. For some, any uncritically assimilated explanation by an authority figure will suffice. But in contemporary societies we must learn to make our own interpretations rather than act on the purposes, beliefs, judgements, and feelings of others. Facilitating such understandings is the cardinal goal of adult education. Transformative learning develops autonomous thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1997, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A perspective transformation leading to transformative learning, however, occurs much less frequently. Mezirow believes that this less frequent transformation usually results from a "disorienting dilemma", which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition, although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow 1995, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

The perspective is explained by Mezirow as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Imel |first=Susan |title=Transformative Learning in Adulthood.

==Other perspectives==
A number of critical responses to Mezirow's theory of transformative learning have emerged over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See Cranton (1994) and Taylor (1998) for a full discussion of these critiques.&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of Mezirow's theory is its emphasis upon rationality. Some studies support Mezirow. Others conclude that Mezirow grants rational critical reflection too much importance.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1998, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward W. Taylor&lt;ref name="Transformative Learning Theory"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Taylor |author2=Edward W. |title= Transformative Learning Theory: A Neurobiological Perspective of the Role of Emotions and Unconscious Ways of Knowing|journal= International Journal of Lifelong Education |date=May–June 2001 |volume=20|issue=3|pages=218–236|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ627580 |doi=10.1080/02601370110036064}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since suggested neurobiological research as a promising area that may offer some explanation about the role emotions play, closing the gap between rationality and emotion in the transformative learning process. Taylor implies that, with available modern technology such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), these once obscure factors can now be examined through determining which neurological brain systems are at work during disorienting dilemmas and the journey of recovery that follows.  This neurobiological research also stresses the importance of the role of [[implicit memory]], from which emerge habits, attitudes and preferences that are related to unconscious thoughts and actions.

While the learning process is certainly rational on some levels, it is also a profound experience that can be described as a spiritual or emotional transformation as well. The experience of undoing racist, sexist, and other oppressive attitudes can be painful and emotional, as these attitudes have often been developed as ways to cope with and make sense of the world. This type of learning requires taking risks, and a willingness to be vulnerable and have one's attitudes and assumptions challenged.

Other theorists have proposed a view of transformative learning as an intuitive and emotional process. John M. Dirkx, Robert D. Boyd, J. Gordon Myers, and Rosemary R. Ruether link Mezirow's rational, cognitive and analytical approach to a more intuitive, creative and holistic view of transformative learning.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; This view of transformative learning is based primarily on the work of Robert Boyd,&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who has developed a theory of transformative education based on [[analytical psychology|analytical (or depth) psychology]].

For Boyd, transformation is a "fundamental change in one's personality involving [together] the resolution of a personal dilemma and the expansion of consciousness resulting in greater personality integration".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, 1989, p. 459, cited in Taylor 1998, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This calls upon extra-rational sources such as [[symbol]]s, [[image]]s, and [[archetype]]s to assist in creating a personal vision or meaning of what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988; Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

First, an individual must be receptive or open to receiving "alternative expressions of meaning", and then recognize that the message is authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd &amp; Myers, 1988, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Grieving, considered by Boyd to be the most critical phase of the discernment process, takes place when an individual realizes that old patterns or ways of perceiving are no longer relevant, moves to adopt or establish new ways, and finally integrates old and new patterns.  More recent research has specifically explored the process of transformative learning as it occurs in bereaved elders,&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly" &gt;{{cite journal |last= Moon |first= Paul J.|title= Bereaved elders: Transformative Learning Late in Life.  Adult Education Quarterly |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2011 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=22–39|url=http://aeq.sagepub.com/content/61/1/22.abstract |doi=10.1177/0741713610363020}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that the "disorienting dilemma" deemed necessary by Mezirow is present in the loss of a loved one, with an additional devastating factor being the isolation that the elderly in particular are likely to face. Another study considers transformative learning in the context of suicide bereavement.&lt;ref name= "Adult Education Quarterly b" &gt;{{cite journal | last= Sands |first= Diana. |author2=Tennant, Mark |title= Transformative Learning in the Context of Suicide Bereavement |journal= Adult Education Quarterly |date=February 2010 |volume=60  |issue=2|pages=99 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/47875269/transformative-learning-context-suicide-bereavement |doi=10.1177/0741713609349932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the dilemma is compounded by the questioning of conceptions or misconceptions that were held about the relationship with the deceased, and the resolving of the meaning of that relationship during the grieving process.

Unlike Mezirow, who sees the ego as playing a central role in the process of perspective transformation, Boyd and Myers use a framework that moves beyond the ego and the emphasis on reason and logic to a definition of transformative learning that is more [[Social psychology#Psychosocial theory|psychosocial]] in nature.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"&gt;Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of transformative learning was put forward by Edmund O'Sullivan:&lt;ref name="OS"&gt;O'Sullivan, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. It is a shift of consciousness that dramatically and irreversibly alters our way of being in the world. Such a shift involves our understanding of ourselves and our self-locations; our relationships with other humans and with the natural world; our understanding of relations of power in interlocking structures of class, race and gender; our body awareness, our visions of alternative approaches to living; and our sense of possibilities for social justice and peace and personal joy.}}

Positing that understanding transformative learning may have been hindered by perspectives of rational thought and Western traditions, Kathleen P. King&lt;ref name="OS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; provides an alternate model grounded in a meta-analysis of research, the "Transformative Learning Opportunities Model".

Recent considerations of these varying perspectives seem to indicate that one perspective does not need to exclude the other. For example, Mezirow and Dirkx discussed their views on transformative learning at a 2005 International Transformative Learning Conference. This dialogue, facilitated by Patricia Cranton, continued via email after the conference and the overview was published in the ''[[Journal of Transformative Education]]''.  Dirkx focuses on subjectivity, in the power of the inner world in one's shift in view of the outer world.  Mezirow emphasizes critical assessment of assumptions.  Although their approaches are different, they agree that their perspectives are similar in several aspects. This includes transforming frames of reference that have lost meaning or have become dysfunctional, and fostering enhanced awareness and consciousness of one's being in the world. Both perspectives are required to deepen understanding and to incorporate these ways of learning into transformative education.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, Mezirow &amp;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the difficulties in defining transformative learning is that it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as "[[meaning making]]" or "[[critical thinking]]".

The term "meaning making" (i.e., constructing meaning) is found most frequently in [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approaches to education, based on the work of educators such as [[John Dewey]], [[Maria Montessori]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Jerome Bruner]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]]. In the constructivist view, meaning is constructed from knowledge.

John Dirkx views transformational learning as a [[meaning-making]] process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision of society and self-actualization of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1998). Transformative learning theory in the practice of adult education: An overview. ''PAACE Journal of Lifelong Learning, 7,'' 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning ''is'' life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment to focus on the here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language for helping us learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Dirkx, J. M. (1997). Nurturing soul in adult education. Retrieved from https://www.msu.edu/~dirkx/DIRKX.CHP.htm#N_1_ on October 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.

Mezirow&lt;ref&gt;Mezirow, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; posits that all learning is change but not all change is transformation. There is a difference between transmissional, transactional and transformational education.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Seller, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the first, knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student. In transactional education, it is recognized that the student has valuable experiences, and learns best through experience, inquiry, critical thinking and interaction with other learners. It could be argued that some of the research regarding transformative learning has been in the realm of transactional education, and that what is seen as transformative by some authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cragg et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; is in fact still within the realm of transactional learning.

According to Stephen D. Brookfield, learning can only be considered transformative if it involves a fundamental questioning or reordering of how one thinks or acts; a challenge to hegemonic  implications.&lt;ref&gt;Brookfield, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, reflection alone does not result in transformative learning unless the process involves a critical reflection, a recognition and analysis of taken-for-granted assumptions.

==In practice==
On the surface, the two views of transformative learning presented here are contradictory. One advocates a rational approach that depends primarily on critical reflection whereas the other relies more on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[emotion]]. However, the differences in the two views may best be seen as a matter of emphasis. Both utilize rational processes and incorporate imagination as a part of a creative process. The two different views of transformative learning described here as well as examples of how it occurs in practice&lt;ref&gt;see Cranton, 1997 &amp; Taylor, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that no single model of transformative learning exists.

When transformative learning is the goal of [[adult education]], fostering a learning environment in which it can occur should consider the following:

===The role of the educator===
Transformative learning cannot be guaranteed.  Teachers can only provide an opportunity to transformatively learn.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;Fullerton, James Roderick. ''Transformative learning in college students: A mixed methods study''. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to foster transformative learning, the educator's role is to assist learners in becoming aware and critical of assumptions. This includes their own assumptions that lead to their interpretations, beliefs, habits of mind, or points of view, as well as the assumptions of others. Educators must provide learners practice in recognizing frames of reference. By doing so, educators encourage practice in redefining problems from different perspectives.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; The goal is to create a community of learners who are "united in a shared experience of trying to make meaning of their life experience".&lt;ref&gt;Loughlin, 1993, pp. 320–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators need to provide learners with opportunities to effectively participate in discourse.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Discourse involves assessing beliefs, feelings, and values.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006"&gt;Cranton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view. Learners are able to validate how and what they understand, as well as develop well-informed judgments regarding a belief. Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator must encourage equal participation among students in discourse. One strategy is to encourage procedures that require group members to take on the roles of monitoring the direction of dialogue and ensuring equal participation. Educators can also encourage dialogue from different perspectives through controversial statements or readings from opposing points of view. It is necessary that the educator avoids shaping the discussion.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;

The role of educators is also to set objectives that include autonomous thinking.  By fostering learners' critical reflection and experience in discourse, autonomous thinking is possible. The foundations to thinking autonomously begin in childhood and continue in adulthood. The educator assists adult learners in becoming more critical in assessing assumptions, better at recognizing frames of references and alternate perspectives, as well as effective at collaborating with others to assess and arrive at judgments in regards to beliefs.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

It is the role of the educator to promote discovery learning through the implementation of classroom methods such as learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations. These methods facilitate transformative learning by helping learners examine concepts in the context of their lives and analyze the justification of new knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The educator's role in establishing an environment that builds trust and care and facilitates the development of sensitive relationships among learners is a fundamental principle of fostering transformative learning.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt; The educator also serves as a role model by demonstrating a willingness to learn and change.&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should provide the environment to allow students to reflect on their transformative learning experiences, but to also allow them to reflect on their own.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;King, Kathleen P. "Both sides now: Examining transformative learning and professional development of educators." ''Innovative higher education'' 29.2 (2004): 155-174.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, professional development is important to assist educators in becoming authentic and critically reflective.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003"&gt;Cranton &amp; King, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Mezirow outlines three ways in which experience is interpreted through reflection:&lt;ref&gt;Cranton, P., &amp; King, K.P. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Content reflection is the investigation of the content. A question that we might ask ourselves is “what did I do that led to the outcome?
* Process reflection includes checking on the problem-solving strategies that are used in the  classroom. For example, “do I understand the needs of my students?”
* Premise reflection is the question of the problem itself. A question might be "“why do I feel responsible for this situation”.

===The role of professional development for the educator===
Transformative learning about teaching occurs when educators critically examine their practice and develop alternative perspectives of understanding their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996"&gt;Cranton, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential that fostering this critical examination become the role of professional development. The role of professional development is to assist educators in gaining awareness of their habits of mind regarding teaching.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; As this professional development occurs, educators critically examine the assumptions that underlie their practice, the consequences to their assumptions, and develop alternative perspectives on their practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 1996" /&gt;

Teachers need education and professional development that will help them to question, challenge and experience critical discussions on school improvement. Transforming teachers so they see themselves as agents of social change can be a challenge within education.&lt;ref&gt;Lysaker &amp; Furuness, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Strategies for transformative professional development ====
Strategies for transformative professional development include action plans, reflective activities, case studies, curriculum development, and critical-theory discussions. Action plans and reflective activities provide the practice and modelling of critical reflection on the profession of education, and provide guidance for the teaching and learning experience.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Through the use of real-life examples, case studies provide the opportunity to analyze assumptions, as well as the consequences of choices and actions. The use of case studies focuses on practice, and on the philosophical and practical aspects of educators' practice.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt; Curriculum development creates the opportunity to connect theory and practice. In addition to introducing new teaching techniques, educators can test and compare new concepts and practices with previous techniques. This testing and comparison moves away from uncritically accepting new teaching methods. Critical-theory discussions can be implemented to guide educators in questioning the meaning and purpose of information, encouraging educators to question the selection of the information they provide to their students.&lt;ref name="Cranton &amp; King, 2003" /&gt;

====Examples in educator professional development====
Mentoring is another strategy for transformative professional, personal and organizational development. By creating a supportive culture, mentoring can provide the environment for transformative learning to occur. Through this experience mentoring becomes a transformative relationship in which individuals reconstruct possible selves. As a two-way process, mentoring is a learning tool for both the mentor as well as the person being mentored.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"&gt;Fletcher, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent study, Karen Weller Swanson, applying theories of critical reflection, incorporating a critical incident model, and positing a learning partnership, designed a program for practicing teachers, for the purpose of transformative teacher development. Experiences were created to get teachers to reflect on their assumptions, asking them to consider alternative perspectives and to develop a language for making connections between theory and practice. Over the studies' two-year period, teachers were able to develop ownership of theory and transfer this knowledge into their practice. To be effective, transformative teacher development must value what teachers bring from their personal and professional experience, and acknowledge that learning is both an individual and a social experience.  The process involved: achieving transparency through negotiation of curriculum, finding a common language through discussion of individual assumptions, getting continuous feedback through critical-incident questions, and testing by teacher application of the program within their classrooms. Autobiography and journaling were additional techniques used within this learning partnership. Both teachers and faculty participating in the program were transformed as beliefs were challenged and knowledge was co-constructed throughout the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

New teachers often find expectations ambiguous, and they lack the self-awareness and understanding to navigate the educational environment. A transformative learning framework was used in a Foundations course, for participants to build on individual and collective analysis of teaching experiences, and to help them re-frame their practice. Giedre Kligyte investigated "transformation narratives" that emerged from written reflection of participants' teaching practice, based on individual reflection and group discussion. By using Mezirow's work, along with Robert Kegan's [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructive developmental theory]], Kligyte found the following themes: a move from non-reflective habitual action to a more conscious practice; a change in perspective to a more sophisticated view of teaching; an increased sense of agency, including the concept that academic practice is an object which can be controlled and shaped, rather than something externally imposed; increased confidence to take risks and experiment; and a more multifaceted idea of what it means to be an academic. The conducive environment allowed for transformative experiences to occur. Through creation of a safe social context where "disorienting dilemmas" can be examined, questioned, and explored, participants were able to develop a new "frame of reference" and reintegrate learning into practice. Kligyte cautions that there are limitations to the framework, such as the possibility that participants will conform to expectations in their reflections. She notes that the "transformation narratives" examined are not a single, final narrative of the self, but a snapshot for further exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Kligyte, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kligyte's findings are similar to S. Fletcher's: that transformative learning helps to make sense of a complex and often ambiguous work environment, which requires multiple selves.&lt;ref name="Fletcher, 2007"/&gt;

===The role of the learner===
The educator becomes a facilitator when the goal of learning is for learners to construct knowledge about themselves, others, and social norms. As a result, learners play an important role in the learning environment and process.&lt;ref name="Cranton, 2006" /&gt;  Learners must create norms within the classroom that include civility, respect, and responsibility for helping one another learn. Learners must welcome diversity within the learning environment and aim for peer collaboration.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

Learners must become critical of their own assumptions in order to transform their unquestioned frame of reference. Through communicative learning, learners must work towards critically reflecting on assumptions that underlie intentions, values, beliefs, and feelings.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt; Learners are involved in objective re-framing of their frames of reference when they critically reflect on the assumptions of others. In contrast, subjective re-framing occurs when learners critically assess their own assumptions.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

The role of the learner involves actively participating in discourse. Through discourse, learners are able to validate what is being communicated to them. This dialogue provides the opportunity to critically examine evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view, which fosters collaborative learning.&lt;ref name="Mezirow, 1997" /&gt;

===The role of the rational and the affective===
Transformative learning has two components that at times seem to be in conflict: the cognitive, rational, and objective and the intuitive, imaginative, and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;Grabove, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Both the rational and the affective play a role in transformative learning. Although the emphasis has been on transformative learning as a rational process, teachers need to consider how they can help students use feelings and emotions both in critical reflection and as a means of reflection.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kegan, Robert (2000) What "form" transforms? A constructive-developmental approach to transformative learning. In Mezirow &amp; Associates Learning as Transformation: Critical Perspectives on a Theory in Progress. San Francisco: Jossey Bass&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of educational and research institutions that are based on the principles of transformative learning. Some examples include the [[Transformative Studies Institute]] and The Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) of the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence is emerging on the applicability of transformative theory in new educational programmes, in business and industry education, health professional education, community education such as courses offered by YMCA, and informal settings such as self-help groups. Phil Bamber and Les Hankin describe how students in a service-learning section experienced perspective transformation and shifts of their world-view when their training was influenced by transformative learning theory.&lt;ref name= "Transformative learning through service-learning"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Bamber |first= Phil. |author2=Les Hankin |title= Transformative learning through service-learning: no passport required |journal= Transformative learning through service-learning|year=2011 | volume=53|issue=2/3|pages=190–206|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1917978 |doi=10.1108/00400911111115726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Imel states that transformative learning may not always be a goal of education, but its importance should not be overlooked. Educators should strive to understand it, even if they choose not to foster it.&lt;ref&gt;Imel, 1997.pg 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13453">A '''two-line element set''' ('''TLE''') is a [[file format|data format]] encoding a list of [[orbital elements]] of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the ''epoch''. Using suitable prediction formula, the [[Orbital_state_vectors|state]] (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the [[simplified perturbations models]] (SGP, [[SGP4]], [[SDP4]], SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of [[space debris]] for purposes of characterizing "future debris events to support [[risk analysis]], close approach analysis, [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)|collision avoidance]] maneuvering" and [[forensic analysis]].&lt;ref name=aiaa2008&gt;

The format was originally intended for [[punch card]]s, encoding a set of elements on two standard 80-column cards. This format was eventually replaced by [[text file]]s with each set of elements written to two 70-column [[ASCII]] lines. The [[United States Air Force]] tracks all detectable objects in Earth orbit, creating a corresponding TLE for each object, and makes available TLEs for non-classified objects on the website Space Track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space-track.org/|title=Introduction and sign in to Space-Track.Org|publisher=Space-track.org|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celestrak.com/|title=Celestrak homepage|publisher=Celestrak.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TLE format is a ''de facto'' standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements.

A TLE set may include a title line preceding the element data, so each listing may take up three lines in the file. The title is not required, as each data line includes a unique object identifier code.

==History==
The two-line format traces its history to seminal work by Max Lane in the early 1960s to develop mathematical models for predicting the locations of satellites based on a minimal set of data elements. His first paper on the topic, published in 1965, introduced the Analytical Drag Theory, which concerned itself primarily with the effects of drag caused by a spherically-symmetric non-rotating atmosphere.&lt;ref name=revisit&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Vallado |first2=Paul |last2=Crawford |first3=Richard |last3=Hujsak |first4=T.S. |last4=Kelso |title=Revisiting Spacetrack Report #3 |url=http://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/AIAA-2006-6753.pdf |journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joined by K. Cranford, the two published a greatly improved model in 1969 that added various harmonic effects due to Earth-Moon-Sun interactions and various other inputs.&lt;ref name=improved&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Max |last1=Lane |first2=Kenneth |last2=Cranford |journal=AIAA |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improved-analytical-drag-theory-for-the-artificial-satellite-problem/oclc/122930989 |title=An improved analytical drag theory for the artificial satellite problem |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane's models were widely used by the military and NASA starting in the late 1960s. The improved version became the standard model for [[NORAD]] in the early 1970s, which ultimately led to the creation of the TLE format. At the time there were two formats designed for [[punch card]]s, an "internal format" that used three cards encoding complete details for the satellite (including name and other data), and the two card "transmission format" that listed only those elements that were subject to change.&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/ADCOM%20DO%20Form%2012.pdf |title=ADCOM Form 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter saved on cards and produced smaller decks when updating the databases.

Cranford continued to work on the modelling, eventually leading Lane to publish ''Spacetrack Report #2'' detailing the Air Force General Perturbation theory, or AFGP4. The paper also described two simplified versions of the system, IGP4 which used a simplified drag model, and SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) which used IGP4's drag model along with a simplified gravity model.&lt;ref name=spacetrack2&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Max |last=Lane |first2=Felix |last2=Hoots |title=General Perturbations Theories Derived from the 1965 Lane Drag Theory |publisher=Project Space Track, Aerospace Defense Command |date=December 1979 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a081264.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the three models were slight for most objects. One year later, ''Spacetrack Report #3'' was released, included full [[FORTRAN]] source code for the SGP4 model.&lt;ref name=spacetrack3&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Felix |last1=Hoots |first2=Ronald |last2=Roehrich |url=https://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/spacetrk.pdf |title=Models for Propagation of NORAD Element Sets |publisher=Project Space Track, Aerospace Defense Command |date=December 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quickly became the ''de facto'' standard model, both in the industry as well as the astronomy field.

Shortly after the publication of ''Report #3'', NASA began posting elements for a variety of visible and other well known objects in their periodic ''NASA Prediction Bulletins'', which consisted of the transmission format data in printed form. After trying for some time to convince NASA to release these in electronic form, T.S. Kelso took matters into his own hands and began manually copying the listings into text files which he distributed through his [https://celestrak.com CelesTrak] [[bulletin board system]]. This revealed a problem in NASA's [[checksum]] system, which traced back to the lack of the plus character (+) on the [[teletype]] machines used at NASA, which ultimately turned out to be a problem from the punch card era that occurred when NORAD updated from the BCD to [[EBCDIC]] [[character set]] on the computer sending out the updates. This problem went away when Kelso began to receive data directly from NORAD in 1989.&lt;ref name=controversy&gt;{{cite web |first=Ted |last=Kelso |title=Two-Line Element Set Checksum Controversy |url=http://celestrak.com/NORAD/documentation/checksum.asp |website=CelesTrak |date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGP4 model was later extended with corrections for deep space objects, creating SDP4, which used the same TLE input data. Over the years a number of more advanced prediction models have been created, but these have not seen widespread use. This is due to the TLE not containing the additional information needed by some of these formats, which makes it difficult to find the elements needed to take advantages of the improved model. More subtly, the TLE data is massaged in a fashion to improve the results when used with the SGP series models, which may cause the predictions of other models to be less accurate than SGP when used with common TLEs. The only new model to see widespread use is SGP8/SDP8, which were designed to use the same data inputs and are relatively minor corrections to the SGP4 model.

==Format==
Originally there were two data formats used with the SGP models, one containing complete details on the object known as the "internal format", and a second known as the "transmission format" that was used to provide updates to that data.

The internal format used three 80-column punch cards. Each card started with a card number, 1, 2 or 3, and ended with the letter "G". For this reason, the system was often known as the "G-card format". In addition to the orbital elements, the G-card included various flags like the launching country and orbit type (geostationary, etc.), calculated values like the [[perigee]] altitude and visual magnitude, and a 38-character comments field.

The transmission format is essentially a cut-down version of the G-card format, removing any data that is not subject to change on a regular basis, or data that can be calculated using other values. For instance, the perigee altitude from the G-card is not included as this can be calculated from the other elements. What remains is the set of data needed to update the original G-card data as additional measurements are made. The data is fit into 70 columns and does not include a trailing character. TLEs are simply the transmission format data rendered as ASCII text.

Where decimal points are assumed, they are leading decimal points. The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 of the first line give powers of 10 to apply to the preceding decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (−0.11606×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;).

The checksums for each line are calculated by adding all numerical digits on that line, including the line number. One is added to the checksum for each negative sign (−) on that line. All other non-digit characters are ignored.

For a body in a typical [[low Earth orbit]], the accuracy that can be obtained with the SGP4 orbit model is on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;km within a few days of the epoch of the element set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelso, T.S.|title=Validation of SGP4 and IS-GPS-200D Against GPS Precision Ephemerides|quote=AAS paper 07-127, presented at the 17th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Conference, Sedona, Arizona|date=29 January 2007|url=http://celestrak.com/publications/AAS/07-127/|publisher=Celestrak.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "low orbit" may refer to either the altitude (minimal or global) or orbital period of the body. Historically, the SGP algorithms defines low orbit as an orbit of less-than 225 minutes.

In [[model theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''type''' is an object that, loosely speaking, describes how a (real or possible) element or elements in a [[structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structure]] might behave.  More precisely, it is a set of [[First-order logic|first-order]] formulas in a language ''L'' with free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that are true of a sequence of elements of an ''L''-structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  Depending on the context, types can be '''complete''' or '''partial''' and they may use a fixed set of constants, ''A'', from the structure &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.  The question of which types represent actual elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; leads to the ideas of [[saturated model]]s and '''omitting types'''.

==Formal definition==
Consider a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; for a [[Formal language|language]] ''L''.  Let ''M'' be the [[Structure (mathematical logic)#Domain|universe]] of the structure. For every ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M'', let ''L''(''A'') be the language obtained from ''L'' by adding a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''A''. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;L(A) = L \cup \{c_a : a \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A '''1-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is a set ''p''(''x'') of formulas in ''L''(''A'') with at most one free variable ''x'' (therefore 1-type) such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'') there is some ''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', depending on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), with &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} \models p_0(b) &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. all formulas in ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; when ''x'' is replaced by ''b'').

Similarly an '''''n''-type (of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;) over''' ''A'' is defined to be a set ''p''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') of formulas in ''L''(''A''), each having its free variables occurring only among the given ''n'' free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that for every finite subset ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''''x''''')&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''p''('''''x''''') there are some elements ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'' with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p_0(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Complete type''' refers to those types that are [[maximal consistent set|maximal]] with respect to inclusion, i.e. if ''p''('''''x''''') is a complete type, then for every &lt;math&gt;\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in L(A,\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt; \phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;  or  &lt;math&gt;\lnot\phi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Any non-complete type is called a '''partial type'''. 
So, the word '''type''' in general refers to any ''n''-type, partial or complete, over any chosen set of parameters (possibly the empty set).

An ''n''-type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be {{anchor|realizationOfTypes}}'''realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;''' if there is an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}\models p(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of such a realization is guaranteed for any type by the [[Compactness theorem]], although the realization might take place in some [[elementary extension]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, rather than in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; itself. 
If a complete type is realized by '''''b''''' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then the type is typically denoted &lt;math&gt;tp_n^{\mathcal{M}}(\boldsymbol{b}/A)&lt;/math&gt; and referred to as '''the complete type of ''b'' over''' ''A''.

A type ''p''('''''x''''') is said to be '''isolated by ''φ''''', for &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in p(x)&lt;/math&gt;, if  &lt;math&gt;\forall \psi(\boldsymbol{x}) \in p(\boldsymbol{x}), \varphi(\boldsymbol{x}) \rightarrow \psi(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Since finite subsets of a type are always realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, there is always an element '''''b'''''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; such that ''φ''('''''b''''') is true in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M} \models \varphi(\boldsymbol{b})&lt;/math&gt;, thus '''''b''''' realizes the entire isolated type. So isolated types will be realized in every elementary substructure or extension. Because of this, isolated types can never be omitted (see below).

A model that realizes the maximum possible variety of types is called a [[saturated model]], and the [[ultraproduct|ultrapower]] construction provides one way of producing saturated models.

==Examples of types==
Consider the language with one binary connective, which we denote as &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the structure &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega, \in_{\omega}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for this language, which is the ordinal &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; with its standard well-ordering. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; denote the theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p(x):=\{ n\in_{\omega} x \mid n \in \omega\} &lt;/math&gt;. First, we claim this is a type. Let &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)\subseteq p(x)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. We need to find an &lt;math&gt;b\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies all the formulas in &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;. Well, we can just take the successor of the largest ordinal mentioned in the set of formulas &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then this will clearly contain all the ordinals mentioned in &lt;math&gt;p_0(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a type. 
Next, note that &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not realized in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. For, if it were there would be some &lt;math&gt;n\in\omega&lt;/math&gt; that contains every element of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. 
If we wanted to realize the type, we might be tempted to consider the model &lt;math&gt;\langle \omega+1,\in_{\omega+1}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, which is indeed a supermodel of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; that realizes the type. Unfortunately, this extension is not elementary, that is this model does not have to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x \forall y (y\in x \lor y=x)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied by this model and not by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

So, we wish to realize the type in an elementary extension. We can do this by defining a new structure in this language, which we will denote &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}'&lt;/math&gt;. The domain of the structure will be &lt;math&gt;\omega \cup \mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers adorned in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'\cap\omega=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt; denote the usual order of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt;. We interpret the symbol &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; in our new structure by &lt;math&gt;\in_{\mathcal{M}'} = \in_{\omega} \cup &lt; \cup \,(\omega \times \mathbb{Z}')&lt;/math&gt;. The idea being that we are adding a "Z-chain", or copy of the integers, above all the finite ordinals. Clearly any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}'&lt;/math&gt; realizes the type &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, one can verify that this extension is elementary.

Another example: the complete type of the number 2 over the emptyset, considered as a member of the natural numbers, would be the set of all first-order statements describing a variable ''x'' that are true for ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. This set would include formulas such as &lt;math&gt;\,\!x\ne 1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\le 1+1+1+1+1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\exists y(y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;. This is an example of an isolated type, since the formula &lt;math&gt;x = 1+1&lt;/math&gt; implies all other formulas that are true about the number 2.

For example, the statements

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y(y^2&lt;2 \implies y&lt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\forall y((y&gt;0 \land y^2&gt;2) \implies y&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt;

describing the [[square root of 2]] are consistent with the axioms of [[ordered field]]s, and can be extended to a complete type. This type is not realized in the ordered field of rational numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of reals. Similarly, the infinite set of formulas (over the emptyset) {x&gt;1, x&gt;1+1, x&gt;1+1+1, ...} is not realized in the ordered field of real numbers, but is realized in the ordered field of [[hyperreals]]. If we allow more parameters, for instance all of the reals, we can specify a type &lt;math&gt;\{ 0 &lt; x &lt; r : r \in \mathbb{R} \}&lt;/math&gt; that is realized by an [[infinitesimal]] hyperreal that violates the [[Archimedean property]].

The reason it is useful to restrict the parameters to a certain subset of the model is that it helps to distinguish the types that can be satisfied from those that cannot. For example, using the entire set of real numbers as parameters one could generate an uncountably infinite set of formulas like &lt;math&gt;x\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\ne \pi&lt;/math&gt;, ... that would explicitly rule out every possible real value for ''x'', and therefore could never be realized within the real numbers.

==Stone spaces==

It is useful to consider the set of complete ''n''-types over ''A'' as a [[topological space]]. Consider the following equivalence relation on formulae in the free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with parameters in ''M'':
:&lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{M} \models \forall x_1,\ldots,x_n (\psi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \leftrightarrow \phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)).&lt;/math&gt;
One can show that &lt;math&gt;\psi \equiv \phi&lt;/math&gt; iff they are contained in exactly the same complete types.

The set of formulae in free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; over ''A'' up to this equivalence relation is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] (and is canonically isomorphic to the set of ''A''-definable subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). The complete ''n''-types correspond to [[ultrafilter]]s of this boolean algebra. The set of complete ''n''-types can be made into a topological space by taking the sets of types containing a given formula as basic open sets. This constructs the [[Stone space]], which is [[compact space|compact]], [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].

'''Example'''. The complete theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 has [[quantifier elimination]], which allows one to show that the possible complete 1-types correspond to:
*[[root of a function|Root]]s of a given [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible non-constant polynomial]] over the rationals with leading coefficient 1. For example, the type of square roots of 2. Each of these types is an open point of the Stone space.
*Transcendental elements, that are not roots of any non-zero polynomial. This type is a point in the Stone space that is closed but not open.
In other words, the 1-types correspond exactly to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''] over the rationals '''Q''': if ''r'' is an element of the model of type ''p'', then the ideal corresponding to ''p'' is the set of polynomials with ''r'' as a root. More generally, the complete ''n''-types correspond to the prime ideals of the polynomial ring '''Q'''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;], in other words to the points of the [[prime spectrum]] of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the Zariski topology of a Boolean ring induced in a natural way from the lattice structure of the Boolean Algebra; while the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if ''q''(''x'',''y'') is an irreducible polynomial in 2 variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (''x'',''y'') of transcendental elements with ''q''(''x'',''y'')=0.

==The omitting types theorem==

Given a complete ''n''-type ''p'' one can ask if there is a model of the theory that '''omits''' ''p'', in other words there is no ''n''-tuple in the model that realizes ''p''. 
If ''p'' is an [[isolated point]] in the Stone space, i.e. if {''p''} is an open set, it is easy to see that every model realizes ''p'' (at least if the theory is complete). The '''omitting types theorem''' says that conversely if ''p'' is not isolated then there is a countable model omitting ''p'' (provided that the language is countable).

'''Example''': In the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0, there is a 1-type represented by elements that are transcendental over the prime field. This is a non-isolated point of the Stone space (in fact, the only non-isolated point). The field of algebraic numbers is a model omitting this type, and the algebraic closure of any 
transcendental extension of the rationals is a model realizing this type.

All the other types are "algebraic numbers" (more precisely, they are the sets of first order statements satisfied by some given algebraic number), and all such types are realized in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0.

A '''windmill''' is a mill that converts the [[wind power|energy of wind]] into [[rotational energy]] by means of vanes called [[windmill sail|sails]] or blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Mill |title=Mill definition |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/windmill |title=Windmill definition stating that a windmill is a mill or machine operated by the wind |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries ago, windmills usually were used to [[mill (grinding)|mill]] grain ([[gristmill]]s), pump water ([[windpump]]s), or both.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gregory, R. The Industrial Windmill in Britain. Phillimore, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of modern windmills take the form of [[wind turbine]]s used to generate electricity, or [[windpump]]s used to pump water, either for land drainage or to extract [[groundwater]].

== Horizontal windmills ==

The first practical windmills had sails that rotated in a horizontal plane, around a vertical axis.&lt;ref name="Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills pp125-145"&gt;Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills. London, Transactions of the Newcomen Society vol.XL 1967-68 pp125-145&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, these [[panemone windmill]]s were invented in eastern [[Greater Iran|Persia]], or [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], as recorded by the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Persian]] geographer [[Estakhri]] in the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=3609 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619044301/http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=3609 |date=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hassan, Hill, p.54f."&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986).

Windmills were in widespread use across the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]], and later spread to China and [[Indian subcontinent|India]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;64–69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar type of horizontal windmill with rectangular blades, used for irrigation, can also be found in thirteenth-century China (during the [[Jurchen Jin dynasty]] in the north), introduced by the travels of [[Yelü Chucai]] to [[Turkestan]] in 1219.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal windmills were built, in small numbers, in Europe during the 18th and nineteenth centuries,&lt;ref name="Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills pp125-145"/&gt; for example [[Fowler's Mill]] at [[Battersea]] in London, and Hooper's Mill at [[History of Margate#Windmills|Margate]] in Kent. These early modern examples seem not to have been directly influenced by the horizontal windmills of the Middle and Far East, but to have been independent inventions by engineers influenced by the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, R L. Power from Wind: A History of Windmill Technology. Cambridge University Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertical windmills ==
Due to a lack of evidence, debate occurs among historians as to whether or not Middle Eastern horizontal windmills triggered the original development of European windmills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shadows in the Desert|first=Kaveh|last=Farrokh|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1-84603-108-7|page=280|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr. ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 86 &amp; p. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |pages=106–7 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=History of, and Recent Progress in, Wind-Energy Utilization|author=[[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sorensen]]|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|volume=20|issue=1|pages=387–424|date=November 1995|doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.20.110195.002131|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northwestern [[Europe]], the horizontal-axis or vertical windmill (so called due to the plane of the movement of its sails) is believed to date from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the triangle of northern France, eastern England and [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. I: The Structure of Everyday Life|page=358|authorlink=Fernand Braudel|first1=Fernand|last1= Braudel|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=9780520081147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the [[The Wolds|Wold]] overlooking the [[Humber Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence Turner|first=Roy Gregory|title=Windmills of Yorkshire|year=2009|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, East Ayrshire|isbn=9781840334753|page=2|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=687}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of earlier, but less certainly dated, twelfth-century European sources referring to windmills have also been found.&lt;ref name="Price2005"&gt;Lynn White Jr., ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
These earliest mills were used to [[gristmill|grind cereals]].&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006" /&gt;

=== Post mill ===
{{main|Post mill}}
The evidence at present is that the earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named because of the large upright post on which the mill's main structure (the "body" or "buck") is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the [[trestle (mill)|trestle]]. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the nineteenth century, when more powerful [[tower mill|tower]] and [[smock mill]]s replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hollow-post mill ====
In a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the fourteenth century onwards.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Tower mill ===
{{main|Tower mill}}
[[File:Molinos de Consuegra.jpg|right|thumb|Tower mills in Spain]]
By the end of the thirteenth century, the masonry [[tower mill]], on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a [[Windmill fantail|fantail]], a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Smock mill ===
{{main|Smock mill}}
[[File:Greetsieler Zwillingsmühlen 2010.jpg|thumb|Two [[smock mill]]s with a stage in [[Greetsiel]], [[Germany]]]]

The smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the "smock", which is thatched, boarded or covered by other materials, such as [[roofing slate|slate]], [[sheet metal]], or [[tar paper]]. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides. The lighter weight than tower mills make smock mills practical as drainage mills, which often had to be built in areas with unstable subsoil. Smock mills originated for drainage, but are also used for other purposes. When used in a built-up area it is often placed on a masonry base to raise it above the surrounding buildings.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Sails ===
{{main|Windmill sail}}
[[File:Kuremaa mõisa tuuleveski.jpg|thumb|Windmill in [[Kuremaa]], [[Estonia]]]]

Common sails consist of a lattice framework on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag" /&gt; The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by [[William Cubitt]] in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In France, [[Pierre-Théophile Berton]] invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}
The majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire]]), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia.&lt;ref name=Sailno&gt;{{Citation | first = Rex| last = Wailes| authorlink= Rex Wailes| year = 1954| month = | title = The English Windmill| pages = 99–104| publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul| location = London | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In the Netherlands the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. A slight tilt of the sails before the main building signals joy, while a tilt after the building signals mourning. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning position in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 [[Malaysian Airlines Flight 17|Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In somber ceremony, Dutch receive the first remains of MH17 victims|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machinery ===
{{Main|Mill machinery}}

Gears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In [[grist mill]]s, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each [[millstone]]. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.
The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A [[windpump|drainage mill]] uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Sawmill]]s use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including [[papermill]]s, [[threshing]] mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 14th century windmills became popular in Europe; the total number of wind-powered mills is estimated to have been around 200,000 at the peak in 1850, which is modest compared to some 500,000 waterwheels.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/history-of-industrial-windmills.html |title=Wind powered factories: history (and future) of industrial windmills |work=Low-tech Magazine |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water, where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag"/&gt; With the coming of the [[industrial revolution]], the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined, and they were eventually replaced by steam (in [[steam mill]]s) and [[internal combustion]] engines, although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century. More recently, windmills have been preserved for their historic value, in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to put in motion, and in other cases as fully working mills.&lt;ref name="Victorian Farm"&gt;''Victorian Farm'', Episode 1. Directed and produced by Naomi Benson. BBC Television&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 10,000 windmills in use in the Netherlands around 1850,&lt;ref name="Stockhuyzen"&gt;Endedijk, L and others. Molens, De Nieuwe Stockhuyzen. Wanders. 2007. {{ISBN|978-90-400-8785-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 1,000 are still standing. Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as backup to the modern pumping stations. The [[Zaanse Schans|Zaan district]] has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Stockhuyzen" /&gt; Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.

Construction of mills spread to the [[Cape Colony]] in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the [[Cape Peninsula]], so in 1717 the [[Heeren XVII]] sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the ''Oude Molen'' and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]]. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=53 |title=Local Windmills |publisher=Mostertsmill.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808134216/http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=53 |archivedate=2013-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wind turbines ==

[[File:西甸子梁风车 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A group of wind turbines in [[Zhangjiakou]], China]]
A [[wind turbine]] is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity. They can be seen as the next step in the development of the windmill. The first wind turbines were built by the end of the nineteenth century by [[Prof James Blyth]] in [[Scotland]] (1887),&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc|title=World First for Scotland Gives Engineering Student a History Lesson|last=Shackleton|first=Jonathan|publisher=The Robert Gordon University|accessdate=20 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063550/http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc|archivedate=17 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles F.

Cleveland,(ed) ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol.6'', Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-1-60119-433-6}}, 2007, pp. 421-422&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul la Cour]] in Denmark (1890s). La Cour's mill from 1896 later became the local powerplant of the village Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators in Denmark, ranging from 5 to 25&amp;nbsp;kW. By the 1930s, windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed, built by companies such as [[Jacobs Wind]], Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline, and Winpower. The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}
[[File:Three 3 prong windmills.jpg|thumb|left|Three windmills in a storm]]

Forerunners of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators were the WIME-3D in service in [[Balaklava]] [[USSR]] from 1931 until 1942, a 100-kW generator on a 30-m (100-ft) tower,&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, ''Wind turbines: fundamentals, technologies, application, economics'', Birkhäuser, 2006 {{ISBN|3-540-24240-6}}, page 32, with a photo&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Smith-Putnam wind turbine]] built in 1941 on the mountain known as Grandpa's Knob in [[Castleton, Vermont]], United States of 1.25 MW&lt;ref name=NP&gt;[http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf The Return of Windpower to Grandpa's Knob and Rutland County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828170455/http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf |date=2008-08-28 }}, Noble Environmental Power, LLC, 12 November 2007.

The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the [[wind turbine design]] technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities.  The modern [[wind power industry]] began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, [[Vestas]], [[NEG Micon|Nordtank]], and [[Siemens|Bonus]]. These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20–30&amp;nbsp;kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

As the 21st century began, rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]]. Worldwide, many thousands of wind turbines are now operating, with a total [[nameplate capacity]] of 194,400&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;Global wind energy council&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind power in Europe|Europe]] accounted for 48% of the total in 2009.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

== Windpumps ==
{{Main|Windpump}}
[[File:Old Windmill.jpg|thumb|[[Aermotor Windmill Company|Aermotor]]-style windpump in [[South Dakota]], USA]]
Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wind pumps became widespread across the [[Muslim world]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[East Anglia]] area of [[Great Britain]], from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

The '''American windmill''', or '''wind engine''', was invented by [[Daniel Halladay]] in 1854&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html |title=fnal.gov |publisher=fnal.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger versions were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html|title=Historic Turns in The Windmill City|last=Clements|first=Elizabeth|work=Ferimi News|publisher=Office of Science/US Dept of Energy|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a [[tankhouse]]. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction.  At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123-127&lt;/ref&gt; Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, [[Eclipse windmill|Eclipse]], [[Fairbanks-Morse]], [[Dempsters|Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company]] and [[Aermotor Windmill Company|Aermotor]] became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.

In Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at [[Toowoomba]] manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876, with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903. These became an icon of the Australian rural sector by utilizing the water of the [[Great Artesian Basin]].&lt;ref name= BM&gt;Bruce Millet, ''[http://www.oocities.org/ozwindmills/SouthernCross.htm Triumph of the Griffiths Family]'' (1984) (retrieved 10-12-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known maker was [[Frederick Metters|Metters Ltd.]] of [[Adelaide]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Sydney]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3973">A '''workcell''' is an arrangement of resources in a manufacturing environment to improve the quality, speed and cost of the process.  Workcells are designed to improve these by improving process flow and eliminating waste.  They are based on the principles of [[Lean Manufacturing]] as described in ''[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine That Changed the World]]'' by Womack, Jones and Roos.&lt;ref name="MTCTW"&gt;''Machine That Changed the World'', James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, Daniel Roos, HarperBusiness, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-06-097417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Classical manufacturing management approaches dictate that costs be lowered by breaking the process into steps, and ensuring that each of these steps minimizes cost and maximizes efficiency. This discrete approach has resulted in machines placed apart from each other to maximize the efficiency and throughput of each machine. The traditional accounting for machine capitalization is based on the number of parts produced, and this approach reinforces the idea of lowering the cost of each machine (by having them produce as many parts as possible.) Increasing the number of parts (WIP) adds waste in areas such as Inventory and Transportation.

Large amounts of excess Inventory often now accumulate between the machines in the process for reasons to do with 'unbalanced' line capacities and batch processing. In addition, the parts must now be transported between the machines. An increase in the number of machines involved also will reduce each worker's multi-skilling proficiency (since that would need them to learn how to operate multiple machines, and they too will need to move between those machines.)

Lean focuses on optimizing the end-to-end process as a whole. This enables a focus in the process on creating a finished product at the lowest cost (instead of lowering the cost of each step.) A common approach to achieving this is known as the workcell. Machines involved in building a product are placed next to each other to minimize transportation of both parts and people (an L-shaped desk with upper shelves is a good office example, which enables many office equipment to be within the reach of a worker). This will minimize waste in both transportation and in the storage of excess inventory.

At first glance, lean workcells may appear to be similar to traditional workcells, but they are inherently different. For instance, lean workcells must be designed for minimal wasted motion, which refers to any unnecessary time and effort required to assemble a product. Excessive twists or turns, uncomfortable reaches or pickups, and unnecessary walking all contribute to wasted motion and may put error inducing [[Muri (Japanese term)|stress]] upon the operator. Workcells can often be reconfigured easily to allow the adaptation of the process to fit [[takt time]]. This flexibility allows the work content to be adapted as demand or product mix changes.

Another Lean approach is to aim to have flexible manufacturing through small production lot sizes since this [[Mura (Japanese term)|smooths]] production. Small lot sizes usually increases transportation waste, but this can be eliminated if machines are back-to-back in a workcell.

==Implementation==

The implementation of workcells can reduce costs by an order of magnitude (90%){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}.

In [[software development]], the core of the workcell is the [[cross-functional team]]. This team differs from a more traditional waterfall team:
