      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15442">The '''2007 tuberculosis scare''' occurred when [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] [[personal injury lawyer|personal-injury lawyer]] '''Andrew "Drew" Speaker''' flew from Atlanta, Georgia to Paris, France and on to Greece and then Italy before returning on a flight from Prague, Czech Republic to Montreal, Canada, where he crossed over the border and back into the United States while infected with [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html Border security scrutinized after TB patient slips in] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308192527/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |date=2008-03-08 }}, CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Emily Brown and Jeff Bliss, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ajze0qn17uXM&amp;refer=home "Border Agents Failed to Stop Man With Tuberculosis" (Update4)].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] believed at the time that Speaker was suffering from [[extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (XDR-TB). The incident sparked a debate in [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the failure of [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|federal customs agents]] to stop him.&lt;ref name = Brown /&gt; Upon Speaker's return to the United States, the CDC placed him under involuntary isolation (similar to [[quarantine]]) using a provision of the [[Public Health Service Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/isolationquarantine.htm|title=Fact Sheet on Isolation and Quarantine|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Check the cite - Speaker is NOT under quarantine --&gt; With this action, Speaker became the first individual subjected to a CDC isolation order since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html|title=Odd twist in TB alert: Patient is TB researcher's son-in-law|publisher=CIDRAP|accessdate=2007-06-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070603154608/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html| archivedate= 3 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In January 2007, Speaker suffered a fall and went to the doctor, concerned that he had bruised a rib. Doctors X-rayed his chest and found an abnormality that required further testing.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/tb/ |accessdate=16 April 2016 |title=A Timeline of Andrew Speaker's Infection, June, 2007 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Speaker was suspected of having TB when a positive [[Mantoux test|PPD test]] came back on March 2, 2007. His third CT scan was done on March 3 and a bronchoscopy was done on March 8. After 18 days of incubation the isolate was sent to CDC for confirmation of his susceptibility results that were done by the Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR).

On March 28, 2007 his doctors and the health department believed the TB strain Speaker had was a resistant one and communicated this to the CDC. On May 1 the apparent MDR TB infection was discussed with the CDC lab by his doctors and they discussed discontinuing the treatment he was on at that time. On May 9 the suspicion of MDR TB was confirmed. A meeting was held with [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] Health Officials, his doctors, his fiancée and his father and father-in-law on May 10, 2007. At this time he was told that he was not contagious and not a threat to anyone but that he would need to go to Denver for treatment.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline/&gt; It would take a few weeks to arrange this. He was advised, or according to some accounts strongly recommended, not to travel.&lt;ref name=NPRTimeline/&gt;

==Travel sequence==
On May 12, 2007, Speaker [[transatlantic flight|flew from the U.S.]] to [[Paris]]. On May 14, he flew on to [[Athens]] and, two days later, flew to the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]] holiday island of [[Santorini]] for his wedding (Santorini's Mayor [[Angelos Roussos]] stated that Speaker lacked the necessary paperwork for the civil ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |title=CNN story on wedding |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212013325/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |archivedate = 2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Speaker then flew to [[Rome]] for his honeymoon.

Doctors say that only after Speaker left the United States did they realize he likely had [[extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|XDR-TB]]. Speaker says that he was informed of MDR TB before leaving the country, and that while officials preferred him not to fly, they said that he was not a threat and was not required to wear a mask.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthnewsdigest.com/news/Disease_420/Diagnosed_with_a_Rare_Form_of_Tuberculosis_-.shtml Andrew Speaker Says He's Being Unfairly Attacked] by Eve Conant, Newsweek, 2 Jun 2007.

July 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC informed him that there were no options for the CDC to get him home, and that he would have to arrange private transportation. Speaker instead flew by commercial jet to [[Prague]] and then on to [[Montréal]].&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, Alice.

Once in Montréal, Speaker rented a car and drove across the [[Canada–United States border]]. A Customs and Border Protection Officer failed to detain him at the frontier, disregarding a warning after he had passed Speaker's passport through the [[Treasury Enforcement Communications System]] (TECS)&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; to hold the traveler, wear a protective mask when dealing with him, and call health authorities because he "did not look sick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=71772 | publisher=Fox News | accessdate=2007-06-11 | title= Border agent fired after allowing TB patient into country}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight itinerary==
According to the CDC, Speaker flew on the following flights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/caseflighthistory.htm |title=Flight Itinerary of U.S. Traveler with Extensively Drug–Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR TB) (May 30, 2007) |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012223701/http://www.cdc.gov/tb/xdrtb/caseflighthistory.htm| archivedate= 12 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tuberculosis case notes==
{{wikinewspar2|US tuberculosis patient moved to Denver hospital|US places man with TB under quarantine, launches search for contactees}}
On May 31, 2007, Speaker was moved from [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] in [[Atlanta]] to the [[National Jewish Medical and Research Center]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], for further treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276613,00.html |title=Foxnews.com: TB Patient moved to Denver hospital, May 31, 2007 |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002135315/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C276613%2C00.html |archivedate=2 October 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Speaker's father-in-law, Robert C. Cooksey, works for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and is a [[Microbiology|microbiologist]] who has conducted research on [[tuberculosis]], according to his CDC biography posted on the agency's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |title=CNN web site: TB patient's name released; father-in-law works at CDC |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308192527/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |archivedate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearing a medical mask, Speaker was interviewed by [[Diane Sawyer]] on the June 1 edition of the American talk show ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on ABC and apologized to all passengers, explaining that he had not intended to endanger them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&amp;page=1 |title=ABCNews.com: TB Patient: "I Really Believed I Wasn't Putting People at Risk" June 1, 2007 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929161834/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&amp;page=1| archivedate= 29 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Speaker said that he had not been told that there was any risk of transmitting the disease to others, nor did the May 10 letter recommending against his travel state this, which Speaker in any case had not received before leaving May 14. His wife, with whom he lived for five months without precautions, remained uninfected.

==New diagnosis==
On July 4, 2007 the National Jewish Medical and Research Center announced, and the CDC confirmed, that Mr. Speaker's earlier diagnosis was incorrect and that he instead had [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB), a more treatable form of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2007-07-04 | title=Doctors: TB traveler's diagnosis more treatable than thought | date=2007-07-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070712192138/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html#cnnSTCVideo| archivedate= 12 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isolation and law==
Before a Congressional hearing, Speaker and his father played audio recordings from CDC and Fulton County health officials which say he was not a danger to others. He asked such questions on five recordings repeatedly and was given the same answers even after stating on two recordings that he was going out of the country and the CDC later admitted they were aware and waited until he had already left before taking further actions.

Speaker was in New York when the CDC served him with an isolation order but CDC director Julie Gerberding stated that the government was legally constrained prior to that order. The federal statute granting quarantine authority allows isolation or quarantine but only for individuals coming into the country from a foreign country or territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1181207137498 | publisher=Law.com | accessdate=2007-06-08 | title=The Legal Questions Behind the TB Case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia TB law may have required Speaker to be confined for two weeks and only allowed travel for medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html | publisher=Physorg.com | accessdate=2007-07-18 | title=TB patient travel may have been illegal| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070826171751/http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html| archivedate= 26 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A court confinement order can isolate a patient only after the infected patient ignores medical advice. This method can be overridden by a declaration of public health emergency by the governor of Georgia.

In 2007, seven Canadians and two Czechs sued Speaker in Montreal [[Quebec Superior Court|Superior Court]]; eight of the plaintiffs were on the same flight as Andrew Speaker and one was related to one of the passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/07/12/tb.suit/ Plane passengers sue TB patient], CNN (July 13, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''activation-synthesis hypothesis''', proposed by [[Harvard University]] [[psychiatrist]]s [[Allan Hobson|John Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]], is a [[neurobiological]] theory of [[dream]]s first published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]] in December 1977. The differences in neuronal activity of the [[brainstem]] during waking and [[REM sleep]] were observed, and the hypothesis proposes that dreams result from [[brain]] activation during REM sleep.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2716 |title=REM sleep and dreaming: Towards a theory of protoconsciousness |year=2010 |last1=Hobson |first1=J. Allan |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |pmid=19794431 |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=803–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the hypothesis has undergone an evolution as technology and experimental equipment has become more precise. Currently, a three-dimensional model called AIM Model, described below, is used to determine the different states of the brain over the course of the day and night. The AIM Model introduces a new hypothesis that [[primary consciousness]] is an important building block on which [[secondary consciousness]] is constructed.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

== Introduction ==

With the advancement of [[brain imaging]] technology, the sleep-waking cycle can be studied as never before. The brain can be objectively quantified and identified as being in either one of three states:  [[awake]], [[REM sleep]], and [[NREM sleep]] due to these advanced methods of measurement. It has been shown that global deactivation of the brain from waking state to NREM sleep occurs, and a subsequent reactivation during REM sleep, to a degree greater than during waking.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;  [[Consciousness]] and its substates, [[primary consciousness]] and [[secondary consciousness]], play a part in identifying the state of the brain. Primary consciousness is the simple awareness of [[perception]] and [[emotion]]; that is, the awareness of the world via advanced visual and [[motor coordination]] information your brain receives.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Secondary consciousness is an advanced state that includes both primary consciousness and abstract analysis, or thinking, and [[metacognitive]] components, or the awareness of being aware.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Most animals show some stages of primary consciousness, but only humans have been experimentally shown to experience secondary consciousness. The cycle of waking-NREM-REM sleep is essential to mental health of mammals. It has been shown through experimentation that animals subjected to inability to enter REM sleep show an immediate attempt to quickly enter REM stages and long-term effects on motor coordination and habitual motor habits, eventually leading to the death of the animal. It has also been shown that [[homeothermic]] animals might require sleep to maintain body weight and temperature.

== Background ==

=== Waking ===

The waking consciousness is the awareness of the world, our bodies, and ourselves.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This includes humans experiencing the awareness of being aware of ourselves, an intrinsic ability to humans.  It's the ability to look in a mirror and know that you are looking at yourself, and not just another human being. Being awake allows the distinction between tasks and default brain states, and also distinguishes between background and foreground processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1965.01720310073009 |title=Eye Movements During Fantasies: Imagining and Suppressing Fantasies |year=1965 |last1=Singer |first1=Jerome L. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=12 |pages=71–6 |pmid=14221693 |last2=Antrobus |first2=JS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being awake allows the person to not only be aware of themselves and the world, but also to have conscious motor coordination and understand the difference between need and want that comes from secondary consciousness.

== Difference between sleep and dream{{anchor|Difference between Sleep and Dream}} ==

There is a difference between being just asleep and in a state of mind called dreaming. Sleeping can be described as the lack of conscious awareness of the outside world, meaning large portions of the brain that receive and interpret signals are deactivated during this time, while dreaming is a specific state of sleep in which enhanced brain activity has been shown to occur,&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; theorizing the primary consciousness could be active during dreaming. Indeed, during dreams we are consciously aware of our surroundings, and assuredly have a certain perception and emotion throughout the course of the dream, suggesting that at least part of the primary consciousness is activated during the dream.

== Dream ==

A dream has all features of primary consciousness but is produced in the brain without external stimulation. Unlike the waking state, the brain cannot recognize its own condition; that it is in the midst of the dream and is not the same as the real world.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; The brain has a single-minded state of primary consciousness during dreaming, which allows the brain to reach greater perception and awareness of a single scenario out of images and dreams.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This is called the dream consciousness.

=== Four stages of sleep{{anchor|Four stages of Sleep}} ===

The four [[sleep]] stages have been identified as follows: sleep onset stage I, late-night stage II, and deep sleep stages III and IV. Deep sleep stages III and IV all occur during the first half of the night, while lighter stages I and II occur during the later half. During standard sleep laboratory measurements, the states of sleep and waking have [[behavioral]], polygraphic, and [[psychological]] manifestation within the [[pons|pontine]] brainstem. These states are regulated by a reciprocal relationship between two types of neuronal cells, aminergic inhibitory cells such as [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] and [[cholinergic]] excitatory cells such as [[acetylcholine]]. Changes in the sleep stages occur when the activity curves of these neurons cross. REM sleep stage I is a state of sleep just above and most closely linked to sleep onset stage I.

==== NREM ====

NREM sleep can be described as the stages of sleep that show greatly decreased brain activity. There are four different stages of NREM sleep. The brain shows dulled or limited senses of perception, though the thought process has been shown to be logical and perseverative.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Episodic movements of the body occur during these stages, though they are involuntary movements.

=== REM ===

REM sleep is an evolutionarily recent behavior of humans.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allison |first1=T. |last2=Van Twyer |first2=H. |year=1970 |title=The evolution of Sleep |journal=Natural History |volume=79 |pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; REM stands for rapid eye movement. It is the deepest sleep a mammal can go into.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt; It is regulated by the pontine brainstem. Infants spend most of their time in REM sleep, and rather than enter stage 1 sleep they go directly to REM sleep. Most REM sleep occurs just above stage I of sleep, and experiences different mental abilities than during NREM sleep. The thought process is non-logical and often bizarre, sensation and perception is vivid but created internally by the brain, and the body's movements are inhibited.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Most REM stages last 10–15 minutes, and the average human will go through 4–6 of these stages during sleep each night. Subsequent REM stages increase in duration, so the last REM stage before awakening is the longest and most vivid. During REM sleep the brain shows increased states of minimal inhibition, which degrades in our ability to recognize the state for which it is; a dream.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; It has been proposed that REM sleep is necessary for preparation of many integrative functions, of which one is consciousness.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; It supports the idea that sleep, and dreaming, is necessary preparation for the next day's processes. The scientific tracking of REM sleep stages can be measured by neuronal signals within the pontine brainstem. The interactions of aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons can be measured, and REM sleep occurs when aminergic cells are at their least active and cholinergic cells are at their most active.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Evolution of REM ====

It has been stated that REM sleep is a recent evolutionary behavior in homeothermic animals. In both, there is increased REM sleep in the early stages of life. In humans, REM sleep peaks during the third trimester of gestation, and quickly falls after birth as primary consciousness declines and secondary consciousness grows with the development of the brain.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; The developing control over stages of sleep and waking suggests that sleep and REM has developed as a way to self-activate in order to anticipate awake-state circumstances.

=== Neuronic modeling{{anchor|Neuronic Modeling}} ===

Within the [[pons]], the modeling and tracking of these aminergic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic excitatory neurons occurs via the study of [[PGO waves]].&lt;ref name="Gott"&gt;Gott, J.A., Liley, D.T.J., Hobson, J.A., 2017. [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00089/full Towards a Functional Understanding of PGO Waves]. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 11:89. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00089.&lt;/ref&gt;
 These are phasic waves that occur in cycles, and originate from the pontine brainstem (P), [[lateral geniculate]] of [[thalamus]] (G), and [[occipital cortex]] (O). Aminergic [[monoamines]] serotonin, [[noradrenaline]], [[histamine]], and [[dopamine]] are balanced between acetylcholine cholinergic signals, and play a part in the regulation of cognition. Aminergic cell signal strength is lowest during REM sleep, increases during NREM, and is highest at waking.  Cholinergic cell signal strength is highest during REM, declines during NREM, and is lowest at waking. Changes in sleep state and phase occur when two activity paths cross.

== Theory ==

The development of consciousness is a gradual, time-consuming and lifelong process that builds upon and uses a more primitive virtual reality generator that is more definable in our dreams.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; As such, the development of secondary consciousness during the lifetime requires a blank consciousness that during REM sleep creates an imaginary self that has movements and experiences emotions.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This is an experimental state not associated with awareness, and this state, or protoconscious, is able to be reached during childhood. This protoconsciousness is a protoself created early in life by the brain as a building block for consciousness to develop, and provides intrinsic predictions of external inputs created by dreaming.

=== Original activation-synthesis hypothesis model{{anchor|Original Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis Model}} ===

Hobson and McCarley originally proposed in the 1970s that the differences in the waking-NREM-REM sleep cycle was the result of interactions between aminergic REM-off cells and cholinergic REM-on cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1135627 |title=Neuronal excitability modulation over the sleep cycle: A structural and mathematical model |year=1975 |last1=McCarley |first1=R. |last2=Hobson |first2=J. |journal=Science |volume=189 |issue=4196 |pages=58–60 |pmid=1135627}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was perceived as the activation-synthesis model, stating that brain activation during REM sleep results in synthesis of dream creation.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Hobson's five cardinal characteristics include: intense emotions, illogical content, apparent sensory impressions, uncritical acceptance of dream events, and difficulty in being remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baruss |first=Imants |title=Alterations of Consciousness |year=2003 |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current model – AIM{{anchor|Current Model - AIM}} ===

Thanks to the development of technology since the original proposal, new experimental data has been collected and additional mechanistic details of neuronal control have been developed. It has been determined that consciousness states can be described with three values, and the AIM model is a model that uses these values for representing the similarities and differences between waking and dreaming. It is a three-dimensional [[state-space]] model that describes different states of the brain and their variance throughout the day and night. It is composed of three different values: A – activation, I – input-output gating, and M – modulation. The model is limited however, in that it cannot yet explain the regional differences in brain activity that distinguish REM sleep from waking. Other limitations include the inability to quantifiably identify and measure M in humans. During waking and activation of primary and secondary consciousnesses, high values of A, I, and M have been observed, but during REM sleep high values of A but low I and M have been observed.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Protoconsciousness ====

The protoconsciousness is template of consciousness that occurs during sleep, and on which can be constructed other mental conscious processes. Early in childhood, it has been said that this protoconsciousness is where secondary aspects of consciousness are originally developed and tested by the primary consciousness, and the person can slowly develop increased secondary consciousness throughout their life as their protoconscious template is further expanded, developed, and creates more vivid ideas and representations of secondary consciousness.

==== Activation (A) ====

Large parts of the brain that are activated and sending signals during waking are inactive during NREM sleep and become reactivated during REM sleep. It is based on the fact that the brain and its neural circuitry is plastic and self-regulating, especially in its own activation and inactivation. This was observed by two experiments: development of sleepiness after dopamine neuron destruction in [[substantia nigra]] in the [[midbrain]], and discovery of the [[reticular activating system]], which are visual cues received through our eyes and to our brain that begin the waking process, that waking consciousness depends sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=von Economo |first1=C. |year=1930 |title=Sleep as a problem of localization |journal=Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=249–59 |doi=10.1097/00005053-193003000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(49)90219-9 |title=Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG |year=1949 |last1=Moruzzi |first1=G. |last2=Magoun |first2=H.W. |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=1 |pages=455–73 |pmid=18421835 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these studies, it became clear that activity levels and quality of consciousness were functions of brain activation and deactivation.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt;

==== Input-output gating (I){{anchor|Input-Output Gating (I)}} ====

It has been shown that the internal activation of the brain is associated with the inhibition of both external sensory input and motor output.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; This implies that the brain is actively kept offline during REM, and the brainstem guarantees the coordination of factors I and A via the input-output gate control within the brainstem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pmid=4867152 |year=1967 |last1=Pompeiano |first1=O |chapter=The neurophysiological mechanisms of the postrual and motor events during desynchronized sleep |pages=351–423 |editor1-first=Seymour S |editor1-last=Kety |editor2-first=Edward V |editor2-last=Evarts |editor3-first=Harold L |editor3-last=Williams |title=Sleep and altered states of consciousness |location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams and Wilkins |oclc=152543313}}&lt;/ref&gt; PGO waves play a part in the ability of the brain to remain asleep while constituting the building blocks for perception and fine motor control via their phasic coordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00003976 |title=Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states |year=2000 |last1=Hobson |first1=J.

==== Modulation (M) ====

The neuromodulator release of aminergic neurons have a broad chemical influence on the brain; they instruct other neurons to keep or discard a record of information they've processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=J.R. |last2=Bloom |first2=F.E. |last3=Roth |first3=R.H. |year=1996 |title=The biochemical basis of Neuropharmacology |edition=7th |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press |location=Oxford}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanics of modulation are not known at this time, and modulation has yet to be quantitatively identified. Qualitatively, aminergic modulation has been shown to be strong during waking but lower during sleep, but more studies need to be conducted. Numerous studies have emerged from the discipline of [[computational neuroscience]] that support to the AIM model. The theory of [[Metalearning (neuroscience)|Metalearning]] in particular describes how these neuromodulators facilitate dynamic learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Implications ==

The three-dimensional AIM model shows that during the cycle of brain states waking-NREM-REM, the brain is dynamically changing constantly, and that this state space described by the AIM has an infinite number of subregions other than the main three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19750924 |year=2009 |last1=Voss |first1=U |last2=Holzmann |first2=R |last3=Tuin |first3=I |last4=Hobson |first4=JA |title=Lucid dreaming: A state of consciousness with features of both waking and non-lucid dreaming |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1191–200 |pmc=2737577 |journal=Sleep}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that via a protoconsciousness brain activation during sleep is necessary for the development and maintenance of waking consciousness and other higher-order brain functions such as problem solving. It suggests the possibility that the state of waking consciousness is only present in humans due to the evolution of extensive cortical structures within the brain.&lt;ref name=Hobson2009/&gt; Dreaming is a state of the brain that is similar to yet different from the waking consciousness, and interaction and correlation between the two is necessary for optimal performance from both. One study conducted measuring brain activity via [[EEG]] used Hobson's AIM model to show that quantitatively dream consciousness is remarkably similar to waking consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.001 |title=Dreaming and the brain: From phenomenology to neurophysiology |year=2010 |last1=Nir |first1=Yuval |last2=Tononi |first2=Giulio |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=88–100 |pmid=20079677 |pmc=2814941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{emotion}}
[[File:"Waiting On Shore" Rosses Point - geograph.org.uk - 242932.jpg|thumb| "Waiting On Shore" [[Rosses Point]], Sligo. The sculpture, by Niall Breton, reflects the anguish of seafaring people who watch for the safe return of loved ones.]]
'''Anguish''' is derived from the Latin word angustiae, meaning extreme pain, distress or anxiety. The feeling of suffering from anguish is typically preceded by a tragedy or event that has a profound meaning to the being in question. Anguish can be felt physically or mentally (often referred to as emotional distress). Anguish is also a term used in [[philosophy]], often as a translation from the Latin word for ''[[angst]]''. It is a paramount feature of [[existentialism | existentialist]] philosophy, in which anguish is often understood as the experience of an utterly free being in a world with zero absolutes (existential despair). In the theology of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], it refers to a being with total [[free will]] who is in a constant state of spiritual fear that his freedom will lead him to fall short of the standards that God has laid out for them.

==Affect Decisions==
A study done at the University of Princeton’s Center for the Study of Brain, Mind, and Behavior suggests that the presence of the emotion influences the decisions made. The study uses a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine to measure the brain waves of a subject when put into a difficult position. In this particular session, the subject was presented with a situation where she had to decide the fate of five people versus one person by the flip of a switch, and then decide the fate of five people versus one person by the physical acting of condemning a man to his death. The results of the fMRI stated that the decision of death by switch was easier than the decision of physically pushing a man to his death. It is theorized that the participant is being subjected to the emotion of anguish when faced with future possibility of physical condemning another person and therefore the brain enforces an “emotional block” to encourage the cessation of this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Breuer, H. (2004). Anguish and Ethics. Scientific American Special Edition, 14(1), 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental Health==
Anguish is made up of fear, distress, anxiety and panic. These stressors cause an enormous amount of dissonance, which could then lead to issues of mental health. While taken literally anguish may be defined as a physical event, but it may be extrapolated to an event of one’s psyche. It has been found that the anguish of a significant change in the way a young student lives (i.e. their new responsibilities, being on their own, multiple deadlines etc.) has contributed to significantly increased rates of college students suffering from anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;WILSON, R. (2015, September 4). An Epidemic of Anguish. Chronicle of Higher Education, pp. A38–A42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Music has a particular way of eliciting emotions into its listeners. The notes heard by one person may have a different connotation than another person hearing the same notes. Upon hearing a song, symphony, or sonnet filled with anguish, one might begin to reflect upon their own life and experiences that coincide with the notes, thereby bringing repressed memories beyond subconscious to our salient mind.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, D. J. (2005). Musical Understanding, Musical Works, and Emotional Expression: Implications for education. Educational Philosophy &amp; Theory, 37(1), 93–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
*“He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa. 'Oh, Jane! my hope - my love - my life!' broke in anguish from his lips.” -Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre
*“What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.” -Soren Kierkegaard
*“Pain, anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed.” - Alexandre Dumas, The Man in the Iron Mask


==Philosophy==
Kierkegaard views anguish as the same as suffering. Everyone wants to find the "truth" but it takes anguish and suffering to "appropriate" the truth. Kierkegaard put it this way in 1847 and 1850. {{Quotation|text=All the knowledge allied with inquisitiveness, thirst for knowledge, natural talent, the self-seeking passion, all the knowledge the natural man promptly understands to be worth learning is also basically and essentially easy to learn, and aptitude is involved here from first to last. Therefore people are willing enough to learn when it is a matter of ''learning more'', but when it is a matter of ''learning anew'' through sufferings, then learning becomes hard and heavy, then aptitude does not help, but on the other hand no one is excluded even though he is ever so lacking in aptitude. The lowliest, the simplest, the most forsaken human being, someone whom all teachers give up but heaven has by no means given up-he can learn obedience fully as well as anyone else. 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong translation, pp. 252–253}}{{Quotation|text=Is “truth” the sort of thing one might conceivably appropriate without more ado by means of another man? Without more ado-that is without being willing to be developed and tried, to fight and to suffer, just as he did who acquired the truth for himself? Is not that as impossible as to sleep or dream oneself into the truth. Is it not just as impossible to appropriate it thus without more ado however wide awake one might be? Or is one really wide awake, is not this a vain conceit, when one does not understand or will not understand that with respect to the truth there is no shortcut which dispenses with the necessity of acquiring it, and with that respect to acquire it from generation to generation there is no essential shortcut, so that every generation and every individual in the generation must essentially begin again from the start? 
|author=Søren Kierkegaard|title=''Training in Christianity'', 1850, pp. 181–182; Lowrie translation 1941, 2004}}

In the teachings of [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], anguish is seen when an utterly captured being realizes the unpredictability of his or her action. For example, when walking along a cliff, you would feel anguish to know that you have the freedom to throw yourself down to your imminent death.

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices).

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]].

Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!)

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the "Anti-Chancellor League," which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended.

It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Evolution of usage===
In 1879, [[Wilhelm Marr]] founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (Anti-Semitic League).&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, "Marr, Wilhelm (1819–1904)" in {{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=vol. 2, pp. 445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in Europe during the late 19th century. For example, [[Karl Lueger]], the popular mayor of [[fin de siècle]] [[Vienna]], skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Geehr. ''Karl Lueger, Mayor of Fin-de-Siècle Vienna'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8143-2055-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1910 obituary of Lueger, ''The New York Times'' notes that Lueger was "Chairman of the Christian Social Union of the Parliament and of the Anti-Semitic Union of the Diet of Lower Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/11/archives/dr-karl-lueger-dead-antisemitic-leader-and-mayor-of-vienna-was-66.html Dr. Karl Lueger Dead; Anti-Semitic Leader and Mayor of Vienna Was 66 Years Old.] ''The New York Times'', 11 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 [[A. C. Cuza]] organized the ''Alliance Anti-semitique Universelle'' in Bucharest. In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938.

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==

Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] names four categories: religious, racial, economic and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roots of hate: anti-semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |first=William |last=Brustein |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA46 |isbn=978-0-521-77478-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic]] historian [[Edward Flannery]] distinguished four varieties of antisemitism:&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |first1=Donald L. |last1=Niewyk|first2=Francis R. |last2=Nicosia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-6vKBHggVwC&amp;pg=PA215|isbn=978-0-231-11201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |pages=30–31 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30|isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious antisemitism===
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), accused of a relapse into Judaism, [[Mexico City]], 1601]]
[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

===Racial antisemitism===
{{Main|Racial antisemitism}}

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political antisemitism===

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

===New antisemitism===
[[Image:Protests Edinburgh 10 1 2009 5.JPG|right|thumb|A sign held at a protest in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] on January 10, 2009 ]]
{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43 {{ISBN|9652172057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin).

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) hundreds or even thousands of [[Rhineland massacres|Jews were killed as the crusaders arrived.]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chazan, ''In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews'' (1996) [https://www.questia.com/library/5684490/in-the-year-1096-the-first-crusade-and-the-jews online]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corliss K.

In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]], as well as [[Rintfleisch massacres|Rintfleisch knights]] in 1298. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all [[English people|English]] Jews; in 1394, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France;&lt;ref&gt;History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes. Originally written in Latin, the work was translated to French in six volumes by L. Bellaguet between 1839 and 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1421, the expulsion of thousands from Austria.

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed in numerous persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew."

The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner]. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1804, Jews were banned from their villages, and began to stream into the towns.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 358&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia]] in 1827 conscripted Jews under 18 years of age into the [[cantonist]] schools for a 25-year military service in order to promote baptism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Military_Service_in_Russia|title=Military Service in Russia|last=Petrovsky-Shtern|first=Yohanan|date=8 June 2017|website=YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M. Green|year=2003|title=Adolf Stoecker:Portrait of a Demagogue|journal=Politics and Policy|volume=31|doi=10.1111/j.1747-1346.2003.tb00889.x|issue=1|pages=106–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] essay ''[[On The Jewish Question]]'' as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883) |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |last=Jacobs |first=Jack |editor=Levy, Richard S. |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-439-4 |pages=446–447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999"&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s.

Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9] in: {{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes|author=Bernard Lazare|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=9781596056015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "[[usury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrucci|first=Filippo|last2=Fois|first2=Marisa|date=2016-03-03|title=Attitudes towards Israel in Tunisian political debate: from Bourguiba to the new constitution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=392–410|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]]. 

In modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Israeli|first=Raphael|title=Anti-Semitism under the Guise of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Israelism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315124933-6|work=Muslim Anti-Semitism in Christian Europe|pages=149–189|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315124933|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well.

Although [[Malaysia]] presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called "antisemitism without Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Jonathan|title=Klezmer America : Jewishness, ethnicity, modernity|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14278-6|page=140|edition=1st}} Hyphenation added by Fulford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fulford|first1=Robert|title=Anti-Semitism without Jews in Malaysia|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/06/robert-fulford-anti-semitism-without-jews-in-malaysia|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country."

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Nieuwe CIDI Monitor antisemitisme" (Dutch)|url=http://www.niw.nl/nieuwe-cidi-monitor-antisemitisme/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]] was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

"We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece Hets av jøder er økende i Europa – Aftenposten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411225535/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece |date=11 April 2012 }}.

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L. Daniel Staetsky |publisher=Institute for Jewish Policy Research |date=September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A. Small|Charles Small]] of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study antisemitism] Associated Press, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America].

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]].

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016.

'''Appropriation''' in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009. pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the [[history of the arts]] ([[literature|literary]], [[visual arts|visual]], [[music]]al and performing arts). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp]].

Inherent in our understanding of appropriation is the concept that the new work '''recontextualizes''' whatever it borrows to create the new work. In most cases the original 'thing' remains accessible as the original, without change.

==Definition==
Appropriation has been defined as "the taking over, into a work of art, of a real object or even an existing work of art."&lt;ref name="Tate Terms"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Wilson |first1=Simon |last2=Lack |first2=Jessica |title=The Tate Guide to Modern Art Terms |url= |place=London |publisher=[[Tate Publishing Ltd]] |pages=20–21 |year=2008|isbn=978-1-85437-750-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tate Gallery]] traces the practise back to [[Cubism]] and [[Dadaism]], but continuing into 1940s [[Surrealism]] and 1950s [[Pop art]]. It returned to prominence in the 1980s with the [[Neo-minimalism|Neo-Geo]] artists.&lt;ref name="Tate Terms" /&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}
In the early twentieth century [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] appropriated objects from a non-art context into their work.  In 1912, Picasso pasted a piece of oil cloth onto the canvas. Subsequent compositions, such as  ''Guitar, Newspaper, Glass and Bottle'' (1913) in which Picasso used newspaper clippings to create forms, became categorized as ''synthetic [[cubism]]''.  The two artists incorporated aspects of the "real world" into their canvases, opening up discussion of signification and [[representation (arts)|artistic representation]].

[[Marcel Duchamp]] is credited with introducing the concept of the '''ready-made''', in which "industrially produced utilitarian objects...achieve the status of art merely through the process of selection and presentation."&lt;ref&gt;Elger, D. (2006). Dadaism. Koln: Taschen, pp. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Duchamp explored this notion as early as 1913 when he mounted a stool with a bicycle wheel and again in 1915 when he purchased a snow shovel and humorously inscribed it  “in advance of the broken arm, Marcel Duchamp.”&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D (ed.).(2009). ''Appropriation: Documents of contemporary art''. London and Cambridge: Whitechapel Gallery and the MIT Press, pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, Duchamp formally submitted a [[readymade]] into the [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibition under the pseudonym, R. Mutt.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne, P., and Snowdon, P. (1997). Duchamp &amp; Co. Paris: Terrail, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', it consisted of a porcelain urinal that was propped atop a pedestal and signed "R. Mutt 1917".  The work posed a direct challenge to traditional perceptions of fine art, ownership, originality and plagiarism, and was subsequently rejected by the exhibition committee.&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"&gt;Plant, S. (1992). [https://monoskop.org/images/2/24/Plant_Sadie_The_Most_Radical_Gesture_The_Situationist_International_in_a_Postmodern_Age.pdf The most radical gesture: The Situationist International in a postmodern age]. London and New York: Routledge, pp.44&lt;/ref&gt;  Duchamp publicly defended ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', claiming "whether Mr.Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance.  He CHOSE it.  He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view—and created a new thought for that object."&lt;ref name="Plant, S. 1992 pp.44"/&gt;

The [[Dada]] movement (including Duchamp as an associate) continued with the appropriation of everyday objects. Dada works featured deliberate irrationality and the rejection of the prevailing standards of art. [[Kurt Schwitters]], who produced art at the same time as the Dadaists, shows a similar sense of the bizarre in his "merz" works. He constructed these from found objects,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and they took the form of large constructions that later generations would call [[installation art|installation]]s.

The [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], coming after the Dada movement, also incorporated the use of '[[found objects]]' such as [[Méret Oppenheim]]'s ''Object (Luncheon in Fur)'' (1936).  These objects took on new meaning when combined with other unlikely and unsettling objects.

In 1938 Joseph Cornell produced what might be considered the first work of film appropriation{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} in his randomly cut and reconstructed film ''Rose Hobart''.

In the 1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] used what he dubbed "combines", literally combining readymade objects such as tires or beds, painting, [[Screen-printing|silk-screens]], collage, and photography.  Similarly, [[Jasper Johns]], working at the same time as Rauschenberg, incorporated found objects into his work.

The [[Fluxus]] art movement also utilised appropriation:{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} its members blended different artistic disciplines including visual art, music, and literature. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s they staged "action" events and produced sculptural works featuring unconventional materials.

Along with artists such as [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Andy Warhol]] appropriated images{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} from commercial art and popular culture as well as the techniques of these industries. Often called "[[pop art]]ists", they saw mass popular culture as the main vernacular culture, shared by all irrespective of education. These artists fully engaged with the ephemera produced from this mass-produced culture, embracing expendability and distancing themselves from the evidence of an artist's hand.

In 1958 Bruce Conner produced the influential ''A Movie'' in which he recombined existing film clips.  In 1958 Raphael Montanez Ortiz produced ''Cowboy and Indian Film'', a seminal appropriation film work.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the late 1970s [[Dara Birnbaum]] was working with appropriation to produce [[feminist art|feminist works of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Welchman|first1=John|title=Art After Appropriation: Essays on Art in the 1990s|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-80136-5|pages=33, 190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udVhfuujhF0C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20appropriation&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978-79 she produced one of the first video appropriations. ''[[Technology/Transformation: Wonder Woman]]'' utilised video clips from the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meigh-Andrews|first1=Chris|title=A History of Video Art|date=2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-0-85785-188-8|page=194|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQq5AQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=%22dara%20birnbaum%22%20technology%20transformation&amp;pg=PA194#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''appropriation art''''' was in common  use in the 1980s with artists such as [[Sherrie Levine]], who addressed the act of appropriating itself as a theme in art.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  Levine often quotes entire works in her own work, for example photographing photographs of [[Walker Evans]]. Challenging ideas of originality, drawing attention to relations between [[power (sociology)|power]], [[gender]] and [[creativity]], [[consumerism]] and commodity value, the social sources and uses of art, Levine plays with the theme of "almost same". [[Elaine Sturtevant]] (also known simply as Sturtevant), on the other hand, painted and exhibited perfect replicas of famous works. She replicated Andy Warhol's ''Flowers'' in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. She trained to reproduce the artist's own technique—to the extent that when Warhol was repeatedly questioned on his technique, he once answered "I don't know. Ask Elaine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans Ulrich Obrist|title=Elaine Sturtevant obituary|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/19/elaine-sturtevant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s [[Richard Prince]] re-photographed advertisements such as for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarette]]s or [[photo journalism|photo-journalism]] shots.  His work takes anonymous and ubiquitous cigarette billboard advertising campaigns, elevates the status and focusses our gaze on the images.

Appropriation artists comment on all aspects of culture and society. [[Joseph Kosuth]] appropriated images to engage with [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology|epistemological theory]]. Other artists working with appropriation during this time with included [[Jeff Koons]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Greg Colson]], and [[Malcolm Morley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In the 1990s artists continued to produce appropriation art, using it as a medium to address theories and social issues, rather than focussing on the works themselves. [[Damian Loeb]] used film and cinema to comment on themes of [[simulacrum]] and reality. Other high-profile artists working at this time included [[Christian Marclay]], [[Deborah Kass]], [[Damien Hirst]]{{dubious|date=October 2013}} and [[Genco Gulan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://visualartbeat.com/self-portrait-by-genco-gulan/ | work=Visual Art Beat | first=Marcus | last=Graf | title=Self Portrait? by Genco Gülan | date=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the digital age ==
Since the 1990s, the exploitation of historical precursors is as multifarious as the concept of appropriation is unclear. A hitherto unparalleled quantity of appropriations pervades not only the field of the visual arts, but of all cultural areas. The new generation of appropriators considers themselves "archeolog[es] of the present time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Paolo Bianchi, quoted by Hedinger J.; Meyer, T.|title=Introduction to Whats next|url=http://whtsnxt.net/000|date=2011|publisher=Kadmos|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speak of "postproduction", which is based on pre-existing works, to re-edit "the screenplay of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourriaud|first1=Nicolas|title=Postproduction. Culture as screenplay. How art reprograms the world|date=2002|publisher=Lucas &amp; Sternberg|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation of works made by others or of available cultural products mostly follows the concept of use. So-called "prosumers"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Toffler|first1=Alvin|title=The third wave. The classic study of tomorrow|date=1980|publisher=Bantam|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;—those consuming and producing at the same time—browse through the ubiquitous archive of the digital world (more seldom through the analog one), in order to sample the ever accessible images, words, and sounds via 'copy-paste' or 'drag-drop' to 'bootleg', 'mashup' or 'remix' them just as one likes. Appropriations have today become an everyday phenomenon.

The new "generation remix"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Djordjevic, V. |editor2=Dobusch, L. |title=Generation Remix|date=2014|publisher=iRights Media|url=http://irights-media.de/webbooks/generationremix/}}&lt;/ref&gt;—who have taken the stages not only of the visual arts, but also of music, literature, dance and film—causes, of course, highly controversial debates. Media scholars [[Lawrence Lessig]] coined in the begin of the 2000s here the term of the [[remix culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2009/05/download-lessigs-remix-then-remix-it/ Download Lessig's Remix, Then Remix It] on [[wired.com]] (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand are the celebrators who foresee a new age of innovative, useful, and entertaining ways for art of the digitized and globalized 21st century. The new appropriationists will not only realize Joseph Beuys' dictum that everyone is an artist but also "build free societies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardy|first1=S.|title=Rip!: A Remix Manifesto|url=http://creativegeneralist.com/2009/03/rip-a-remix-manifesto/|website=Creative Generalist|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By liberating art finally from traditional concepts such as aura, originality, and genius, they will lead to new terms of understanding and defining art. More critical observers see this as the starting point of a huge problem. If creation is based on nothing more than carefree processes of finding, copying, recombining and manipulating pre-existing media, concepts, forms, names, etc. of any source, the understanding of art will shift in their sight to a trivialized, low-demanding, and regressive activity. In view of the limitation of art to references to pre-existing concepts and forms, they foresee endless recompiled and repurposed products. Skeptics call this a culture of recycling with an addiction to the past&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=Retro Mania Pop Culture’s Addiction To Its Own Past|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|location=London:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4-dcDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that only lazy people who have nothing to say let themselves be inspired by the past in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Albini, Steve, quoted by Benjamin Franzen; Kembrew McLeod|title=Copyright Criminals|date=2009|publisher=documentary film}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others fear, that this new trend of appropriation is caused by nothing more than the wish of embellishing oneself with an attractive genealogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=cf. Diedrichsen|first1=Diedrich|title=Showfreaks und Monster|journal=Texte zur Kunst. Artists' Artists|date=September 2008|volume=No. 71|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''appropriationism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aden|first1=Maike|title=Let's dance like we used to....

Appropriationism is discussed—in comparison of appropriation forms and concepts of the 20th century which offer new representations of established knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aden|first1=Maike|title=Ulises Carrión Carries On!|journal=Journal of Artists' Books (JAB)|date=Summer 2016|volume=No. 40, in prep.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—as a kind of "racing standstill",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=cf. Virilio|first1=Paul|title=Rasender Stillstand|date=1992|publisher=Hanser|location=München}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the acceleration of random, uncontrollable operations in highly mobilised, fluid Western societies that are governed more and more by abstract forms of control. Unlimited access to the digital archive of creations and easily feasible digital technologies, as well as the priority of fresh ideas and creative processes over a perfect masterpiece leads to a hyperactive hustle and bustle around the past instead of launching new expeditions into unexplored territory that could give visibility to the forgotten ghosts and ignored phantoms of our common myths and ideologies.

== Appropriation art and copyright ==
Appropriation art has resulted in contentious [[copyright]] issues regarding its validity under copyright law.  The U.S. has been particularly litigious in this respect. A number of [[case law|case-law]] examples have emerged that investigate the division between transformative works and [[derivative work]]s.

[[Andy Warhol]] faced a series of lawsuits from photographers whose work he appropriated and [[Screen-printing|silk-screened]]. Patricia Caulfield, one such photographer, had taken a picture of flowers for a photography demonstration for a photography magazine. Without her permission, Warhol covered the walls of [[Leo Castelli]]'s New York gallery with his silk-screened reproductions of Caulfield's photograph in 1964. After seeing a poster of Warhol's unauthorized reproductions in a bookstore, Caulfield sued Warhol for violating her rights as the copyright owner, and Warhol made a cash settlement out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/andy_warhol_flowers.html|title=Andy Warhol's Flower Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Warhol's famous ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' are generally held to be non-infringing of the soup maker's [[trademark]], despite being clearly appropriated, because "the public was unlikely to see the painting as sponsored by the soup company or representing a competing product. Paintings and soup cans are not in themselves competing products", according to expert trademark lawyer [[Jerome Gilson]].&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;as quoted in Grant,Daniel, ''The Business of Being an Artist'' (New York: Allworth Press, 1996), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Koons]] has also confronted issues of copyright due to his appropriation work (see ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]''). Photographer Art Rogers brought suit against Koons for [[copyright infringement]] in 1989.  Koons' work, ''String of Puppies'' sculpturally reproduced Rogers' black-and-white photograph that had appeared on an airport greeting card that Koons had bought. Though he claimed [[fair use]] and [[parody]] in his defense, Koons lost the case, partially due to the tremendous success he had as an artist and the manner in which he was portrayed in the media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  The parody argument also failed, as the appeals court drew a distinction between creating a parody of modern society in general and a parody directed at a specific work, finding parody of a specific work, especially of a very obscure one, too weak to justify the fair use of the original.

In October 2006, Koons successfully defended a different work by claiming "[[fair use]]". For a seven-painting commission for the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin, Koons drew on part of a photograph taken by [[Andrea Blanch]] titled ''Silk Sandals by Gucci'' and published in the August 2000 issue of ''Allure'' magazine to illustrate an article on metallic makeup. Koons took the image of the legs and diamond sandals from that photo (omitting other background details) and used it in his painting ''Niagara'', which also includes three other pairs of women's legs dangling surreally over a landscape of pies and cakes.

In his decision, [[Judge Louis L. Stanton]] of U.S. District Court found that ''Niagara'' was indeed a "transformative use" of Blanch's photograph. "The painting's use does not 'supersede' or duplicate the objective of the original", the judge wrote, "but uses it as raw material in a novel way to create new information, new aesthetics and new insights. Such use, whether successful or not artistically, is transformative."

The detail of Blanch's photograph used by Koons is only marginally copyrightable. Blanch has no rights to the Gucci sandals, "perhaps the most striking element of the photograph", the judge wrote. And without the sandals, only a representation of a woman's legs remains—and this was seen as  "not sufficiently original to deserve much copyright protection."
 
In 2000, [[Damien Hirst]]'s sculpture ''Hymn'' (which [[Charles Saatchi]] had bought for a reported £1m) was exhibited in ''Ant Noises'' in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over this sculpture. The subject was a 'Young Scientist Anatomy Set' belonging to his son Connor, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull (Emms) Toy Manufacturer.  Hirst  created a 20-foot, six-ton enlargement of the Science Set figure, radically changing the perception of the object. Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, [[Children Nationwide]] and the [[Toy Trust]] in an out-of-court settlement. The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first.

Appropriating a familiar object to make an art work can prevent the artist claiming copyright ownership. [[Jeff Koons]] threatened to sue a gallery under copyright, claiming that the gallery infringed his proprietary rights by selling bookends in the shape of balloon dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/02/04/DDRN1HIDPL.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Sam | last=Whiting | title=Jeff Koons' balloon-dog claim ends with a whimper | date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koons abandoned that claim after the gallery filed a complaint for declaratory relief stating, "As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/36786/6-hilarious-zingers-from-the-balloon-dog-freedom-suit-filed-against-jeff-koons |title=6 Hilarious Zingers From the Balloon-Dog Freedom Suit Filed Against Jeff Koons |date= January 21, 2011 |website=BlouinArtinfo |last=ALLEN |first=EMMA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, photojournalist Patrick Cariou sued artist [[Richard Prince]], [[Gagosian Gallery]] and [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli books]] for copyright infringement. Prince had appropriated 40 of Cariou's photos of [[Rastafari]] from a book, creating a series of paintings known as ''Canal Zone''. Prince variously altered the photos, painting objects, oversized hands, naked women and male torsos over the photographs, subsequently selling over $10 million worth of the works. In March 2011, a judge ruled in favor of Cariou, but Prince and Gargosian appealed on a number of points.  Three judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the right to an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Rachel; [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/corbett/prince-wins-right-to-appeal-in-cariou-v-prince.asp "A Win for Richard Prince in Copyright Case"], ''Artnet Magazine'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Prince's attorney argued that "Appropriation art is a well-recognized modern and postmodern art form that has challenged the way people think about art, challenged the way people think about objects, images, sounds, culture"&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Barbara, [http://www.artnews.com/2012/03/22/copy-rights/ "Copy Rights"], ARTnews LLC, March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24, 2013, the appeals court largely overturned the original decision, deciding that many of the paintings had sufficiently transformed the original images and were therefore a permitted use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/arts/design/appeals-court-ruling-favors-richard-prince-in-copyright-case.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=0|title=Court Rules in Artist's Favor|author=RANDY KENNEDY|date=April 25, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See '''[[Cariou v.

Retrieved on January 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kembrew McLeod]], author of several books on sampling and appropriation, said in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] that Scott Blake's art should fall under the doctrine of [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;Dayal, Geeta. [https://www.wired.com/2012/07/artist-who-builds-chuck-close-filter-gets-slammed-by-chuck-close/ "How the Artist Who Built the 'Chuck Close Filter' Got Slammed by Chuck Close"], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', July 10, 2012. Retrieved on January 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit questioned the Second Circuit's interpretation of the fair use doctrine in the ''Cariou'' case. Of particular note, the Seventh Circuit noted that "transformative use" is not one of the four enumerated fair use factors but is, rather, simply part of the first fair use factor which looks to the "purpose and character" of the use. The Seventh Circuit's critique lends credence to the argument that there is a split among U.S. courts as to what role "transformativeness" is to play in any fair use inquiry.&lt;ref name="proskauer.com"/&gt;

In 2013, Andrew Gilden and Timothy Greene published a law review article in The ''University of Chicago Law Review'' dissecting the factual similarities and legal differences between the ''Cariou'' case and the ''[http://www.ipinbrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/salinger-opinion.pdf Salinger v. Colting]'' case, articulating concerns that judges may be creating a fair use "privilege largely reserved for the rich and famous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fair Use for the Rich and Fabulous? {{!}} The University of Chicago Law Review {{!}} The University of Chicago|url = https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/fair-use-rich-and-fabulous|website = lawreview.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barnes–Hut simulation''' (Josh Barnes and [[Piet Hut]]) is an [[approximation algorithm]] for performing an [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]]. It is notable for having [[Big O notation|order]] O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Susanne Pfalzner ; Paul|title=Many-body tree methods in physics|date=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ.

The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an [[octree]] (in a three-dimensional space), so that only [[Point particle|particles]] from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's [[center of mass]] (or as a low-order [[multipole expansion]]). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed.

Some of the most demanding [[high-performance computing]] projects do [[computational astrophysics]] using the Barnes–Hut treecode algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==

=== The Barnes–Hut tree ===
In a three-dimensional [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]], the Barnes–Hut algorithm [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] divides the ''n'' bodies into groups by storing them in an [[octree]] (or a [[quadtree|quad-tree]] in a 2D simulation). Each [[Node (graph theory)|node]] in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|octants]] of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into octants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their octants). 
There are two types of nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the [[center of mass]] and the total mass of all its children bodies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Calculating the force acting on a body ===
To calculate the [[net force]] on a particular body, the nodes of the tree are traversed, starting from the root. If the center of mass of an internal node is sufficiently far from the body, the bodies contained in that part of the tree are treated as a single particle whose position and mass is respectively the center of mass and total mass of the internal node. If the internal node is sufficiently close to the body, the process is repeated for each of its children.

Whether a node is or isn't sufficiently far away from a body, depends on the quotient &lt;math&gt;s/d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and ''d'' is the distance between the body and the node’s center of mass. The node is sufficiently far away when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value ''θ''. The parameter ''θ'' determines the accuracy of the simulation; larger values of ''θ'' increase the speed of the simulation but decreases its accuracy. If ''θ'' = 0, no internal node is treated as a single body and the algorithm degenerates to a direct-sum algorithm.

:''For the origin of life, see [[Abiogenesis]].''
'''Biogenesis''' is the production of new living [[organism]]s or [[organelle]]s. Conceptually, biogenesis is primarily attributed to [[Louis Pasteur]] and encompasses the belief that complex [[life|living things]] come only from other living things, by means of [[reproduction]]. That is, life does not spontaneously arise from non-living material, which was the position held by [[spontaneous generation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cphl/history/articles/pasteur.htm Pasteur's Papers on the Germ Theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Pasteur#External links|Louis Pasteur: External links]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for ''"all life [is] from life."'' A related statement is ''Omnis cellula e cellula'', "all cells [are] from cells;" this conclusion is one of the central statements of [[cell theory]].

== Biogenesis and abiogenesis ==
The term biogenesis was coined by [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] to mean the generation of a life form  from nonliving materials, however, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] chose the term [[abiogenesis]] and redefined biogenesis for life arising from preexisting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Strick |first= James |title= Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate= August 28, 2012 |date= April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv|chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of life from non-living material is called [[abiogenesis]], and occurred through stepwise chemical and [[molecular evolution]] over millions of years.&lt;ref name="PNAS-20120110"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spiegel |first=David S. |last2=Turner |first2=Edwin L. |title=Bayesian analysis of the astrobiological implications of life’s early emergence on Earth |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/2/395.full.pdf+html |date=January 10, 2012 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=109 |number=2 |pages=395–400 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1111694108 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |arxiv = 1107.3835 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..109..395S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9868373"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Orgel LE| title=The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations. | journal=Trends Biochem Sci | year= 1998 | volume= 23 | issue= 12 | pages= 491–5 | pmid=9868373 | doi= 10.1016/s0968-0004(98)01300-0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9868373 | quote=Life, therefore, originated on or was transported to the earth at some point within a window of a few hundred million years that opened about four billion years ago.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH-20060612"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=June 12, 2006 |issue= |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17 |pmc=1526419 |pmid=16768805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20110114"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vieru |first=Tudor |title=Life Is 10 Billion Years Old |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Life-Is-10-Billion-Years-Old-178156.shtml |date=January 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSR-201010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=Paul S. |title=Panspermia, Past and Present: Astrophysical and Biophysical Conditions for the Dissemination of Life in Space |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11214-010-9671-x |date=October 2010 |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=156 |issue=1-4 |pages=239–252 |doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9671-x |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |arxiv = 1011.0101 |bibcode = 2010SSRv..156..239W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biogenesis'' may also refer to biochemical processes of production in living organisms (see [[biosynthesis]]).

==Spontaneous generation and its disproof==
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
The Ancient Greeks believed that living things could spontaneously come into being from nonliving matter, and that the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] could make life arise spontaneously from stones – a process known as ''Generatio spontanea''. [[Aristotle]] disagreed, but he still believed that creatures could arise from dissimilar organisms or from soil. Variations of this concept of spontaneous generation still existed as late as the 17th century, but towards the end of the 17th century, a series of observations and arguments began that eventually discredited such ideas. This advance in scientific understanding was met with much opposition, with personal beliefs and individual prejudices often obscuring the facts.

[[William Harvey]] (1578–1657) was an early proponent of all life beginning from an egg, ''omne vivum ex ovo''.
[[Francesco Redi]], an Italian physician, proved as early as 1668 that higher forms of life did not originate spontaneously by demonstrating that [[maggot]]s come from eggs of [[fly|flies]].&lt;ref name=lev&gt;{{cite web|author= Levine R, Evers C|title= The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859)|url= http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080426191204/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2008-04-26|accessdate= 2013-04-18|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But proponents of spontaneous generation claimed that this did not apply to microbes and continued to hold that these could arise spontaneously.  Attempts to disprove the spontaneous generation of life from non-life continued in the early 19th century with observations and experiments by [[Franz Schulze]] and [[Theodor Schwann]].&lt;ref name="Jgerm"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juuXAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 | title=Germ Theory | publisher=Twenty-First Century Books | author=Herbst, Judith | year=2013 | pages=18–20 | isbn=1467703710}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1745, [[John Needham]] added chicken broth to a flask and boiled it. He then let it cool and waited. Microbes grew, and he proposed it as an example of spontaneous generation. In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] repeated Needham's experiment but removed all the air from the flask. No growth occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentsguide.in/microbiology/microbiology/controversy-over-spontaneous-generation.html The controversy over spontaneous generation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, [[Heinrich G. F. Schröder]] (1810–1885) and [[Theodor von Dusch]], and in 1859, Schröder  alone, repeated the [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] filtration experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1864, [[Louis Pasteur]] finally announced the results of his scientific experiments. In a series of experiments similar to those performed earlier by Needham and Spallanzani, Pasteur demonstrated that life does not arise in areas that have not been contaminated by existing life. Pasteur's empirical results were summarized in the phrase ''Omne vivum ex vivo'', Latin for "all life [is] from life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=27 The microbial world: a look at things small]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE8/B-Ab.html Biogenesis and Abiogenesis: Critiques and Addresses]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis.gif|Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis]]

After obtaining his results, Pasteur stated: "''La génération spontanée est une chimère''" ("Spontaneous generation is a dream").

'''''Categories for the Working Mathematician''''' ('''''CWM''''') is a textbook in [[category theory]] written by American [[mathematician]] [[Saunders Mac Lane]], who cofounded the subject together with [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It was first published in 1971, and is based on his lectures on the subject given at the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Australian National University]], [[Bowdoin College]], and [[Tulane University]]. It is widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leinster |first1=Tom |title=Category Theory for the Sciences |year=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=174}} "The towering presence among category theory books is the classic one by one of its founders: [[Saunders Mac Lane]]'s Categories for the Working Mathematician"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Awodey |first1=Steve |title=Category Theory |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=iv}} "Why write a new textbook on Category Theory, when we already have Mac Lane’s Categories for the Working Mathematician? Simply put, because Mac Lane’s book is for the working (and aspiring) mathematician. What is needed now, after 30 years of spreading into various other disciplines and places in the curriculum, is a book for everyone else." Awodey also dedicated the book to Saunders Mac Lane.&lt;/ref&gt; as the premier introduction to the subject.

== Contents ==

The book has twelve chapters, which are:

:Chapter I. [[Category (mathematics)|Categories]], [[Functor]]s, and [[natural transformation|Natural Transformation]]s.
:Chapter II. Constructions on Categories.
:Chapter III. Universals and [[Limit (category theory)|Limit]]s.
:Chapter IV. [[Adjoint functors|Adjoints]].
:Chapter V. [[Limit (category theory)|Limits]].
:Chapter VI. [[Monad (category theory)|Monad]]s and Algebras.
:Chapter VII. [[Monoidal category|Monoid]]s.
:Chapter VIII. [[Abelian category|Abelian Categories]].
:Chapter IX. Special Limits.
:Chapter X. [[Kan extension|Kan Extension]]s.
:Chapter XI. Symmetry and [[Braided monoidal category|Braiding in Monoidal Categories]]
:Chapter XII. Structures in Categories.

Chapters XI and XII were added in the 1998 second edition, the first in view of its importance in [[string theory]] and [[quantum field theory]], and the second to address higher-dimensional categories that have come into prominence.&lt;ref&gt;From the preface to the second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is the classic reference for [[category theory]], some of the terminology is not standard. In particular, Mac Lane attempted to settle an ambiguity in usage for the terms [[epimorphism]] and [[monomorphism]] by introducing the terms ''epic'' and ''monic,'' but the distinction is not in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bergman |first1=George |title=An Invitation to General Algebra and Universal Constructions |year=1998 |publisher=Henry Helson |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legal status}}
'''Citizenship''' is the status of a person recognized under the [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[law]] as being a legal member of a [[sovereign state]] or belonging to a [[nation]].

A person may have [[multiple citizenship]]s. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]], while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.&lt;ref&gt;Coplan, David. "Introduction: From empiricism to theory in African border studies." Journal of Borderlands Studies 25.2 (2010): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nationality]] is often used as a synonym for citizenship in English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – although the term is sometimes understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]] (a large [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff &amp; Noordhoff |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&amp;pg=PA3 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g. the [[Citizenship of the United States#Citizenship vs. nationality|United States]], [[British nationality law#Classes of British nationality|the United Kingdom]], nationality and citizenship can have different meanings (for more information, see [[Nationality#Nationality versus citizenship|Nationality versus citizenship]]).

{{further information|Nationality law}}
Each country has its own policies, regulations and criteria as to who is entitled to its citizenship. A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but in other cases an application may be required.

* Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I 8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization8 USC Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in Europe. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. States normally{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state, although some do not.{{clarify|date=October 2013}} This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.
* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]] where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries.
** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).
* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops UK government Web site: Bishops act to tackle sham marriages - New UK Border Agency approved guidance for clergy should help prevent weddings for visas, 11 April 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.
* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.

{{Main article|History of citizenship}}

===Polis===
{{Main article|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.&lt;ref name="tws2Y17"/&gt; The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12&gt;{{Cite book

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (πολίτης ''politēs'' &lt; πόλις 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of Egypt or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which Aristotle famously expressed: "To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entire empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Civis romanus sum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn =1-4025-8360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; If Greek citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things",{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1998{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} The law itself was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During the European [[Middle Ages]], citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns, and applied mainly to middle class folk. Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.

During this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.

===Renaissance===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Subject}}
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

====United States====
[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dred Scott, plaintiff in the infamous ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case at the Supreme Court of the United States, commissioned by a "group of Negro citizens" and presented to the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, in 1888]]
From 1790 until the mid-twentieth century, United States law used racial criteria to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible to become a naturalized citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/04/news/mn-9708|title=A History of U.S. Citizenship|last=|first=|date=July 4, 1997|website=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naturalization Act of 1790|The Naturalization Act of 1790]], the first law in U.S. history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all people who were not of European descent, stating that "any alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Library of Congress|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under early U.S. laws, African Americans were not eligible for citizenship. In 1857, these laws were upheld in the US Supreme Court case [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]], which ruled that "a free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States," and that "the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393#writing-USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZO|title=Scott v. Sandford|last=|first=|date=1857|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the abolition of slavery following the [[American Civil War]] that African Americans were granted citizenship rights. [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], ratified on July 9, 1868, stated that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendment XIV|last=|first=|date=1868|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] would extend the right to become a naturalized citizen to include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870|title=Naturalization Act of 1870|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikisource|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the gains made by African Americans after the Civil War, Native Americans, Asians, and others not considered "free white persons" were still denied the ability to become citizens. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] explicitly denied naturalization rights to all people of Chinese origin, while subsequent acts passed by the US Congress, such as laws in [[Naturalization Act of 1906|1906]], [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]], and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], would include clauses that denied immigration and naturalization rights to people based on broadly defined racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1917_immigration_act.html|title=1917 Immigration Act|last=|first=|date=|website=US Immigration Legislation Online|publisher=University of Washington-Bothell Library|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court cases such as [[Ozawa v. United States]] (1922) and [[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind|U.S. v. Bhagat Singh Thind]] (1923), would later clarify the meaning of the phrase "free white persons," ruling that ethnically Japanese, Indian, and other non-European people were not "white persons", and were therefore ineligible for naturalization under U.S. law.

Native Americans were not granted full US citizenship until the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924. However, even well into the 1960s some state laws prevented Native Americans from exercising their full rights as citizens, such as the right to vote. In 1962, New Mexico became the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/voters9.html|title=Elections: Native Americans|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] that the racial and gender restrictions for naturalization were explicitly abolished. However, the act still contained restrictions regarding who was eligible for US citizenship, and retained a national quota system which limited the number of visas given to immigrants based on their national origin, to be fixed "at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality's population in the United States in 1920".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act|title=The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act)|last=|first=|date=|website=The Office of the Historian|publisher=U.S. Department of State|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that these immigration quota systems were drastically altered in favor of a less discriminatory system.

====Soviet Union====
The [[Russian Constitution of 1918|1918 constitution of revolutionary Russia]] granted citizenship to any foreigners who were living within Russia, so long as they were "engaged in work and [belonged] to the working class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article2.htm|title=1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

====National Socialism====

[[National Socialism]] or "Nazism", the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which would have different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on males of German (or so-called "Aryan") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The Reich Citizenship Law of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not prove "German" racial heritage were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|last=|first=|date=|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred "subject" status upon birth, and could only obtain "citizen" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).

The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.

{{Quote|text="The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

The young boy or girl who is of German nationality and is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him conscious of his race and a member of the folk-community. Then he has to fulfil all those requirements laid down by the State in regard to physical training after he has left school; and finally he enters the army. The training in the army is of a general kind. It must be given to each individual German and will render him competent to fulfil the physical and mental requirements of military service. The rights of citizenship shall be conferred on every young man whose health and character have been certified as good, after having completed his period of military service. This act of inauguration in citizenship shall be a solemn ceremony.

And the diploma conferring the rights of citizenship will be preserved by the young man as the most precious testimonial of his whole life. It entitles him to exercise all the rights of a citizen and to enjoy all the privileges attached thereto. For the State must draw a sharp line of distinction between those who, as members of the nation, are the foundation and the support of its existence and greatness, and those who are domiciled in the State simply as earners of their livelihood there.

On the occasion of conferring a diploma of citizenship the new citizen must take a solemn oath of loyalty to the national community and the State. This diploma must be a bond which unites together all the various classes and sections of the nation. It shall be a greater honour to be a citizen of this Reich, even as a street-sweeper, than to be the King of a foreign State.

The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State.

The German girl is a subject of the State but will become a citizen when she marries. At the same time those women who earn their livelihood independently have the right to acquire citizenship if they are German subjects."|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

==Different senses==
[[File:Citizenship contrasting views.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History of citizenship#Competing senses of citizenship|History of citizenship]].]]
Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both [[Social rights (social contract theory)|rights]] and [[duties]]. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

How citizenship is understood depends on the person making the determination. The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government. 

Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" linking "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15&gt;{{Cite book

* The civic-republican or sometimes classical or civic humanist conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]].

{{further|Civic engagement}}

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duties]] and [[rights]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Another is a question about what is the proper balance between political citizenship versus social citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; According to [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arthur Stinchcombe]], citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

==International==
{{See also|Global citizenship}}
Some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''"The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy"''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===European Union===
{{Main article|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: the consolidated version.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.&lt;ref name="Rome"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]&lt;ref name="Rome" /&gt; established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States&lt;ref&gt;Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.&lt;/ref&gt; which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L'Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth===
The concept of "[[Commonwealth citizen|Commonwealth Citizenship]]" has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President]] or [[Prime Minister]].

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to "Commonwealth countries and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct Canadian Citizenship, automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

==Subnational==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as "citizens" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New Jersey]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

[[File:Diagram of citizenship.jpg|thumb|Diagram of relationship between; Citizens, Politicians + Laws]]

==Education==
{{Main article|Citizenship education (subject)}}
"[[Active citizenship]]" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.

===Republic of Ireland===
It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics &amp; Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.&lt;ref name=dfes&gt;{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called "Modern Studies" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msa-scotland.co.uk/
|title=Modern Studies Association
|accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.

==Criticism of citizenship education in schools==
There are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg &amp; Guérin"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A. &amp; L.J.F. Guérin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education. ''Critical Review'', DOI: 10.1080/08913811.2016.1191191 [https://www.academia.edu/28404527/Questioning_Participation_and_Solidarity_as_Goals_of_Citizenship_Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved 14 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some educationalists relate this criticism to John Dewey (see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).&lt;ref name="Van der Ploeg"&gt;Van der Ploeg, P.A.

A '''civil rights referendum''' or '''human rights referendum''' is any act of [[direct democracy]] which allows for a vote on the granting or amendment of current civil rights, liberties or associations as recognized by a government. Such referenda have frequently been proposed as a means by which the majority of the voting public in a polity, rather than the judicial or legislative chambers of government, could determine what the state should recognize or carry out, while such referenda have been strongly criticized by civil rights organizations and professional bodies as means by which the majority of the public could vote on the rights of a vulnerable minority according to contemporary prejudices.

==United States==

===LGBT rights and Same-sex marriage===
Civil rights referenda have been frequently proposed by those in ideological rejection against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender rights, most often due to Abrahamic religious objections against homosexuality. In countries where governments have passed, activists have frequently sought to put either a repeal of the new LGBT-affirmative law or a (constitutional or statutory) ban on LGBT-affirmative activities or relationships, and often rely upon a core religious constituency in order to drive the advocacy for such a referendum.

In the United States, civil rights referenda were held in the latter 1900s in order to prohibit same-sex unions (including marriage) and repeal amendments to human rights ordinances which included sexual orientations and gender identities as protected classes. The climax of such legislation was the passage of a record number of [[U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions]] by referendum in 2004, which coincided with a large turnout for the re-election of [[George W. Bush]] to the presidency and Republican legislators to control of both houses of Congress.

Among those who advocate for LGBT rights, the delegation of marriage and other rights to the "will of the people" has propelled the notion of preventing civil rights-related laws and proposals from going to the ballot. This notion was underscored in the aftermath of the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]] in California.

===Race relations===
In a 2000 Alabama referendum on repealing the 1901 state constitutional ban on [[interracial marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/us/national-news-briefs-interracial-marriage-ban-up-for-vote-in-alabama.html|title = National News Briefs; Interracial Marriage Ban Up for Vote in Alabama|date = June 3, 1999|publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://articles.cnn.com/1999-03-12/us/9903_12_interracial.marriage_1_interracial-house-panel-samesex-marriage?_s=PM:US|title = Alabama considers lifting interracial marriage ban|date = March 12, 1999|publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40% of the participating electorate voted against repealing the ban. While the ban was rendered unenforceable following ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', the 40.51% of the populace voting against the repeal . In 1998, South Carolina voters voted 61.95%-38.05% in favor of repealing their own constitutional ban. Harvard University professor [[Werner Sollors]] intimated that the laws took so long after ''Loving'' to be repealed because of the complex clauses which required large majorities in order to repeal them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/2001/03/08/sollors/singleton|title = Mixing it up|date = Mar 8, 2001 &lt;!-- 3:14 PM --&gt; |publisher = Salon|author = Suzy Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2012, in remarks accompanying his decision to veto the legalization of same-sex marriage by the State Legislature and call for a referendum on the matter, New Jersey governor [[Chris Christie]] remarked that "The fact of the matter is, I think people would have been happy to have a referendum on civil rights rather than fighting and dying in the streets in the South.

===Women's suffrage===
[[Women's suffrage]] was first brought forward as proposed legislation in the [[Kansas women's suffrage referendum, 1867]]. The proposal was defeated twice before passing.

{{Other uses2|Cockayne}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 037.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]: ''[[The Land of Cockaigne (Bruegel)|Luilekkerland]]'' ("The Land of Cockaigne "), oil on panel (1567; [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]])]]

'''Cockaigne''' or '''Cockayne''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ˈ|k|eɪ|n}} is a [[Mythical place|land of plenty]] in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] myth, an [[Imagination|imaginary]] place of extreme luxury and ease where physical comforts and pleasures are always immediately at hand and where the harshness of medieval [[peasant]] life does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cockaigne, Land of|volume=6|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in poems like [[Land of Cockayne (poem)|''The Land of Cockaigne'']], it is a land of contraries, where all the restrictions of society are defied (abbots beaten by their monks), sexual liberty is open (nuns flipped over to show their bottoms), and food is plentiful (skies that rain cheeses). Writing about Cockaigne was a commonplace of [[Goliard]] verse.  It represented both wish fulfillment and resentment at the strictures of [[asceticism]] and death.

==Etymology==
While the first recorded uses of the word are the Latin ''Cucaniensis'', and the Middle English ''Cokaygne'', one line of reasoning has the name tracing to [[Middle French]] ''(pays de) cocaigne'' "(land of) plenty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lautrec.fr/tourisme/pastel.php?menu=3 |title=Le Pastel et le Pays de Cocagne |publisher=Lautrec.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505134056/http://www.lautrec.fr/tourisme/pastel.php?menu=3 |archivedate=2008-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately adapted or derived from a word for a small sweet cake sold to children at a fair (''[[OED]]''). In [[Ireland]] it was mentioned in the ''[[Kildare Poems]]'' composed c. 1350. In [[Italian language|Italian]], the same place is called ''Paese della Cuccagna''; the Flemish-Belgian equivalent is ''Luilekkerland'' ("relaxed luscious, delicious land"), translated from the Middle-Belgian word ''Cockaengen'', and the German equivalent is ''Schlaraffenland''. In Spanish an equivalent place is named ''[[Jauja]]'', after a rich mining region of the Andes, and ''País de Cucaña'' ("fools' paradise") may also signify such a place. From Swedish dialect ''lubber'' ("fat lazy fellow") comes ''Lubberland'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120630212437/http://home.comcast.net/~wwftd/archives.html Today's wwftd is...], at ''Worthless words for the day'', by Michael A. Fischer.&lt;/ref&gt; popularized in the ballad ''[[An Invitation to Lubberland]]''. 

In the 1820s, the name ''Cockaigne'' came to be applied jocularly to [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;''OED'' notes a first usage in 1824.&lt;/ref&gt; as the land of [[Cockney]]s ("Cockney" from a "cock's egg", an implausible creature; see also [[basilisk]]), though the two are not linguistically connected otherwise. The composer [[Edward Elgar]] used the word "Cockaigne" for his [[symphonic poem|concert overture]] and suite evoking the people of London, ''[[Cockaigne (In London Town)]]'', Op. 40 (1901).

The Dutch villages of [[Kockengen]] and [[Koekange]] were named after Cockaigne. The surname Cockayne also derives from the mythical land, and was originally a nickname for an idle dreamer.&lt;ref name=Oxon&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hanks, Patrick|author2=Hodges, Flavia|author3=Mills, A. D.|author4=Room, Adrian|title=The Oxford Names Companion|date=2002|location=Oxford|publisher=the University Press|isbn=0198605617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Atlantis]] and [[El Dorado (myth)|El Dorado]], the land of Cockaigne was a utopia. It was a fictional place where, in a parody of paradise, idleness and gluttony were the principal occupations. In ''Specimens of Early English Poets'' (1790), [[George Ellis (poet)|George Ellis]] printed a 13th-century French poem called "The Land of Cockaigne" where "the houses were made of barley sugar and cakes, the streets were paved with pastry, and the shops supplied goods for nothing"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Wordsworth Editions | isbn = 9781840223101 | last = Brewer | first = Ebenezer Cobham | title = The Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | date = 2001-05-01 | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Pleij]], ''Dreaming of Cockaigne: Medieval Fantasies of the Perfect Life'' (2001):

{{quote|roasted pigs wander about with knives in their backs to make carving easy, where grilled geese fly directly into one's mouth, where cooked fish jump out of the water and land at one's feet. The weather is always mild, the wine flows freely, sex is readily available, and all people enjoy eternal youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-11702-9/dreaming-of-cockaigne |title=Dreaming of Cockaigne |publisher=Cup.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cockaigne was a "medieval peasant’s dream, offering relief from backbreaking labor and the daily struggle for meager food."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utopia.nypl.org/I_sources_9b.html |title=New York Public Library: Utopia |publisher=Utopia.nypl.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716201501/http://utopia.nypl.org/I_sources_9b.html |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brothers Grimm]] collected and retold the [[fairy tale]] in ''Das Märchen vom Schlaraffenland'' ("The Tale About the Land of Cockaigne").

[[Image:Two men preparing greasy pole for La Tomatina festival.jpg|thumb|Greasing the pole during the [[Tomatina]] festival of [[Buñol]], Spain.]]

==Traditions==
[[File:La cucaña.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Goya]]: ''[[La cucaña]]'' ("The Greasy Pole", c. 1786)]]

A [[Naples|Neapolitan]] tradition, extended to other Latin-culture countries, is the [[Greasy pole|Cockaigne pole]] (Italian: cuccagna; Spanish: cucaña), a horizontal or vertical pole with a prize (like a [[ham]]) at one end. The pole is covered with grease or soap and planted during a festival. Then, daring people try to climb the slippery pole to get the prize. The crowd laughs at the often failed attempts to hold on to the pole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6037">[[File:Conical coordinates.png|thumb|380px|right|[[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|Coordinate surfaces]] of the conical coordinates.  The constants {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} were chosen as 1 and 2, respectively.  The red sphere represents {{math|1=''r'' = 2}}, the blue elliptic cone aligned with the vertical {{math|''z''}}-axis represents μ=cosh(1) and the yellow elliptic cone aligned with the (green) {{mvar|x}}-axis corresponds to {{math|1=''ν''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2/3}}.  The three surfaces intersect at the point {{math|'''P'''}} (shown as a black sphere) with [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] roughly (1.26, -0.78, 1.34).  The elliptic cones intersect the sphere in taco-shaped curves.]]

'''Conical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] consisting of 
concentric spheres (described by their radius {{mvar|r}}) and by two families of perpendicular cones, aligned along the {{math|''z''}}- and {{math|''x''}}-axes, respectively.

==Basic definitions==

The conical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r, \mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
x = \frac{r\mu\nu}{bc}
&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \frac{r}{b} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu^{2} - b^{2} \right) \left( \nu^{2} - b^{2} \right)}{\left( b^{2} - c^{2} \right)} }
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = \frac{r}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\left( \mu^{2} - c^{2} \right) \left( \nu^{2} - c^{2} \right)}{\left( c^{2} - b^{2} \right)} }
&lt;/math&gt;

with the following limitations on the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;
\nu^{2} &lt; c^{2} &lt; \mu^{2} &lt; b^{2}. 
&lt;/math&gt;

Surfaces of constant {{mvar|r}} are spheres of that radius centered on the origin

:&lt;math&gt;
x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = r^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; are mutually perpendicular cones

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\mu^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{\mu^{2} + b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{\mu^{2} - c^{2}} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^{2}}{\nu^{2}} + \frac{y^{2}}{\nu^{2} - b^{2}} + \frac{z^{2}}{\nu^{2} + c^{2}} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this coordinate system, both [[Laplace's equation]] and the [[Helmholtz equation]] are separable.

==Scale factors==

The scale factor for the radius {{mvar|r}} is one ({{math|1=''h&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1}}), as in [[spherical coordinates]]. The scale factors for the two conical coordinates are 

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\mu} = r \sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2} - \nu^{2}}{\left( b^{2} - \mu^{2} \right) \left( \mu^{2} - c^{2} \right)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\nu} = r \sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2} - \nu^{2}}{\left( b^{2} - \nu^{2} \right) \left( c^{2} - \nu^{2} \right)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Light cone conical coordinates ==
[[File:LightConeConicCoords.pdf|thumb]]
An alternative set of (non-orthogonal) conical coordinates have been derived&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Drake|first = Samuel Picton|last2 = Anderson|first2 = Brian D.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\xi   &amp;=  r\cos(\phi\sin\theta)\\
\psi  &amp;=  r\sin(\phi\sin\theta) \\ 
\zeta &amp;=  \theta,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;   

where &lt;math&gt;\{r, \theta, \phi\}&lt;/math&gt; are [[spherical polar coordinates]]. The corresponding inverse relations are

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r      &amp; =  \sqrt{\xi^2 + \psi^2}\\
\phi   &amp; =  \frac{1}{\sin\zeta}\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi}) \\
\theta &amp; =  \zeta.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal Euclidean distance between two points in these coordinates 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
ds^2  &amp; =  d\xi^2 + d\psi^2+(\xi^2 + \psi^2)(1+\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})^2\cot\zeta^2) d\zeta^2 \\
&amp;+ 2\psi\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})\cot\zeta d\xi d\zeta - 2\xi\arctan(\frac{\psi}{\xi})\cot\zeta d\psi d\zeta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal coordinates on the surface of the cone given by &lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
If the path between any two points is constrained to this surface, then the geodesic distance between any two points

&lt;math&gt;\{\xi_1,\psi_1,\zeta_1=\frac{\pi}{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\xi_2,\psi_2,\zeta_2=\frac{\pi}{4}\}&lt;/math&gt; is 

&lt;math&gt;s^2_{12} = (\xi_1-\xi_2)^2+(\psi_1-\psi_2)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Contra proferentem''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: "against [the] offeror"),&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]]|edition=9th|editor-last1=Garner|editor-first1=Bryan A.|editor-link1=Bryan A. Garner |first=Henry C. |last=Black |authorlink=Henry Campbell Black |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=[[West Publishing]] |year=2009 |type=Print. |isbn=0-314-19949-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as "interpretation against the draftsman", is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] of [[contract]]ual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or [[contractual term|term]] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording.&lt;ref name="r2d206"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Law Institute|title=Restatement (Second) of Contracts|year=1981|publisher=American Law Institute Publishers|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|volume=2|chapter=The Scope of Contractual Obligations|at=§ 206|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal [[bargaining power]], but is applicable to other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with [[insurance contract]]s and [[bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|American Law Institute|1981|loc=§ 206, cmt. b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can.

Additionally, the rule reflects the court's inherent dislike of [[Standard form contract|standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts]] also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual [[consumer]]s, residential leases, etc.). The [[court]] perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, [[legal system]]s apply the doctrine of ''contra proferentem''; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party upon whom the contract was foisted.  Some courts when seeking a particular result will use ''contra proferentem'' to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and go so far as to interpret [[Contractual Term|terms]] of the contract in favor of the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} although this application is disfavored.

''Contra proferentem'' also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the [[contract]]. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position to, for example, avoid contractual forfeiture. This is a longstanding principle: see, for example, [[California Civil Code]] §1654 (“In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist"), which was enacted in 1872. Numerous other states have also codified the rule.

The principle has also been codified in international instruments such as the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles and the [[Principles of European Contract Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8966">'''Cost–utility analysis''' ('''CUA''') is a form of [[financial analysis]] used to guide procurement decisions.

The most common and well-known application of this analysis is in [[pharmacoeconomics]], especially health [[technology assessment]] (HTA).

== Health economics ==
In health economics the purpose of CUA is to estimate the ratio between the cost of a health-related intervention and the benefit it produces in terms of the number of years lived in full health by the beneficiaries. Hence it can be considered a special case of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], and the two terms are often used interchangeably.

Cost is measured in monetary units. Benefit needs to be expressed in a way that allows health states that are considered less preferable to full health to be given quantitative values. However, unlike [[cost–benefit analysis]], the benefits do not have to be expressed in monetary terms. In HTAs it is usually expressed in [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs).

If, for example, intervention A allows a patient to live for three additional years than if no intervention had taken place, but only with a quality of life weight of 0.6, then the intervention confers 3 * 0.6 = 1.8 QALYs to the patient. If intervention B confers two extra years of life at a quality of life weight of 0.75, then it confers an additional 1.5 QALYs to the patient. The net benefit of intervention A over intervention B is therefore 1.8 – 1.5 = 0.3 QALYs.

The [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER) is the ratio between the difference in costs and the difference in benefits of two interventions. The ICER may be stated as (C1 – C0)/(E1 – E0) in a simple example where C0 and E0 represent the cost and gain, respectively, from taking no health intervention action. C1 and E1 would represent the cost and gain, respectively of taking a specific action. So, an example in which the costs and gains, respectively, are $140,000 and 3.5 QALYs, would yield a value of $40,000 per QALY. These values are often used by policy makers and hospital administrators to determine relative priorities when determining treatments for disease conditions. It is important to note that CUA measures relative patient or general population utility of a treatment or [[Pharmacoeconomics|pharmacoeconomic]] intervention. Its results give no absolute indicator of the value of a certain treatment.

The [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) in the UK has been using QALYs to measure the health benefits delivered by various treatment regimens. There is some question as to how well coordinated NICE and NHS are in making decisions about resource allocation. According to a recent study "cost effectiveness often does not appear to be the dominant consideration in decisions about resource allocation made elsewhere in the NHS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah|first=K.K|title= Is the aim of the health care system to maximise QALYs? An investigation of 'what else matters' in the NHS|url=http://www.ohe.org/news/2011/05/17/qalys-v-other-criteria-in-nhs-decision-making/%5D|work=OHE Research Paper|publisher=Office of Health Economics|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While QALYs are used in the United States, they are not utilized to the same degree as they are in Europe.

In the United Kingdom, in January 2005, the NICE is believed to have a threshold of about £30,000 per QALY – roughly twice the mean income after tax – although a formal figure has never been made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, any health intervention which has an incremental cost of more than £30,000 per additional QALY gained is likely to be rejected and any intervention which has an incremental cost of less than or equal to £30,000 per extra QALY gained is likely to be accepted as cost-effective. This implies a value of a full life of about £2.4 million. For end of life treatments, a higher threshold of £50,000 per additional QALY gained is used by NICE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In North America, a similar figure of US$50000 per QALY is often suggested as a threshold ICER for a cost-effective intervention.

A complete compilation of cost–utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925101826/http://www.tufts-nemc.org/cearegistry/ CEA Registry Website]

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===

On the plus side, CUA allows comparison across different health programs and policies by using a common unit of measure (money/QALYs gained). CUA provides a more complete analysis of total benefits than simple [[cost–benefit analysis]] does. This is because CUA takes into account the quality of life that an individual has, while CBA does not.

However, in CUA, societal benefits and costs are often not taken into account. Furthermore, some economists believe that measuring QALYs is more difficult than measuring the monetary value of life through health improvements, as is done with cost–benefit analysis. This is because in CUA you need to measure the health improvement effects for every remaining year of life after the program is initiated. While for [[Cost-benefit analysis]] (CBA) we have an approximate [[value of life]] ($2 million is one of the estimates), we do not have a QALY estimate for nearly every medical treatment or disease.

In addition, some people believe that life is priceless and there are ethical problems with placing a value on human life.

Also, the weighting of QALYs through [[time-trade-off]], standard gamble, or [[visual analogue scale]] is highly subjective.

=== Criticism of cost-utility analysis ===

There are criticisms of QALY. One involves QALY's lack of usefulness to the healthcare provider in determining the applicability of alternative treatments in the individual patient environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kind|first=P.|author2=Lafata, J. E. |author3=Matuszewski, K. |author4=Raisch, D. |title=The use of QALYs in clinical and patient decision-making: Issues and prospects|journal=Value in Health|date=February 2009|volume=12|issue=S1|pages=S27-S30|doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2009.00519.x|url=http://www.ispor.org/meetings/Invitational/QALY/Paper6.pdf|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of incorporating the patient's willingness to pay (i.e. [[behavioral economics]]) in decisions to finance new treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Another criticism involves age; elderly individuals are assumed to have lower QALYs since they do not have as many years to influence the calculation of the measurement; so comparing a health intervention's impact on a teenager's QALYs to an older individual's QALYs may not be considered "fair" since age is such an important factor. Specific health outcomes may also be difficult to quantify, thus making it difficult to compare all factors that may influence an individual's QALY.
Example: Comparing an intervention's impact on the livelihood of a single woman to a mother of three; QALYs do not take into account the importance that an individual person may have for others' lives.

In the US, the health care reform law ([[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]) has forbidden the use of QALYs "as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended. Also, "The Secretary shall not utilize such an adjusted life year (or such a similar measure) as a threshold to determine coverage, reimbursement, or incentive programs under title XVIII".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=PJ|author2=Weinstein MC|title=Legislating against use of cost-effectiveness information.|journal=N Engl J Med|date=October 2010|issue=16|pages=1495–1497|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1007168|accessdate=24 July 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1007168|pmid=20942664|volume=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 111 – 148 – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ148/content-detail.html|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but has since fallen into disuse.

==Beginnings==

In 1958, Forrester unwittingly instigated DYNAMO's development when he asked an MIT staff programmer to compute needed solutions to some equations, for a [[Harvard Business Review]] paper he was writing about industrial dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | author = Forrester, J.W.
  | title = Industrial Dynamics
  | publisher = [[MIT Press]]

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/sdep/papers/D-4165-1.pdf "The Beginning of System Dynamics," Jay W. Forrester]&lt;/ref&gt;
The programmer, Richard Bennett, chose to implement a system (SIMPLE - "Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations") that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions. SIMPLE became the proof-of-concept for DYNAMO: rather than have a specialist programmer "hard-code" a special-purpose solver in a general purpose programming language, users could specify a system's equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution.

==Design goals==

DYNAMO was designed to emphasize the following:

* ease-of-use for the industrial dynamics modeling community (who were not assumed to be expert programmers);
* immediate execution of the compiled model, without producing an intermediate object file; and
* providing graphical output, with [[line printer]] and [[pen plotter]] graphics.

Among the ways in which DYNAMO was above the standard of the time, it featured [[Dimensional analysis|units checking]] of numerical types and relatively clear error messages.

==Implementation==

The earliest versions were written in [[assembly language]] for the [[IBM 704]], then for the [[IBM 709]] and [[IBM 7090]].  DYNAMO II was written in [[ALGOL Extended for Design|AED-0]], an extended version of [[Algol 60]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Apart from its (indirectly felt) public impact in environmental issues raised by the controversy over ''Limits to Growth'', DYNAMO was influential in the history of discrete-event simulation even though it was essentially a package for continuous simulation specified through [[difference equations]].&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Discrete Event Simulation Programming Languages", Richard E.

'''Della Moneta''' ('''On Money''') is a book written by [[Ferdinando Galiani]], and is considered one of the first specific treatise on [[economics]], especially [[monetary theory]], preceding [[Adam Smith]]'s [[The Wealth of Nations]] by twenty-five years.

==Summary==
''Della Moneta'' is divided into five sections, covering what are still seen today as the standard aspects of [[monetary theory]]. These include the [[history of money|origin of money]], its [[Theory of value (economics)|value]] (including [[inflation]] and [[deflation]]), [[interest]], and [[monetary policy]].

==The Origin of Money==

The author, only 23 years old at the time, started with the history of Italian coinage, going back to the Greeks and Romans. Discarding the contemporary view of the origin of money through centrally planned contracts, Galiani proposes that money tends to arise spontaneously, through the need for trade, anticipating the [[Austrian school]] of economics by well over a century. He describes a sort of thought experiment, in which a government would attempt to trade or confiscate through taxes a portion of all goods in the kingdom, until it finds that the plunder is too diverse and complex to manage, and would then turn to demanding only the trade equivalent in some simple commodities that happen to have the traits seen as useful for money at the time, like compactness, ease of distribution and ease of storage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3868531/Della_Moneta_by_Ferdinando_Galiani_a_Quarter_Millennium_Assessment_-_Editors_Introduction Della Moneta by Ferdinando Galiani: a Quarter Millennium Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Value of Money==
Interwoven into the other themes throughout the book is a second premise, that money, and material goods in general, have value based on their utility to people: a premise that was only rediscovered with examination of [[marginal utility]] 120 years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinando-Galiani#ref725639 Encyclopedia Brittanica: Ferdinando Galiani]&lt;/ref&gt; He even touches upon a modern idea that would not be deeply examined again until the mid 20th century: that the value of money and goods may reach an equilibrium in price, based on [[supply and demand]]. This may also be the first modern examination of supply and demand as an economic driver.

==Methodology==
Galiani attempts to use sound philosophical methodology in the presentation and organization of his book. He even criticizes other early economic texts as failing to do so. For example, in Della Moneta he mentions [[Montesquieu]], whose book he says was harmful to France, because it commits the [[is-ought fallacy]], is full of wishful thinking, and lacks scientific rigour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3868531/Della_Moneta_by_Ferdinando_Galiani_a_Quarter_Millennium_Assessment_-_Editors_Introduction Della Moneta by Ferdinando Galiani: a Quarter Millennium Assessment - Editors' Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects a cutting-edge understanding of logic, as for example the is-ought problem was only recently identified by [[David Hume]].

==Influences==
Galiani appears to have been well-versed in the complex debates about how and why money had such an impact on Europe in the previous two centuries, brought on by incidents like the [[price revolution]] in [[Spain]] in the 16th century, where an influx of gold plundered from the [[New World]] caused dramatic inflation in first Spain, then all of Europe, a crisis that continued to varying degrees until around the time of Galiani's book.

He makes mention, in the book, of previous thoughts on topics of political economy by others, including [[John Locke]] and [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]].

==Impact==
This book has widely cited by economists from different [[schools of economic thought]] from Adam Smith's time on, from [[Karl Marx]] through [[Joseph Schumpeter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4393">A '''dream dictionary''' is a tool made for interpreting images in a [[dream]]. Dream dictionaries tend to include specific images which are attached to specific interpretations. However, dream dictionaries are generally not considered scientifically viable by those within the psychology community.
 
==History==
Since the 19th century, the art of dream interpretation has been transferred to a scientific ground, making it a distinct part of psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dream symbols of the "unscientific" days—the outcome of hearsay interpretations that differ around the world among different cultures—continued to mark the day of an average human-being, who is most likely unfamiliar with Freudian analysis of dreams.

The dream dictionary includes interpretations of dreams, giving each symbol in a dream a specific meaning. The argument of what dreams represent has greatly changed over time. With this changing, so have the interpretation of dreams. Dream dictionaries have changed in content since they were first published. The Greeks and Romans saw dreams as having a religious meaning. This made them believe that their dreams were an insight into the future and held the key to the solutions of their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's view on dreams were that they were merely a function of our physiological make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beare|first=J.I.|title=On Dreams by Aristotle|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/dreams.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not believe dreams have a greater meaning, solely that it is a result of how we sleep. In the Middle Ages, dreams were seen as an interpretation of good or evil.

Although the dream dictionary is not recognized in the psychology world, Freud is said to have revolutionized the interpretation and study of dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream in History|url=http://www.dreammoods.com/dreaminformation/history.htm|publisher=Dream Moods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud came to the conclusion that dreams were a form of wish fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Kevin|title=Introduction to Sigmund Freud's Theory on Dreams|url=http://www.insomnium.co.uk/dream-theory/introduction-freud-theory-on-dreams/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries were first based upon Freudian thoughts and ancient interpretations of dreams.

Some examples of [[dream interpretation]] are: dreaming you are on a beach means you are facing negativity in your life, or a lion may represent a need to control others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Dreams|url=http://www.dreambible.com/common-dreams.html|publisher=US Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream dictionaries typically hold interpretations ranging from A-Z. Dream dictionaries can be found in book form or on the internet.

[[Image:Cat_demonstrating_static_cling_with_styrofoam_peanuts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Styrofoam peanut]]s clinging to a cat's fur due to [[static electricity]].  The [[triboelectric effect]] causes an [[electrostatic charge]] to build up on the fur due to the cat's motions. The [[electric field]] of the charge causes polarization of the molecules of the styrofoam due to [[electrostatic induction]], resulting in a slight attraction of the light plastic pieces to the charged fur. This is also the cause of [[static cling]] in clothes.]] 

'''Electrostatics''' is a branch of [[physics]] that studies [[electric charge]]s at rest.

Since [[classical physics]],  it has been known that some materials such as [[amber]] attract lightweight particles after [[Triboelectric effect|rubbing]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word for amber, {{lang|grc|ήλεκτρον}}, or ''{{lang|grc-Latn|electron}}'', was the source of the word 'electricity'. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the [[force]]s that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces are described by [[Coulomb's law]].
Even though electrostatically induced forces seem to be rather weak, some electrostatic forces such as the one between an [[electron]] and a [[proton]], that together make up a [[hydrogen]] [[atom]], is about 36 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] stronger than the [[gravitation]]al force acting between them.

There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of the plastic wrap to one's hand after it is removed from a package to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and [[photocopier]] &amp; [[laser printing|laser printer]] operation. Electrostatics involves the buildup of charge on the [[Interface (matter)|surface]] of objects due to contact with other surfaces. Although charge exchange happens whenever any two surfaces contact and separate, the effects of charge exchange are usually only noticed when at least one of the surfaces has a high [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] to electrical flow.  This is because the charges that transfer are trapped there for a time long enough for their effects to be observed.  These charges then remain on the object until they either bleed off to ground or are quickly neutralized by a [[Electrostatic discharge|discharge]]: e.g., the familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge built up in the body from contact with insulated surfaces.

==Coulomb's law==
{{Main article|Coulomb's law}}
Coulomb's law states that:

'The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'

The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.

If &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance (in [[meters]]) between two charges, then the force (in [[Newton (unit)|newton]]s) between two point charges &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (in [[coulomb]]s) is:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\frac{qQ}{r^2}= k_0\frac{qQ}{r^2}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]], or permittivity of free space:&lt;ref name="Sadiku"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of electromagnetics|year=2009|isbn=9780195387759|page=104|author=Matthew Sadiku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 \approx {10^{-9}\over 36\pi} \;\; \mathrm{C^2\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}}\approx 8.854\ 187\ 817 \times 10^{-12} \;\; \mathrm{C^2\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[International System of Units|SI]] units of ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are equivalently &amp;ensp;[[Ampere|A]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Coulomb|C]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[[Newton (units)|N]]&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Farad|F]] m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Coulomb's constant]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; k_0 \approx \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\approx 8.987\ 551\ 787 \times 10^9 \;\; \mathrm{N\ m^2\ C}^{-2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The use of ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; instead of k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in expressing Coulomb's Law is related to the fact that the force is inversely proportional to the [[surface area]] of a sphere with radius equal to the separation between the two charges.

A single [[proton]] has a charge of ''e'', and the [[electron]] has a charge of −''e'', where,

:&lt;math&gt; e \approx 1.602\ 176\ 565 \times 10^{-19}\;\; \mathrm{C}. &lt;/math&gt;

These [[physical constant]]s (ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, e) are currently defined so that ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and k&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are exactly defined, and ''e'' is a measured quantity.

==Electric field==
[[Image:Electrostatic induction.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|The [[electrostatic field]] ''(lines with arrows)'' of a nearby positive charge ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(+)&lt;/span&gt;'' causes the mobile charges in conductive objects to separate due to [[electrostatic induction]]. Negative charges ''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;(blue)&lt;/span&gt;'' are attracted and move to the surface of the object facing the external charge.  Positive charges ''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;(red)&lt;/span&gt;'' are repelled and move to the surface facing away.   These induced surface charges are exactly the right size and shape so their opposing electric field cancels the electric field of the external charge throughout the interior of the metal.  Therefore, the electrostatic field everywhere inside a conductive object is zero, and the [[electrostatic potential]] is constant.]]

The [[electric field]], &lt;math&gt;\vec{E}&lt;/math&gt;, in units of [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[coulomb]] or [[volt]]s per meter, is a [[vector field]] that can be defined everywhere, except at the location of point charges (where it diverges to infinity).&lt;ref name="Purcell"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as the electrostatic force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}\,&lt;/math&gt; in newtons on a hypothetical small [[test charge]] at the point due to [[Coulomb's Law]], divided by the magnitude of the charge &lt;math&gt;q\,&lt;/math&gt; in coulombs

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = {\vec{F} \over q}\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Field line|Electric field lines]] are useful for visualizing the electric field. Field lines begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge.  They are parallel to the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.

Consider a collection of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles of charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;, located at points &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; (called ''source points''), the electric field at &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt; (called the ''field point'') is:&lt;ref name="Purcell" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \vec{E}(\vec r)
=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\widehat\mathcal R_i Q_i}{\left \|\mathcal\vec R_i \right \|^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \vec\mathcal R_i =  \vec r - \vec r_i ,&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement vector from a ''source point'' 
&lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; to the ''field point'' 
&lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt; \widehat\mathcal R_i = \vec\mathcal R_i / \left \|\vec\mathcal R_i \right \|&lt;/math&gt; 
is a [[unit vector]] that indicates the direction of the field.  For a single point charge at the origin, the magnitude of this electric field is &lt;math&gt;E =k_eQ/\mathcal R^2,&lt;/math&gt; and points away from that charge is positive. The fact that the force (and hence the field) can be calculated by summing over all the contributions due to individual source particles is an example of the [[superposition principle]].  The electric field produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume [[charge density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho (\vec r)&lt;/math&gt; and can be obtained by converting this sum into a [[triple integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E}(\vec r)= \frac {1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \iiint \frac {\vec r - \vec r \,'}{\left \| \vec r - \vec r \,' \right \|^3} \rho (\vec r \,')\operatorname{d}^3 r\,'
&lt;/math&gt;

===Gauss' law===
[[Gauss' law]] states that "the total electric flux through any closed surface in free space of any shape drawn in an electric field is proportional to the total [[electric charge]] enclosed by the surface." Mathematically, Gauss's law takes the form of an integral equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_S\vec{E} \cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{A}  = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_0}\,Q_{enclosed}=\int_V{\rho\over\varepsilon_0}\cdot\operatorname{d}^3 r,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{d}^3 r =\mathrm{d}x \ \mathrm{d}y \ \mathrm{d}z &lt;/math&gt; is a volume element. If the charge is distributed over a surface or along a line, replace &lt;math&gt; \rho\mathrm{d}^3r &lt;/math&gt; by  &lt;math&gt; \sigma\mathrm{d}A &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \lambda\mathrm{d}\ell &lt;/math&gt;. The [[Divergence Theorem]] allows Gauss's Law to be written in differential form:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} = {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla} \cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence|divergence operator]].

===Poisson and Laplace equations===

The definition of electrostatic potential, combined with the differential form of Gauss's law (above), provides a relationship between the potential Φ and the charge density ρ:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla}^2 \phi = - {\rho\over\varepsilon_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is a form of [[Poisson's equation]]. In the absence of unpaired electric charge, the equation becomes [[Laplace's equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;{\nabla}^2 \phi = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

==Electrostatic approximation==
The validity of the electrostatic approximation rests on the assumption that the electric field is [[irrotational]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{E} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

From [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], this assumption implies the absence or near-absence of time-varying magnetic fields:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial\vec{B}\over\partial t} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, electrostatics does not require the absence of magnetic fields or electric currents. Rather, if magnetic fields or electric currents ''do'' exist, they must not change with time, or in the worst-case, they must change with time only ''very slowly''. In some problems, both electrostatics and [[magnetostatics]] may be required for accurate predictions, but the coupling between the two can still be ignored. Electrostatics and magnetostatics can both be seen as Galilean limits for electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heras|first1=J. A.|title=The Galilean limits of Maxwell's equations|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|date=2010|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1048|doi=10.1119/1.3442798|arxiv = 1012.1068 |bibcode = 2010AmJPh..78.1048H }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=May 2016}}&lt;!--The original was &lt;ref name="Levy Leblond"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Galinean electromagnetism

===Electrostatic potential===

Because the electric field is [[irrotational]], it is possible to express the electric field as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function,&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, called the [[electrostatic potential]] (also known as the [[voltage]]). An electric field, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, points from regions of high electric potential to regions of low electric potential, expressed mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Vector calculus|gradient theorem]] can be used to establish that the electrostatic potential is the amount of [[work (physics)|work]] per unit charge required to move a charge from point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with the following [[line integral]]:

:&lt;math&gt; -\int_a^b{\vec{E}\cdot \mathrm{d}\vec \ell} = \phi (\vec b) -\phi(\vec a).&lt;/math&gt;

From these equations, we see that the electric potential is constant in any region for which the electric field vanishes (such as occurs inside a conducting object).

===Electrostatic energy===
{{Main article|Electric potential energy|Energy density}}

A single [[test particle]]'s potential energy, &lt;math&gt;  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{single}}&lt;/math&gt;, can be calculated from a [[line integral]] of the work, &lt;math&gt;q_n\vec E\cdot\mathrm d\vec\ell &lt;/math&gt;.  We integrate from a point at infinity, and assume a collection of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles of charge &lt;math&gt;Q_n&lt;/math&gt;, are already situated at the points &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt;.  This potential energy (in [[Joule]]s) is:

:&lt;math&gt;  U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{single}}=q\phi(\vec r)=\frac{q }{4\pi \varepsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{Q_i}{\left \|\mathcal{\vec R_i} \right \|} &lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; \vec\mathcal {R_i} = \vec r - \vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the distance of each charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; from the [[test charge]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, which situated at the point &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \phi(\vec r)&lt;/math&gt;  is the electric potential that would be at &lt;math&gt;\vec r &lt;/math&gt; if the [[test charge]] were not present.  If only two charges are present, the potential energy is &lt;math&gt;k_eQ_1Q_2/r&lt;/math&gt;.  The total [[electric potential energy]] due a collection of ''N'' charges is calculating by assembling these particles [[Electric Potential Energy|one at a time]]:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{total}} = \frac{1 }{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1}^N Q_j \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \frac{Q_i}{r_{ij}}= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N Q_i\phi_i ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the following sum from, ''j = 1'' to ''N'', excludes ''i = j'':

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon _0}\sum_{j=1 (j\ne i)}^N \frac{Q_j}{r_{ij}}. &lt;/math&gt;

This electric potential, &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; is what would be measured at &lt;math&gt;\vec r_i&lt;/math&gt; if the charge &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; were missing.  This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of charge.  The sum over charges can be converted into an integral over charge density using the prescription &lt;math&gt;\sum (\cdots) \rightarrow \int(\cdots)\rho\mathrm d^3r&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;U_\mathrm{E}^{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \int\rho(\vec{r})\phi(\vec{r}) \operatorname{d}^3 r = \frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2} \int  \left|{\mathbf{E}}\right|^2 \operatorname{d}^3 r&lt;/math&gt;,

This second expression for [[electrostatic energy]] uses the fact that the electric field is the negative [[gradient]] of the electric potential, as well as [[vector calculus identities]] in a way that resembles [[integration by parts]].  These two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\rho\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varepsilon_0 }{2}E^2&lt;/math&gt;; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.

===Electrostatic pressure===

On a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an [[electric field]]. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:

:&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{ \varepsilon_0 }{2} E^2 &lt;/math&gt;,

This pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.

==Triboelectric series==
{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}

The [[triboelectric effect]] is a type of contact electrification in which certain materials become electrically charged when they are brought into contact with a different material and then separated.  One of the materials acquires a positive charge, and the other acquires an equal negative charge.  The polarity and strength of the charges produced differ according to the materials, surface roughness, temperature, strain, and other properties.  Amber, for example, can acquire an electric charge by friction with a material like wool. This property, first recorded by [[Thales of Miletus]], was the first electrical phenomenon investigated by humans. Other examples of materials that can acquire a significant charge when rubbed together include glass rubbed with silk, and hard rubber rubbed with fur.

==Electrostatic generators==
{{Main article|Electrostatic generator}}
The presence of [[surface charge]] imbalance means that the objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of [[contact electrification]] and the [[triboelectric effect]]. Rubbing two nonconductive objects generates a great amount of static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two nonconductive surfaces can become charged by just being placed one on top of the other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge.  Some examples of these substances are [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], and [[pith]]. [[conductor (material)|Conductive]] objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. [[electrostatic generator|Static electric generators]], devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.

Note that the presence of [[electric current]] does not detract from the electrostatic forces nor from the sparking, from the [[corona discharge]], or other phenomena. Both phenomena can exist simultaneously in the same system.

==Charge neutralization==
Natural electrostatic phenomena are most familiar as an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, but can be destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing). When working in direct contact with integrated circuit electronics (especially delicate [[MOSFET]]s), or in the presence of flammable gas, care must be taken to avoid accumulating and suddenly discharging a static charge (see [[electrostatic discharge]]).

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a redistribution of charges in an object caused by the electric field of a nearby charge.  For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged [[electron]]s in the metal will be attracted the external charge, and move to the side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface.  When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These ''induced charges'' disappear when the external charge is removed.  Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges.  The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object.  This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a [[Faraday cage]].  Since the electric field is the [[gradient (calculus)|gradient]] of the voltage, electrostatic induction is also responsible for making the [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) constant throughout a conductive object.

=='Static' electricity==
{{Main article|Static electricity}}
[[Image:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Lightning]] over [[Oradea]] in [[Romania]]]]
Before the year 1832, when [[Michael Faraday]] published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities, physicists thought "static electricity" was somehow different from other electrical charges. Michael Faraday proved that the electricity induced from the magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same.

Static electricity is usually caused when certain materials are rubbed against each other, like wool on plastic or the soles of shoes on carpet. The process causes electrons to be pulled from the surface of one material and relocated on the surface of the other material.

A static shock occurs when the surface of the second material, negatively charged with electrons, touches a positively charged conductor, or vice versa.

Static electricity is commonly used in [[xerography]], [[air filter]]s, and some automotive paints.
Static electricity is a buildup of electric charges on two objects that have become separated from each other.
Small electrical components can easily be damaged by static electricity. Component manufacturers use a number of [[antistatic devices]] to avoid this.

=== Static electricity and chemical industry ===
When different materials are brought together and then separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that you receive when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet is an example of excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.

A similar charging mechanism can occur within low conductivity fluids flowing through pipelines—a process called flow electrification. Fluids which have low electrical conductivity (below 50 picosiemens per meter), are called accumulators. Fluids having conductivities above 50 pS/m are called non-accumulators. In non-accumulators, charges recombine as fast as they are separated and hence electrostatic charge generation is not significant. In the [[petrochemical industry]], 50 pS/m is the recommended minimum value of electrical conductivity for adequate removal of charge from a fluid.

An important concept for insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This is similar to the time constant (tau) within an [[RC circuit]]. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static [[dielectric constant]] divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/cm (100 pS/m) will have an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge within a fluid will be almost completely dissipated after 4 to 5 times the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.

Charge generation increases at higher fluid velocities and larger pipe diameters, becoming quite significant in pipes {{convert|8|in|mm}} or larger. Static charge generation in these systems is best controlled by limiting fluid velocity. The British standard BS PD CLC/TR 50404:2003 (formerly BS-5958-Part 2) Code of Practice for Control of Undesirable Static Electricity prescribes velocity limits. Because of its large impact on dielectric constant, the recommended velocity for hydrocarbon fluids containing water should be limited to 1&amp;nbsp;m/s.

Bonding and earthing are the usual ways by which charge buildup can be prevented. For fluids with electrical conductivity below 10 pS/m, bonding and earthing are not adequate for charge dissipation, and anti-static additives may be required.

==Electrostatic induction in commercial applications==
Electrostatic induction was used in the past to build high-voltage generators known as [[Influence machine]]s.
The main component that emerged in these times is the [[capacitor]]. 
Electrostatic induction is also used for electro-mechanic precipitation or projection.In such technologies, charged particles of small sizes are collected or deposited intentionally on surfaces. Applications range from [[Electrostatic precipitator]] to [[Spray painting]] or [[Inkjet printing]].
Recently a new [[Wireless power]] Transfer Technology has been based on electrostatic induction between oscillating distant dipoles.

[[Image:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|thumb|right|'''Thermal motion''' of an [[alpha helix|α-helical]] [[peptide]]. The jittery motion is random and complex, and the energy of any particular atom can fluctuate wildly. Nevertheless, the equipartition theorem allows the ''average'' [[kinetic energy]] of each atom to be computed, as well as the average potential energies of many vibrational modes. The grey, red and blue spheres represent [[atom]]s of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]], respectively; the smaller white spheres represent atoms of [[hydrogen]].]]

In [[classical physics|classical]] [[statistical mechanics]], the '''equipartition theorem''' relates the [[temperature]] of a system to its average [[energy|energies]]. The equipartition theorem is also known as the '''law of equipartition''', '''equipartition of energy''', or simply '''equipartition'''. The original idea of equipartition was that, in [[thermal equilibrium]], energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average [[kinetic energy]] per [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] in [[translation (physics)|translational motion]] of a molecule should equal that in [[rotational motion]].

The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions. Like the [[virial theorem]], it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's [[heat capacity]] can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single [[spring (device)|spring]]. For example, it predicts that every atom in a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]] has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|(thermodynamic) temperature]]. More generally, equipartition can be applied to any [[classical physics|classical system]] in [[thermal equilibrium]], no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]], and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids. The equipartition theorem can also be used to predict the properties of [[star]]s, even [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s, since it holds even when [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are considered.

Although the equipartition theorem makes accurate predictions in certain conditions, it is inaccurate when [[quantum physics|quantum effects]] are significant, such as at low temperatures.  When the [[thermal energy]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]], the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be "frozen out" when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model [[black-body radiation]]—also known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]—led [[Max Planck]] to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].

==Basic concept and simple examples==
{{See also|Kinetic energy|Heat capacity}}

[[File:MaxwellBoltzmann-en.svg|right|thumb|440px|Figure 2. Probability density functions of the molecular speed for four [[noble gas]]es at a [[temperature]] of 298.15 [[Kelvin|K]] (25 [[Celsius|°C]]). The four gases are [[helium]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), [[neon]] (&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne), [[argon]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar) and [[xenon]] (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Xe); the superscripts indicate their [[mass number]]s. These probability density functions have [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of probability times inverse speed; since probability is dimensionless, they can be expressed in units of seconds per meter.]]

The name "equipartition" means "equal division," as derived from the [[Latin]] ''equi'' from the antecedent, æquus ("equal or even"), and partition from the noun, ''partitio'' ("division, portion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=equi&amp;searchmode=none|title=equi-|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Partition&amp;searchmode=none|title=partition|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept of equipartition was that the total [[kinetic energy]] of a system is shared equally among all of its independent parts, ''on the average'', once the system has reached thermal equilibrium. Equipartition also makes quantitative predictions for these energies. For example, it predicts that every atom of an inert [[noble gas]], in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'', has an average translational kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. As a consequence, since kinetic energy is equal to 1/2(mass)(velocity)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the heavier atoms of [[xenon]] have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of [[helium]] at the same temperature. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 shows the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] for the speeds of the atoms in four noble gases.

In this example, the key point is that the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and therefore contributes {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This has many applications.

===Translational energy and ideal gases===
{{See also|Ideal gas}}

The (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass ''m'', velocity '''v''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \tfrac12 m |\mathbf{v}|^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left( v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Cartesian components of the velocity '''v'''. Here, ''H'' is short for [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]] plays a central role in the most [[#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|general form]] of the equipartition theorem.

Since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', as in the example of noble gases above.

More generally, in an ideal gas, the total energy consists purely of (translational) kinetic energy: by assumption, the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another. Equipartition therefore predicts that the average total energy of an ideal gas of ''N'' particles is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''T''.

It follows that the [[heat capacity]] of the gas is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of such gas particles is (3/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (3/2)''R'', where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] and ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. Since ''R'' ≈ 2 [[calorie|cal]]/([[mole (unit)|mol]]·[[Kelvin|K]]), equipartition predicts that the [[molar heat capacity]] of an ideal gas is roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment.&lt;ref name="kundt_1876" /&gt;

The mean kinetic energy also allows the [[root mean square speed]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; of the gas particles to be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\langle v^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 R T}{M}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''m'' is the mass of a mole of gas particles. This result is useful for many applications such as [[Graham's law]] of [[effusion]], which provides a method for [[enriched uranium|enriching]] [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/enrichment.html Fact Sheet on Uranium Enrichment] U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotational energy and molecular tumbling in solution===
{{See also|Angular velocity|Rotational diffusion}}

A similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with [[principal moments of inertia]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The rotational energy of such a molecule is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{rot}} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( I_{1} \omega_{1}^{2} + I_{2} \omega_{2}^{2} + I_{3} \omega_{3}^{2} ),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the principal components of the [[angular velocity]]. By exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case, equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Similarly, the equipartition theorem allows the average (more precisely, the root mean square) angular speed of the molecules to be calculated.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;

The tumbling of rigid molecules—that is, the random rotations of molecules in solution—plays a key role in the [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]]s observed by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], particularly [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]] and [[residual dipolar coupling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Cavanagh, J; Fairbrother WJ, Palmer AG III, Skelton NJ, Rance M | year = 2006 | title = Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice | edition = 2nd | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-164491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as [[fluorescence anisotropy]], [[flow birefringence]] and [[dielectric spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cantor | first = CR |author2=Schimmel PR | year = 1980 | title = Biophysical Chemistry. Part II. Techniques for the study of biological structure and function | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-1189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential energy and harmonic oscillators===
Equipartition applies to [[potential energy|potential energies]] as well as kinetic energies: important examples include [[harmonic oscillator]]s such as a [[spring (device)|spring]], which has a quadratic potential energy

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{pot}} = \tfrac 12 a q^2,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' describes the stiffness of the spring and ''q'' is the deviation from equilibrium. If such a one-dimensional system has mass ''m'', then its kinetic energy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt; is
&lt;!-- {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m'', --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;= ''mv'' denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator. Combining these terms yields the total energy&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H = H_{\text{kin}} + H_{\text{pot}} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} a q^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

Equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium, the oscillator has average energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = 
\langle H_{\text{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\text{pot}} \rangle = 
\tfrac{1}{2} k_B T + \tfrac{1}{2} k_B T = k_B T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the angular brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the average of the enclosed quantity,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

This result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator, such as a [[pendulum]], a vibrating molecule or a passive [[electronic oscillator]]. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and hence contributes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This can be used to derive the formula for [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Mandl | first = F | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 213–219 | isbn = 0-471-56658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.

[[Image:Vätskefas.png|frame|left|Figure 3. Atoms in a crystal can vibrate about their equilibrium positions in the [[crystal structure|lattice]]. Such vibrations account largely for the [[heat capacity]] of crystalline [[dielectric]]s; with [[metal]]s, [[electron]]s also contribute to the heat capacity.]]

===Specific heat capacity of solids===
::''For more details on the molar specific heat capacities of [[solid]]s, see [[Einstein solid]] and [[Debye model]].''

An important application of the equipartition theorem is to the specific heat capacity of a crystalline solid. Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid can be viewed as a system of 3''N'' independent [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s, where ''N'' denotes the number of atoms in the lattice. Since each harmonic oscillator has average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average total energy of the solid is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', and its heat capacity is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

By taking ''N'' to be the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and using the relation ''R''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; between the [[gas constant]] ''R'' and the Boltzmann constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, this provides an explanation for the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids, which stated that the specific heat capacity (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its [[atomic weight]]. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is ''3R''&amp;nbsp;≈ 6&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

However, this law is inaccurate at lower temperatures, due to quantum effects; it is also inconsistent with the experimentally derived [[third law of thermodynamics]], according to which the molar heat capacity of any substance must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero.&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" /&gt; A more accurate theory, incorporating quantum effects, was developed by [[Albert Einstein]] (1907) and [[Peter Debye]] (1911).&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

Many other physical systems can be modeled as sets of [[oscillation#Coupled oscillations|coupled oscillators]]. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into [[normal mode]]s, like the vibrational modes of a [[piano string]] or the [[resonance]]s of an [[organ pipe]]. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, because there is no exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called ''ergodicity'', is important for the law of equipartition to hold.

===Sedimentation of particles===
{{See also|Sedimentation|Mason&amp;ndash;Weaver equation|Brewing}}

Potential energies are not always quadratic in the position. However, the equipartition theorem also shows that if a degree of freedom ''x'' contributes only a multiple of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (for a fixed real number ''s'') to the energy, then in thermal equilibrium the average energy of that part is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s''.

There is a simple application of this extension to the [[sedimentation]] of particles under [[gravitation|gravity]].&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" /&gt; For example, the haze sometimes seen in [[beer]] can be caused by clumps of [[protein]]s that [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter]] light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miedl M, Garcia M, Bamforth C |title=Haze formation in model beer systems |journal=J. Agric. Food Chem. |volume=53 |issue=26 |pages=10161–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16366710 |doi=10.1021/jf0506941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity, causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top. However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also [[diffusion|diffuse]] back up towards the top of the bottle. Once equilibrium has been reached, the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of [[buoyant mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. For an infinitely tall bottle of beer, the gravitational [[potential energy]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H^{\mathrm{grav}} = m_{\rm b} g z\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the height of the protein clump in the bottle and ''[[Earth's gravity|g]]'' is the [[acceleration]] due to gravity. Since ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 1, the average potential energy of a protein clump equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Hence, a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10&amp;nbsp;[[Dalton (unit)|MDa]] (roughly the size of a [[virus]]) would produce a haze with an average height of about 2&amp;nbsp;cm at equilibrium. The process of such sedimentation to equilibrium is described by the [[Mason–Weaver equation]].&lt;ref name="mason_1924" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Mason | first = M |author2=Weaver W | year = 1924 | title = The Settling of Small Particles in a Fluid | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 412–426 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.23.412|bibcode = 1924PhRv...23..412M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
::''This article uses the non-[[International System of Units|SI]] unit of ''[[calorie|cal]]/([[mole (unit)|mol]]·[[Kelvin|K]])'' for heat capacity, because it offers greater accuracy for single digits.&lt;br /&gt;For an approximate conversion to the corresponding SI unit of ''J/(mol·K)'', such values should be multiplied by 4.2''&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|J]]/cal.

The equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843, and more correctly in 1845, by [[John James Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 1 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 134–159 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 2 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 336–339 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waterston | first = JJ | authorlink = John James Waterston | year = 1846 | title = On the physics of media that are composed of free and elastic molecules in a state of motion | journal = Proc.

Waterston's key paper was written and submitted in 1845 to the [[Royal Society]]. After refusing to publish his work, the Society also refused to return his manuscript and stored it among its files. The manuscript was discovered in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], who criticized the original reviewer for failing to recognize the significance of Waterston's work. Waterston managed to publish his ideas in 1851, and therefore has priority over Maxwell for enunciating the first version of the equipartition theorem.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxwell | first = JC | authorlink = James Clerk Maxwell | year = 2003 | chapter = Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gases | title = The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell | editor = WD Niven | pages = Vol.1, pp. 377–409 | publisher = Dover | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-486-49560-6 | nopp = true}} Read by Prof. Maxwell at a Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen on 21 September 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1871 | title = Einige allgemeine Sätze über Wärmegleichgewicht (Some general statements on thermal equilibrium) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 63 | pages = 679–711|language=de}} In this preliminary work, Boltzmann showed that the average total kinetic energy equals the average total potential energy when a system is acted upon by external harmonic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1876 | title = Über die Natur der Gasmoleküle (On the nature of gas molecules) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 74 | pages = 553–560|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat|specific heat capacities]] of solids.

[[Image:DiatomicSpecHeat1.png|thumb|450px|right|Figure 4. Idealized plot of the [[specific heat capacity|molar specific heat]] of a diatomic gas against temperature. It agrees with the value (7/2)''R'' predicted by equipartition at high temperatures (where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]), but decreases to (5/2)''R'' and then (3/2)''R'' at lower temperatures, as the vibrational and rotational modes of motion are "frozen out". The failure of the equipartition theorem led to a paradox that was only resolved by [[quantum mechanics]]. For most molecules, the transitional temperature T&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; is much less than room temperature, whereas ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be ten times larger or more. A typical example is [[carbon monoxide]], CO, for which ''T''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 3103&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. For molecules with very large or weakly bound atoms, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be close to room temperature (about 300&amp;nbsp;K); for example, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 308&amp;nbsp;K for [[iodine]] gas, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" /&gt;]]

The history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of [[specific heat capacity]], both of which were studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit]] discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petit | first = AT | authorlink = Alexis Thérèse Petit |author2=Dulong PL |authorlink2=Pierre Louis Dulong  | year = 1819 | title = Recherches sur quelques points importants de la théorie de la chaleur (Studies on key points in the theory of heat) | url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PETIT.html | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 10 | pages = 395–413|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights.&lt;ref name="pais_1982" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1982 | title = Subtle is the Lord | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-853907-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies by [[James Dewar]] and [[Heinrich Friedrich Weber]] showed that this [[Dulong–Petit law]] holds only at high [[temperature]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dewar | first = J | authorlink = James Dewar | year = 1872 | title = The Specific Heat of Carbon at High Temperatures | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 44 | pages = 461}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1872 | title = Die specifische Wärme des Kohlenstoffs (The specific heat of carbon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 147 | pages = 311–319 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152316|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.18722231007|bibcode = 1872AnP...223..311W }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1875 | title = Die specifische Wärmen der Elemente Kohlenstoff, Bor und Silicium (The specific heats of elemental carbon, boron, and silicon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 154 | pages = 367–423, 553–582 |doi=10.1002/andp.18752300307 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15238m|language=de|bibcode = 1875AnP...230..367W }}&lt;/ref&gt; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as [[diamond]], the specific heat capacity was lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = de la Rive | first = A |author2=Marcet F | year = 1840 | title = Quelques recherches sur la chaleur spécifique (Some research on specific heat) | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | volume = 75 | pages = 113–144 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBwAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA3 | publisher = Masson.|language=fr}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Regnault | first = HV | authorlink = Henri Victor Regnault | year = 1841 | title = Recherches sur la chaleur spécifique des corps simples et des corps composés (deuxième Mémoire) (Studies of the specific heats of simple and composite bodies) | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 1 | series = (3me Série)| pages = 129–207 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34742d|language=fr}} Read at l'Académie des Sciences on 11 January 1841.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wigand | first = A | year = 1907 | title = Über Temperaturabhängigkeit der spezifischen Wärme fester Elemente (On the temperature dependence of the specific heats of solids) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 22 | pages = 99–106|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.19063270105 |bibcode = 1906AnP...327...99W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental observations of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns about the validity of the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

Several explanations of equipartition's failure to account for molar heat capacities were proposed.

==General formulation of the equipartition theorem==
{{See also|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics|Microcanonical ensemble|Canonical ensemble}}

The most general form of the equipartition theorem states that under suitable assumptions (discussed below), for a physical system with [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] energy function ''H'' and degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the following equipartition formula holds in thermal equilibrium for all indices ''m'' and ''n'':&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1918 | title = A General Theory of Energy Partition with Applications to Quantum Theory | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–275 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.11.261|bibcode = 1918PhRv...11..261T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''δ&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], which is equal to one if ''m''&amp;nbsp;= ''n'' and is zero otherwise. The averaging brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be an [[ensemble average]] over phase space or, under an assumption of [[ergodic]]ity, a time average of a single system.

The general equipartition theorem holds in both the [[microcanonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="huang_1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Huang | first = K | authorlink = Kerson Huang | year = 1987 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = 2nd | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 136–138 | isbn = 0-471-81518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the total energy of the system is constant, and also in the [[canonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pathria | first = RK | year = 1972 | title = Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Pergamon Press | pages = 43–48, 73–74 | isbn = 0-08-016747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1938 | title = The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | pages = 93–98 | isbn = 0-486-63896-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the system is coupled to a [[heat bath]] with which it can exchange energy. Derivations of the general formula are given [[#Derivations|later in the article]].

The general formula is equivalent to the following two:
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{B} T \quad \mbox{for all } n&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{for all } m \neq n.&lt;/math&gt;

If a degree of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' appears only as a quadratic term ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Hamiltonian ''H'', then the first of these formulae implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}}\Bigr\rangle = 2\langle a_n x_n^2 \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy &lt;math&gt;\langle H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula. A similar argument, with 2 replaced by ''s'', applies to energies of the form ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n''&lt;/sub&gt; are coordinates on the [[phase space]] of the system and are therefore commonly subdivided into [[canonical coordinates|generalized position]] coordinates ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[generalized momentum]] coordinates ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[conjugate momentum]] to ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this situation, formula 1 means that for all ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle =  \Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equations of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]],&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" &gt;{{cite book | last = Goldstein |first = H | authorlink = Herbert Goldstein | year = 1980 | title = Classical Mechanics | edition = 2nd. | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-201-02918-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; these formulae may also be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can show using formula 2 that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 
\quad \mbox{ for all } \, j,k
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{ for all } \, j \neq k.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to the virial theorem===
{{See also|Virial theorem|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics}}

The general equipartition theorem is an extension of the [[virial theorem]] (proposed in 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = R | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = Ueber einen auf die Wärme anwendbaren mechanischen Satz | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 141 | pages = 124–130 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152258 | doi=10.1002/andp.18702170911|language=de|bibcode = 1870AnP...217..124C }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = RJE | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=Series 4 | volume = 40 | pages = 122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which states that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' denotes [[time]].&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt; Two key differences are that the virial theorem relates ''summed'' rather than ''individual'' averages to each other, and it does not connect them to the [[temperature]] ''T''. Another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over [[phase space]].

==Applications==

===Ideal gas law===
{{See also|Ideal gas|Ideal gas law}}

[[Ideal gas]]es provide an important application of the equipartition theorem. As well as providing the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H^{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{2m} \langle p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2} \rangle\\
&amp;=  \frac{1}{2} \biggl(
\Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle +
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle \biggr) = 
\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for the average kinetic energy per particle, the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]] from classical mechanics.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; If '''q''' = (''q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') and '''p''' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and
'''F''' is the net force on that particle, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{F} \rangle &amp;= \Bigl\langle q_x \frac{dp_x}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{dp_y}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{dp_z}{dt} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;=-\Bigl\langle q_x \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_x} \Bigr\rangle -
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_y} \Bigr\rangle - 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_z} \Bigr\rangle = -3k_B T,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the first equality is [[Newton's second law]], and the second line uses [[Hamilton's equations]] and the equipartition formula. Summing over a system of ''N'' particles yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = - \biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|frame|right|Figure 5. The kinetic energy of a particular molecule can [[thermal fluctuations|fluctuate wildly]], but the equipartition theorem allows its ''average'' energy to be calculated at any temperature. Equipartition also provides a derivation of the [[ideal gas law]], an equation that relates the [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[temperature]] of the gas. (In this diagram five of the molecules have been colored red to track their motion; this coloration has no other significance.)]]

By [[Newton's third law]] and the ideal gas assumption, the net force on the system is the force applied by the walls of their container, and this force is given by the pressure ''P'' of the gas. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;
-\biggl\langle\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k}\biggr\rangle = P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''d''S''''' is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the [[divergence]] of the position vector '''q''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} =
\frac{\partial q_{x}}{\partial q_{x}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{y}}{\partial q_{y}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{z}}{\partial q_{z}} = 3,
&lt;/math&gt;

the [[divergence theorem]] implies that

:&lt;math&gt;
P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS} = P \int_{\mathrm{volume}} \left( \boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} \right) \, dV = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''V'' is an infinitesimal volume within the container and ''V'' is the total volume of the container.

Putting these equalities together yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = -\biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

which immediately implies the [[ideal gas law]] for ''N'' particles:

:&lt;math&gt;
PV = Nk_{B} T = nRT,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of moles of gas and ''R''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[gas constant]]. Although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal-gas law and the internal energy, the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].&lt;ref name="configint"&gt;

===Diatomic gases===
{{See also|Two-body problem|Rigid rotor|Harmonic oscillator}}

A diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, joined by a [[spring (device)|spring]] of [[Hooke's law|stiffness]] ''a'', which is called the ''rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 91–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical energy of this system is

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{1} \right|^{2}}{2m_{1}} + 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{2} \right|^{2}}{2m_{2}} + 
\frac{1}{2} a q^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the momenta of the two atoms, and ''q'' is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value. Every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and, thus, should contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the total average energy, and {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the heat capacity. Therefore, the heat capacity of a gas of ''N'' diatomic molecules is predicted to be 7''N''·{{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;: the momenta '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contribute three degrees of freedom each, and the extension ''q'' contributes the seventh. It follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be (7/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (7/2)''R'' and, thus, the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K)&lt;ref name="Wueller_1896" /&gt; and fall to 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Eucken_1912" /&gt; This disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule, since adding more degrees of freedom can only ''increase'' the predicted specific heat, not decrease it.&lt;ref name="maxwell_1875" /&gt; This discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of matter.

[[Image:Chandra-crab.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Figure 6. A combined X-ray and optical image of the [[Crab Nebula]]. At the heart of this nebula there is a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]] which has about one and a half times the mass of the [[Sun]] but is only 25 km across. The equipartition theorem is useful in predicting the properties of such neutron stars.]]

===Extreme relativistic ideal gases===
{{See also|Special relativity|White dwarf|Neutron star}}

Equipartition was used above to derive the classical [[ideal gas law]] from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. However, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become dominant in some systems, such as [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and the ideal gas equations must be modified. The equipartition theorem provides a convenient way to derive the corresponding laws for an extreme relativistic [[ideal gas]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; In such cases, the kinetic energy of a [[relativistic particle|single particle]] is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{kin}} \approx cp = c \sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the derivative of ''H'' with respect to the ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' momentum component gives the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
p_x \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_x}  = c \frac{p_x^2}{\sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' components. Adding the three components together gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle
&amp;= \biggl\langle c \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}{\sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}}  \biggr\rangle\\
&amp;= \Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;= 3 k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality follows from the equipartition formula. Thus, the average total energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case: for ''N'' particles, it is 3&amp;nbsp;''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.

===Non-ideal gases===
{{See also|Virial expansion|Virial coefficient}}

In an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions. The equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of "non-ideal gases" in which the particles also interact with one another through [[conservative force]]s whose potential ''U''(''r'') depends only on the distance ''r'' between the particles.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] distribution. It is then customary to introduce a [[radial distribution function]] ''g''(''r'') such that the [[probability density function|probability density]] of finding another particle at a distance ''r'' from the given particle is equal to 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ρg''(''r''), where ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/''V'' is the mean [[density]] of the gas.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000b" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 254–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty} 4\pi r^{2} \rho U(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore &lt;math&gt; \langle H_{pot} \rangle = \tfrac12 N \langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor {{frac|1|2}} is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice.
Adding kinetic and potential energies, then applying equipartition, yields the ''energy equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = 
\frac{3}{2} Nk_{B}T + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{2} U(r) g(r) \, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar argument,&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; can be used to derive the ''pressure equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{\rm B}T = 3PV + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{3} U'(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Anharmonic oscillators===
{{See also|Anharmonic oscillator}}

An anharmonic oscillator (in contrast to a simple harmonic oscillator) is one in which the potential energy is not quadratic in the extension ''q'' (the [[canonical coordinate|generalized position]] which measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium). Such oscillators provide a complementary point of view on the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1927 | title = Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Physics and Chemistry | publisher = Chemical Catalog Company | pages = 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terletskii_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Terletskii | first = YP | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | edition = translated: N. Fröman | publisher = North-Holland | location = Amsterdam | isbn = 0-7204-0221-2 | pages = 83–84 | lccn = 70157006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples are provided by potential energy functions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = C q^{s},\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' and ''s'' are arbitrary [[real number|real constants]]. In these cases, the law of equipartition predicts that

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{\rm B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\langle q \cdot s C q^{s-1} \rangle = \langle s C q^{s} \rangle = s \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the average potential energy equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s'', not ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/2 as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 2).

More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a [[Taylor expansion]] in the extension ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} C_{n} q^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative [[integer]]s ''n''. There is no ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 1 term, because at the equilibrium point, there is no net force and so the first derivative of the energy is zero. The ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 0 term need not be included, since the energy at the equilibrium position may be set to zero by convention. In this case, the law of equipartition predicts that&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \langle q \cdot n C_{n} q^{n-1} \rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T - 
\sum_{n=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{n - 2}{2} \right) C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
does ''not'' allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.

===Brownian motion===
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 7. Typical Brownian motion of a particle in three dimensions.]]
{{See also|Brownian motion}}

The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[Brownian motion]] of a particle from the [[Langevin equation]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass ''m'' with velocity '''v''' is governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\tau} + \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{rnd}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the [[time constant]] τ reflects the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] that opposes the particle's motion through the solution. The drag force is often written '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;drag&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −γ'''v'''; therefore, the time constant τ equals ''m''/γ.

The dot product of this equation with the position vector '''r''', after averaging, yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\frac{1}{\tau} \langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

for Brownian motion (since the random force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is uncorrelated with the position '''r'''). Using the mathematical identities

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\frac{d}{dt} \left( r^{2} \right) = 2 \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right) = v^{2} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}} \langle r^{2} \rangle + \frac{1}{\tau} \frac{d}{dt} \langle r^{2} \rangle = 
2 \langle v^{2} \rangle = \frac{6}{m} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = \Bigl\langle \frac{p^{2}}{2m} \Bigr\rangle = \langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

The above [[differential equation]] for &lt;math&gt;\langle r^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle = \frac{6k_{\rm B} T \tau^{2}}{m} \left( e^{-t/\tau} - 1 + \frac{t}{\tau} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

On small time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''τ'', the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the [[Taylor series]] of the [[exponential function]], the squared distance grows approximately ''quadratically'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{3k_{\rm B} T}{m} t^{2} = \langle v^{2} \rangle t^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

However, on long time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''τ'', the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only ''linearly'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{6k_{B} T\tau}{m} t = \frac{6 k_{B} T t}{\gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This describes the [[diffusion]] of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.

===Stellar physics===
{{See also|Astrophysics|Stellar structure}}

The equipartition theorem and the related [[virial theorem]] have long been used as a tool in [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = GW | year = 1978 | title = The Virial Theorem in Stellar Astrophysics  | url = http://ads.harvard.edu/books/1978vtsa.book/ | publisher = Pachart Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, the virial theorem may be used to estimate stellar temperatures or the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] on the mass of [[white dwarf]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandrasekhar | first = S | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | year = 1939 | title = An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | pages = 49–53 | isbn = 0-486-60413-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kourganoff | first = V | year = 1980 | title = Introduction to Advanced Astrophysics | publisher = D. Reidel | location = Dordrecht, Holland | pages = 59–60, 134–140, 181–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature of a star can be estimated from the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chiu | first = H-Y | year = 1968 | title = Stellar Physics, volume I | publisher = Blaisdell Publishing | location = Waltham, MA | lccn = 67017990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most stars are spherically symmetric, the total [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational]] [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|potential energy]] can be estimated by integration

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = -\int_0^R \frac{4\pi r^2 G}{r} M(r)\, \rho(r)\, dr,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''(''r'') is the mass within a radius ''r'' and ''ρ''(''r'') is the stellar density at radius ''r''; ''G'' represents the [[gravitational constant]] and ''R'' the total radius of the star. Assuming a constant density throughout the star, this integration yields the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5R},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the star's total mass. Hence, the average potential energy of a single particle is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = \frac{H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{N} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5RN},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of particles in the star. Since most [[star]]s are composed mainly of [[ion]]ized [[hydrogen]], ''N'' equals roughly ''M''/''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of one proton. Application of the equipartition theorem gives an estimate of the star's temperature

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle r \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{\partial r} \Bigr\rangle = \langle -H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = 
k_B T = \frac{3G M^2}{5RN}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the mass and radius of the [[Sun]] yields an estimated solar temperature of ''T''&amp;nbsp;= 14 million kelvins, very close to its core temperature of 15 million kelvins. However, the Sun is much more complex than assumed by this model—both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius—and such excellent agreement (≈7% [[approximation error|relative error]]) is partly fortuitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noyes | first = RW | year = 1982 | title = The Sun, Our Star | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-85435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star formation===
The same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for [[star formation]] in giant [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ostlie | first = DA |author2=Carroll BW | year = 1996 | title = An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics | publisher = Addison–Wesley | location = Reading, MA | isbn = 0-201-59880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity. Such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem—or, equivalently, the [[virial theorem]]—is no longer valid, i.e., when the gravitational potential energy exceeds twice the kinetic energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3G M^{2}}{5R} &gt; 3 N k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a constant density ρ for the cloud

:&lt;math&gt;
M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^{3} \rho
&lt;/math&gt;

yields a minimum mass for stellar contraction, the Jeans mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M_{\rm J}^{2} = \left( \frac{5k_{B}T}{G m_{p}} \right)^{3} \left( \frac{3}{4\pi \rho} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the values typically observed in such clouds (''T''&amp;nbsp;= 150&amp;nbsp;K, ρ&amp;nbsp;= 2{{e|&amp;minus;16}}&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) gives an estimated minimum mass of 17 solar masses, which is consistent with observed star formation. This effect is also known as the [[Jeans instability]], after the British physicist [[James Hopwood Jeans]] who published it in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jeans | first = JH | authorlink = James Hopwood Jeans | year = 1902 | title = The Stability of a Spherical Nebula | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 199 | issue = 312–320 | pages = 1–53 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1902.0012 | bibcode=1902RSPTA.199....1J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivations==

===Kinetic energies and the Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution===
The original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that, in any physical system in [[thermal equilibrium]], every particle has exactly the same average [[kinetic energy]], (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be shown using the [[Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution]] (see Figure 2), which is the probability distribution

:&lt;math&gt;
f (v) = 4 \pi 
\left( \frac{m}{2 \pi k_{\rm B} T}\right)^{3/2}\!\!v^2
\exp \Bigl(
\frac{-mv^2}{2k_{\rm B} T}
\Bigr)
&lt;/math&gt;

for the speed of a particle of mass ''m'' in the system, where the speed ''v'' is the magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (v_x,v_y,v_z).&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies to any system composed of atoms, and assumes only a [[canonical ensemble]], specifically, that the kinetic energies are distributed according to their [[Boltzmann factor]] at a temperature ''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" /&gt; The average kinetic energy for a particle of mass ''m'' is then given by the integral formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = 
\langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = 
\int _{0}^{\infty} \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}\  f(v)\  dv = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem. The same result can also be obtained by averaging the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state.&lt;ref name="configint"/&gt;

===Quadratic energies and the partition function===
More generally, the equipartition theorem states that any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] ''x'' which appears in the total energy ''H'' only as a simple quadratic term ''Ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''A'' is a constant, has an average energy of ½''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium. In this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] ''Z''(''β''), where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/(''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') is the canonical [[inverse temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Callen | first = HB | authorlink = Herbert Callen | year = 1985 | title = Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 375–377 | isbn = 0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration over the variable ''x'' yields a factor

:&lt;math&gt;
Z_{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \ e^{-\beta A x^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\beta A}},
&lt;/math&gt;

in the formula for ''Z''. The mean energy associated with this factor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{x} \rangle = - \frac{\partial \log Z_{x}}{\partial \beta} = \frac{1}{2\beta} = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem.

===General proofs===
General derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many [[statistical mechanics]] textbooks, both for the [[microcanonical ensemble]]&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and for the [[canonical ensemble]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt;
They involve taking averages over the [[phase space]] of the system, which is a [[symplectic manifold]].

To explain these derivations, the following notation is introduced. First, the phase space is described in terms of [[canonical coordinates|generalized position coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; together with their [[conjugate momentum|conjugate momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The quantities ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; completely describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system, while the quantities (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) together completely describe its [[Classical mechanics|state]].

Secondly, the infinitesimal volume
:&lt;math&gt;
d\Gamma = \prod_i  dq_i \, dp_i \,
&lt;/math&gt;

of the phase space is introduced and used to define the volume Σ(''E'', Δ''E'') of the portion of phase space where the energy ''H'' of the system lies between two limits, ''E'' and ''E''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma (E, \Delta E) = \int_{H \in \left[E, E+\Delta E \right]} d\Gamma .
&lt;/math&gt;
In this expression, Δ''E'' is assumed to be very small, Δ''E''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''E''. Similarly, Ω(''E'') is defined to be the total volume of phase space where the energy is less than ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega (E) = \int_{H &lt; E} d\Gamma.\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Since Δ''E'' is very small, the following integrations are equivalent

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]} \ldots d\Gamma  = \Delta E \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E} \ldots d\Gamma,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ellipses represent the integrand. From this, it follows that Γ is proportional to Δ''E''

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma = \Delta E \ \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} = \Delta E \ \rho(E),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''(''E'') is the [[density of states]]. By the usual definitions of [[statistical mechanics]], the [[entropy]] ''S'' equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; log ''Ω''(''E''), and the [[temperature]] ''T'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{\partial \log \Omega}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{1}{\Omega}\,\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} .
&lt;/math&gt;

====The canonical ensemble====
In the [[canonical ensemble]], the system is in [[thermal equilibrium]] with an infinite heat bath at [[temperature]] ''T'' (in kelvins).&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt; The probability of each state in [[phase space]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]] times a [[normalization factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is chosen so that the probabilities sum to one

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. [[Integration by parts]] for a phase-space variable ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') between two limits ''a'' and ''b'' yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int  \left[ e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \right]_{x_{k}=a}^{x_{k}=b} d\Gamma_{k}+ 
\mathcal{N} \int  e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \beta \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''Γ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;= d''Γ''/d''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e., the first integration is not carried out over ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first term is usually zero, either because ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is zero at the limits, or because the energy goes to infinity at those limits. In that case, the equipartition theorem for the canonical ensemble follows immediately

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \,d\Gamma = 
\Bigl\langle x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \frac{1}{\beta} = k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the averaging symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ensemble average]] taken over the [[canonical ensemble]].

====The microcanonical ensemble====
In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from the rest of the world, or at least very weakly coupled to it.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Hence, its total energy is effectively constant; to be definite, we say that the total energy ''H'' is confined between ''E'' and ''E''+d''E''. For a given energy ''E'' and spread d''E'', there is a region of [[phase space]] Σ in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of [[phase space]] is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble. Given these definitions, the equipartition average of phase-space variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr \rangle &amp;=
\frac{1}{\Sigma}   \, \int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;=\frac{\Delta E}{\Sigma}\, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\rho} \,\frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial \left( H - E \right)}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows because ''E'' is a constant that does not depend on ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. [[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields the relation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial ( H - E )}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma &amp;= 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}} \bigl( x_{m} ( H - E ) \bigr) \,d\Gamma - 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \delta_{mn} ( H - E ) d\Gamma\\
&amp;=  \delta_{mn} \int_{H &lt; E} ( E - H ) \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
since the first term on the right hand side of the first line is zero (it can be rewritten as an integral of ''H'' − ''E'' on the [[hypersurface]] where ''H'' = ''E'').

Substitution of this result into the previous equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \frac{1}{\rho} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}\left( E - H \right)\,d\Gamma  = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{1}{\rho}  \, \int_{H &lt; E} \,d\Gamma = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{\Omega}{\rho}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} &lt;/math&gt; the equipartition theorem follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{1}{\Omega} \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1}  = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{\partial \log \Omega} {\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1} = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have derived the [[#General_formulation_for_all_energies|general formulation of the equipartition theorem]]

&lt;div style="border:2px solid black; padding:3px; margin-left: 0em; width: 250px;
text-align:left"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

which was so useful in the [[#Applications|applications]] described above.

==Limitations==
[[Image:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|frame|right|Figure 9. Energy is ''not'' shared among the various [[normal modes]] in an isolated system of ideal coupled [[harmonic oscillator|oscillators]]; the energy in each mode is constant and independent of the energy in the other modes. Hence, the equipartition theorem does ''not'' hold for such a system in the [[microcanonical ensemble]] (when isolated), although it does hold in the [[canonical ensemble]] (when coupled to a heat bath). However, by adding a sufficiently strong nonlinear coupling between the modes, energy will be shared and equipartition holds in both ensembles.]]

===Requirement of ergodicity===
{{See also|Ergodicity|Chaos theory|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Solitons}}

The law of equipartition holds only for [[ergodic hypothesis|ergodic]] systems in [[thermal equilibrium]], which implies that all states with the same energy must be equally likely to be populated.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Consequently, it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external [[heat bath]] in the [[canonical ensemble]]. The number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be ergodic is small; a famous example is the [[dynamical billiards|hard-sphere system]] of [[Yakov G. Sinai|Yakov Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arnold | first = VI | authorlink = Vladimir Arnold |author2=Avez A | year = 1957 | title = Théorie ergodique des systèms dynamiques | publisher = Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  (English edition: Benjamin-Cummings, Reading, Mass. 1968)|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements for isolated systems to ensure [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]]—and, thus equipartition—have been studied, and provided motivation for the modern [[chaos theory]] of [[dynamical system]]s. A chaotic [[Hamiltonian system]] need not be ergodic, although that is usually a good assumption.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" /&gt;

A commonly cited counter-example where energy is ''not'' shared among its various forms and where equipartition does ''not'' hold in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" &gt;{{cite book | last = Reichl | first = LE | year = 1998 | title = A Modern Course in Statistical Physics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Wiley Interscience | isbn = 978-0-471-59520-5 | pages = 326–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the system is isolated from the rest of the world, the energy in each [[normal mode]] is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the [[energy]] function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.

Another way ergodicity can be broken is by the existence of nonlinear [[soliton]] symmetries. In 1953, [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]], [[John Pasta|Pasta]], [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]] conducted [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|computer simulations]] of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] led to the development of soliton mathematics.

===Failure due to quantum effects===
{{See also|Ultraviolet catastrophe|History of quantum mechanics|Identical particles}}

The law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'' is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], which is required in the [[#Derivations|derivations of the equipartition theorem above]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Historically, the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain [[specific heats]] and [[blackbody radiation]] were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

[[Image:Et fig2.png|left|thumb|400px|Figure 10. Log–log plot of the average energy of a quantum mechanical oscillator (shown in red) as a function of temperature. For comparison, the value predicted by the equipartition theorem is shown in black. At high temperatures, the two agree nearly perfectly, but at low temperatures when ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T &lt;&lt; hν'', the quantum mechanical value decreases much more rapidly. This resolves the problem of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]: for a given temperature, the energy in the high-frequency modes (where ''hν &gt;&gt; k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'') is almost zero.]]

To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case. Neglecting the irrelevant [[zero-point energy]] term, its quantum energy levels are given by ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= nhν'', where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''ν'' is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the oscillator, and ''n'' is an integer. The probability of a given energy level being populated in the [[canonical ensemble]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]]

:&lt;math&gt;
P(E_{n}) = \frac{e^{-n\beta h\nu}}{Z},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and the denominator ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], here a [[geometric series]]

:&lt;math&gt;
Z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-n\beta h\nu} = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Its average energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} E_{n} P(E_{n}) =
\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} nh\nu \ e^{-n\beta h\nu} = 
-\frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} = 
-\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the formula for ''Z'' gives the final result&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = h\nu \frac{e^{-\beta h\nu}}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

At high temperatures, when the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is much greater than the spacing ''hν'' between energy levels, the exponential argument ''βhν'' is much less than one and the average energy becomes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', in agreement with the equipartition theorem (Figure 10). However, at low temperatures, when ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average energy goes to zero—the higher-frequency energy levels are "frozen out" (Figure 10). As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' (roughly 0.025&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10&amp;nbsp;eV).

Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy. This reasoning was used by [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]], among others, to resolve the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] of [[blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | year = 1905 | title = Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt (A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 132&amp;ndash;148 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2094597 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |language=de}}. An [[s:A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light|English translation]] is available from [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the [[electromagnetic field]] in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayleigh | first = JWS | authorlink = John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh | year = 1900 | title = Remarks upon the Law of Complete Radiation | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 49 | pages = 539–540 | doi=10.1080/14786440009463878}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ''ν'' goes to infinity; moreover, [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;

Other, more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition, such as [[identical particles]] and [[symmetry|continuous symmetries]]. The effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures. For example, the [[valence electron]]s in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few [[electronvolt]]s, which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins. Such a state, in which the density is high enough that the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] invalidates the classical approach, is called a [[degenerate matter|degenerate fermion gas]]. Such gases are important for the structure of [[white dwarf]] and [[neutron star]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At low temperatures, a [[fermionic condensate|fermionic analogue]] of the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state) can form; such [[superfluid]] electrons are responsible{{dubious|date=May 2018}} for [[superconductivity]].

'''Experience''' is the [[knowledge]] or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.&lt;ref&gt;
Compare various contemporary definitions given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] (2nd edition, 1989): "[...] 3. The actual [[observation]] of facts or events, considered as a source of knowledge.[...]  4. a. The fact of being consciously the subject of a state or condition, or of being consciously affected by an event. [...]  b. In religious use: A state of mind or feeling forming part of the inner religious life; the mental history (of a person) with regard to religious emotion. [...]  6. What has been experienced; the events that have taken place within the knowledge of an individual, a community, mankind at large, either during a particular period or generally. [...]  7. a. Knowledge resulting from actual observation or from what one has undergone. [...] 8. The state of having been occupied in any department of study or practice, in affairs generally, or in the intercourse of life; the extent to which, or the length of time during which, one has been so occupied; the aptitudes, skill, judgement, etc. thereby acquired."
&lt;/ref&gt; Terms in [[philosophy]] such as "[[empirical knowledge]]" or "''a posteriori'' knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an [[expert]]. The concept of experience generally refers to [[know-how]] or [[procedural knowledge]], rather than [[propositional knowledge]]: [[on-the-job training]] rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. Experience plays an important role in the [[philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard]]. The [[German language|German]] term ''[[wiktionary:Erfahrung|Erfahrung]]'', often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, connoting the coherency of [[personal life|life]]'s experiences.

Certain [[religious]] [[traditions]] (such as [[Buddhism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]], [[mysticism]] and [[Pentecostalism]]) and educational [[paradigms]] with, for example, the [[physical exercise|conditioning]] of military [[recruit training|recruit-training]] (also known as "boot camps"), stress the experiential nature of human [[epistemology]]. This stands in contrast to alternatives: traditions of [[dogma]], [[logic]] or [[reason]]ing. Participants in activities such as [[tourism]], [[extreme sports]] and [[recreational drug use|recreational drug-use]] also tend to stress the importance of experience.

The history of the word ''experience'' aligns it closely with the concept of [[experiment]].

== Types of experience ==
The word "experience" may refer, somewhat ambiguously, both to [[mind|mentally]] unprocessed immediately perceived events as well as to the purported [[wisdom]] gained in subsequent reflection on those events or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

Some wisdom-experience accumulates over a period of [[time]],&lt;ref&gt;

though one can also experience (and gain general wisdom-experience from) a single specific momentary event.

One may also [[wikt:differentiate|differentiate]] between (for example) [[Human body|physical]], [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] and [[virtual reality|virtual]] experience(s).

=== Mental ===
{{Main|Mind}}

Mental experience involves the aspect of [[intellect]] and [[consciousness]] experienced as combinations of [[thought]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], [[free will|will]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and [[imagination]], including all unconscious [[cognitive]] processes. The term can refer, by implication, to a thought process. Mental experience and its relation to the physical brain form an area of philosophical debate: some identity theorists originally argued that the identity of brain and mental states held only for a few sensations. Most theorists, however, generalized the view to cover all mental experience.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Mathematicians]] can exemplify cumulative mental experience in the approaches and skills with which they work. [[Mathematical realism]], like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover and experience it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. This point of view regards only one sort of mathematics as discoverable; it sees triangles, right angles, and curves, for example, as real entities, not just the creations of the human mind. Some working mathematicians have espoused mathematical realism as they see themselves experiencing naturally occurring objects. Examples include [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (for example: for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but some conjectures, like the [[continuum hypothesis]], might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology such as experience could provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture. With experience, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

=== Emotional ===
{{Main|Emotion}}

Humans can rationalize [[falling in love|falling in (and out) of love]] as "emotional experience". Societies which lack institutional arranged marriages can call on emotional experience in individuals to influence [[mate selection|mate-selection]].&lt;ref&gt;

People can likewise achieve such experiences more deliberately through recognized [[mystical practice]]s such as [[sensory deprivation]] or [[mind control|mind-control]] techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], or [[mystical discipline]]s such as [[mantra meditation]], [[yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[dream yoga]], or [[surat shabd yoga|surat shabda yoga]]. Some practices encourage [[spiritual experience]]s through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drug]]s such as alcohol and opiates, but more commonly with [[entheogen]]ic plants and substances such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], ''[[salvia divinorum]]'', [[psilocybin]] mushrooms, [[peyote]], [[Dextromethorphan|DXM]], [[ayahuasca]], or ''[[datura]]''. Another way to induce spiritual experience through an altered state of consciousness involves [[psychoacoustics]], [[binaural beats]], or light-and-sound stimulation.

[[Role-playing game]]s treat "experience" (and its acquisition) as an important, measurable, and valuable commodity. Many [[role-playing video game]]s, for instance, feature units of measurement used to quantify or assist a player-character's progression through the game - called [[experience point]]s or XP.

=== Subjective ===

Subjective experience can involve a state of [[individual]] [[subjectivity]], [[perception]] on which one builds one's own state of [[reality]]; a reality based on one’s [[interaction]] with one's environment. The ''subjective'' ''experience'' depends on one’s [[individual]] ability to process [[data]], to store and [[internalize]] it. For example: our senses collect data, which we then process according to [[biological]] programming (genetics), [[neurological]] network-relationships and other variables such as [[Cultural relativity|relativity]] etc.,{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} all of which affect our individual experience of any given situation in such a way as to render it subjective.

== Immediacy of experience ==

Someone able to recount an event they witnessed or took part in has "[[wikt:firsthand|first hand]] experience". First hand experience of the "you had to be there" variety can seem especially valuable and privileged, but it often remains potentially subject to errors in [[sense]]-[[perception]] and in personal [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]].

[[Second hand|Second-hand]] experience can offer richer resources: recorded and/or summarised from first-hand observers or experiencers or from instruments, and potentially expressing multiple [[Perspective (cognitive)|points of view]].

Third-hand experience, based on indirect and possibly unreliable [[rumour]] or [[hearsay]], can (even given reliable accounts) potentially stray perilously close to blind honouring of [[authority]].

== Changes through history ==

Some [[post-modernism|post-modernist]]s suggest that the nature of human experiencing (quite apart from the details of the experienced surrounds) has undergone qualitative change during transition from the pre-modern through the [[modernity|modern]] to the [[post-modernity|post-modern]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Alternatives to experience ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] contrasted experience with [[reason]]:
:"Nothing, indeed, can be more harmful or more unworthy of the philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to so-called experience. Such experience would never have existed at all, if at the proper time, those institutions had been established in accordance with ideas."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

These views of Kant are mirrored in the research of [[ideasthesia]], which demonstrates that one can experience the world only if one has the appropriate concepts (i.e., the ''ideas'') about the objects that are being experienced.

=== Writing ===
American author [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote an essay entitled "[[Experience (Emerson)|Experience]]" (published in 1844), in which he asks readers to disregard [[emotion]]s that could alienate them from the divine; it provides a somewhat [[pessimism|pessimistic]] representation of the [[transcendentalism]] associated with Emerson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15888">'''The [[family]] as a model for the organization of the [[State (polity)|state]]''' is a theory of [[political philosophy]].  It either explains the structure of certain kinds of state in terms of the structure of the family (as a model or as a claim about the historical growth of the state), or it attempts to justify certain types of state by appeal to the structure of the family.  The first writer to use it (certainly in any clear and developed way) was [[Aristotle]], who argued that the natural progression of human beings was from the family via small communities to the [[polis]].

Many writers from ancient times to the present have seen parallels between the family and the forms of the state. In particular, [[Monarchy|monarchists]] have argued that the state mirrors the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] family, with the people obeying the [[Monarch|king]] as children obey their father.

==Ancient Greek thought==
The family&amp;ndash;state model was first expressed in ancient times, often as a form of justification for [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] rule.

[[Plutarch]] records a laconic saying of the [[Dorians]] attributed to [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]].  Asked why he didn't establish a democracy in the Lacedæmon, Lycurgus responded: “Begin, friend, and set it up in your family”. The Dorians of Crete and Sparta seemed to mirror the family institution and organization in their form of government. (see Plutarch's ''The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans'' &amp;mdash; Lycurgus, p.&amp;nbsp;65)

[[Aristotle]] often describes personal and domestic relationships in terms of different forms of government. He gives examples such as men and their domestic animals, wives, slaves, and children. He says, for example: “the government of a household is a monarchy, since every house is governed by a single ruler”.(2)  Later in the same text he says that husbands exercise a [[republic]]an government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general. (''Politics'' Bk I, §v, 1&amp;ndash;2; 1259a 35&amp;ndash;1259b 1)

However, while he is prepared to use political terms as metaphors for domestic relationships, he is equally clear that such metaphors are limited:
:“Some thinkers, however, suppose that statesman, king, estate manager, and master of a family have a common character.  This is a mistake; they think that the distinction between them is not a difference in kind, but a simple, numerical difference.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §i)&lt;!-- standardise translations, &amp; add full reference here and following --&gt;
After discussing the various domestic relationships, he concludes: “mastership and statesmanship are not identical, nor are all forms of power the same, as some thinkers suppose.” (''Politics'' Bk I, §vi)

Aristotle's main notion is that the ancient Greek ''polis'' or city-state is the natural end of human beings; they start in family groups, progress naturally to forming villages, and finally come together in cities.  Thus the family forms the root of human relationships, but the city is the flower.

[[Arius Didymus]] in Stobaeus, 1st century CE, writes: “A primary kind of association (politeia) is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life.”  From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, “&lt;nowiki&gt;[s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;o just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution (politeia)”. Further, he claims: “Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy.  The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic.” (''Hellenistic Commentary to the New Testament'', edd Boring, Berger, &amp; Colpe)

==Confucian thought==
{{main|Role ethics}}

[[Confucius]] believed the child should be subordinate to the parent, younger brother to the older, wife to husband, and subject to the sovereign who is to be regarded as the [[father of the nation]]. The state as the family writ large was the most harmonious, orderly, and natural form of government. This was later expanded to cover [[international relations]] (e.g. the [[emperor of China]] is treated as the older brother of the [[list of Korean monarchs|Korean king]]). Confucian family theory is still espoused in [[North Korea]] to justify their method of leadership succession.

The concept of family is important in classical [[Confucianism]]. For Confucius, ''xiào'' or [[filial piety]] was a ''[[De (Chinese)|dé]]'' or [[virtue]]. The character representing ''xiào'', 孝, itself represents a basic family structure, with the upper component representing elders (''lao'', old), and the lower representing children (''zi'', son). Those acting with filial piety, such as through the performances of ''[[Li (Confucian)|lĭ]]'' were therefore acting in accordance with ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' (righteousness, or fulfilling one's proper roles or acting in harmony with one's station). The relationship of this concept to the state is discussed at length in the ''Xiàojīng'', or [[Classic of Filial Piety]]. In politics, ''xiào'' is not simply loyalty on the part of subordinates and citizens, but also an expectation for the king to provide for his subjects with "paternal love"; just as the people were expected to act with respect for the king's law, the king was expected to make those laws out of kindness for the people.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius.

American [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|diplomat Edmund Roberts]] in his description of [[Guangzhou|Canton City]], which he visited in 1832, included a quote on this, for which he gives no source, but which was subsequently include in latter 18th-century publications, again without a source:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sovereign of men, say they, "is heaven's son; nobles and statesmen are the sovereign's children; the people are the children of nobles and statesmen. The sovereign should serve heaven as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, but exciting himself to illustrate his virtues, and looking up to receive from heaven, the vast patrimony which it confers; thus the emperors will daily increase in felicity and glory. Nobles and ministers of state should serve their sovereign as a father, never forgetting to cherish reverential thoughts, not harbouring covetous and sordid desires, nor engaging in wicked and clandestine thoughts, but faithfully and justly exerting themselves; thus their noble rank will be preserved. The people should never forget to cherish reverential thoughts towards the nobles and ministers of state, to obey and keep the laws; to excite no secret or open rebellion; then no great calamity will befall their persons."&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

==Modern thought==
[[Louis de Bonald]] wrote as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, De Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is “active and strong” and the child is “passive or weak”, the mother is the “median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion”. De Bonald justified his analysis by quoting and interpreting passages from the [[Bible]]:

:“&lt;nowiki&gt;[It]&lt;/nowiki&gt; calls man the ''reason'', the ''head'', the power of woman: ''Vir caput est mulieris'' {man is head of woman} says St Paul.  It calls woman the helper or ''minister'' of man:  ‘Let us make man,’ says Genesis, ‘a helper similar to him.’  It calls the child a ''subject'', since it tells it, in a thousand places, to obey its parents”. (''On Divorce'' pp&amp;nbsp;44&amp;ndash;46)

De Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state (the principle of [[macrocosm/microcosm]]). He insists that the ''deconstitution'' of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with “[[The Kyklos]]” not far behind. (''On Divorce'', pp&amp;nbsp;88&amp;ndash;89; 149.)

[[Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn]] draws a connection between the family and monarchy:

:“Due to its inherent patriarchalism, monarchy fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of a Christian society.  (Compare the teaching of Pope [[Leo XIII]]: 'Likewise the powers of fathers of families preserves expressly a certain image and form of the authority which is in God, from which ''all paternity in heaven and earth receives its name'' &amp;mdash; Eph 3.15')  The relationship between the King as 'father of the fatherland' and the people is one of mutual love”. (''Liberty or Equality'', p.155)

==Politics and the family==
In her book, ''Delacroix, Art and Patrimony in Post-Revolutionary France'', Elisabeth Fraser analyses [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s famous “Massacres of Chios” (1824), which helped galvanise [[philo-Hellenism]] in France. Delacroix's symbol for the oppressed Greek nation was a family employed as a conceptual and visual structuring device. A reviewer encapsulated Fraser's argument:
:“Equating patriarchal family metaphor with government paternalism and imperialist protectionism, the chapter argues that such familial intimations, heightened by acute emotionalism and hints of a Western culture soiled by Eastern penetration, corresponded to and reflected a paternalistic government urge to protect the victimized Greeks, a thinly veiled justification for French colonial intervention in the Mediterranean.” [http://www.kunstform.historicum.net/2005/02/4653.html Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer]

More recently, [[George Lakoff]] has claimed that the [[left-right politics|left/right distinction]] in politics comes from a difference between ideals of the family in the mind of the person in question; for [[right-wing]] people, the ideal is a patriarchical and moralistic family; for [[left-wing]] people, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each side's deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.[https://web.archive.org/web/20020416055642/http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=515].

Such a model is not a recent addition to modern discourse; J. Vernon Jenson discussed “British Voices on the Eve of the American Revolution: Trapped by the Family Metaphor” in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 63 (1977), pp&amp;nbsp;43&amp;ndash;50.

The idea of the [[commonwealth]] as a family is close to [[cliché]]; it permeates political discourse at every level:

:“There is an historic American National Family metaphor .. That American National Family frame is like any real extended family-fractious but in the end functional. There are people in it who aren't just like you, but they are still family and we still have to try to solve our problems together, despite our differences.” &amp;mdash; [http://metaphorproject.org/our-one-big-family-frame/           Susan C. Strong, ''Our 'One Big Family' Frame'']

'''Feminist interventions in the philosophy of law''' concern the examination and reformulation of traditional legal systems in order to better reflect the political, social, and economic concerns of women---which also includes various other minority and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-law/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Francis|first=Leslie|last2=Smith|first2=Patricia|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it draws heavily from [[feminist legal theory]], feminist interventions in the philosophy of law differs from the more common feminist jurisprudence as it also seeks to explain the justification that a government has in interfering with the lives of its citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|date=|title=Interventionism|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/interven/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, then, feminist interventions in legal philosophy specifically addresses the relationship and rationale between a judicial system’s exercise of power and its effects on female citizens. While particular views vary greatly, most feminist interventions in the philosophy of law operate under a belief that many contemporary legal systems are predicated on patriarchal notions of masculinity that result in a system of deeply-rooted bias and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Katharine|date=1990|title=Feminist Legal Methods|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=103|pages=829–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The rule of law ==
The [[rule of law]] is generally defined as the fundamental principle that both government and its citizens all operate under a system of general and fair rules that are publicly disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rule-of-law|title=the definition of rule of law|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to feminism, feminist philosophers of law typically perceive the current iteration of the rule of law as an institution that perpetuates primarily patriarchal norms, or in terms of power relationships that have been primarily been dominated by males.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P., 2005. “Four Themes in Feminist Legal Theory: Difference, Dominance, Domesticity &amp; Denial,” in M. Golding and W. Edmundson, ''Philosophy of Law &amp; Legal Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, pp. 90–104.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they perceive the current normativity of law as perpetuating male values as the status quo. Though feminists maintain several different positions in terms of how to address these issues, it is almost universally agreed that these patriarchal structures cannot be properly challenged until their underlying biases are fully exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Catharine. "Toward a Feminist Theory of the State," ''Women's Rights Law Reporter'' vol. 12, no. 3 (Fall 1990): p. 205-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of intervention by ideology ==
As in traditional feminist jurisprudence, feminists hold several competing philosophical positions in regards to ways the law should work to better accommodate women.

=== Cultural Feminism ===
[[Cultural feminists]] contend that the solution to attaining legal equality must come from procedural reform that embraces the differences between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The challenge here derives from acknowledging various differences between men and women without further reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting sexist practices.&lt;ref&gt;Minow, M., 1991. ''Making All the Difference: Inclusion, Exclusion &amp; American Law'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the government must intervene insofar as it promotes laws that embrace only the immutable differences between the sexes—such as [[pregnancy]]—with the ultimate goal being equal recognition to women's moral voice of caring and communal values.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, whereas women emphasize the importance of relationships and reconciliation of conflicting positions, men emphasize more abstract principles such as rights and logic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Feminist Jurisprudence.” ''LII / Legal Information Institute'', Cornell Law School, 16 Mar. 2018, www.law.cornell.edu/wex/feminist_jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cultural feminists see their intervention into law as a means to achieve balance and reconciliation between the two.

=== Liberal Feminism ===
[[Liberal feminism|Liberal feminists]] believe women and men possess the same rational capabilities and have no fundamental differences in capability; therefore, they assert that women should have equal opportunity as men to the extent that some liberal feminists believe there should be no legal distinctions between men or women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Accordingly, the law’s role, according to the liberal feminist, should strive for the utmost equality between men and women. This is because liberal feminists believe that women have long been denied the same bodily autonomy that has been enjoyed by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Rhode, D. and C. Sanger (eds.), 2005. ''Gender and Rights'', New York: International Library of Essays on Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues manifest themselves in the form of the debate on whether or not the law ought to legally recognize industries like prostitution as a legitimate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, M.M., 2010. “Sex Trafficking and Criminalization: In Defense of Feminist Abolitionism,” ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'', 158: 1729–1778&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy area in law where parity is specifically desired is in the “standards of reasonableness” that are used in criminal, contract, and tort law, which liberal feminists argue are predicated on masculine assumptions of what is “reasonable.”&lt;ref&gt;Chamallas, M. and J. Wriggins, 2010. ''The Measure of Injury: Race, Gender, and Tort Law'', New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, liberal feminists seek to articulate how this masculine norm accordingly affects those aspects of law in regards to judging women or other feminine groups as “reasonable” in trial.

Furthermore, liberal feminists also place a particular value on [[intersectionality]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K., with N. Gotanda, G. Peller and K. Thomas (eds.), 1996. ''Critical Race Theory: Key Writing that Formed the Movement'', New York: New Press&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for this growing movement is that keeping categories such as race and sex separate often made such persons "invisible" by making it more difficult to exact equality for persons who were oppressed for their gender, race, or class.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger, S., 2012. ''Resisting Reality'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominant Feminism ===
[[Radical feminism|Dominant]], or ''radical'', feminists maintain that there are differences between men and women, but these differences do not derive from innate differences between men and women; rather, such differences come as a result of women being subjugated by men in larger society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As such, it is not merely enough to embrace the differences between men and women: sexual equality under the rule of law must be established upon a female paradigm that cannot simply be an addition to the current paradigm of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, C. A. 1987. ''Feminism Unmodified''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of philosophical interventions, dominant feminists contend that a systemic reevaluation must take place within any legal system that operates to subjugate women. Moreover, the law must be constructed in such a way that it does not work to a disparate effect of either sex.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, J. A. 1999. ''Our Lives before the Law: Constructing a Feminist Jurisprudence''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, some radical feminists even contend that it is fundamentally flawed to have a paradigm based upon only women, because this mistakenly implies  women as all having the same interests, identities, needs, and values. Such paradigms are said to be flawed because they privilege the preferences and viewpoints of more privileged white women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harris, A. 1990. Race and essentialism in feminist legal theory. ''Stanford Law Review'', 42: 581–616.Find this resource:&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, feminist analysis should focus on the intersections of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation and their treatment by law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Still others seek policies or modes of analysis that use both men and women, of all kinds of background, as the starting point of analysis, and design rules for workplaces, families, politics, and society that are fully inclusive of these backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.1984–5. Equality’s riddle: pregnancy and equal treatment. ''New York University Review of Law and Social Change'', 13: 325–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of intervention in the United States ==

=== Bodily Autonomy ===
Feminist interventions concerning women's issues of bodily autonomy cover a wide range of legal topics, such as abortion, prostitution, and rape.

==== Abortion ====
Several American legal feminists have expressed approval of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which guaranteed the right to have an abortion in the United States. [[Lucinda Peach]], for example, argued in her 2002 essay that controlling one’s own body was a necessary condition for any other freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Peach, L., 2002. ''Religious Lawmaking in a Secular State'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, though generally accepting of the Court's decision, have nevertheless argued that the Court's opinion was based upon "paternalistic attitudes" regarding women.&lt;ref&gt;Appleton, S.F., 2011. “Reproduction and Regret,” ''Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism'', 23: 255–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, other feminist legal commentators have acknowledged the difficulties associated with the legalization of abortion in the United States. For example, certain feminists concerned with the rights of the disabled argue that abortion decisions that are based on inadequate or biased information about disabilities are inherently problematic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Likewise, certain feminists of color are more concerned with whether some abortion policies themselves are racially biased, implicitly or even explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L.P. (ed.), 2017. ''The Oxford Handbook of Reproductive Ethics'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have even gone as far as to suggest that ''Roe v. Wade'' "was not a victory for women but a victory for the medical profession; it gave physicians, not women, the right to make abortion decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Petchesky RP, New York, Longman, 1984. 404 p. (Longman Series in Feminist Theory)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prostitution ====
Some legal feminists have argued that markets which cater specifically to sexual services should be banned by the state. This is because such markets are viewed as exploitative of marginalized classes of people and pose numerous risks to its workers.&lt;ref&gt;Shrage, Laurie, "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay published in 2010, [[Debra Satz|Debrah Satz]] argued that feminist interventions in the law should be opposed to the legalization of prostitution, as prostitution often employs people from stigmatized or disempowered social classes, fails to create conditions for informed consent, endangers the health of its participants, and reinforces invidious stereotypes about women or other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Satz, D., 2010, ''Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale: The Moral Limits of Markets'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Carole Pateman]] has argued that, because people’s bodies and sexual capacities are an integral part of their identity, the woman who works as a prostitute sells her womanhood and, consequently, her very self.&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, C., 1988, ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]]—who is a Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago—has devoted several of her publications to explaining why the social stigma associated with sex work is irrational. As she believes it, feminists should oppose the stigmatization of sex work, rather than oppose sex work for its contribution to the stigmatization of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nussbaum, M., 1999, ''Sex and Social Justice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nussbaum speculated that the problems associated with prostitution are reflective of many other social practices, and that these social practices are not inherent to prostitution but are often a function of the prostitute’s working conditions and treatment by others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sexual Assault ====
Feminist legal scholars have also attempted to address the many ways in which law fails to protect women and girls against forms of violence such as rape, domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traditionally, legal scholars acknowledge that a central purpose of civil law has been to keep men from violating one another; however, violation of women by men had historically been largely considered a private matter beyond the purview of law.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C., 2016. “Dead to the World: Rape, Unconsciousness, and Social Media,” ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 41: 361–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic chastisement was once considered legitimate discipline of one’s wife and marital rape was excluded from the definition of rape in many criminal law statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Estrich, S., 1987. ''Real Rape'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ''Sex &amp; Power'', New York: Riverhead Books.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few decades, however, Feminists have noted that multiple nations have made advances to their legal protections regarding sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Taslitz, A., 1999. ''Rape &amp; the Culture of the Courtroom'', New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many western nations no longer require the corroboration of rape by witnesses; additionally, other jurisdictions hold that consent is no longer presumed from the absence of resistance; and most western nations now require far stricter requirements for the relevance of evidence presented in rape trials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulhofer, S., 1998. ''Unwanted Sex: The Culture of Intimidation &amp; the Failure of Law'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known as a critic of [[Judeo-Christian]] morality and religions in general. One of the arguments he raised against the truthfulness of these doctrines is that they are based upon the concept of [[free will]], which, in his opinion, does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 68-69: "He also ''shares'' with the Materialists a blanket repudiation of the idea of free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26, tr. [[H. L. Mencken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schopenhauer==
In ''[[The Gay Science]]'', Nietzsche praises [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s "immortal doctrines of the intellectuality of intuition, the apriority of the law of causality, (...) and the non-freedom of the will,&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book2.html The Gay Science]'', 99, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;" which have not been assimilated enough by the disciples. Following is, then, the short description of those views of the latter philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. Leiter, ''Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Nietzsche on Morality'', Routledge 2002, p. 59: "Schopenhauer's picture is, in fact, richer than this, and important for understanding Nietzsche." [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbeGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SimAY6RRK9&amp;sig=t5B7vVeXlOWDMu6I5m3gTA_hZGk&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6SFsVbqHNoG0sgHZ5oDwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The principle of causality===
In ''Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' Schopenhauer claimed to prove &amp;ndash; in accordance with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and against [[David Hume|Hume]] &amp;ndash; that causality is present in the perceivable reality as its principle, i.e. it precedes and enables human perception (so called [[apriority]] of the principle of causality), and thus it is not just an observation of something likely, statistically frequent, which however does not happen "on principle" ([[empiricism]] of the principle of causality). More on this dispute in philosophy can be found in the article on [[Free will#Free will and views of causality|free will]].

===Physical freedom===
In his treatise ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer calls the fact that we can do whatever we will a physical freedom, i.e. lack of physically present obstacles, which is not identical with moral freedom.&lt;ref name="OFW"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', 1839, c. 1 (explanation of terms), "What is meant by freedom?". [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/98022360.pdf First chapter online]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically "free" means: one acting according only to one's will; if attempts are made to use this term to the will itself, the question arises: "is will itself willed?," "do you will the will to become so-and-so?". It is therefore a specific aspect of the claim of freedom, in which it is stressed whether the course of consciousness follows indeed in a willed way. The problem of willing the will appears in ''Thus spake Zarathustra'', for instance in the chapter "Backworldsmen."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The backworldsmen", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity vs. contingency===
In ''On the Freedom of the Will'', Schopenhauer demonstrates the (well known in philosophy) distinction between necessity and contingency.&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; He calls "necessary" what follows from a given sufficient basis&lt;ref&gt;Such sufficient basis can then be transcribed as the presence of all the necessary conditions of the occurrence of an effect. As long as it is possible to point out some necessary conditions of an event or state, so long there also exists a sufficient basis, which in case of its occurrence will work with necessity; it is dictated by logic. ''Cf.'' there, c. 4 ("Precursors"), a quote from Hobbes. This does not preclude the inclusion of an accurate realization of a certain random variable in a sufficient basis.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. that what is already certain – if one knows that the sufficient cause is present). On the other hand, one calls "contingent"&lt;ref&gt;''Zufällig'' is the German adjective combining all the meanings of chance, randomness, fortuity, and contingency; the same situation in several other European languages. Perhaps ''fortuitous'' or ''random'' to something could better suit the intuitive meaning, and such translation of this scholastic term is sometimes used. The term is sometimes used in a misleading way so that it denotes in general all "instances [products] of a rule" (which are indeed contingent to each other), and then lack of necessity is triumphantly announced (like in the case of St. Thomas Aquinas), whereas one in fact agrees that there are still causes (so another connection-by-necessity must exist); this is the so-called relative fortuity of events. For Schopenhauer it is the starting point for discussion about absolute fortuity and lack of causes.&lt;/ref&gt; or "incidental" (with regard to a sufficient basis) that what does not follow from the latter (so e.g. two unconnected events can be contingent to each other: like when a black cat crosses the street and one's job is lost on the same day). As ''moral'' freedom means lack of necessity, it would mean a lack of ''any'' basis: it "would have to be defined as ''absolutely contingent''",&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; i.e. an '''[[Indeterminism#Philosophy|absolute fortuity, or chance]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;The above-mentioned classification of phenomena in Schopenhauer's works is not really a methodology or a kind of optics, but simply a notice that either an event or a state is determined (by another, by anything) or it is not (by another, by anything; like in case of a choice when all its directing forces – will, values, all emotional aspects – are rejected or unworking). Thus philosophers even before Schopenhauer have already thought that everything is either necessary or fortuitous and as much as one does not apply, the other does; so for instance in Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'', where the distinction is one of categories of reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question about the freedom of will is thus the question whether something depends on another thing (a state, an event), i.e. is in some way determined by it, or does not depend on anything (then we call it a chance). Or, in other words, whether something can be predicted: whether it is certain (given the presence or absence of the sufficient cause) or not. Cf. Luther's argument: for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already.

==Nietzsche's analysis==

===Power of will===
In ''Beyond Good and Evil'' Nietzsche criticizes the concept of free will both negatively and positively.&lt;ref name="BGE"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 21, tr. H. Zimmern&lt;/ref&gt; He calls it a folly resulting from extravagant pride of man; and calls the idea a ''crass stupidity''. The latter probably relates to ordinary-man's visions about a god who (after the ellapse of eternal waiting) creates the world and then waits and observes (being, however, still "beyond time"): and then he is surprised and subdued by what one does.&lt;ref&gt;Why then it does not surprise man? Cf. the so-called [[Argument from free will|paradox of omniscience]], according to which there is a contradiction between visions of a live and free God and omniscience or even the possibility of omniscience.&lt;/ref&gt; (This vision is brought up by Nietzsche in ''The Antichrist''.)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 48, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, he argues that free will generally represents an error of ''causa sui'':&lt;ref&gt;That is, "X is the cause of X" &amp;ndash; whereas "cause" should in philosophy be usually something else than effect. The terms ''causa sui'' (cause of self, here considered a fallacy), ''causa prima'' (first cause), and absolute randomness have a common logical sense with respect to states and events in the universe, but occur in different philosophical contexts and with different aspects of meaning and associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The &lt;u&gt;desire&lt;/u&gt; for "freedom of will" in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this ''causa sui'', and, with more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Finally, he suggests that the only ''real'' thing about will is whether it is strong (i.e. hard to break) or weak:

{{Quotation|The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life it is only a question of ''strong'' and ''weak'' will.&lt;ref name="BGE"/&gt;}}

Nothing is (or can be) fully resistant to stimula, for that would mean it is immutable: whereas nothing in this world is or can be immutable.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', c. 3, sect. 2, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore continues here the Schopenhauer's issue of physical freedom: "whether you will, what you willed to will".&lt;ref&gt;The composition actually already known to Hegel, in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', 27, written in 1821. In Schopenhauer's essay an infinite regression arises upon considering this issue, when one assumes the fixed answer Yes to the question about freedom; so a logical fallacy occurs. This already can suggest that there is a problem with searching for cause of everything one does in consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt;

Will is generally considered a mental power. "Freedom" of will could then be interpreted as: power of will (cf. the appropriate passus from ''The Antichrist'', where Nietzsche generally opposes will-based psychology&lt;ref name="A14"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). Will has power over actions, over many things; therefore, things are ''determined'' by will. But is this power unlimited? Does will rule without itself being ruled? (And further: does a Christian want to sin?) &amp;ndash; Nietzsche disagrees. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it; and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. Nietzsche suggests in many places that if a pious man loses faith, it is because of the power of his ''values'' over him, of the will for truthfulness...

==="Me", will, and chance===
[[Volition (psychology)|Will]] is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc.  It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. ''The Antichrist'' about Christians: "in point of fact, they simply do what they cannot help doing"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist The Antichrist]'', 44, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term "me" and "chance" (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).

The term "me" (as in the statements "it's up to me", "it is ''you'' who willed that") had already been recognized as empty in the preface of ''Beyond Good and Evil''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', Preface, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; (or as connected with the ''superstition about the soul''). Later Nietzsche stated more clearly that it was a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] ("what will I do? what will my decision be?" &amp;ndash; "it's up to ''you''" &amp;ndash; that actually means: your decision depends on your decision, something happens in your mind and not somewhere else...). See e.g. ''On the Genealogy of Morals'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm On the Genealogy of Morals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192122/http://home.sandiego.edu/~janderso/360/genealogy1.htm |date=2014-10-08 }}'', treatise I, 13, tr. W. Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an ''action'', as the effect of a subject which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is ''free'' to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; &lt;u&gt;there is no "being" behind the doing, acting, becoming&lt;/u&gt;. "The doer" is merely made up and added into the action &amp;ndash; the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: &lt;u&gt;when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect&lt;/u&gt;. (...) "We weak people are merely weak. It's good if we do nothing; ''we are not strong enough for that''" &amp;ndash; but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do "too much"), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, &lt;u&gt;just as if the weakness of the weak man himself&lt;/u&gt; &amp;ndash; that means his ''essence'', his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an ''act'', ''something of merit''&lt;/u&gt;.}}

The same however can be applied to the ''moral'' weakness of a Christian (his lack of resistance), who would certainly prefer not to sin and would construct himself otherwise if he could. "And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!"&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67a/part1.html#chapter3 Thus spake Zarathustra]'', tr. T. Common, "Old and new tables", 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Nietzsche criticizes the idea of "free choice", and even of "choice" in general (cf. the end of above quotation): man does not want to "choose", man wants to affirm himself ("[[will to power]]").&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Belfiore, ''The Triadic Structure of the Mind: Outlines of a Philosophical System'' (2nd edition), Univ. Press of America, 2014, p. 380: "My comment is that Nietzsche, as I point out elsewhere (...), conceived the will to power as the expression of the outward/selfish desire of the agent to affirm and impose on others his apirations, interests and preferences, regardless to any inward/moral thought and feeling." See also on p. 472: "Again with regard to the &amp;laquo;will to power&amp;raquo;, he held that &amp;laquo;A living thing seeks above all to ''discharge'' its strength &amp;ndash; life itself is ''will to power''; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent ''results''&amp;raquo;."&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the role of chance. Unless the change brought to man is too big, a chance is generally responded by will, ''wherever there is will''. He calls it "the redemption (of chance)". This topic dawns as early as in ''Human, All Too Human'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Human All-Too-Human#SECOND DIVISION - The History Of The Moral Sentiments.|Human, All Too Human'', 173, under the topic: ''Corriger la fortune'' (to correct a chance), tr. R.J. Hollingdale.]]&lt;/ref&gt; and it returns in many places of ''Zarathustra''. For instance in part 3 it is discussed as follows:

::I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.
::&lt;u&gt;And verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak unto it&lt;/u&gt; (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Bedwarfing Virtue", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in this part:

::The time is now past when accidents ''[Zufälle]'' could befall me; and what could not fall to my lot which would not already be mine own!"&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', "The Wanderer".&lt;/ref&gt;

To cut it short, if it was always that "''we'' choose a chance", then there would be determinism (for "we", "we ourselves" means: our will and its filtering and determining capabilities). And since it happens otherwise ("a chance chooses us"), then there is indeterminism. But the latter case means we have no will in a topic, i.e. it is at that time morally indifferent to us, ''adiaphora'', not opposed to anything (and therefore even more there is no guilt).

===Necessity in man. What is "unfree will"?===
Since free will is discussed, it must obviously be some restricted reality (if "freedom" meant "everything," there would be no need for a separate word). What follows? That there must be events ''external'' to one's freedom: therefore, besides "free will" there should also consequently be "unfree will." Although Nietzsche considers both terms entirely fictional, he gives some clues about the ''psychological'' reality behind them:

{{Quotation|When man experiences the conditions of power, the imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is ''not responsible'' for them &amp;mdash; they come without being willed, consequently we are not their author: &lt;u&gt;the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness that we have been changed without having willed it)&lt;/u&gt; needs an ''external'' will.&lt;ref&gt;''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of religion, 1. Genesis of Religions, &amp;sect;135, where he demonstrates the notion of "unfree will" as crucial to the emergence of many religious explanations. Vintage Books edition, September, 1968, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Magi-iz7kIQC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=&amp;quot;136+(March-June+1888)&amp;quot;&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OcKHVB3dib&amp;sig=-9HqUzdC-rG-EJGaHY9P1NVGLwM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bUfVLCeEKT9ywP4_YKgAg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22136%20(March-June%201888)%22&amp;f=false Online version here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, an unexpected change. Now, going back to the mentioned definition, [[randomness|chance]] means: that what cannot be predicted. If randomness affects a man (unsubjugated, reaching even the surface of his consciousness), then "unfree will" occurs. Thus, whenever we call something free, we ''feel'' something free, in short: wherever we feel our power, it is deterministic, it is a necessity. And indeed Nietzsche says it with the mouth of Zarathustra:

::Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived, &amp;mdash; where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (...)
::Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, &lt;u&gt;where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Old and new tables", 2, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same in ''Beyond Good and Evil'':

{{Quotation|Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax &amp;mdash; in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are then the same thing with them.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 213, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The universe indeterministic?===
Yet in another part of ''Zarathustra'' Nietzsche claims that when we look long-term enough and from the bird's-eye perspective of supreme powers big enough, a chance is unimportant, because it is subject to and step-by-step softened and arranged by natural laws and necessities which constitute the order of the world and evolution:

{{Quotation|If ever a breath hath come to me of the creative breath, &lt;u&gt;and of the heavenly necessity which compelleth even chances to dance star-dances&lt;/u&gt;: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "The Seven Seals", 3, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Nietzsche everything in this world is an expression of will to power.&lt;ref&gt;K. Gemes, J. Richardson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Nietzsche'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2013, p. 177-178 ("The Duality of Nietzsche's Theory of the Will to Power: The Psychological and Cosmological Aspects"). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yZmJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;f=false Read online here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Beyond Good and Evil]'', 36, tr. H. Zimmern.&lt;/ref&gt; To exist is to represent will to power, to ''cause influence'' (compare similar views of Protagoras' disciples in Plato's ''Theaetetus''). One can cause influence only on something that exists. Therefore, (through induction) an act changes everything from that moment onwards. If one thing was otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise (and generally also backwards).&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"&gt;This belief, perhaps not 100% deterministic, is explicitly expressed in ''Twilight of the Idols'', "Morality as Anti-Nature", 6, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale: "To say to him, &amp;laquo;Change yourself!&amp;raquo; is to demand that everything be changed, even retroactively."&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]]'s views, this general rule is not precluded even by absolute chances: they of course change the course of the world too, but still: if one thing was set otherwise, everything would have to be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TI_humanact"/&gt;

Several scholars have argued that Nietzsche was not a determinist in his views of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''The Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 23 (2002), p. 64 ("Nietzsche on Freedom and Fatalism"). [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v023/23.1solomon.html Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche on morality'' (2nd edition), Routledge 2015, p. 66. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hBDEBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;f=false Online text here]
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Zarathustra'', absolute randomness (maybe not as the essence of reality, but as a part thereof) can be thought of, yes, perhaps it even exists:

{{Quotation|Verily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that "above all things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft/beyondgoodandevi00nietuoft_djvu.txt Thus spake Zarathustra]'', "Before sunrise", tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Issues of responsibility and morality===
Because ''causa sui'' is according to Nietzsche a nonsense, even to a chance could get a basis attributed (only "the whole" has no basis), and it would be "divine dice" (or "Divine Plan"):

::If ever I have played dice with the gods at the divine table of the earth, so that the earth quaked and ruptured, and snorted forth fire-streams: &amp;ndash;
::&amp;ndash; For a divine table is the earth, and trembling with new active dictums and dice-casts of the gods: (...)&lt;ref name=TSZ3/&gt;

To Nietzsche no one is responsible either for the necessities (laws and powers) he represents, or for chances he encounters (which conquer him unwillingly &amp;ndash; and which, as things totally independent from anything, only the "supreme being" could change); after all, no one is absolutely and completely resistant, there can always happen something which changes one deeply enough.

From ''The Dawn of Day'':

{{Quotation|To tranquillise the sceptic. &amp;ndash; "I don't know at all what I am doing. I don't know in the least what I ought to do!" You are right, but 
be sure of this: you are being done at every moment! Mankind has at all times mistaken the active for the passive: it is its eternal grammatical blunder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/dawnofday029675mbp/dawnofday029675mbp_djvu.txt The Dawn of Day]'', 120, tr. J. M. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche discusses [[fatalism]] and responsibility in these words:

{{Quotation|What alone can our teaching be? &amp;ndash; That no one gives a man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his parents and ancestors, nor ''he himself'' (the latter absurd idea here put aside has been taught as "intelligible freedom" by Kant, perhaps also by Plato). &lt;u&gt;''No one'' is responsible for existing at all&lt;/u&gt;, for being formed so and so, for being placed under those circumstances and in this environment. His own destiny cannot be disentangled from the destiny of all else in past and future. He is ''not'' the result of a special purpose, a will, or an aim, the attempt is ''not'' here made to reach an "ideal of man," an "ideal of happiness," or an "ideal of morality;" &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;it is absurd to try to ''shunt off'' man's nature towards some goal&lt;/u&gt;. We have invented the notion of a "goal:" in reality a goal is ''lacking'' . . . We are necessary, we are part of destiny, we belong to the whole, we ''exist'' in the whole, &amp;ndash; &lt;u&gt;there is nothing which could judge, measure, compare, or condemn our being, for that would be to judge, measure, compare, and condemn the whole&lt;/u&gt; . . . ''But there is nothing outside the whole! &amp;ndash; This only is the grand emancipation'': that no one be made responsible any longer, that the mode of being be not traced back to a ''causa prima'', that the world be not regarded as a unity, either as sensorium or as "spirit;" &amp;ndash; it is only thereby that the ''innocence'' of becoming is again restored . . . The concept of "God" has hitherto been the greatest ''objection'' to existence . . . We deny God, we deny responsibility by denying God: it is only ''thereby'' that we save the world. &amp;ndash;&lt;ref name="TI_fw"&gt;''[http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 Twilight of the Idols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214453/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/The_Case_of_Wagner_v11_1000198930/165 |date=2016-03-03 }}'', "The Four Great Errors", 8, tr. T. Common.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Free will as a psychological error===
Nietzsche's critique of free will has essentially two aspects: one is philosophical (fatalistic), and the other is psychological.&lt;ref name="NTotW"&gt;[[Brian Leiter|B. Leiter]], ''Nietzsche's Theory of the Will'', p. 1. [[Philosophers' Imprint]] v. 7, no. 7, September 2007. [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/nietzsche-s-theory-of-the-will.pdf?c=phimp;idno=3521354.0007.007 Online text here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism lets Nietzsche theoretically prove the error of moral doctrines, which &amp;ndash; most generally speaking &amp;ndash; would require that a sinner changed his destiny (for instance by changing the laws of nature, influencing chances which lie completely beyond the extent of his influence), which is by definition impossible. But such theory would not be convincing enough if at the same time the impression of control was not removed, as well as the ever renewed attempts at associating it with the "freedom of will" and building a philosophy out of that. Thus a psychological critique is needed.

If one agrees that the "freedom of will" denotes the power of will which rules but is not itself ruled, then it would at bottom be enough to prove that it is not will what governs human behaviour in order to abolish the very term, to prove that "it is not there". And Nietzsche went on to this.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' (Leiter), p. 12 ("The Real Genesis of Action").&lt;/ref&gt; For Nietzsche the term "will" is psychologically strictly connected with the term "aim" (he often combines the two), maybe even they are identical to him.&lt;ref name="WTP"&gt;Cf. ''The Will to Power'', Book II ("Critique of highest values hitherto"), I. Critique of philosophy, 238: on "psychology which ... searched for will (i.e. aim) behind every act."&lt;/ref&gt; Aim could then be interpreted, according to a common definition, as planning and intellectual foreseeing&lt;ref&gt;The intellect in philosophy was by the way usually presented as working causally and, in principle, learning in course of life to associate the appropriate causes and effects. It was thus understood e.g. by Schopenhauer (cf. F. C. White, ''On Schopenhauer's Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', c. 4: "Perception," p. 42: Brill Academic Pub, 1991; [https://books.google.com/books?id=95X3LSZ9O04C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4t8t3huF0&amp;sig=_yZNYjtOD8g49uNcKKxGql5cn9w&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7gTVOfLEcvTPI_TgLgE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false read online]). The more thus the phenomena of will and aim would have a deterministic foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; (of especially effects); according to Nietzsche first and foremost the anticipation of acts which in fact do not need to follow by its virtue from aiming (which is here foreseeing).

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' Nietzsche demonstrates the ''error of false causality'' just before the ''error of free will'':

{{Quotation|Of these "inward facts" that seem to demonstrate causality, the primary and most persuasive one is that of &lt;u&gt;the will as cause&lt;/u&gt;. The idea of consciousness ("spirit") or, later, that of the ego ''[I]'' (the "subject") as a cause are only afterbirths: first the causality of the will was firmly accepted as proved, as a fact, and these other concepts followed from it. But we have reservations about these concepts. &lt;u&gt;Today we no longer believe any of this is true&lt;/u&gt;. (...) The so-called motives: another error. &lt;u&gt;Merely a surface phenomenon of consciousness, something shadowing&lt;ref&gt;"Accompanying" in original.&lt;/ref&gt; the deed&lt;/u&gt; that is more likely to hide the causes of our actions than to reveal them. (...)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The Four Great Errors", 3, tr. W. Kaufmann &amp;amp; R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and then, in the section directly regarding free will, he observes:

{{Quotation|Men were considered "free" only so that they might be considered guilty &amp;ndash; could be judged and punished: consequently, &lt;u&gt;every act had to be considered as willed, and the origin of every act had to be considered as lying within the consciousness&lt;/u&gt; (and thus the most fundamental psychological deception was made the principle of psychology itself).&lt;ref&gt;There, sect. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly in ''The Antichrist'': "the will no longer &amp;laquo;acts,&amp;raquo; or &amp;laquo;moves&amp;raquo;...", "the term no longer denotes any power".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 14, tr. H. L. Mencken. The latter is a mistranslation by Mencken (in original: ''kein Vermögen mehr verstanden werden darf'').&lt;/ref&gt; This non-deriving of acts straight way out of aims, which are just foreseeing (the accompanying self-consciousness of that what is to come), but searching for their sources elsewhere (for example in reflexes, habits, urges) is to Nietzsche even one of major differences between medieval (Thomist) and modern psychology.&lt;ref name="WTP"/&gt;

Nietzsche's words turned out to be prophetic,&lt;ref name="NTotW"/&gt; for [[Free will#Neurophilosophy|modern neuroscience]], especially the famous Libet's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/brain/106.3.623 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | last2 = Gleason | first2 = C.

The authors affirmed a kind of naturalistic, [[compatibilism|compatibilistic]] free will.&lt;/ref&gt;) experiment and other of this type, has not once confirmed that the decision for an act is made beyond the (self)consciousness (in popular words, the will), which comes up to even half a second later.

==Nietzsche's conclusions==

===About man and freedom===
In ''The Antichrist'' Nietzsche argues that man should be considered no otherwise than as a machine.&lt;ref name="A14"/&gt; Even if some generic chaos (randomness) is added to the picture, it does not affect this. A chance is innocent.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 25, tr. H. L. Mencken "Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented  as a danger, as a “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....".&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche points out the weakness of human as well as of God. Man wills the good, "God" wills the good, and yet evil happens.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/n/nietzsche/friedrich/n67j/book5.html The Gay Science]'', 346, tr. T. Common. "We have become saturated with the conviction (and have grown cold and hard in it) that things are not at all divinely ordered in this world, nor even according to human standards do they go on rationally, mercifully, or justly: we know the fact that the world in which we live is ungodly, immoral, and &amp;laquo;inhuman&amp;raquo;, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; So where is this "freedom" (i.e. power) of will? And where is this good God?&lt;ref&gt;In ''Ecce Homo'', "Why I am so wise", 3, tr. Duncan Large he repeated after Stendhal: "God's only excuse is that he doesn't exist." Due to the lack of free will the [[theodicee]] (defence of divine goodness) based on indeterminism becomes void.&lt;/ref&gt;

===About good and evil===
These two human valuations refer to things essentially mixed with each other and interdependent. Good causes the evil, and evil causes the good.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. "[http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/works-pub/bge/bgefhm.htm The Aftersong]" in ''Beyond Good and Evil'' or "[https://archive.org/stream/thusspakezarathu01998gut/spzar10.txt The Seven Seals]", 4 in ''Zarathustra''.&lt;/ref&gt; The dichotomy between a good God and an evil satan is a "dualistic fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 17, tr. H. L. Mencken.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twilight of the Idols'' (see the quote above) and later in ''The Antichrist''&lt;ref name="A2638"&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 26 &amp;amp; 38 about the moral order of the world.&lt;/ref&gt; all concepts which explain life as a test or raise an (externally reasonable) moral "task," "purpose" or the "will of God" are considered false. They are a part of the "error of free will"&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; consisting in incomprehension of [[fatalism|fatalism of life]], i.e. the fact that it is shaped by higher forces.

===About organized religion===
Religion is a form of controlling people:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19322/19322-h/19322-h.htm#THE_ANTICHRIST The Antichrist]'', 38. "We know, our conscience now knows &amp;ndash; just what the real value of all those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and what ends they have served, with their debasement of humanity to a state of self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing, &amp;ndash; the concepts &amp;laquo;the other world,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the last judgment,&amp;raquo; &amp;laquo;the immortality of the soul,&amp;raquo; the &amp;laquo;soul&amp;raquo; itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture, systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains master..."&lt;/ref&gt; one man-machine wants to achieve power over another. Even the term "freedom," very often used by theologians, in its positive sense actually means "power."&lt;ref name="OFW"/&gt; Religion is by no means more "fulfilling the will of God" than anything else. As God is primary and almighty, his will is by definition always fulfilled (it is impossible that he wills something and it is not fulfilled).

A priest, a moralist does in fact nothing for man's "salvation," but just rules, and even when doing so he acts in a way that would (apart from that) be considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html Twilight of the Idols]'', "The &amp;laquo;Improvers&amp;raquo; of Mankind", tr. W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nietzsche goes on to analysing the [[Bible]] philologically and to guesses about the person of [[Jesus]]. He claims that it was not the aim of the latter to have anybody serve him, for God rules everything anyway; to the contrary, in Nietzsche's opinion Jesus fought with churchedness and the notion of sin rooted in the Old Testament. And thus in ''The Antichrist'' Christianity was portrayed as the corruption of the original doctrine taught by Jesus about equal rights of all to be children of God, the doctrine of no guilt and of no gulf between God and man.

The very "freedom of will" was invented by the priests in order to master the process of human thinking &amp;ndash; and nothing more.&lt;ref name="TI_fw"/&gt; And in order to master it, they had first to denaturize it.&lt;ref name="A2638"/&gt;

[[File:Gravitational field Earth lines equipotentials.svg|right|thumb|Image depicting [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]]. Objects accelerate towards the Earth, thus losing their gravitational energy and transforming it into [[kinetic energy]].]]
'''Gravitational energy''' is the [[potential energy]] a [[body (physics)|body]] with [[mass]] has in relation to another massive object due to [[gravity]]. It is potential energy associated with the [[gravitational field]]. Gravitational energy is dependent on the [[mass]]es of two bodies, their distance apart and the [[gravitational constant]] ({{math|''G''}}).&lt;ref name=gpe&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravitational Potential Energy|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/gpot.html|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday cases only one body is accelerating measurably, and its acceleration is constant (for example, dropping a ball on Earth). For such scenarios the Newtonian formula can – for the potential energy of the accelerating body with respect to the stationary – be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;U = mgh&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational potential energy, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object accelerating, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of the object, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the bodies.&lt;ref name=gpe/&gt; Note that this formula treats the potential energy as a positive quantity.

== Newtonian mechanics ==

In [[classical mechanics]], two or more [[mass]]es always have a gravitational [[potential (physics)|potential]]. [[Conservation of energy]] requires that this gravitational field energy is always [[Negative energy|negative]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Guth]]'' The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins'' (1997), Random House, {{ISBN|0-224-04448-6}} Appendix A: ''Gravitational Energy'' demonstrates the negativity of gravitational energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy an object has because it is within a gravitational field.

The force one point mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; exerts onto another point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]]: &lt;math&gt;F = G\frac {mM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To get the total work done by an external force to bring point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from infinity to the final distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (for example the radius of Earth) of the two mass points, the force is integrated with respect to displacement:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\int_\infty^R G\frac {mM}{r^2}dr = &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-G\left . {mM\over r} \right \vert _{\infty}^{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{r}=0&lt;/math&gt;, the total work done on the object can be written as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for the IB Diploma Full Colour |edition=revised |first1=K.

== General relativity ==

{{Main article|Mass in general relativity}}
[[File:Spacetime lattice analogy.svg|thumb|right|A depiction of curved [[geodesics]] ("world lines"). According to [[general relativity]], mass distorts [[spacetime]] and gravity is a natural consequence of Newton's First Law.]]
In [[general relativity]] gravitational energy is extremely complex, and there is no single agreed upon definition of the concept. It is sometimes modeled via the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Davidovich Landau]] &amp; [[Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz]], ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', (1951), Pergamon Press, {{ISBN|7-5062-4256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows retention for the energy-momentum conservation laws of [[classical mechanics]]. Addition of the matter [[stress–energy–momentum tensor]] to the Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor results in a combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor that has a vanishing [[Four-vector|4]]-[[divergence]] in all frames - ensuring the conservation law. Some people object to this derivation on the grounds that [[pseudotensor]]s are inappropriate in general relativity, but the divergence of the combined matter plus gravitational energy pseudotensor is a [[tensor]].

In Scotland, the first Monday after New Year's Day was traditionally known as '''Hansel Monday''', or '''Handsel Monday''', and gifts ({{lang-sco|Hansels}}) were given at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-han2.htm Michael Quinion, "World Wide Words: Handsel"]. Retrieved 7 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the rural population of Scotland, ''[[wikt:auld|Auld]] Hansel Monday'', is traditionally celebrated on the first Monday after January 12. This custom reflects a reluctance to switch from the old ([[Julian calendar|Julian]]) style calendar to the new ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) calendar.&lt;ref name="World Dict"&gt;[http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hfcwd/handsel_monday. ''Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary'', ''s.v.'' "Handsel Monday," Detroit: Omnigraphics, Inc., 2010]. Retrieved 7 January 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word "handsel" originates from old Saxon word which means “to deliver into the hand”. It refers to small tips and gifts of money given as a token&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 Handsel at Scots Language Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130705033754/http://www.scotslanguage.com/articles/words/1154 |date=2013-07-05 }}. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; of good luck, particularly at the beginning of something; the modern house-warming gift would be a good example. An 1825 glossary marks Handsel Monday as an occasion "when it is customary to make children and servants a present".&lt;ref&gt;John Trotter Brockett, A glossary of north country words, in use, 1st edition, 1 vol., Newcastle upon Tyne: 1825.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, tips of small gifts were expected by servants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/handsel%20monday Definition at Merriam-Webster]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the postman, the deliverers of newspapers, scavengers, and all persons who wait upon the house.

In this respect it is somewhat similar to [[Boxing Day]], which eventually supplanted it.&lt;ref name="World Dict" /&gt; If the handsel was a physical object rather than money, tradition said that the object could not be sharp, or it would "cut" the relationship between the giver and the recipient. The day is known in [[Scottish Gaelic]] as {{lang|gd|Diluain Traoighte}} (drained Monday).

The custom was also known as “handseling a purse”. A new purse would not be given to anyone without placing money in it for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T100054.html The History of Ireland]. Retrieved 4 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Money received during Handsel Monday is supposed to insure monetary luck all for the rest of the year.

{{quote|It is worth mentioning that one William Hunter, a collier (residing in the parish of [[Tillicoultry]], in [[Clackmannanshire]]), was cured in the year 1738 of an inveterate rheumatism or gout, by drinking freely of new ale, full of harm or yeast. The poor man had been confined to his bed. for a year and a half, having almost entirely lost the use of his limbs. On the evening of '''Handsel Monday''', as it is called, some of his neighbours came to make merry with him. Though he could not rise, yet he always took his share of the ale, as it passed round the company, and in the end he became much intoxicated. The consequence was that he had the use of his limbs next morning, and was able to walk about. He lived more than twenty years after this, and never had the smallest return of his old complaint.|[[Sir John Sinclair|Sinclair]]|''[[Statistical Account of Scotland]]'', 1792, xv., note on p. 201.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">In [[non-standard analysis]], a '''hyperinteger''' ''n'' is a [[hyperreal number]] that is equal to its own integer part.  A hyperinteger may be either finite or infinite.  A finite hyperinteger is an ordinary integer.  An example of an infinite hyperinteger is given by the class of the sequence {{nowrap|(1, 2, 3, ...)}} in the [[ultrapower]] construction of the hyperreals.

==Discussion==
The standard [[integer part]] function: 
:&lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
is defined for all real ''x'' and equals the greatest integer not exceeding ''x''.  By the [[transfer principle]] of non-standard analysis, there exists a natural extension: 
:&lt;math&gt;{}^*\! \lfloor \,\cdot\, \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
defined for all hyperreal ''x'', and we say that ''x'' is a hyperinteger if: 
:&lt;math&gt; x = {}^*\! \lfloor x \rfloor .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the hyperintegers are the image of the integer part function on the hyperreals.

==Internal sets==
The set &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of all hyperintegers is an [[internal set|internal subset]] of the hyperreal line &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all finite hyperintegers (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; itself) is not an internal subset.  Elements of the complement

:&lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{Z}\setminus\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

are called, depending on the author, ''non-standard'', ''unlimited'', or ''infinite'' hyperintegers. The reciprocal of an infinite hyperinteger is always an [[infinitesimal]].

Nonnegative hyperintegers are sometimes called ''hypernatural'' numbers.  Similar remarks apply to the sets &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;^*\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the latter gives a [[non-standard model of arithmetic]] in the sense of [[Skolem]].

'''Intrinsic finality''' is the idea that there is a natural good for all beings, and that all beings have a natural tendency to pursue their own good.  It is an underlying principle of both [[teleology]] and [[moral universalism|moral objectivism.]] The concept of intrinsic finality was summarized by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ([[Summa contra Gentiles|''Contra Gentiles'']] IV, xix)&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

:''By the form which gives it its specific perfection, everything in nature has an inclination to its own operations and to its own end, which it reaches through these operations. Just as everything is, such also are its operations and its tendency to what is suitable to itself.''

The idea of intrinsic finality presumes an [[objective reality]] that obeys a natural order or [[natural law]] in the universe.  Things are "meant" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way.  For instance, animals have natural instincts for self-preservation, seeking food, and reproduction.  They do so because it is their ''nature'' to do so.  Theologians go further, to argue that they do so because they were ''created'' to do so.

The existence of such a finality is often challenged, particularly by philosophers ascribing to [[philosophical naturalism]].  They argue that it is unreasonable to say that all beings naturally pursue their own benefit, when some beings clearly do not.  They point to instances of [[perfection|imperfection]], [[disease]], and [[death]] as evidence that natural beings do not naturally move toward perfection. But proponents of intrinsic finalilty respond that the very recognition of such imperfection requires an ideal or standard of the perfect end from which the being in question falls short owing to a variety of factors including improper [[education]], [[sin]], or [[predestination]].

Intrinsic finality provides the basis for the [[teleological argument]] for the existence of God and its modern counterpart, [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of teleology argue that Darwinism does not resolve a fundamental defect in philosophical naturalism; that it focuses exclusively on the immediate causes and mechanisms of events and does not attend to the reason for their synthesis. For example, if we take a clock apart, we discover in it nothing but springs, wheels, pivots, levers and so on but does our having explained the mechanism which causes the revolutions of the hands on the dial make it reasonable to say that the clock was not made to keep time?

Naturalists respond that biology has been profoundly concerned with the ways function constrains structure since the time of Aristotle and that Darwin's own awareness of teleology is evident in his study  in functional constraints on the evolutionary development of the beaks of Galapagos finches, of which he wrote, "Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends." (''[[Origin of Species]]'', chapter 19)

==Key ideas==

===Bystander approach===
Katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"&gt;{{Cite web |first = Johannah |last = Cornblatt | title = Bystanders No More: Teaching Kids to Respond to Violent Crime |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/the-human-condition/2009/10/30/bystanders-no-more-teaching-kids-to-respond-to-violent-crime.html |work = Newsweek Online |date = October 30, 2009 |accessdate= April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment, abuse or violence, the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools, groups, teams, workplaces and other social units.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=165}}

In 2009, after an alleged gang rape in Richmond, California where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing, Newsweek online reported that, "a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring what's called 'bystander education' to American schools. While sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim (discouraging women from walking alone at night, for example) or the perpetrator (reiterating the fact that no means no), the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence."&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

Katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives, the mixed-gender Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) program, in 1993 at Northeastern University’s Center for the Study of Sport in Society.  “Most people think they only have two choices for intervention,” says Katz. “One is to intervene physically right at the point of attack, and the other is to do nothing. And that’s a false set of choices.” As part of the MVP program, students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling 911—available to them. At the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations. Each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

According to Newsweek, research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystander-awareness programs in schools, but the initial results are promising. One study found that after the Sioux City School District in Iowa implemented the MVP program, the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by 50 percent.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

The bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the U.S. military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices.  The MVP model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education.   This approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives "implicit consent" to such behavior.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=168}}

The MVP bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a male-dominated society. [24]  Thus, the MVP approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=168}} By challenging men to speak up and “[change] group dynamics in male peer culture,”{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=117}}this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victim/perpetrator binary{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=115}} and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space.”{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=125}}

==Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) Model==
Jackson Katz presented the Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue, instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson, H. Alan Heisterkamp, and Wm. Michael Fleming. "The Social Justice Roots of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Model and Its Application in a High School Setting." Violence Against Women 17.6 (2011): 684-686.&lt;/ref&gt; Katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion, prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys.

The original MVP model was created as workshops for all-male student athletes; Katz hoped that by working with male student athletes, they could help to stop the spread of ‘rape-supportive’ and ‘battering-supportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence. (Recon, 166) Katz says his initial focus on working with student-athletes stems from the “apathy, defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors, coaches, and student-athletes...men and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture, and particularly in male peer culture.” &lt;ref name="Katz, Jackson 2013"&gt;Katz, Jackson. "MVP Strategies." MVP Strategies. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. &lt;http://www.jacksonkatz.com/aboutmvp.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a step towards the bystander approach. By working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture, Katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners. It was important for Katz to ensure that MVP considers male student-athletes as potential mentors for younger kids, able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and role-playing, as well as large discussion-based group meetings both consisting same-sex and different-sex students.  As a part of his college initiative, his MVP model involves “holding three 90-minute sessions each year with each participating college team. A fourth session is scheduled for those student-athletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school.” &lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition, as well as its relation to  gender abuse and violence. Additionally, Katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams. As his program has grown and evolved, he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 170.&lt;/ref&gt;) In this, he is hoping that the top-down approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation. If these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence, it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community.

The MVP model originally focused on just male student-athletes. Since, the MVP model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls, men and women, working together and in single-sex formats…by the mid-1990’s MVP had moved from a near-exclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students, and other institutional settings.” &lt;ref name="Katz, Jackson 2013"/&gt; This expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation. More frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused, but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other.

===Media literacy and masculinities===
In his writings, public lectures, and films, Katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1 = Katz |first1= Jackson |last2= Jhally |first2= Sut |title= Manhood on the Mat: The problem is not that pro wrestling makes boys violent.

Katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class, race and ethnicity, "violence in America is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon," shaped by "cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood."&lt;ref name=wcw/&gt; He argues that "masculinity" and "femininity" are socially constructed categories, and thus the "disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence" that currently exists in America is not genetically predetermined and can be changed.&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.mediaed.org/assets/products/211/studyguide_211.pdf |first1= Jeremy |last1= Earp |last2= Katz |first2= Jackson |title = Violence, Media &amp; The Crisis In Masculinity Study Guide |publisher = Media Education Foundation |year = 1999|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Tough Guise" study guide, co-written with the video producer Jeremy Earp of the Media Education Foundation, Katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy: "By looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted, regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo, we might begin to clear some space for individuals, male and female, to live freer lives."&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"/&gt;

===Presidential masculinities===
Katz's work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of "a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis: the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity."&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"/&gt;  Katz posits that "media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion," and that "education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539}}

According to Katz, part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a sub-textual force in presidential politics. He asks questions such as "how does the perceived 'manliness' or 'toughness' of political candidates affect their electoral success? To what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by men's gendered identities and sense of themselves as men, which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals? How does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters' perceptions of the relative 'manliness' of candidates? What are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the 'masculine ideal' that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment? Which mediated (white) masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years, and why?"{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=554}}

In an article about the [[Barack Obama]]-[[Hillary Clinton]] race for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic presidential nomination in 2008]], Katz responded to [[pundit]]s and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed. "Presidential elections are always about race and gender. The reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a (white) woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination. Their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=554}}

"Campaigns for the U.S. presidency in the era of mass media," he wrote, "always turn on the personality and style of candidates, their skills at televisual performance, their race and gender, and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment. The biggest difference this time is that the Democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the race/gender system."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

Katz further maintained that, "Presidential contests until now have been contests between men. Men were the gender that mattered. No matter how qualified by intelligence, leadership ability or experience, women were not seriously considered for the top job in government, and everyone knew it. Their gender prevented people from seeing them as 'presidential.' If there is one thing that truly represents 'change' in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear 'presidential.'   In the past, whether a candidate was a Republican or Democrat, conservative, centrist or liberal, their race and gender were predetermined. They were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man.”{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

For Katz, violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters' choice of whom to support for president. "How much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative 'manliness' or 'toughness' of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified," Katz writes. "But there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it, and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the 'national interest' — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues (e.g. the Cold War, Vietnam, the 'War on Terror,' and the invasion of Iraq, as well as gun control, and executive, legislative and judicial responses to violent crime)."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

In several articles, Katz analyzes and comments on "the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jackson-katz/the-hidden-race-and-gende_b_88580.html |first = Jackson |last = Katz |title = The Hidden Race and Gender Factor in Presidential Campaigns |work = Huffington Post |date = February 26, 2008 |accessdate= March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that "the two most 'metaphorically influential' sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football... not coincidentally, both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=540}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://voicemalemagazine.org/pdfs/voice_male_winter_09.pdf |first = Jackson | last = Katz | title = Sports Metaphors in Politics: Time to Punt? |publisher = VoiceMale Magazine |date = Winter 2009 |page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics, but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity, embodied until the historic 2008 election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=547}}

Katz also comments on implications for female candidates. He writes, "One of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin's most-quoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of 2008 was 'The heels are on, the gloves are off,' which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval. In coming years, when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed, it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the 'knockout punch.' Does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commanders-in-chief? Or do women who are seen as 'too-aggressive' – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off? What are the differences between how the sexes view a woman 'throwing punches' if she's a conservative (like Palin) or a liberal feminist (like Hillary Clinton?)."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=548}}

The [[portmanteau]] coinages '''kidult''',&lt;ref name=ki&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/kidult "Kidult"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; '''rejuvenile''',&lt;ref name=reju&gt;[[Christopher Noxon]], ''[[Rejuvenile: Kickball, Cartoons, Cupcakes, and the Reinvention of the American Grown-up]]'', 2006, ([http://www.rejuvenile.com/index.php/pages/the_book online book preview])&lt;/ref&gt; '''adultescent'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adultescent "Adultescent"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;  refer to [[adult]]s with interests traditionally seen as suitable for [[child]]ren.

It can also have other meanings, such as a parent who enjoys being a parent due to spending quality time with their children, but is not willing to accept their more authoritarian role/responsibilities as parent.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} An example is [[Robin Williams]]' character in ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', a father who has fun with his children but is a poor disciplinarian and is seen by his wife as an irresponsible head of the household.

In the past, [[psychology]] recognized the concept of ''[[puer aeternus]]'', or "eternal boy".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Today, often called "[[Puer aeternus#Peter_Pan_syndrome|Peter Pan syndrome]]", it means a person remaining emotionally at that of a teenager or even a child. It is derived from the traditional archetypal "eternal boy", [[Peter Pan]].

One of the most well-known and extreme cases of Peter Pan syndrome and the kidult mentality is [[Michael Jackson]]. Michael explicitly stated that he did not want to grow up and he owned an impressive collection of arcade video games, toy cars and fantasy and sci-fi memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fameable.com/kidults-market/2228/ "Kidults, the adultescent market"], Fameable, February 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, there was reporting that for an adult to have interests traditionally expected only from children is not necessarily an anomaly.&lt;ref name=reju/&gt; The entertainment industry was quick to recognize the trend, and introduced a special category, "kidult", of things marketable for kids and adults alike.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/forty-year-old-virgins-94401 "Forty-Year-Old Virgins"], by Tony Dokoupil, December 15, 2007

*''Quote'': "[[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy became the first children's book ever to win an adult fiction prize (the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread]])"&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that [[Disneyland]] is among the world's top adult (without kids) vacation destinations&lt;ref name=ki/&gt; seem to indicate that "kidulthood" is a rather mainstream phenomenon. And unlike ''puer aeternus'', "rejuveniles" successfully marry adult responsibilities with non-adult interests.&lt;ref name=ki/&gt; When [[Christopher Noxon]] appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on June 29, 2006, he remarked that "There's a big difference between childish and childlike".

In South Korea, the buzzword "kideolteu" was used in 2015, highlighting the market trend of increasing toy sales (such as drones and "electric wheels") to kidults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://besuccess.com/2015/11/drone-electricwheel/|title = 연말 유통 트랜드 분석, ‘드론, 전동휠’ 아웃도어 키덜트 제품 인기|date = 2015-11-30|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = be|first = success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''linguistic performance''' was used by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1960 to describe "the actual use of language in concrete situations".&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, P. H. "performance." Oxford Reference. 30 Oct. 2014. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-2494.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used to describe both the [[Language production|production]], sometimes called '' parole'', as well as the comprehension of language.&lt;ref name =":Reishaan"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Reishaan| first = Abdul-Hussein Kadhim| authorlink = Abdul-Hussein Kadhim Reishaan| title = The Relationship between Competence and Performance: Towards a Comprehensive TG Grammar| journal = اداب الكـوفة | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | date = 2008 | url = http://www.journals.uokufa.edu.iq/index.php/kufa_arts/article/download/108/pdf_20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance is defined in opposition to "[[Linguistic competence|competence]]"; the latter describes the mental knowledge that a speaker or listener has of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Carlson| first = Marvin| author-link = Marvin Carlson | title = Performance: A Critical Introduction| edition = revised| publisher = Routledge| year = 2013| url = https://books.google.com/?id=9MJdAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=linguistic+performance| isbn = 9781136498657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the motivation for the distinction between performance and competence comes from [[speech error]]s: despite having a perfect understanding of the correct forms, a speaker of a language may unintentionally produce incorrect forms. This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences. For example, distractions or memory limitations can affect lexical retrieval (Chomsky 1965:3), and give rise to errors in both production and perception&lt;ref name =":Myers"&gt;{{Citation| last = Myers| first = David G.| author-link = David G.

Such non-linguistic factors are completely independent of the actual knowledge of language,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Noam Chomsky.(2006).''Language and Mind Third Edition''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-85819-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establish that speakers' knowledge of language (their competence) is distinct from their actual use of language (their performance).&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1965 4"&gt;{{Citation| last = Chomsky| first = Noam| author-link = Noam Chomsky| title = Aspects of the Theory of Syntax| publisher =| year = 1965| page = 4| isbn = 0-262-53007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Langue versus parole ===
{{main|Langue and parole}}Published in 1916, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' describes [[language]] as ''"a system of signs that express ideas".''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  de Saussure describes two components of language: [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']]. ''Langue'' consists of the structural relations that define a language, which includes [[grammar]], [[syntax]] and [[phonology]]. ''Parole'' is the physical manifestation of [[sign (linguistics)|sign]]s; in particular the concrete manifestation of ''langue'' as [[speech]] or [[writing]]. While ''langue'' can be viewed strictly as a system of rules, it is not an absolute system such that ''parole'' must utterly conform to ''langue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image and Representation: Key Concepts in Media Studies|last = Lacey|first = Nick|publisher = Palgrave|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing an analogy to chess, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|de Saussure]] compares ''langue'' to the rules of chess that define how the game should be played, and ''parole'' to the individual choices of a player given the possible moves allowed within the system of rules.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Competence versus performance ===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}

Proposed in the 1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]], [[generative grammar]] is an analysis approach to language as a structural framework of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;A Chomsky, Noam (1956). "Three Models for the Description of Language". IRE Transactions on Information Theory 2 (2): 113 123.doi:10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813.&lt;/ref&gt; Through formal analysis of components such as [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[semantics]] and [[phonology]], a [[generative grammar]] seeks to model the implicit linguistic knowledge with which speakers determine [[grammaticality]].

In [[transformational grammar|transformational generative grammar theory]], [[Chomsky]] distinguishes between two components of [[language production]]: [[Linguistic competence|competence]] and performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Linguistic competence|Competence]] describes the mental knowledge of a language, the speaker's intrinsic understanding of sound-meaning relations as established by linguistic rules. '''Performance''' – that is the actual observed use of language – involves more factors than phonetic-semantic understanding. Performance requires extra-linguistic knowledge such as an awareness of the speaker, audience and the context, which crucially determines how speech is constructed and analyzed. It is also governed by principles of cognitive structures not considered aspects of language, such as [[memory]], [[distractions]], [[attention]], and [[speech errors]].

=== I-Language versus E-Language ===
In 1986, [[Chomsky]] proposed a distinction similar to the competence/performance distinction, entertaining the notion of an [[i-language|I-Language (internal language)]] which is the intrinsic linguistic knowledge within a native speaker and [[E-language|E-Language (external language)]] which is the observable linguistic output of a speaker. It was I-Language that [[Chomsky]] argued should be the focus of inquiry, and not E-Language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1986).Knowledge of Language. New York:Praeger. {{ISBN|0-275-90025-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

E-language has been used to describe the application of artificial systems, such as in [[calculus]], [[set theory]] and with [[natural language]] viewed as sets, while performance has been used purely to describes applications of natural language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chomsky: Ideas and Ideals|last = Smith|first = Neilson Voyne|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = 37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between I-Language and [[Linguistic competence|competence]], I-Language refers to our intrinsic faculty for language, competence is used by Chomsky as an informal, general term, or as term with reference to a specific competency such as "grammatical competence" or "pragmatic competence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Performance-grammar correspondence hypothesis==

[[John A. Hawkins (linguist)|John A. Hawkins]]'s Performance-Grammar Correspondence Hypothesis (PGCH) states that the syntactic structures of [[grammar]]s are conventionalized based on whether and how much the structures are preferred in performance.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=John A.|title=Efficiency and Complexity in Grammars|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-199-25268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance preference is related to structure complexity and [[sentence processing|processing]], or comprehension, efficiency.  Specifically, a complex structure refers to a structure containing more linguistic elements or words at the end of the structure than at the beginning. It is this structural complexity that results in decreased processing efficiency since more structure requires additional processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt; This model seeks to explain word order across languages based on avoidance of unnecessary complexity in favour of increased processing efficiency. Speakers make an automatic calculation of the [[Immediate constituent analysis|Immediate Constituent(IC)]]-to-word order ratio and produce the structure with the highest ratio.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;  Structures with a high IC-to-word order are structures that contain the fewest number of words required for the listener to parse the structure into constituents which results in more efficient processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

===Head-initial structures===
In [[head (linguistics)|head-initial structures]], which includes example [[Subject-verb-object|SVO]] and VSO word order, the speaker's goal is to order the sentence constituents from least to most complex.

====SVO word order====
SVO word order can be exemplified with English; consider the example sentences in (1). In (1a) three immediate constituents (ICs) are present in the [[verb phrase]], namely VP, PP1 and PP2, and there are four words (''went, to, London, in'') required to parse the VP into its constituents. Therefore, the IC-to-word ratio is 3/4=75%. In contrast, in (1b) the VP is still composed of three ICs but there are now six words that are required to determine the constituent structure of the VP (''went, in, the, late, afternoon, to''). Thus, the ratio for (1b) is 3/6 = 50%. Hawkins proposes that speakers prefer to produce (1a) since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio and this leads to faster and more efficient processing.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

   1a.  ''John'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''''went''''' [&lt;sub&gt;PP1&lt;/sub&gt; '''''to London'''''] [&lt;sub&gt;PP2&lt;/sub&gt; '''''in''' the late afternoon'']]
   1b.  ''John'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''''went''''' [&lt;sub&gt;PP2&lt;/sub&gt; '''''in the late afternoon''''']] [[&lt;sub&gt;PP1&lt;/sub&gt; '''''to''' London'']]

Hawkins supports the above analysis by providing performance data to demonstrate the preference speakers have for ordering short phrases before long phrases when producing head-initial structures. The table based on English data, below, illustrates that the short [[Preposition and postposition|prepositional phrase]] (PP1) is preferentially ordered before the long PP (PP2) and that this preference increases as the size differential between the two PPs increases.  For example, 60% of the sentences are ordered short (PP1) to long (PP2) when PP2 was longer than PP1 by 1 word. In contrast, 99% of the sentences are ordered short to long when PP2 is longer than PP1 by 7+ words.

&lt;small&gt;PP2 = longer PP; PP1=shorter PP. Proportion of short-long to long-short as 
a percentage; actual numbers of sequences in parentheses. An additional 
71 sequences had PPs of equal length (total n=394)&lt;/small&gt;

====VSO word order====
Hawkins argues that the preference for short followed by long phrases applies to all languages that have head-initial structuring. This includes languages with [[Verb-subject-object|VSO]] word order such as from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].  By calculating the IC-to-word ratio for the Hungarian sentences in the same way as was done for the [[English language|English]] sentences, 2a. emerges as having a higher ratio than 2b.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

  2a.  ''VP['''Döngetik''' NP['''facipöink''' NP['''az''' utcakat] ]''
         ''batter   wooden shoes-1PL  the streets-ACC''
         ''Our wooden shoes batter the streets''
  2b.  ''VP['''Döngetik''' NP['''az utcakat'''] NP[[ '''facipöink''' ] ]''

The Hungarian performance data (below) show the same preference pattern as the English data. This study looked at the ordering of two successive [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) and found that the shorter NP followed by the longer NP is preferred in performance, and that this preference increases as the size differential between NP1 and NP2 increases.

&lt;small&gt;mNP = any NP constructed on its left periphery. 
NP2 = longer NP; NP1 = shorter NP. Proportion of short-long
to long-short given as a percentage; actual numbers of sequences 
given in parentheses. An additional 21 sequences had NPs of equal length
(total n = 16).&lt;/small&gt;

===Head-final structures===
Hawkins' explanation of performance and word order extends to head-final structures. For example, since [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is a [[subject-object-verb|SOV]] language the head (V) is at the end of the sentence. This theory predicts that speakers will prefer to order the phrases in head-final sentences from long phrases to short, as opposed to short to long as seen in head-initial languages.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;  This reversal of ordering preference is due to the fact that in head-final sentences it is the long followed by short phrasal ordering that has the higher IC-to-word ratio.

   3a. ''Tanaka ga vp[pp[Hanako '''kara''']np['''sono''' '''hon o'''] '''katta''']''
       ''Tanaka NOM  Hanako from that book ACC bought''
        ''Tanako bought that book from Hanako'' 
   3b. ''Tanaka ga vp[np[sono hon '''o'''] pp['''Hanako kara'''] ['''katta''']''

The VP and its constituents in 4. are constructed from their heads on the right. This means that the number of words used to calculate the ratio is counted from the head of the first phrase (PP in 3a. and NP in 3b.) to the verb (as indicated in bold above). The IC-to-word ratio for the VP in 3a. is 3/5=60% while the ratio for the VP in 3b. is 3/4=75%. Therefore, 3b. should be preferred by Japanese speakers since it has a higher IC-to-word ratio which leads to faster parsing of sentences by the listener.&lt;ref name="Hawkins2004" /&gt;

The performance preference for long to short phrase ordering in SVO languages is supported by performance data. The table below shows that production of long to short phrases is preferred and that this preference increases as the size of the differential between the two phrases increases. For example, ordering of the longer 2ICm (where ICm is either a direct object NP with an accusative case particle or a PP constructed from the right periphery) before the shorter 1ICm is more frequent, and the frequency increases to 91% if the 2ICm is longer than the 1ICm by 9+ words.

==Utterance planning hypothesis==

[[Tom Wasow]] proposes that word order arises as a result of utterance planning benefiting the speaker.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasow|first=Thomas|title=Postverbal behavior|year=2002|publisher=Centre for the Study of Language and Information|volume =lecture notes, No. 145|isbn=978-1-57586-401-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduces the concepts of early versus late commitment, where commitment is the point in the utterance where it becomes possible to predict subsequent structure.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Specifically, early commitment refers to the commitment point present earlier in the utterance and late commitment refers to the commitment point present later in the utterance.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; He explains that early commitment will favour the listener since early prediction of subsequent structure enables faster processing.  Comparatively, late commitment will favour the speaker by postponing decision making, giving the speaker more time to plan the utterance.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Wasow illustrates how utterance planning influences syntactic word order by testing early versus late commitment in [[Heavy NP shift|heavy-NP shifted]] (HNPS) sentences. The idea is to examine the patterns of HNPS to determine if the performance data show sentences that are structured to favour the speaker or the listener.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

===Examples of early/late commitment and heavy-NP shift===

The following examples illustrate what is meant by early versus late commitment and how heavy-NP shift applies to these sentences. Wasow looked at two types of verbs:&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

Vt ([[transitive verbs]]): require NP objects.

     4a. ''Pat VP[brought NP[a box with a ribbon around it] PP[ [to the party] ] ''
     4b. ''Pat VP[brought PP[to the party] NP[ [a box with a ribbon around it] ] ''

In 4a. no heavy-NP shift has been applied.  The NP is available early but does not provide any additional information about the sentence structure – the "to" appearing late in the sentence is an example of late commitment. In contrast, in 4b., where heavy-NP shift has shifted the NP to the right, as soon as "to" is uttered the listener knows that the VP must contain the NP and a PP. In other words, when "to" is uttered it allows the listener to predict the remaining structure of the sentence early on. Thus for transitive verbs HNPS results in early commitment and favors the listener.

Vp ([[prepositional verbs]]): can take an NP object or an immediately following PP with no NP object

     5a. ''Pat VP[wrote NP[something about Chris] PP[ [on the blackboard]].''
     5b. ''Pat VP[wrote PP[on the blackboard] NP[ [something about Chris.]] ''

No HNPS has been applied to 5a. In 5b. the listener needs to hear the word "something" in order to know that the utterance contains a PP and an NP since the object NP is optional but "something" has been shifted to later in the sentence. Thus for prepositional verbs HNPS results in late commitment and favours the speaker.

===Predictions and findings===

Based on the above information Wasow predicted that if sentences are constructed from the speaker's perspective then heavy-NP shift would rarely apply to sentences containing a transitive verb but would apply frequently to sentences containing a prepositional verb. The opposite prediction was made if sentences are constructed from the listener's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt;

{|  class="wikitable"
|-
!       !!Speaker's Perspective    !! Listener's Perspective
|-
| Vt    ||Heavy-NP shift= rare                || Heavy-NP shift= relatively common
|-
| Vp    ||Heavy-NP shift= relatively common   || Heavy-NP shift =very rare
|}

To test his predictions Wasow analyzed performance data (from corpora data) for the rates of occurrence of HNPS for Vt and Vp and found HNPS occurred twice as frequently in Vp than in Vt, therefore supporting the predictions made from the speaker's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; In contrast, he did not find evidence in support of the predictions made based on the listener's perspective. In other words, given the data above, when HNPS is applied to sentences containing a transitive verb the result favors the listener. Wasow found that HNPS applied to transitive verb sentences is rare in performance data thus supporting the speaker's perspective. Additionally, when HNPS is applied to prepositional verb structures the result favors the speaker. In his study of the performance data, Wasow found evidence of HNPS frequently applied to prepositional verb structures further supporting the speaker's perspective.&lt;ref name="Wasow2002" /&gt; Based on these findings Wasow concludes that HNPS is correlated with the speaker's preference for late commitment thereby demonstrating how speaker performance preference can influence word order.

==Alternative grammar models==
While the dominant views of grammar are largely oriented towards competence, many, including Chomsky himself, have argued that a complete model of grammar should be able to account for performance data.  But while Chomsky argues that competence should be studied first, thereby allowing further study of performance,&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1965 4"/&gt; some systems, such as [[constraint grammar]]s are built with performance as a starting point (comprehension, in the case of constraint grammars&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Karlsson | first = Fred | author-link = Fred Karlsson | last2 = Voutilainen | first2 =  Atro  | author2-link =  Atro Voutilainen|last3 = Heikkilae|first3 = Juha|author-link3 = Juha Heikkilae|last4 = Anttila|first4 = Arto|author-link4 = | title = Constraint Grammar: A Language-Independent System for Parsing Unrestricted Text  | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | origyear = |date=January 1995  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=2avNr3SPtyEC&amp;dq=Constraint+Grammar:+A+Language-Independent+System+for+Parsing+Unrestricted+Text | isbn = 9783110882629}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional models of generative grammar have had a great deal of success in describing the structure of languages, they have been less successful in describing how language is interpreted in real situations.  For example, traditional grammar describes a sentence as having an "underlying structure" which is different from the "surface structure" which speakers actually produce.  In a real conversation, however, a listener interprets the meaning of a sentence in real time, as the surface structure goes by.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sag, I. A. &amp; Wasow, T., 2011. [https://www.academia.edu/download/39233619/0fcfd50d1eb7c4aa9d000000.pdf Performance-Compatible Competence Grammar]. In: R. Borsley &amp; K. Börjars, eds. Non-Transformational Syntax: Formal and Explicit Models of Grammar. s.l.:John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 359-377.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of on-line processing, which accounts for phenomena such as finishing another person's sentence, and starting a sentence without knowing how it is going to finish, is not directly accounted for in traditional generative models of grammar.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Several alternative grammar models exist which may be better able to capture this surface-based aspect of linguistic performance, including
[[Constraint Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]].

==Errors in linguistic performance==

Errors in linguistic performance not only occur in children newly acquiring their native language, second language learners, those with a disability or an acquired brain injury but among competent speakers as well. Types of performance errors that will be of focus here are those that involve errors in [[syntax]], other types of errors can occur in the [[Phonology|phonological]], [[Semantics|semantic]] features of words, for further information see [[speech errors]]. Phonological and semantic errors can be due to the repetition of words, mispronunciations, limitations in verbal [[working memory]], and length of the [[utterance]].&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Crain|author2=Rosalind Thornton|title=Investigations in Universal Grammar: A Guide to Experiments on the Acquisition of Syntax and Semantics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwDS0vlTepwC|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-53180-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slips of the tongue are most common in spoken languages and occur when the speaker either: says something they did not mean to; produces the incorrect order of sounds or words; or uses the incorrect word.&lt;ref name="Menn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lise Menn|title=Psycholinguistics: Introduction and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1F6GQAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Plural Pub.|isbn=978-1-59756-283-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of errors in linguistic performance are slips of the hand in [[Sign language|signed languages]], slips of the ear which are errors in comprehension of utterances and slips of the pen which occur while writing. Errors of linguistic performance are perceived by both the speaker and the listener and can therefore have many interpretations depending on the persons judgement and the context in which the sentence was spoken.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montserrat Sanz|author2=Itziar Laka|author3=Michael K. Tanenhaus|title=Language Down the Garden Path: The Cognitive and Biological Basis for Linguistic Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YhuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2|date=29 August 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967713-9|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is proposed that there is a close relation between the linguistic units of grammar and the psychological units of speech which implies that there is a relation between linguistic rules and the psychological processes that create utterances.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Fromkin|title=Errors in linguistic performance: slips of the tongue, ear, pen, and hand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UG95AAAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-268980-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in performance can occur at any level of these psychological processes. [[Lise Menn]] proposes that there are five levels of processing in speech production, each with its own possible error that could occur.&lt;ref name="Menn2011"/&gt; According to the proposed speech processing structure by Menn an error in the syntactic properties of an utterance occurs at the '''positional level'''.
#Message Level
#Functional Level
#Positional Level
#Phonological Encoding
#Speech Gesture

Another proposal for the levels of speech processing is made by [[Willem Levelt|Willem J. M. Levelt]] to be structured as so:&lt;ref name="Levelt1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem J. M. Levelt|title=Speaking: From Intention to Articulation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbVCdCE-NQAC|year=1993|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-62089-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Conceptualization
#Formulation
#Articulation
#Self-Monitoring
Levelt (1993) states that we as speakers are unaware of most of these levels of performance such as '''articulation''', which includes the [[Manner of articulation|movement]] and [[Place of articulation|placement]] of the articulators, the '''formulation''' of the utterance which includes the words selected and their pronunciation and the rules which must be followed for the utterance to be grammatical. The levels speakers are consciously aware is the intent of the message which occurs at the level of '''conceptualization''' and then again at '''self-monitoring''' which is when the speaker would become aware of any errors that may have occurred and correct themselves.&lt;ref name="Levelt1993"/&gt;

===Slips of the tongue===

One type of slip of the tongue which cause an error in the syntax of the utterance are called '''transformational errors'''. [[Transformational grammar|Transformational]] errors are a mental operation proposed by [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] in his Transformational Hypothesis and it has three parts which errors in performance can occur. These transformations are applied at the level of the underlying structures and predict the ways in which an error can occur.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; 
*Structural analysis
*Structural Change
*Conditions

'''Structural Analysis'''
errors can occur due to the application of (a) the rule misanalyzing the tense marker causing the rule to apply incorrectly, (b) the rule not being applied when it should or (c) a rule being applied when it should not.

This example from [[Victoria Fromkin|Fromkin]] (1980) demonstrates a rule misanalyzing the tense marker and for subject-auxiliary inversion to be incorrectly applied. The [[subject-auxiliary inversion]] is misanalyzed as to which structure it applies, applying without the verb ''be'' in the tense as it moves to the C position. This causes "[[do-support]]" to occur and the verb to lack tense causing the syntactic error.

The following example from Fromkin (1980) demonstrates how a rule is being applied when it should not. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule is omitted in the error utterance, causing affix-hopping to occur and putting the tense onto the verb "say" creating the syntactic error. In the target the subject-auxiliary rule and then do-support applies creating the grammatically correct structure.
     7a. Error: And what he said?
     7b. Target: And what did he say?

'''Structural Change'''
Errors can occur in the carrying out of rules, even though the analysis of the phrase marker is done correctly. This can occur when the analysis requires multiple rules to occur.

The following example from Fromkin (1980) shows the relative clause rule copies the [[determiner phrase]] "a boy" within the [[Relative clause|clause]] and this causes front attaching to the Wh-marker. Deletion is then skipped, leaving the determiner phrase in the clause in the error utterance causing it to be ungrammatical. 
     9a. Error: A boy who I know a boy has hair down to here.
     9b. Target: A boy who I know has hair down to here.

'''Conditions''' errors restrict when the rule can and cannot be applied.

This last example from Fromkin (1980) shows that a rule was applied under a certain condition in which it is restricted. The subject-auxiliary inversion rule cannot apply to embedded clauses. In the case of this example it has causing for the syntactic error.

===Slips of the hand===
The linguistic components of [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) can be broken down into four parts; the hand configuration, place of articulation, movement and other minor parameters. '''Hand configuration''' is determined by the shape of the hand, fingers and thumbs and is specific to the sign that is being used. It allows the signer to articulate what they are wanting to communicate by extending, flexing, bending or spreading the digits; the position of the thumb to the fingers; or the curvature of the hand. However, there are not an infinite amount of possible hand configurations, there are 19 classes of hand configuration primes as listed by the ''Dictionary of American Sign Language''. '''Place of articulation''' is the particular location that the sign is being performed known as the "signing place". The "signing place" can be the whole face or a particular part of it, the eyes, nose, cheek, ear, neck, trunk, any part of the arm, or the neutral area in front of the signers head and body. '''Movement''' is the most complex as it can be difficult to analyze. Movement is restricted to directional, rotations of the wrist, local movements of the hand and interactions of the hands. These movements can occur singularly, in sequence, or simultaneously. '''Minor parameters''' in ASL include contacting region, orientation and hand arrangement. They are subclasses of hand configuration.
 
Performance errors resulting in ungrammatical signs can result due to processes that change the hand configuration, place, movement or other parameter of the sign. These processes can be anticipation, preservation, or metathesis. '''Anticipation''' is caused when some characteristic of the next sign is incorporated into the sign that is presently being performed. '''Preservation''' is the opposite of anticipation where some characteristic of the preceding sign is carried over into the performance of the next sign. '''Metathesis''' occurs when two characteristics of adjacent signs are combined into one in the performance of both signs.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; Each of these errors will result in an incorrect sign being performed. This could result in either a different sign being performed instead of the intended one, or nonexistent signs which forms are possible and those which forms are not possible due to the structural rules.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; These are the main types of performance errors in sign language however on the rare occasion there is also the possibility of errors in the order of the signs performed resulting in a different meaning than what the signer intended.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt;

===Other types of errors===
'''Unacceptable Sentences'''
are ones which, although are grammatical, are not considered proper utterances. They are considered unacceptable due to the lack of our cognitive systems to process them. Speakers and listeners can be aided in the performance and processing of these sentences by eliminating time and memory constraints, increasing motivation to process these utterances and using pen and paper.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt; In English there are three types of sentences that are grammatical but are considered unacceptable by speakers and listeners.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt;
# Repeated self-embedded clauses: ''The cheese that the rat that the cat chased ate is on the table.''
# Multi Right Branching: ''This is the cat that caught the rat that ate the cheese that is on the table.''
# Ambiguity or Garden Path Sentences: ''The horse raced past the barn fell''
When a speaker makes an utterance they must translate their ideas into words, then syntactically proper phrases with proper pronunciation.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael W. Eysenck|author2=Mark T. Keane|title=Cognitive Psychology: A Student's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk21ehtrE8oC|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-86377-550-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speaker must have prior world knowledge and an understanding of the grammatical rules that their language enforces. When learning a second language or with children acquiring their first language, speakers usually have this knowledge before they are able to produce them.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"/&gt; Their speech is usually slow and deliberate, using phrases they have already mastered, and with practice their skills increase. Errors of linguistic performance are judged by the listener giving many interpretations if an utterance is well-formed or ungrammatical depending on the individual. As well the context in which an utterance is used can determine if the error would be considered or not.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p258"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montserrat Sanz|author2=Itziar Laka|author3=Michael K. Tanenhaus|title=Language Down the Garden Path: The Cognitive and Biological Basis for Linguistic Structures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YhuAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA258|date=29 August 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967713-9|pages=258–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing "Who must telephone her?" and "Who need telephone her?" the former would be considered the ungrammatical phrase. However, when comparing it to "Who want telephone her?" it would be considered the grammatical phrase.&lt;ref name="SanzLaka2013p258" /&gt; The listener may also be the speaker. When repeating sentences with errors if the error is not comprehended then it is performed. As well if the speaker does notice the error in the sentence they are supposed to repeat they are unaware of the difference between their well-formed sentence and the ungrammatical sentence.&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt;
An unacceptable utterance can also be performed due to a brain injury. Three types of brain injuries that could cause errors in performance were studied by Fromkin are dysarthria, apraxia and literal paraphasia. [[Dysarthria]] is a defect in the [[neuromuscular]] connection that involves speech movement. The speech organs involved can be paralyzed or weakened, making it difficult or impossible for the speaker to produce a target utterance. [[Apraxia]] is when there is damage to the ability to initiate speech sounds with no paralysis or weakening of the articulators. Literal [[paraphasia]] causes disorganization of linguistic properties, resulting in errors of [[word order]] of [[phonemes]].&lt;ref name="Fromkin1980"/&gt; Having a brain injury and being unable to perform proper linguistic utterances, some individuals are still able to process complex sentences and formulate syntactically well formed sentences in their mind.&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt;
'''Child productions''' when they are acquiring language are full of errors of linguistic performance. Children must go from imitating adult speech to create new phrases of their own. They will need to use their cognitive operations of the knowledge of their language they are learning to determine the rules and properties of that language.&lt;ref name="EysenckKeane2000"/&gt; The following are examples of errors in English speaking children's productions. 
*"I goed"
*"He runned"

In an elicited production experiment a child, Adam, was prompted to ask questions to an Old Lady&lt;ref name="CrainThornton2000"/&gt;

==Performance measures==

===Mean length of utterance===

The most commonly used measure of syntax complexity is the [[mean length of utterance]], also known as MLU.&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"&gt;Scott, CM &amp; Stokes, SL 1995 'Measures of Syntax in School Age Children and Adolescents', ''Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools'', vol.56, pp. 309-320&lt;/ref&gt;    This measure is independent from how often children talk and focuses on the complexity and development of their grammatical systems, including morphological and syntactic development.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"&gt;Huttenlocher, J, Vasilyeva, M, 
Cymerman, E &amp; Levine, S 2002, 'Language input and child syntax', ''Cognitive Psychology'', vol. 45, pp. 337–374.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number representing a person's MLU corresponds to the complexity of the syntax being used.  In general, as the MLU increases, the syntactic complexity also increases.  Typically, the average MLU corresponds to a child's age due to their increase in working memory, which allows for sentences to be of greater syntactic complexity.&lt;ref name="everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu"&gt;Everyday Language Discovering the Hidden Powers of Speech and Language 2014, ''Morphology and MLU''.  Available from: &lt;http://everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/2014/03/08/morphology-and-mlu/&gt;. [12 November 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the average MLU of a 7 year old child is 7 words.  However, children show more individual variability of syntactic performance with more complex syntax.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"/&gt; Complex syntax have a higher number of phrases and clause levels, therefore adding more words to the overall syntactic structure.  Seeing as there are more individual differences in MLU and syntactic development as children get older, MLU is particularly used to measure grammatical complexity among school-aged children.&lt;ref name="Cymerman, E 2002, pp. 337"/&gt;  Other types of segmentation strategies for discourse are the [[T-unit]] and C-unit (communicative unit).  If these two measurements are used to account for discourse, the average length of the sentence will be lower than if MLU is used alone.  Both the T-units and C-units count each clause as a new unit, hence a lower number of units.

Typical MLU per age group can be found in the following table, according to [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]]'s five stages of syntactic and morphological development:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R 1973, ''A first language: The early stages'', George Allen &amp; Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Stage !! MLU !! Approximate Age (in months)
|-
| 1 || 1.0-2.0 || 12-26
|-
| 2 || 2.0-2.5 || 27-30
|-
| 3 || 2.5-3.0 || 31-34
|-
| 4 || 3.0-3.75 || 35-40
|-
| 5 || 3.75-4.5 || 41-46
|-
| 6 || 4.5+ || 47+
|}
Here are the steps for calculating MLU:&lt;ref name="everydaylanguage.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu"/&gt;

# Acquire a language sample of about 50-100 utterances
# Count the number of [[morphemes]] said by the child, then divide by the number of utterances
# The investigator can assess what stage of syntactic development the child is at, based on their MLU

Here's an example of how to calculate MLU:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Example utterance !! Morpheme and MLU Analysis !! Total MLU
|-
| go home now || go (=1) home (=1) now (=1) || 3
|-
| I live in Billingham || I (=1) live (=1)  in (=1) Billingham (=1) || 4
|-
| Mommy kissed my Daddy || Mommy (=1) kiss (=1) -ed (=1) my (=1) daddy (=1) || 5
|-
| I like your dogs || I (=1) like (=1) your (=1) dog (=1) -s (=1) || 5
|}

In total there are 17 morphemes in this data set.  In order to find the MLU, we divide the total number of morphemes (17) by the total number of utterances (4). In this particular data set, the mean length of utterance is 17/4 = 4.25.&lt;ref&gt;Speech Language Therapy Info 2014, ''Mean Length of Utterance''.  Available from: &lt;http://www.sltinfo.com/mean-length-of-utterance/&gt;. [12 November 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clause density===

Clause density refers to the degree to which utterances contain dependent [[clauses]].  This density is calculated as a ratio of the total number of clauses across sentences, divide by the number of sentences in a discourse sample.&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"/&gt;  For example, if the clause density is 2.0, the ratio would indicate that the sentence being analyzed has 2 clauses on average: one main clause and one subordinate clause.

Here is an example of how clause density is measured, using T-units, adapted from Silliman &amp; Wilkinson 2007:&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, ER &amp; Wilkinson, LC 2007, ''Language and Literacy Learning in Schools''. The Guilford Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! T-unit !! Number of words !! Number of clauses !! Example sentences from a story
|-
| 1 || 12 || 2 || When the night was dark I was watching TV in my room
|-
| 2 || 5 || 1 || I heard a howling noise
|-
| 3 || 3 || 1 || I looked outside
|}

===Indices of syntactic performance===

Indices track structures to show a more comprehensive picture of a person's syntactic complexity.  Some examples of indices are Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax and the Syntactic Complexity Measure.

====Developmental sentence scoring====
Developmental Sentence Scoring is another method to measure syntactic performance as a clinical tool.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"&gt;Rheinhardt, KM 1972, 'The Developmental Sentence Scoring Procedure', ''Independent Studies and Capstones'', vol. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this indice, each consecutive utterance, or sentence, elicited from a child is scored.&lt;ref&gt;Politzer, RL, 1974, 'Developmental Sentence Scoring as a Method of Measuring Second Language Acquisition', ''Modern Language Journal'', vol. 58, no. 5/6, pp. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a commonly applied measurement of syntax for first and [[Second-language acquisition|second language]] learners, with samples gathered from both elicited and spontaneous oral discourse.  Methods for eliciting speech for these samples come in many forms, such having the participant answering questions or re-telling a story.  These elicited conversations are commonly tape-recorded for playback during analysis to see how well the person can incorporate syntax among other linguistic cues.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  For every utterance elicited, the utterance will receive one point if it is a correct form used in adult speech.  A score of 1 indicates the least complex syntactic form in the category, whereas a higher score reflects higher level grammaticality.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  Points are specifically awarded to an utterance based on whether or not it contains any of the eight categories outlined below.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;

Syntactic categories measured by developmental sentence scoring with examples:

   '''[[Indefinite pronouns]]'''
   11a. '''Score of 1:''' it, this, that
   11b. '''Score of 6:''' both, many, several, most, least

   '''Personal [[pronouns]]'''
   12a. '''Score of 1:''' I, me, my, mine, you, your(s)
   12b. '''Score of 6:''' Wh-pronouns (i.e. who, which, what, how) and wh-word + [[infinitive]] (i.e. I know ''what'' to do)

   '''Main [[verb]]'''
   13a. '''Score of 1:''' Uninflected verb (i.e. I "see" you) and copula, is or 's (i.e. It'' 's'' red)
   13b. '''Score of 6:''' Must, shall + verb (i.e. He "must come" or We "shall see"), have + verb + '-en' (i.e. I ''have eaten'')

   '''Secondary [[verb]]'''
   14a. '''Score of 1:''' [[Infinitival]] complements (i.e. I wan"na see" = I want ''to see'')
   14b. '''Score of 6:''' [[Gerund]] (i.e. ''Swinging'' is fun)

   '''Negatives'''
   15a. '''Score of 1:''' it, this or that + [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] or [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] 'is' or 's + not (i.e. It's "not" mine)
   15b. '''Score of 5:''' Uncontracted negative with 'have' (i.e. I have "not" eaten it), auxiliary'have'-negative contraction (i.e. I had"n't" eaten 
        it), pronoun auxiliary 'have' contraction (i.e. I've "not" eaten it)

   '''[[Conjunctions]]'''
   16a. '''Score of 1:''' and 
   16b. '''Score of 6:''' where, than, how

   '''[[Interrogative]] reversals'''
   17a. '''Score of 1:''' Reversal of copula (i.e. "Is it" red?)
   17b. '''Score of 5:''' Reversal with three auxiliaries (i.e. "Could he" have been going?)

   '''[[Wh-questions]]'''
   18a. '''Score of 1:''' who or what (i.e. "What" do you mean?), what + noun (i.e. "What book" are you reading?)
   18b. '''Score of 5:''' whose or which (i.e. "Which" do you want?), which + noun (i.e. "Which book" do you want?)

In particular, those categories that appear the earliest in speech receive a lower score, whereas later-appearing categories receive a higher score.  If an entire sentence is correct according to adult-like forms, then the utterance would receive an extra point.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  The eight categories above are the most commonly used structures in syntactic formation, thus structures such as possessives, articles, plurals, prepositional phrases, adverbs and descriptive adjectives were omitted and not scored.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  Additionally, the scoring system is arbitrary when applied to certain structures.  For example, there is no indication as to why "if" would receive four points rather than five.  The scores of all the utterances are totalled in the end of the analysis and then averaged to get a final score.  This means that the individual's final score reflects their entire syntactic complexity level, rather than syntactic level in a specific category.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;  The main advantage of development sentence scoring is that the final score represents the individual's general syntactic development and allows for easier tracking of changes in language development, making this tool effective for longitudinal studies.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt 1972"/&gt;

====Index of productive syntax====

Similar to Development Sentence Scoring, the Index of Productive Syntax evaluates the grammatical complexity of spontaneous language samples.  After age 3, Index of Productive Syntax becomes more widely used than MLU to measure syntactic complexity in children.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, A, Sagae, K, MacWhinney, B, 'Automatic Measurement of Syntactic Development in Child Language', ''Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics'', pp.197-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is because at around age 3, MLU does not distinguish between children of similar language competency as well as Index of Productive Syntax does.  For this reason, MLU is initially used in early childhood development to track syntactic ability, then Index of Productive Syntax is used to maintain validity.  Individual utterances in a discourse sample are scored based on the presence of 60 different syntactic forms, placed more generally under four subscales: [[noun phrase]], [[verb phrase]], question/negation and sentence structure forms.&lt;ref&gt;Springer Reference 2014, Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn). Available from: &lt;http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/333184.html&gt;. [26 October 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;  After a sample is recorded, a corpus is then formed based on 100 utterance transcriptions with 60 different language structures being measured in each utterance.  Not included in the corpus are imitations, self-repetitions and routines, which constitute language that does not represent productive language usage.&lt;ref name="Moyle, M 2013"&gt;Moyle, M &amp; Long, S 2013, 'Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn)', ''Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders'', pp. 1566-1568&lt;/ref&gt;  In each of the four sub-scales previously mentioned, the first two unique occurrences of a form are scored.  After this, occurrences of a sub-scale are not scored.  However, if a child has mastered a complex syntax structure earlier than expected, they will receive extra points.&lt;ref name="Moyle, M 2013"/&gt;

====Standardized tests====

The six main tasks in standardized testing for syntax:&lt;ref name="Scott, CM pp. 309-320"/&gt;
*What is the level of syntactic complexity?
*What specific syntactic structures are found? (a syntactic content analysis)
*Are specific structures representative of what is known about syntactic development within the age range of standardization sample?
*What are the processing requirements of the test format? (a task analysis)
*Are processing requirements similar to or different from language processing in more naturalistic contexts?
*Is syntactic ability in naturalistic language predicted by performance on the test?

Some of the common standardized tests for measuring syntactic performance are the TOLD-2 Intermediate (Test of Language Development), the TOAL-2 (Test of Adolescent Language) and the CELF-R (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Revised Screening Test).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Task being tested !! TOLD-2 Intermediate !! TOAL-2 !! CELF-R
|-
| Listening || Grammaticality Judgement (hears 1 sentence: judges correct/incorrect) || Syntactic Paraphrase (hears 3 sentences; marks 2 with similar meaning) || 
|-
| Speaking || Sentence Combining (hears 2-4 sentences, says 1 sentence that combines input sentences) || Sentence Imitation (hears 1 sentence, repeats verbatim) || Formulating Sentences (hears 1-2 words and sees a picture;  makes up a sentence using words), Imitating Sentences (hears 1 sentence, repeats verbatim), Scrambled Sentences (hears/sees/reads sentence components out of order; says 2 different recorded/correct versions)
|-
| Reading ||  || Syntactic paraphrase (read 5 sentences; marks 2 with similar meaning) || 
|-
| Writing ||  || Sentence combining (reads 2-6 sentences; writes 1 sentence that combines input sentences) || 
|}

'''''MacGyver''''' is an American action-adventure television series created by [[Lee David Zlotoff]] and starring [[Richard Dean Anderson]] as the title character. [[Henry Winkler]] and [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] were the executive producers. The show ran for seven seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States and various other [[television network|networks]] abroad from 1985 to 1992. The series was filmed in Los Angeles during seasons one, two, and seven, and in [[Vancouver]] during seasons three through six. The show's final episode aired on April 25, 1992 on ABC (the network aired a previously unseen episode for the first time on May 21, 1992, but it was originally intended to air before the series finale).

The series was a moderate ratings success and gained a loyal following. It was popular in the United States and around the world. Two television movies, ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis]]'' and ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday]]'', aired on ABC in 1994. A spin-off series, ''Young MacGyver,'' was planned in 2003, but only the pilot was made. Merchandise for ''MacGyver'' includes games, toys, print media and an original audio series.

A [[MacGyver (2016 TV series)|reboot series of the same name]] premiered on September 23, 2016 on [[CBS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/cbs-fall-premiere-dates-2016-1201776569/|title=CBS Sets Fall 2016 Premiere Dates, Slates JonBenet Ramsey kLimited Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 21, 2016|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which today owns the rights to the series through its acquisition of the original [[Paramount Television]].

==Plot==
The show follows [[secret agent]] [[Angus MacGyver]], played by [[Richard Dean Anderson]], who works as a [[Troubleshooting|troubleshooter]] for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States government agency, the ''Department of External Services'' (DXS). Educated as a scientist in [[Physics]] at Western Tech ("Hell Week"), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a [[Bomb squad|Bomb Team Technician]]/EOD during the [[Vietnam War]] ("Countdown"). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the [[physical science]]s, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present [[Swiss Army knife]],&lt;!-- need a citation stating each timestamp  --&gt; [[duct tape]], and occasionally matches&lt;!-- need citation with each timestamp --&gt;. He favors non-violent resolutions and prefers not to handle a gun due to a gun death of one of his friends in his teenage years.

His main asset is his practical application of scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problems{{nsmdns}}often in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices in a matter of minutes{{nsmdns}}were a major attraction of the show, which was praised{{by whom|date=July 2015}} for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Design News|page= 50|author= Design News Staff|date =December 18, 2001|title= Engineers making a difference; Five engineers find the time to teach kids that engineering is cool}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date= September 2013}} and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in [[real life]] one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix up poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt;

The show often dealt with social issues, though more so in seasons 4–7 than 1–3, which were mostly about MacGyver's adventures working for the United States government and later for the Phoenix Foundation.

There are three exceptions when he uses a gun for its original intended purpose: in the pilot episode, MacGyver is seen firing an AK-47 on a mission in the opening gambit (7:51 into the episode); he holds two kidnappers at gunpoint in the opening scene of episode 10, season one;&lt;ref name="TargetMacGyver"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= | title=Target MacGyver | series= MacGyver | serieslink= |credits = | writers = | network = American Broadcasting Company | season = 1 | number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, is seen using a gun in the TV movie ''Trail to Doomsday''. He is often suspicious of militaristic attitudes within the government; he sees the Los Angeles-based Phoenix Foundation, his employer, as an alternative to more conventional (and violent) means of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="macgyverbook"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pieter Jacobus Fourie |title=Media Studies: Content, audiences, and production |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLiS7_vqB2EC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=macGyver+production#PPA174,M1 |publisher=Google Books |location=|isbn=978-0-7021-5656-4|date=April 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dana Elcar]] as [[Peter Thornton (MacGyver)|Pete Thornton]], MacGyver's boss and best friend. He was an operative at the ''Department of External Services'' (DXS), which is where he is impressed by Mac's ingenuity while tracking down [[Murdoc]] ([[Michael Des Barres]]), an international assassin and master of disguise. When Thornton becomes director of operations at the ''Phoenix Foundation'' several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various tasks for the foundation, Thornton is many times forced to bail MacGyver out of the trouble he gets into. Thornton has a son named Michael. Late in the show it is learned that Pete has [[glaucoma]], an element written in because of Elcar developing glaucoma in real life. [[Dana Elcar]] is first cast in the pilot episode as Andy Colson, the Chief of Operations at the KIVA Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/andy_colson.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919122954/http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/andy_colson.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 19, 2014 |title=MacGyver Online: Andy Colson |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bruce McGill]] as [[Jack Dalton (MacGyver)|Jack Dalton]], MacGyver's comical best friend. He is a soldier of fortune/bush pilot who periodically gets everyone into a heap of trouble with various get rich quick schemes that only MacGyver can get them out of. His left eye twitches when he's lying. Dalton often attempts to romance the women he is introduced to.

== Production ==
===Development===
While creating the series ''MacGyver'', [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] was working on the sitcom ''Mr. Sunshine'' for ABC, which was short-lived and cancelled quickly. [[Henry Winkler]] had just finished off his eleven-year run on ''[[Happy Days]]'' and was looking for another project. [[Lee David Zlotoff]] was working as a producer for ''[[Remington Steele]]'', which was airing on NBC. The three got together to form the basis for ''MacGyver'' and sold the idea to [[Paramount Television|Paramount]], and ABC became interested in the series.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich" /&gt;

===Filming===
The series was filmed in [[Southern California]] for its first two seasons and again in its final season. From seasons 3-6, it was filmed in various locations around [[Vancouver]] in British Columbia, Canada.&lt;ref name="filmingcanada"&gt;{{cite web|author=Canadaka |title=TV Series Filmed in Canada |url=http://www.canadaka.net/content/page/127-tv-series-filmed-in-canada |work=Canadaka.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles remained as the setting of the show for the entire duration.  The move to Vancouver was due to the threat of the series being cancelled due to the high production cost. In seasons 1 and 2, MacGyver was portrayed living in a waterfront apartment in [[Venice Beach, California|Venice Beach]]. In season 3, he moved onto a houseboat at an unspecified location, though implied still to be in Los Angeles (the actual shooting took place at [[Coal Harbour]], near downtown Vancouver). Filming returned to Los Angeles for the final season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/locations.html|title=MacGyver Online: Filming Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
When the series was in pre-production, Winkler and Rich were looking for a suitable actor for the lead.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich" /&gt; After Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in the American television series ''[[The Love Boat]]'', Winkler got Anderson to audition for the part.&lt;ref name="casting"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brady |first=James |title=In Step With Richard Dean Anderson |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/98-12-27.htm |date=December 27, 1998 |publisher=Parade Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927080959/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/98-12-27.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rich, every auditioning actor "hulked" his way through his audition. When Anderson eventually auditioned for the role, Winkler and Rich felt that he gave the character a human touch which the other actors could not. Both believed that Anderson would become one of the new "breakout" stars on American television.&lt;ref name="macgyverbookrich"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rich |title=Warm Up the Snake |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIW4EVwj1egC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=macGyver+richard%20dean%20anderson#PPA161,M1 |work=Google Books |accessdate=May 14, 2009|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-11578-5|date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is known for having done many of the stunts in the series, though in later seasons he reduced his participation because of accumulating injuries. He injured his back and required foot surgery because of accidents working as a stuntman.&lt;ref name="stuntman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenstein |first1=Lindsay |last2=Giles |first2=Laura |last3=Bogdan |first3=Alex |title=Kidsday: Talking with Richard Dean Anderson |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/90-02-04.htm |date=February 4, 1990 |publisher=Newsday |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081005/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/90-02-04.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes}}
{{:List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes}}

Several episodes, including the pilot, begin with a [[cold open]], finding MacGyver already on a mission. MacGyver often narrates a story from his childhood relating to his current situation. He resolves this situation quickly, and the main story commences after the opening credits. The credits refer to such an opening sequence as the "Opening Gambit"{{nsmdns}}it occurs far more commonly in earlier episodes than in later ones. This segment is often written and directed by a different team than the main story of the episode. After the credits, the main story plays out in standard [[three-act structure]]. In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission but rather in a situation used for [[characterization|character development]]. In the same manner as the "Opening Gambit" sequences, these opening segments often do not directly relate to the main story.

==Broadcast history==
After a slow start in its first season, ''MacGyver'' became a [[sleeper hit]] for ABC in its second season, during which it began a six-year run as the lead-in to ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (the longest such run in history).&lt;ref name="onetwohit"&gt;{{cite web|author=Suzanne Stevens |title=In a fix? Call MacGyver, not the average Joe who plays him |url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/article30.html | date= January 19, 1987 | publisher=People Weekly | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the show's [[MacGyver (1985 TV series, season 4)|fourth season]], Richard Dean Anderson complained that ABC was not marketing the series enough. Saying that the series is "just another action show" for ABC, he further stated that ABC didn't give the series enough promotion.&lt;ref name="thephiladelphia"&gt;{{cite web|author=David Walstad |title=Series gets no respect, star says; Richard Dean Anderson faces his fourth season as MacGyver |url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/article16.html | date= July 24, 1988 | publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''MacGyver's'' seventh season was abbreviated. After the twelfth episode of the season aired on December 30, 1991, ''MacGyver'' disappeared from the ABC schedule and did not return until April 25, 1992 by which point the series had been cancelled. The finale aired that night, with a previously unaired episode following on May 21, 1992. When asked why the series was cancelled, Anderson replied: "The only reason it went off the air was that everybody was ready to move on. I was physically exhausted and had no life."&lt;ref name="iceman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Nollinger |title=Ice Man |url=http://rdanderson.com/archives/1997-07-05.htm | work=TV Guide | date= July 15, 1997 | publisher=TV Guide | accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV films===
In 1994, the series was released in over 70 different worldwide markets.&lt;ref name="producingmacsequal" /&gt; Because of popular demand, two TV-movies were created, both released in 1994. The first movie ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis]]'' premiered in the United States in May. The film was shot in England and Greece. The second movie was entitled ''[[List of MacGyver (1985 TV series) episodes#TV films (1994)|MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday]]''. Anderson served as [[executive producer]] for both films,&lt;ref name="producingmacsequal"&gt;{{cite web |first=Susan |last=King |title=Richard Dean Anderson producing Macsequels |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/94-05-08.htm |date=May 8, 1994 |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081143/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/94-05-08.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were filmed in Europe.&lt;ref name="anewimageformacgyver"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jerry |last=Buck |title=A New Image for MacGyver |url=http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/92-12-14.htm |date=December 14, 1992 |publisher=The Wichita Eagle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927081155/http://www.rdanderson.com/archives/92-12-14.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndication and home media==
Re-runs of the series still air in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Ethiopia. Alongside local syndication, reruns aired on the [[USA Network]] from 1990 to 1997, on [[WGN America]] from 1998 to 2002, on [[TV Land]] from January 2003 to 2006, on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] for a brief time in 2005. It is formerly aired on [[Cloo]] (2011–2017) with marathon blocks shown on the weekends and on May 13, 2015, [[Esquire Network]] started airing reruns of the series.  [[MeTV Network]] has acquired some rights to air the series as of December 2, 2015.

[[Paramount Home Entertainment]] has released all seven seasons of ''MacGyver'' on DVD in  [[Dvd region code|Regions]] 1, 2 and 4.

The June 21 press release confirmed that the first three seasons had been completed, with the remaining four to be remastered before the end of 2018. The press release also included a teaser showcasing the notable improvement in quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.home.cbssi.com/news-press-details/the-original-macgyver-hd-remastered/ CBS Press Release, June 21 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season was eventually released on October 30, 2018.

==Impact==
{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by MacGyver|MacGyver in popular culture}}

The character's ability to use everyday objects to perform extraordinary feats (sometimes called "MacGyvering") has been widely referenced and parodied. There have been a few comedic [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of the show, such as ''[[Saturday Night Live|Saturday Night Live's]]'' "[[MacGruber]]," which later was made into a full feature film named ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]'', and a parody of the song "[[Hey There Delilah]]", which was given the name "Hey There MacGyver."

The series is referenced in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', primarily detailing the obsession [[Marge Simpson|Marge Simpson's]] sisters ([[Patty Bouvier|Patty]] and [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]]) have with the show and their [[Limerence|crush]] on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing of the show is an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode "[[Black Widower]]". The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. ("Don't thank me. Thank the moon's [[gravitational pull]].")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=A Star Is Burns |episodelink=A Star Is Burns |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |airdate=1995-03-05 |season=6 |number=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another episode, "[[A Star is Burns]]", Homer tricks [[The Critic|Jay Sherman]] into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the rain gutter by his underpants, and Bart asks "You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?" Anderson himself is an avid fan of ''The Simpsons'', and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled "[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]", which first aired April 9, 2006, where Patty and Selma kidnap Richard Dean Anderson after he admits that he never liked doing ''MacGyver'' and only did the show for the money, but eventually gets a thrill out of escaping and annoys them by wanting to do it again and again.

In the first episode of Anderson's later show, ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', [[Amanda Tapping]] mentions that the Air Force had to "MacGyver" a Dial Home Device for the Stargate, and a split-second shot following this shows Anderson twitching an eyebrow. (However, this line was removed when this episode was re-released in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods – Final Cut review|url=http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=99007|publisher=ReviewStream.com|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) There is a blooper reel where Tapping's character, who is trapped with Anderson's character on a glacier, begins ranting about how "we got belt buckles, shoelaces and a piece of gum. Build a nuclear reactor, for cryin' out loud! You used to be MacGyver, MacGadget, MacGimmick... now you're Mr. MacUseless... Dear God, I'm stuck on a glacier with MacGyver!"  Later, various episodes establish that Jack O'Neill (Anderson's character) has an immense love of the cartoon series "The Simpsons".

In 2001, the band [[They Might Be Giants]] released a song titled "All MacGyver on It" on the [[Japan]]ese version of their album ''Mink Car''.

In 2006, Anderson appeared in a MasterCard television commercial for [[Super Bowl XL]]. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary [[sock|tube sock]] as the [[pulley]] for a [[zip-line]], and somehow repairs and [[hot-wiring|hot-wires]] a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tow.com/2006/02/05/macgyver-mastercard-commercial/|title=MacGyver MasterCard Commercial|publisher=Tow.com|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2007 survey commissioned by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, Americans polled voted MacGyver as the favorite fictional hero they would want to have if they were ever caught in an emergency.&lt;ref name="macgyver2007"&gt;{{cite web | title= MacGyver is favorite disaster hero | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/macgyver-trumps-jack-bauer/2007/09/13/1189276851582.html | work= The Sydney Morning Herald | date= September 13, 2007 | accessdate=September 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[NBC]] sketch series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured a parody of ''MacGyver'' called "[[MacGruber]]" with [[Will Forte]] as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the ''MacGyver'' series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15–20 seconds. MacGruber has his co-stars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably gets in the way (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because no one wants to touch what he has asked for) and the bomb detonates. In the March 7, 2009 installment of the "MacGruber" sketches, it was revealed that MacGyver is MacGruber's long-lost father. In 2010 the character was featured in its own R-rated spinoff movie, entitled ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]''; the film was released by [[Rogue Pictures]].

In February 2008, the science series ''[[MythBusters]]'' featured a [[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 100 – "MacGyver Special"|''MacGyver'' special]] which tested several of MacGyver's tactics. Of the seven tested only one (an ultralight plane can make a safe landing while gliding) was confirmed. In the final season's "[[MythBusters (2016 season)#Episode 238 – "The Explosion Special"|Explosion Special]]" they busted filling a mail truck containing a bomb with wet concrete to contain the blast.

In 2008, the phrase "What would MacGyver do?" was used in a New Zealand television commercial for Gregg's "freestyle cooking" range of herbs and spices. The commercial featured the word MacGyver unfolding like a puzzle with a potato peeler and chopping knife opening out like the blades of a [[Swiss Army knife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/wwmd.html MacGyver Online web site] has this commercial to watch online&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode "Emancipation" has Daisy Johnson telling Lincoln Campbell (twice) that he has to "MacGyver" the door of his holding room to escape.

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]] has twice referenced the series in his songs – "Couch Potato" and "Handy" both mention MacGyver.

==="MacGyver" and "MacGyverism"===
MacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his knowledge of chemistry, physics,&lt;ref name=britton&gt;Britton, Wesley, ''Spy Television'', Praeger/Greenwood, {{ISBN|0-275-98163-0}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; technology, and sportsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to solve these problems. These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called MacGyverisms by fans.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;Rich, John, 2006, ''Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir'', {{ISBN|0-472-11578-2}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; MacGyver was unlike secret agents in other television series and films because, instead of relying on high-tech weapons and tools, he carried only a [[Swiss Army knife]] and [[duct tape]] but never a gun.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt;

This also led to the verb, "to MacGyver". "MacGyverism" was first used by Joanne Remmings (played by [[Pamela Bowen]]) in the third episode of Season 2. When MacGyver introduces himself to her, she uses the term in a manner that suggests other people had used it before:&lt;ref&gt;Season 2, Episode 3 – "[[Twice Stung]]". Her phrasing suggests it's a popular term to those who know of MacGyver's track record, although MacGyver himself was unaware of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Oh I've heard about you! You're the guy who does the whatchamacallits, you know, ''MacGyverisms''; turns one thing into another?}}

In a 1989 interview with Richard Dean Anderson, [[Arsenio Hall]] said that he had heard the word ''MacGyver'' used as a verb meaning "to do the impossible." Anderson then used it as an adjective meaning "impossible." Anderson stated that his show's producers had just missed out on getting the word "MacGyverism" entered into the [[Webster's Dictionary]] and that "we" intended to try to get it in the next update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgyveronline.com/pages/video11.html Arsenio Hall interview of Richard Dean Anderson]. ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''. 1989. MacGyver Online. accessed July 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "MacGyver" however entered the [[Oxford Dictionaries]] in 2015 as a verb meaning "make or repair (an object) in an improvised or inventive way, making use of whatever items are at hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/macgyver |title=MacGyver |work=Oxford Dictionaries }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34075407 |title=How 'MacGyver' became a verb|date= August 27, 2015|work=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's writers based MacGyver's inventions on items they found on location, concepts from scientific advisers John Koivula and Jim Green, and real events.&lt;ref name=britton /&gt; The show offered a monetary prize to people who sent good ideas for the show. A young fan suggested that MacGyver could patch up a vehicle's radiator by cracking an egg into it. The episode "Bushmaster" was constructed around this trick, and the fan was rewarded (producer Henry Winkler said in a 2005 NPR interview that this was his favorite "MacGyverism"). Although staff read every letter, few usable ideas were obtained in this way.&lt;ref name=rich /&gt;

==2016 CBS reboot series==

In October 2015, the original series' executive producer, Henry Winkler, signed on to produce a reboot series with [[James Wan]] and [[R.

In March 2016, [[Lucas Till]] was announced as the new MacGyver, Joshua Boone as Gunner, MacGyver's best friend from high school, former ''[[CSI:Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' star [[George Eads]] as Lincoln (later renamed as Jack Dalton), a man who could easily be written off as an eccentric conspiracy theorist but is a legitimate government employee with great capability for compassion, [[Addison Timlin]] as Mickey, an app developer who is aggressively progressive in her political views, with a soft spot for MacGyver, and [[Michelle Krusiec]] as Agent Croix, Lincoln’s sister who works for the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

In May 2016, the network picked up the series, with co-creator/exec producer [[Peter Lenkov]] to serve as showrunner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/05/training-day-bull-macgyver-the-great-indoors-matt-leblanc-jason-katims-cbs-series-1201755376/|title=‘Training Day’, ‘Bull’, ‘MacGyver’, ‘The Great Indoors’, Matt LeBlanc Comedy &amp; Jason Katims Drama Picked Up By CBS|publisher=Deadline|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 18, 2016, CBS indicated that the new series would air in late 2016.&lt;ref name="MacGyverFall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2016/05/18/macgyver-trailer-cbs-fall-video/|title= MacGyver: CBS Unveils Trailer for Upcoming Reboot of '80s Series|publisher=TV Line|last=Ianucci|first=Rebecca|date=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, however, the network scrapped the pilot and set Wan to direct the new pilot episode with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. [[Justin Hires]] was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver's roommate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/james-wan-direct-cbs-rebooted-903740|title=James Wan to Direct CBS' Rebooted 'MacGyver' Pilot|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/06/macgyver-rush-hour-justin-hires-cast-cbs-series-reboot-1201771878/|title=‘MacGyver’: ‘Rush Hour’s Justin Hires Cast In CBS Series Reboot|publisher=Deadline|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Sandrine Holt]] is cast as Patricia Thornton, an ex-field agent who is now director of operations for the Department of External Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/macgyver-casts-sandrine-holt-as-series-regular-1201815294/|title=‘MacGyver’ Casts Sandrine Holt as Series Regular|publisher=Variety|last=Prudom|first=Laura|date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that [[Tristin Mays]] was cast as Riley Davis, a highly unpredictable computer hacker with a chip on her shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/macgyver-tristan-mays-cast-cbs-1201824668/|title=Tristin Mays Joins ‘MacGyver’ Completing Cast of CBS Reboot|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|date=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Wan]] thinks they were lucky to find Lead actor [[Lucas Till]] who is one of the biggest discoveries with the show.

===''MacGyver and the New Citan''===
Anderson reprised his role as MacGyver in September 2012 in a new series of short films, created by [[Mercedes-Benz]] for the launch of their new MPV [[Mercedes-Benz Citan|Citan]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/MacGyver-Gets-Comeback-Mercedes-Benz-Web-Episodes-45879.html |title=MacGyver Gets A Comeback In Mercedes-Benz Web Episodes |last=Kasperowicz |first=Leslie |work=Cinema Blend |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518190114/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/MacGyver-Gets-Comeback-Mercedes-Benz-Web-Episodes-45879.html |archivedate=May 18, 2016 |dead-url=no |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-656174-1-1521664-1-0-1-0-0-1-13457-656174-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html |title=MacGyver and the new Citan: every hero needs a strong partner |publisher=[[Daimler AG]] |location=Stuttgart |date=August 14, 2012 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes were shot in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]], in July 2012.

In the short film series, MacGyver now runs a mobile repair service with his daughter Caitlin. They go to a high-rise building to fix a faulty air conditioning system when terrorists incapacitate all of the occupants with knockout gas and take over the building. Despite his age, MacGyver uses his skills to overcome the knockout gas and follow the terrorists, discovering a military bunker below the basement. After the terrorists load a large crate into a van, MacGyver follows them in his Citan work van to a shipping yard, where the terrorists begin an exchange deal with another party. Inside the crate is a robot soldier, which goes haywire and kills everyone in sight. MacGyver then runs over the robot with his Citan and deactivates it to save the day.

===Comic book===
In 2012, [[Tony Lee]] joined with MacGyver creator [[Lee David Zlotoff]] and technical advisor John Potter to write a 5-part comic book series of MacGyver titled ''MacGyver: Fugitive Gauntlets''. The story has a contemporary setting but retains all the major elements of the old show, including well known character Pete Thornton and the Phoenix Foundation as well as the much loved narration by the eponymous protagonist and [[MacGyverisms]].  The first issue was released October 10, 2012 with a new issue released each month ending with issue 5 on February 27, 2013.

The comic book was very well received around the world with the first issue selling out within the first two weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://macgyveronline.com/news/macgyver-comic-sells-out-in-less-than-2-weeks |title=MacGyver comic sells out in less than 2 weeks |work=MacGyver Online |date=October 31, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801045300/http://macgyveronline.com/news/macgyver-comic-sells-out-in-less-than-2-weeks |archivedate=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mostly favorable reviews through major comic book sites. However, the series' lead author, Tony Lee, confirmed in September 2014 that the series in total did not sell well enough to warrant a second series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No more comics planned|url=http://www.macgyveronline.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=7955|publisher=MacGyver Online Forums|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">In mathematics, '''monus''' is an operator on certain [[commutative property|commutative]] [[monoid#Commutative monoid|monoid]]s that are not [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. A commutative monoid on which a monus operator is defined is called a '''commutative monoid with monus''', or '''CMM'''. The monus operator may be denoted with the '''&amp;minus;''' symbol because the [[natural number]]s are a CMM under [[subtraction]]; it is also denoted with the '''∸''' symbol to distinguish it from the standard subtraction operator.

| &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
|}

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(M, +, 0)&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative [[monoid]]. Define a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; on this monoid as follows: for any two elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, we set &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists another element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a + c = b&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to check that &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (taking &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[neutral element]] of the monoid) and that it is [[transitive relation|transitive]] (if &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; with witness &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \leq c&lt;/math&gt; with witness &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;d + d'&lt;/math&gt; witnesses that &lt;math&gt;a \leq c&lt;/math&gt;). We call &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; ''naturally ordered'' if the &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; relation is additionally [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], so that &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]]. Further, if for each pair of elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique smallest element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;, then we call {{math|''M''}} a ''commutative monoid with monus''&lt;ref name="Amer"&gt;
  {{citation
    |last=Amer
    |first=K.
    |title=Equationally complete classes of commutative monoids with monus
    |journal=Algebra Universalis
    |year=1984
    |doi=10.1007/BF01182254
    |volume=18
    |pages=129&amp;ndash;131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}}
and we can then define the ''monus'' {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;∸&amp;nbsp;''b''}} of any two elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as this unique smallest element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of a commutative monoid which is not naturally ordered is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}, +, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the commutative monoid of the [[integer]]s with usual [[addition]], as for any &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a + c = b&lt;/math&gt;, so we have &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is not a partial order. There are also examples of monoids which are naturally ordered but are not semirings with monus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1968090 math.SE answer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other structures ==

Beyond monoids, the notion of monus can be applied to other structures. For instance, a '''naturally ordered semiring''' (sometimes called a '''dioid'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcpouly.ch/pdf/internal_100712.pdf Semirings for breakfast], slide 17&lt;/ref&gt;) is a semiring where the commutative monoid induced by the addition operator is naturally ordered. When this monoid is a commutative monoid with monus, the semiring is called a '''semiring with monus''', or '''m-semiring'''.

== Examples ==
If {{math|''M''}} is an [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] in a [[Boolean algebra]], then {{math|''M''}} is a commutative monoid with monus under {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#61;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''b''}} and {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;∸&amp;nbsp;b&amp;nbsp;&amp;#61;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;¬''b''}}.&lt;ref name="Amer" /&gt;{{rp|129}}

=== Natural numbers ===
The [[natural number]]s including 0 form a commutative monoid with monus, with their ordering being the usual order of natural numbers and the monus operator being a [[Saturation arithmetic|saturating]] variant of standard subtraction, variously referred to as '''truncated subtraction''',&lt;ref name="Computable Functions"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truncated subtraction is usually defined as&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \mathop {\dot -} b =
\begin{cases}
0 &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; b \\
a - b &amp; \mbox{if } a \ge b,
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;minus; denotes standard [[subtraction]]. For example, 5 &amp;minus; 3 = 2 and 3 &amp;minus; 5 = &amp;minus;2 in regular subtraction, whereas in truncated subtraction 3 ∸ 5 = 0. Truncated subtraction may also be defined as&lt;ref name="Wirsing" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \mathop {\dot -} b = \max(a - b, 0).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], truncated subtraction is defined in terms of the predecessor function {{math|''P''}} (the inverse of the [[successor function]]):&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(0)    &amp;= 0 \\
P(S(a)) &amp;= a \\
a \mathop {\dot -} 0 &amp;= a \\
a \mathop {\dot -} S(b) &amp;= P(a \mathop {\dot -} b).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Truncated subtraction is useful in contexts such as [[primitive recursive function]]s, which are not defined over negative numbers.&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt; Truncated subtraction is also used in the definition of the [[multiset#Multiplicity function|multiset]] [[set difference|difference]] operator.

== Properties ==
The class of all commutative monoids with monus form a [[algebraic variety|variety]].&lt;ref name="Amer" /&gt;{{rp|129}} The equational basis for the variety of all CMMs consists of the axioms for [[monoid#Commutative monoid|commutative monoids]], as well as the following axioms:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + (b \dot - a) &amp;= b + (a \dot - b) \\
(a \dot - b) \dot - c &amp;= a \dot - (b + c) \\
(a \dot - a) &amp;= 0 \\
(0 \dot - a) &amp;= 0. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Background ==
'''Jamie Nabozny''' (born October 1975) went to the local public middle school in the small Wisconsin town of [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]], where his parents Bob and Carol Nabozny had grown up. His parents had a rocky relationship, which wasn't helped by poverty. In spite of this, he managed to do well in school. Bullies at Nabozny's school believed him to be effeminate and "girlish" and bullied him. The harassment reached a point where at age 13, Nabozny complained to his parents who decided to send him to live with an uncle and aunt temporarily who would [[homeschooling|homeschool]] him. Nabozny's aunt consoled him for the bullying and he shared with her the secret that he was gay but this disclosure did not fit with her religious beliefs. Nabozny ran away, and his aunt informed the police who investigated his running away and in the course of their investigation disclosed Nabozny's sexuality to his parents. His mother Carol was supportive and loving, but his father Bob reacted in anger, storming out of the room after telling Jamie that it was simply a phase.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Carlos A.|title=From the Closet to The Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Mass|isbn=9780807001530|chapter=Harassment|pages=67–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabozny's return to middle school led to the harassment recommencing. He told a school counselor that he had been called a "queer", a "faggot" and a "fudge packer" among other terms and confirmed to the counselor that he was indeed gay and did not wish to deny this. The counselor attempted to intervene and get the bullies to stop but it resumed shortly after the intervention.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt; A new counselor arrived at the school who also attempted to make the bullying stop by involving the school principal, Mary Podlesny.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline A. Stefkovich|title=Best Interests of the Student: Applying Ethical Constructs to Legal Cases in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-da2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168|date=October 23, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92069-2|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intervention of the principal, the abuse soon resumed and now started including physical violence—hits, kicks and elbows.

In addition to Nabozny's sexual orientation, another fact led into his bullying. At age 11, Jamie Nabozny was molested by an 18-year-old church youth group leader named Nick Rising. He kept this abuse secret until Rising attempted to molest Jamie's younger brother. Rising was arrested, pleaded guilty at trial and went to jail. The scandal was reported in a local newspaper. A number of the bullies who were harassing Nabozny were friendly with Rising and blamed Nabozny for reporting the sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents complained repeatedly about the bullying but after no action was taken by the principal, they pulled Jamie out of school and transferred him to a Catholic middle school to finish seventh grade.&lt;ref name="Conn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Conn|title=Bullying and Harassment: A Legal Guide for Educators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlJhbm0gLZUC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2004|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-1-4166-0014-5|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the tuition fees meant that he dropped out shortly after starting eighth grade. Jamie Nabozny had to return to the middle school where he endured more harassment, homophobic language and physical violence. In one incident, Jamie and his brother Corey were physically assaulted by a group of boys in the bathrooms.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Following this harassment, Bob and Carol Nabozny complained again to the school and demanded a meeting with the Principal. At the meeting with the Nabozny family and a number of the boys who Jamie had accused of bullying, the Principal took the word of the bullies and then also later told Jamie Nabozny that if he continued to be [[Coming out|out]] about his sexual orientation at school, the bullying would continue. The bullies faced no disciplinary actions and the harassment continued. Following a number of bullies verbally abusing him, inappropriately touching him and then enacting a mock rape&lt;ref name="Mezey2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; while the rest of his class watched, Nabozny went to the principal who told him that "boys will be boys"&lt;ref name="Biegel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Biegel|title=The Right to be Out: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQmS0_RHxt4C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7457-2|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LINDBRZUZY2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amy Lind|author2=Stephanie Brzuzy|title=Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdoIS5YdygkC&amp;pg=PA576|date=December 30, 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08800-1|pages=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonished him for entering her office without an appointment. The continued bullying at middle school led to Nabozny attempting suicide, after which he refused to return to middle school.

At high school, the same bullies returned and the harassment continued. At one point, Nabozny was attacked while at a urinal and urinated upon by another boy.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betsy Kuhn|title=Gay Power!: The Stonewall Riots and the Gay Rights Movement, 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRJp2Bs_tlUC&amp;pg=PA112|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-7613-7275-2|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Davis, the principal at the high school continued the inaction—the perpetrators were not disciplined and the only advice Davis gave to Nabozny was to go home to change his clothes. He attempted suicide for a second time.

Nabozny's parents attempted to send him to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Drummond, Wisconsin]], but his uncle was hostile to his homosexuality, leading him to run away from them and hitch-hike to [[Minneapolis]]. Bob and Carol Nabozny attempted to find him in Minneapolis and distributed 'missing child' posters. Nabozny phoned the number listed on one of the posters and was reunited with his parents. Nabozny told his parents that he refused to return to the high school. They sought to homeschool him but were legally forbidden as neither had a high school diploma. They could not afford to send him to a private school, and the only private school nearby was a Christian fundamentalist school. The school district demanded that Jamie return to high school, where the bullying started again.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents requested the local social services department put him into foster care out of the district so he could attend school elsewhere. At the new school, the bullying that Nabozny suffered was promptly resolved by the school. The new school seemed to boost his happiness and self-confidence as well as his grades. The social worker who had moved Nabozny demanded that he move back to his parents during tenth grade. He then had to return to the high school in Ashland, where the bullying restarted. The school continued to ignore the bullying and assistant principal Thomas Blaumert told Nabozny that his harassment was due to him provoking them and that he deserved the punishment because of his sexuality.&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; Blaumert also laughed when Nabozny was pushed and tripped in the hallway.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

For over four years, no school official took any disciplinary action in response to Nabozny's reports. In the eleventh grade, he was attacked in the school library by a group of boys, one of whom repeatedly kicked him in the stomach&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011" /&gt; which caused him to have pain and a stomach cramp for weeks. The internal bleeding and bruising required surgery.

In December 1992, Nabozny collected together over $100 in cash and ran away from Ashland and took a bus to Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, he moved in with a gay church deacon and his partner who served as foster parents. He was diagnosed with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[post traumatic stress disorder]]&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt; and spent years in therapy. Eventually, he completed his [[GED]] and became a student at the [[University of Minnesota]] and studied for a degree in psychology.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

== The case ==
Nabozny decided to sue the school district and was represented by [[Lambda Legal]], an LGBT legal organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Lambda Legal]]|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny.html|title=Nabozny v. Podlesny|accessdate=December 12, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725165752/http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny?qt-related_conent_for_cases=2#qt-related_conent_for_cases|archivedate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had made a policy decision in 1995 to take cases involving youth issues. Nabozny was represented by Patricia Logue, a lawyer (and lesbian) who had previously worked in corporate law before taking a job with Lambda in Chicago in 1993 along with Michael Terrien an attorney with Skadden Arps Meagher and Flom LLP. She had previously helped a black LGBT group change the policy of the [[Bud Billiken Parade]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Baim2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Baim|title=Out and Proud in Chicago: An Overview of the City's Gay Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoLGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|date=September 1, 2008|publisher=Surrey Books|isbn=978-1-57284-100-0|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought against the school district as well as a number of the school officials. Nabozny's lawyers argued that his rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to equal protection and due process had been violated by the school's failure to protect him as a member of a discernible minority group, namely gay people. They also argued that his rights under Wisconsin law to not be discriminated against were violated by the school district. The plaintiffs also pointed to the existence of school anti-harassment policies and argued that they were being enforced in a discriminatory manner: when sexist abuse was reported by female students, it was quickly stopped by school officials in a way they did not do for homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;

The District Court made a summary judgment in favor of the school district. Nabozny appealed to the Seventh Circuit federal appeals court which found that the school district had infringed his equal protection rights on the grounds of combined gender and sexual orientation discrimination, but rejected the due process claim.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

Judge [[Jesse E. Eschbach]] concluded in his judgment:

: The defendants ask us to affirm the grant of qualified immunity because "there was no clear duty under the Equal Protection Clause for the individual defendants to enforce every student complaint of harassment by other students the same way." The defendants are correct in that the Equal Protection Clause does not require the government to give everyone identical treatment. Nothing we say today suggests anything to the contrary. The Equal Protection Clause does, however, require the state to treat each person with equal regard, as having equal worth, regardless of his or her status. The defendants' argument fails because they frame their inquiry too narrowly. The question is not whether they are required to treat every harassment complaint the same way: as we have noted, they are not. The question is whether they are required to give male and female students equivalent levels of protection; they are, absent an important governmental objective, and the law clearly said so prior to Nabozny's years in middle school.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

== Reception and significance ==
Catherine A. Lugg, a professor of education at [[Rutgers University]], said that the facts of the case "clearly illustrates the public school's historic power as the ''enforcer'' of expected norms regarding gender, [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia" and also shows "how devastating a homophobic public school culture can be for queer children".&lt;ref name="CarlsonGause2007" /&gt;

In 1997, the Department of Education clarified that [[Title IX]] requires schools to provide students with an environment free of harassment and that this requirement includes gay and lesbian students.&lt;ref name="Stewart2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chuck Stewart|title=Gay and Lesbian Issues: A Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKvt-GoidYC&amp;pg=PA59|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-372-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''Nabozny'' case, other students who have brought similar cases have generally won. Such cases include:&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;
* a student in Minnesota called Jesse Montgomery&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt;
* a California student named George Loomis who suffered homophobic abuse from teachers and students.

After reporting this to the school principal, she was told: "You need to go back to class. Don't bring me this trash anymore. This is disgusting."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12159">According to [[Franz Brentano]], [[intentionality]] refers to the "aboutness of mental states that cannot be a physical relation between a mental state and what is about (its object) because in a physical relation each of the relata must exist whereas the objects of mental states might not.

Several problems arise for features of intentionality, which are unusual for materialistic relations.  Representation is unique. When 'x represents y' is true, it is not the same as other relations between things, like when 'x is next to y' or when 'x caused y' or when 'x met y', etc. Representation is different because, for instance, when 'x represents y' is true, y need not exist. This isn't true when say 'x is the square root of y' or 'x caused y' or 'x is next to y'. Similarly, when 'x represents y' is true, 'x represents z' can still be false, even when y = z.  Intentionality encompasses relations that are both physical and mental. In this case, "Billy can love Santa and Jane can search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no unicorns."

==History==
'''[[Franz Brentano]]''', the nineteenth century philosopher, spoke of mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our thoughts.  This idea encompasses his belief that one cannot desire something unless they actually have a representation of it in their minds.

'''[[Dennis Stampe]]''' was one of the first philosophers in modern times to suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of reliable causes.

'''[[Fred Dretske]]'''{{'}}s book, ''Knowledge and the Flow of Information'' (1981), was a major influence on the development of informational theories, and although the theory developed there is not a teleological theory, Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later produced an informational version of [[teleosemantics]].  He begins with a concept of carrying information that he calls "indicating", explains that indicating is not equivalent to representing, and then suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function of indicating

==Related theories==

'''Teleosemantics''', also known as biosemantics, is used to refer to the class of theories of mental content that use a teleological notion of function. Teleosemantics is best understood as a general strategy for underwriting the normative nature of content, rather than any particular theory. What all teleological theories have in common is the idea that semantic norms are ultimately derivable from functional norms.

Attempts to naturalize semantics began in the late 1970s.  Many attempts were and still are being made to bring natural-physical explanations to bear on minds and, specifically, to the question of how minds acquire content.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Adams, Fred. "Thoughts and Their Contents: Naturalized Semantics." In Philosophy of Mind 143.&lt;/ref&gt;   This is an interesting question; it is no surprise that it takes center stage in the philosophy of mind.  Indeed, it is certainly an interesting question how minds, thought by those in the natural camp to be "natural physical objects",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; could have developed intentional properties.  In the mid-1980s, with the works of Ruth Millikan and David Papineau (Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories and "Representation and Explanation", respectively) teleosemantics, a theory of mental content that attempts to address the question of content and intentionality of minds, was born.

Ruth Millikan is perhaps the most vocal supporter of the teleosemantic program. Millikan's view differs from other teleosemantic views in myriad ways, but perhaps its most unusual characteristic is its distinction between the mechanisms that produce mental representations from those that consume mental representations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Macdonald, G, and Papineau, D. "Prospects and Problems for Teleosemantics," in Teleosemantics 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   There is a representational function as a whole, at a composite level; and there are two "sub-functions",&lt;ref&gt;Shea, Nicholas. "Millikan's Contribution to Materialist Philosophy of Mind," 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  the producer-function and the consumer-function.  In terms that are easy to understand, let's take Millikan's own example of beavers splashing their tails.  One beaver alerts other beavers to the presence of danger by splashing its tail on the surface of water.  The splashing of the tail tells, or represents to, the other beavers that there is danger in the environment, and the other beavers dip into the water to avoid the danger.  The splashing of the beaver's tail produces a representation; the other beavers consume the representation.  The representation that the beavers consume guides their behavior in ways that relate to their survival.

Of course, the foci of the teleosemantic program is internal representations, and not just representational states of affairs between two (or more) distinct, external  entities.  How does the picture of the producer and consumer beavers, for instance, play into a story about internal representations?  Papineau and Macdonald describe Millikan's account of this well and loyally, saying "The producing mechanisms will be the sensory and other cerebral mechanisms that give rise to cognitive representations."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   The consuming mechanisms are those that "use these representations to direct behavior in pursuit of some biological end".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;   Here, we have a picture similar to the beaver example, but this picture portrays the two sub-functions, producer and consumer, operating within a more-obviously unified system, namely, the cognitive system.  One sub-function produces mental representations while the other sub-function consumes them in order to reach some end, e.g., danger-avoidance or food-acquisition.  The representations consumed by the consumer sub-function guide an organism's behavior toward some biological end, e.g., survival.  This is a rather brief sketch of Millikan's overall portrait.  Of course, more goes into her account of the relation between producer- and consumer-functions in order to arrive at a nuanced account of mental representation.  But that is a matter of how.  Details as to the how aside, much of Millikan's efforts are directed towards the why, viz., why it is that perceivers like us have mental representations—why representations are produced in the first place.

'''The theory of asymmetric dependence''', from Fodor, who says that his theory "distinguishes merely informational relations on the basis of their higher-order relations to each other: informational relations depend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. He gives an example of this theory when he says, "if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by horses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then they carry information about horses, etc. If however, such tokens are caused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they are caused by horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or property horse).

==Alternative theories==

===Indeterminacy of translation===

20th century American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] believed that linguistic terms do not have distinct meanings that accompany them because there are no such entities as "meanings". In his books, ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960) and ''[[Ontological Relativity]]'' (1968), Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate an unknown language in order to outline his thesis. His thesis, the [[indeterminacy of translation]], notes that there are many different ways to distribute purpose and meanings among words. Whenever a theory of translation is made it is commonly based upon context. An argument over the correct translation of an unidentified term depends on the possibility that the native could have spoken a different sentence. The same problem of indeterminacy would appear in this argument once again since any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language. Quine uses as an example the word "gavagai" spoken by a native upon seeing a rabbit. One can go the simplest route and translate the word to "Lo, a rabbit", but other possible translations such as "Lo, food" or "Let's go hunting" are completely reasonable given what the linguist knows. Subsequent observations can rule out certain possibilities as well as questioning the natives. But this is only possible once the linguist has mastered much of the [[natives']] grammar and vocabulary. This is a big problem because this can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language, which admit multiple interpretations, as we have seen.

===The intentional stance===

[[Daniel C. Dennett]]'s theory of mental content, the intentional stance, tries to view the behavior of things in terms of mental properties. According to Dennett: 
"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do."

Dennett's thesis has three levels of abstraction:
# The most tangible is the physical stance, which is at the level of physics and chemistry. This level is concerned with things such as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. 
# Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, which is at the level of biology and engineering. This level is concerned with things such as purpose, function and design. 
# Most abstract is the intentional stance, which is at the level of software and minds. This level is concerned with things such as belief, thinking and intent.

Dennett states that the more concrete the level, the more accurate is in principle our predictions. Though if one chooses to view an object through a more abstract level, he will gain greater computational power by getting a better overall picture of the object and skipping over any extraneous details. Also, switching to a more abstract level has its risks as well as its benefits. If we applied the intentional stance to a thermometer that was heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, trying to understand it through its beliefs about how hot it is and its desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no useful information. The problem would not be understood until we dropped down to the physical stance to comprehend that it has been melted. Whether to take a particular stance should be decided by how successful that stance is when applied. Dennett argued that it is best to understand human beliefs and desires at the level of the intentional stance.

'''Oksana Mas''' is a contemporary artist and the organizer of "ArtTogether", a global interactive art project aimed at visualizing the new cultural code of the modern generation and uniting people at a time of political and social turmoil.

Working with a variety of mediums, Oksana employs painting and graphic art techniques, creates sculptures, installations and large-scale photo works and partakes in urban construction and space design workshops across Europe.

== Biography ==
Born in 1969 in Ukraine, Oksana graduated from the M.B. Grekov Odessa State Art School in 1992. In the 1990s, she played a part in the decade's painting revival and later investigating [[relational art]] and scientific art practices. Already an established artist, in 2003 she earned a Bachelor of Philosophy from Odessa State University. Oksana is working on a PhD on problems of art in the social media.

Highlights of Oksana's work include the [http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/35588/ukrainian-pavilion-at-the-54th-venice-biennale/ POST-VS-PROTO-RENAISSANCE] project (a [http://www.greendiary.com/colorful-wooden-eggs-assembled-into-breathtaking-art-forms.html prototype] of the "ArtTogether" installation) presented at the 54th [http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/archive/54th-exhibition/national-participations/ Venice Biennale] in 2011 which became one of the most attended and widely covered pavilions of the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/8555041/Venice-Biennale-2011-art-festival-in-pictures.html Biennale]. In 2013 the artist participated in the Collateral Events program of [http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/archive/55th-exhibition/collateral-events/ the 55th Venice Biennale] with the [http://www.glasstress.org/event_2013/artist/oksana-mas/12_192 "Quantum Prayer"] project in [http://www.itsliquid.com/glasstress-white-light.html the "Glasstress 2013"] group exhibition . In 2012, Oksana won the Independent Critics Prize at the 65th Locarno [http://www.pardolive.ch/pardo/festival-del-film-locarno/home.html International Film Festival].

Oksana's art has been shown at multiple exhibitions worldwide, including the [https://matureartstudent.wordpress.com/2014/02/03/museum-visit-sharjah-art-museum-women-art-interpreting-peace-sunday-2-feb/ "Women and Art"] Biennial at the Sharjah Contemporary Art Museum in 2014, the [http://www.gif.ru/eng/news/modus-r/ "Modus R. Russian Formalism Today"] (part of the Art Basel Miami non-commercial program, 2006); the [http://www.mmoma.ru/en/exhibitions/petrovka/oksana_mas/ "MAS"] exhibit at the Moscow Museum of Modern Art in 2008, as well as in FRIEZE (London), ARCO (Madrid), Fiac (Paris), The Armory Show (New York), Vienna Fair, Art Dubai and Art Karlsruhe. 
 
Works by Oksana have been sold at the Sotheby's, Christie’s and Phillips auction houses. Her art-works can be found in museum and private collections in France, the United States, Great Britain, Italy, Switzerland, Japan, Ukraine, Arab Emirates, Russia and Australia.

Actor [[Kevin Spacey]] selected Oksana's work "Mandala Dance", together with pieces by [[Tracey Emin]], [[Banksy]], [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], [[Michael Craig-Martin]] for a charity auction, "Illuminating the Future", held by Christie's on February 10, 2014 to support the legendary [[The Old Vic|Old Vic Theater]]. The ruling [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince of Monaco Albert II]] chose Oksana’s "Spheres of Good" installations to decorate Avenue Henri Dunant in the center of [http://primetour.ua/en/company/culture-news/TSentralnaya-ulitsa-Monte-Karlo-ukrashena-ukrainskimi-pisankami.html Monte-Carlo].

Oksana gives lectures on contemporary art at leading universities in the United States, the UK (Cambridge) and Germany. She is also a frequent guest speaker on history of art and philosophy. 
 
Oksana currently lives and works in Spain and Poland.

== Work philosophy ==
In her art works, Oksana elaborates an aesthetic perception of a human being in times of drastic
social and geo-political change that is experienced by every generation, irrespective of the era or geographical placement.
Oksana’s academic knowledge in such fields as science, the philosophy of digital technologies, the history of religions and art history and her multiculturalism have created the foundation of her artistic identity and enabled her to create timeless and versatile artworks with the aim of searching for this generation's new cultural code and facilitating a creative dialogue between different religions and social groups.
The artist manages to combine a vivid figurativeness of visually and formally unique works with perviousness of interpretations, based on eternal values. The symbolic images in her paintings are always both focused and ambiguous. Multi-layered meanings intertwined in every artwork immerse the audience in an everlasting process of discovering new ideas and images found in both European and Eastern cultures.

== Works ==

=== ArtTogether ===
'''Post-vs-Proto-Renaissance - 1st stage of ArtTogether project'''  	
This art installation became the first stage in [http://arttogether.com/ ArtTogether project].  It was presented under the title of "Altarpiece of Nations" (22 m. in height by 38 m. in width) at the Saint Sophia Square in Kiev and as part of the main program of the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011. The installation represented fragments of the Ghent Altarpiece by the 15th-century Flemish artists, the [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]] [[Hubert van Eyck|brothers]]. Each of them was assembled from hand-painted wooden eggs, referencing the Ukrainian folk  [[Pysanka|pysankas"]].
As the famous art historian, curator and critic [[Achille Bonito Oliva]], who was curating the [http://www.greendiary.com/colorful-wooden-eggs-assembled-into-breathtaking-art-forms.html exhibition] [http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/35588/ukrainian-pavilion-at-the-54th-venice-biennale/ Post-vs-Proto-Renaissance] at the 54th Venice biennale, put it: "In the art-works of the last years Oksana Mas has switched the optics from timeless, metaphysical perception of sculpture towards collisions between the path of history and subjective time, doing so through the transformation of individual creativity into a collective one. This is the way of true spiritual democracy. Art as an emancipation of personal "self" and of general "us"."

'''ArtTogether stages'''
At the current 2nd stage of the project people from all over the world contribute via Internet platform ArtTogether.com their drawings to allow them to become part of a new cultural code of a generation. They manifest their vision of and aspirations for an ideal world. New parts of installation are created using digital technologies on plastic eggs. No curator is supervising co-creators. To date, 380.000 people from 42 countries have taken part in the project.
At the 3rd stage scheduled for 2017-2019 the global community will complete the project, creating 3.640.000 drawings via Internet platform and the entire installation will be demonstrated on all continents.

=== Paintings ===
'''Biomorphic Realism'''  	
As with the series They Are Among Us, in Biomorphic Realism the artist continues to look at random objects, strangers on the street, fleeting signs of a higher existence that cannot be captured by a glimpse or a name. The artist’s technique of applying dozens of interlacing layers of
paint and lacquer gives the canvas surfaces a glassy glossiness, underlining the fluidity of the shapes of art and of life.

'''Red Expression'''
In this series of paintings created in 2012, Mas takes the spectator into her experience of seeing the world in a rhythmic, pulsating dimension. The artist depicts her own environment with the intimacy of a diary: people feeding pigeons in a park, cyclists, a couple having a rest or awaiting
for someone. Mas combines the spontaneity of an instant with a timeless validity that can never be obliterated.

=== Sculptures, Installations and Video ===
'''Phenomenon of Epidermism'''
Created in 2006, this series of sculptures is made out of brand new wheels and tires covered with latex, giving the appearance of human bodies turned into formless esh. The biomass of body fragments is perceived as a suggestion of car-wrecked humanity. Mas’ installation challenges conventional attitudes towards life, referencing pervasive fears and self-destruction. With the premonitory video Phenomenon of Epidermism, Mas won the Independent Critics Prize at the prestigious [http://www.pardolive.ch/pardo/festival-del-film-%20locarno/home.html Locarno Film Festival] in 2012.

'''Helium-3'''
This series of objects (created in 2010) made of metal and plastic and assembled in a high-scale spatial installation engages with the theme of the duality and ambiguity of any phenomenon. Helium-3, which is considered the fuel of the future — a resource everyone will fight for — is an
extremely rare substance on Earth, unlike the Moon where it is abundant. It symbolizes the hopes and fears of humanity.

=== Photo ===
'''Quantum Prayer'''
Oksana’s Quantum Prayer was a title piece at [http://www.glasstress.org/event_2013/artist/oksana-mas/12_192 the Glasstress 2013] exhibition, a collateral event of the 55th Biennale di Venezia. The Glasstress organizers inspire modern artists to create works of art in collaboration with the best Murano glass blowers. Oksana combined several personally important topics in this project – an interest in science and motor vehicles, alongside a study of the tremendous potential of freedom and unity to be found in art. Under her supervision, the Murano maestro covered car engines with liquid glass. The high temperature of the glass melted the metal, just as the power of thought changes the world.

== Mas Studio ==
In 2012 Oksana established the Mas Studio, where she oversees the creation of artistic concepts for jewelry, architecture, urban space design and photography. Mas Studio has offices in London, Zurich and New York.

Personal branding is essentially the ongoing process of establishing a prescribed image or impression in the mind of others about an individual, group, or organization.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Your Personal Brand - Los Ellis 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Personal branding often involves the application of one's name to various products. For example, the celebrity [[real estate development|real-estate]] mogul turned [[President of the United States]], [[Donald Trump]] uses his last name extensively on his buildings and on the products he endorses. (e.g. [[Trump Tower]]). In ''Be Your Own Brand'' first published in 1999, marketers David McNally and Karl Speak&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brandtoolbox.com/about-us/karl-d-speak/|title=Karl D. Speak - Founding Principal &amp; Exec. Consultant|work=Brand Tool Box|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; define personal brand this way: "Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you." Kim Kardashian has a strong personal brand since she is considered a very influential person, thus every product she endorses, skyrockets on the market. Hence why companies look out for her due to the influential power she has in the media.

The relationship between brands and consumers needs to be constantly made and remade, and this continuous process creates a demonstration of the ambivalence in brand cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814787144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same logic follows for personal brands- there is a constant desire for a reinforcement of the self-brand.

== History ==
Personal branding, self-positioning, and all individual branding by whatever name, was first introduced in 1937 in the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} by [[Napoleon Hill]]. This relates specifically to Chapter 6, Organized Planning, Planning the Sale of Services, where Hill states, "It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS." The idea surfaced later in the 1981 book ''Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind'', by [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ries | first=Al | last2=Trout | first2=Jack | year=1981 | title=Positioning: The Battle for your Mind | publisher=McGraw-Hill | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hjG01OzMGYC | isbn=978-0-07-135916-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically in "Chapter 23. Positioning Yourself and Your Career - You can benefit by using positioning strategy to advance your own career. Key principle: Don't try to do everything yourself. Find a horse to ride". It was later popularized by [[Tom Peters]].

Branding has reached a new level of imperative because of the rise of the Internet. The growth of the virtual world created the necessity of managing online identities. Despite being expressly virtual, social media and online identity has the ability to affect the real world. Because Individuals want to portray themselves a certain way to their social circle, they may work to maintain a certain image on their social media sites. As a result, social media enables the creation of an online identity that may not be completely true to the [[True self and false self|real self]]. (See: [[online identity]])

Today, added emphasis is placed on personal branding, especially in the online world. Employers are now increasingly using social media tools in order to vet applicants before offering them interviews. Such techniques range from searching the applicants [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] feed to conducting large background checks using search engines and other tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2013/dec/11/job-applications-social-media-profiles-scrutiny |title=Job applications: social media profiles under scrutiny |last=Landau |first=Phillip |date=11 December 2013  | website=guardian.co.uk |accessdate= January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst job-seekers, this is leading to a shift away from the practice of submitting a resume as part of their job application process to providing potential employers with access to a number of personal brand assets. Such assets are likely to include a resume, links to a carefully managed LinkedIn profile and a personal blog, evidence of articles which disseminate original ideas on industry blogs, and evidence of having an online following. Such efforts give job-seekers better odds of being noticed by potential employers.

== Goffman's self presentation theory ==
[[Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman's]] Self Presentation is a key theory that explores the way people want to be seen and how people are perceived by their peers. Goffman, uses the term Dramaturgy as a component to his theory of self-presentation. This term refers to looking at your own persona as a drama, treating your actions as an actor in a play. One can control how he or she is viewed by their peers and in cases of celebrities or athletes, can build a personal brand through utilizing what they present to their publics using various social media outlets. Self-presentation theory and personal branding go hand  in hand, we see celebrities and athletes building a particular brand, or persona over with the use of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Building a personal brand is a big part of a celebrity's life, and it can help them spread awareness and also provide an outlet to connect with their fans/supporters. This is made possible through the use of social media and the ability of the person looking to build a personal brand to make their messages heard. The theory of self-presentation looks at how people look to create an identity for themselves that they would like to be seen as by their peers or in the public eye. This is what Goffman call's the 'front stage'.

The front stage is a key component of this theory and it is a way a person acts when in public or around other people to build a certain persona for how they would like others to view them. The front stage is where celebrities and athletes tend to build their own brand and show many positive, deliberate messages that will try and portray them in a certain light in which the person would like to be seen. As opposed to what Goffman refer's to as the 'back stage' which is a particular way a person acts when they are not in public or not posting on social media, trying to build a particular persona or brand they would like others to see.

There are many examples of celebrities building a brand for themselves over some sort of social media platform. In fact, it is rare to see an athlete or celebrity without a social media page whether it is twitter or instagram. Celebrities use these outlets as ways of branding themselves, by showing people their lives and having fans feel close to them, almost like they are friends, and have a connection through social media outlets such as twitter and instagram. Also, to keep more of their fans interested, and to reach as many as possible many celebrities will update daily on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat so their message can be seen by a wider audience. They can keep fans informed on everything from what they want to wear, to their political views. Social Media has provided a simple way for celebrities to get their personal brand to reach a wider audience, and they utilize the 'front stage'  to influence people in a particular way and to make themselves look good in the public eye.

The 'back stage' is part of Goffman's theory of self-presentation theory, and it is happenings or beliefs people wouldn't want their peers or public to necessarily see or hear. These are happenings that go on behind the scenes that can oftentimes hurt someone's reputation and are avoided when a celebrity is trying to build a personal brand. These are often personal happenings, or beliefs that will negatively effect how an audience will look at the brand you are building. There are numerous examples of celebrities saying something that they didn't want their public to hear but got out and this hurts the brand they are building. One example of this is when [[LA Clippers]] owner [[Donald Sterling]] made racist comments to his then girlfriend and she had recorded them and put them on her social media.&lt;ref name="TMZ 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clippers Owner Donald Sterling to GF -- Don't Bring Black People to My Games ... Including Magic Johnson | website=TMZ | date=2014-04-25 | url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/26/donald-sterling-clippers-owner-black-people-racist-audio-magic-johnson/ | access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Sterling was quickly removed from the team and is no longer associated with the NBA. This is an example of how something in the back stage will negatively affect what you want the public to see you as.

Self-presentation theory is very apparent in the world of celebrities and professional athletes and is a big part of building a brand for themselves. Goffman's theory seems to identify itself well with the personal branding of these celebrities and you can see why they would want to utilize social media to positively show a message they want to be heard by their public (front stage) and avoid more personal beliefs that may negatively effect their brand (back stage).

== Social media ==
[[Social media]] can be "roughly defined as 'a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content'".&lt;ref&gt;Dijck, José Van. "Chapter 1: Engineering Sociality in a Culture of Connectivity." The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media extends beyond just [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] and into the professional world as well. There are general professional profiles like [[LinkedIn]] and company or industry-specific networks, such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]]. Because of these professional networks, self-branding is useful in finding a job or improving one's professional standing. As an online open source, social media has become a place that is fulfilled with highly reliable and resourceful information to target user identities&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ang, L., Khamis, S., &amp; Welling, R. (2017). Self-branding, ‘micro-celebrity’ and the rise of social media influencers. ''Celebrity Studies, 8''(2), 191-208. doi: 10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292&lt;/ref&gt;.

Building a brand and an online presence through internal corporate networks allows for individuals to network with their colleagues, not only socially but professionally as well. This kind of interaction allows for employees to build up their personal brand relative to other employees, as well as spur innovation within the company because more people can learn from more people.

Some social media sites, like [[Twitter]], can have a flattened, all-encompassing audience that can be composed of professional and personal contacts, which then can be seen as a more "'professional' environment with potential professional costs".&lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. E., and D. Boyd. "I Tweet Honestly, I Tweet Passionately: Twitter Users, Context Collapse, and the Imagined Audience." [[New Media &amp; Society]] 13.1 (2011): 114-33. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014.  {{doi|10.1177/1461444810365313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its explicitly public nature, Twitter becomes a double-sided platform that can be utilized in different ways depending on the amount of censorship a user decides on.

Personal branding focuses on "self-packaging," where "success is not determined by individuals' internal sets of skills, motivations, and interests but, rather, by how effectively they are…branded";&lt;ref name="Lair, D. J 2005"&gt;Lair, D. J. "Marketization and the Recasting of the Professional Self: The Rhetoric and Ethics of Personal Branding." Management Communication Quarterly 18.3 (2005): 307-43. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it is more about self-promotion rather than true self-expression. The difference between the two is that self-promotion is deliberately intentional in all aspects because the individual is purposely shaping their image or persona, while self-expression can even be a byproduct of promotion.&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"&gt;Dijck, J. Van. "'You Have One Identity': Performing the Self on Facebook and LinkedIn." Media, Culture &amp; Society 35.2 (2013): 199-215. Sage Journal. Web. 19 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from professional aspirations, personal branding can also be used on personal-level social networks to flare popularity. The online self is used as a marketing and promotional tool to brand an individual as a type of person; success on the virtual platforms then becomes "online social value [that could transform] to real rewards in the offline world."&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"/&gt; A prominent example of a self-made self-branded social media icon is [[Tila Tequila]], who rose to prominence in 2006 on the [[Myspace]] network, gaining more than 1.5 million friends, through expertly marketing her personal brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|publisher=NYU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780814787144|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As social media has become a vehicle for self-branding, these moguls have begun to situate the maintenance of their online brand as a job, which brings about new ways to think about work and labor&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814787144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of online sites and the presence of feedback means that one's online presence is viewed by others using the same rubric to judge brands: evaluation, ranking, and judgment. Thus, social media network sites serve as complex, technologically mediated venues for the branding of the self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Personal branding offers promises of increased success in the business world. Thousands of [[self-help]] books, programs, personal coaches, and articles exist to help individuals learn to self-brand. These strategies emphasize authenticity but framed as becoming "'more of who you are' as well as who 'you were meant to be.'&lt;ref name="Banet-Weiser, Sarah 2012"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah. "Branding the Postfeminist Self: The Labor of Femininity." Authentic™: The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: New York U, 2012. 51-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of these 'strategies for success' is that this is very subtle self-commodification.&lt;ref name="Lair, D. J 2005"/&gt; Because personal branding is basically pointing out, and in some cases, glorifying, certain positive characteristics of an individual, it is not unlike traditional branding of products and companies. This puts individuals in the place of products, in which their efforts to appear more human are subverted.&lt;ref name="Banet-Weiser, Sarah 2012"/&gt;

This possibility is exploited by celebrities and politicians, as "marketing individual personalities as products" is an effective way to gain millions of fans not just online but in real life as well.&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"/&gt; For celebrities of all types, online personas are their brands. Public relations for [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Barack Obama]] alike can easily control the "brand" and maximize exposure and profitability.

On the other hand, personal branding may afford potential employers the opportunity to more accurately judge a candidate's abilities and cultural suitability, since blogs, profiles, websites, etc., are pieces of work that can be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/what-your-employees-personal-branding-means-to-your-company-1/|title=What Your Employees' Personal Branding Means to Your Company {{!}} OPEN Forum|website=www.americanexpress.com|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/12/04/personal-branding-in-the-future-workplace-a-crucial-skill-for-employees-and-recruiters-alike/#5809b7e416b0|title=Personal Branding in the Future Workplace: A Crucial Skill for Employees and Recruiters Alike|last=Meister|first=Jeanne|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Disclosure ==
Personal branding involves the practice of self-disclosure, and this transparency is part of what Foucault would call "the proper care of the self".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this sense, disclosure refers to the details of one's everyday life for other's consumption, while transparency is the effect of this kind of disclosure. Transparency essentially works to give viewers a complete view of one's authentic self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Digitally aided disclosure, which involves building a self-brand on a social network site, relies on traditional discourses of the authentic self as one that is transparent, without artifice, and open to others. Authenticity is viewed as both residing inside the self and is also demonstrated by allowing the outside world access to one's inner self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is interesting to think about the idea of authenticity with disclosure, and the freedom social networks allow in disclosing an inauthentic self. All the while, these posting are forming a digital archive of the self, through which a brand could be crafted by others. An example of this is Carly Fleishmann, whose [[Twitter]] posting created an iconicity and brand without her ever speaking out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNZVV4Ciccg|title=Autistic Girl Expresses Unimaginable Intelligence|first=|last=Ichiban MacBean|date=25 May 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a figure who rose to prominence through this disclosure is Ingrid Nilsen, who posted a video on [[YouTube]] coming out as lesbian and subsequently took off as a [[YouTube]] star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/youtubes-most-popular-coming-out-videos-2015-7|title=The top 10 most viewed YouTube coming-out videos of all time will bring you to tears|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through disclosure individuals are able to go through the process of personal branding.

'''QAGS''' (''Quick Ass Game System'') is a [[generic role-playing game system]] for use in [[freeform role-playing game]]s.  QAGS is not tied to any particular genre or setting, and has been used to run everything from paranormal teenagers to post-apocalyptic super-heroes to fantasy sailing adventure to gun-toting monster hunters to "hard-core" luchadore action to Regency romance to 80’s cartoons to Shakespeare meets Tarantino.&lt;ref&gt;“FAQ: Can you really play anything with QAGS" [http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=24&amp;Itemid=97]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} broken link&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, three gamers (Steve Johnson, Leighton Connor, and Dale French) published the First Edition of the game after a year of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=15 “About Hex Games”]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since then, QAGS (pronounced "kwags") has  been updated with a Second Edition, and the publisher, Hex Games, has continued to release games.

To date, Hex Games has used the core system for ''M-Force: Monster Hunting In The 21st Century'', ''Rasslin’'', ''Qerth'', ''The Adventures Of Sindbad'', ''Rocket Jocks'', ''Weird Times At Charles Fort High'', 
''Funkadelic Frankenstein on the Mean Streets of Monstertown'', "Hobomancer", "Edison Force", and "The Pytheas Club", as well as several stand alone adventures such as ''Deep Space Rescue'' and ''The Dungeon Of Moderate Annoyance (Not Nearly So Bad As The Dungeon Of Infinite Pain)''.

In 2001, Hex Games was the Gaming Guest of Honor at Marcon 36. In 2006, Hex was the "Gaming Guest" of Honor at Archon 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archonstl.org/30/index2.html  "Archon 30"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230060043/http://www.archonstl.org/30/index2.html |date=December 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game mechanics ==
In QAGS, player characters are defined by six Words.  Body, Brain, and Nerve represent the character’s physical, "intellectual" and mental (willpower and social skills, for example) abilities.  Job, Gimmick and Weakness represent what the character does, what makes him unique in the world, and what limits him in a grand Shakespearean way.  These last three Words are qualified.  For example, a character’s Job might be “Animal Control Officer”, his Gimmick “Hide In Plain Sight”, and his Weakness “Dies if touches peanut butter”.  Each of these six Words is assigned a Number ranging from 6 to 16.  Skills, areas of knowledge that round out the character, with Numbers ranging from +1 to +5 are also assigned, and they will be used to modify target numbers when rolls are called for.  Numbers are generated by using either the Qik Start system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexgames.com/qags2e/index.php/hikashop-menu-for-categories-listing/product/102-qags-qik-start-rules-pdf|title=QAGS Qik-Start Rules|website=www.hexgames.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; that relies on dice-rolling, or the Point Built system in which the player is given a certain number of points with which to create the character.

Player characters are further fleshed out by assigning them a Tag Line (something that the character routinely says, such as “Jinkies, a Clue!”), WWPHITM (Who Will Play Him/Her In The Movie), and any number of Dumb Facts.

When the Game Master determines that a character’s action goes beyond what would be considered normal or everyday, she decides what Word is applicable and use that Word’s Number as the target number.  If no Word is applicable, the GM will use half the player’s Body, Brain or Nerve Number rounded down as a default target number.   Any Skill modifiers are added to determine the modified target number.  Then she asks the player to roll a 20-sided die; no other dice are required to play QAGS.  The number rolled on the die is then compared to the modified target "number" assigned to the appropriate Word.  If the roll is under the modified target number, the action succeeds; over the modified target number, a failure.  If two characters are in opposition, hand-to-hand combat for example, then the higher successful role is the one that actually succeeds.

In an example of play, Our Hero, Rollo the Superspy, wants to impress Isvestia, a beautiful Ruritanian counterintelligence agent, at the casino in Monte Carlo.  He adds his +2 skill in “Tango Dancing” to the 12 of his “Superspy” Job, which she will oppose with her 15 Nerve.  He rolls a 13 while she rolls a 4.  Both are "successful", but his roll, being higher, is the one that succeeds.  The result should be that he has her eating out of his hand, but Rollo also has “Overplays His Hand” for a Weakness with a Number of 13.  He rolls a 9, and the Weakness wins and takes effect, thus releasing Isvestia from her fascination.

Simple dice-rolling is augmented by the use of Yum Yums. Yum Yums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=24&amp;Itemid=97#faq3 “FAQ: Yum Yums? Really? Yum Yums?”]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are anything compact and edible, anything from hard candies to potato chips. Yum Yums may be used to buy automatic successes, chances to re-roll failed rolls, and to modify things like damage given and taken. They also give players a chance to take control of a game and determine details about the game world. Additional Yum Yums are handed out for advancing the plot, role-playing well, or making the GM snort lemonade out her nose.

In the play example of Rollo the Superspy (eyeballing Isvestia across the ballroom floor), he can throw the GM a Yum Yum instead of rolling dice, granting him an automatic success in his attempt to impress Isvestia. The GM again invokes his weakness, but Rollo can throw another Yum Yum to avoid having his Weakness take effect.  Now Isvestia's ready to tell him "anything".

== Complexity ==
QAGS can be as complex or as simple as the GM and players want it to be, and the rules can be easily adapted to include whatever mechanic a new setting might require.  For example, ''Rasslin’'' needed to add a mechanic for resolving the showy combat of professional wrestling; ''Rocket Jocks'' needed rules for spaceship combat; and ''Weird Times at Charles Fort High'' needed an alternative point-build character generation system to balance the different paranormal characters.

The '''realisation''' of a [[unit of measure]] is the conversion of its definition into reality.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|Realise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International vocabulary of metrology]] identifies three distinct ways in which this is done - the first being the realisation of a measurement unit from its definition, the second the reproduction of [[Standard (metrology)|measurement standards]], and the third the process of actually adopting a particular artefact as a standard.

In the case of the [[International System of Units]], realisation techniques for the [[SI base units|base units]] base are maintained by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]

==Overview==
The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word "realise" (also spelt "realize") as "to convert (something imagined, planned, etc.) into real existence or fact."&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;  The [[International vocabulary of metrology]] identifies three distinct ways in which this is done - the first being the realisation of a measurement unit from its definition, the second the reproduction of measurement standards and the third the process of actually adopting a particular artefact as a standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!--The term “realization” is used here in the most
general meaning. It denotes three procedures of
“realization”. The first one consists in the physical
realization of the measurement unit from its definition
and is realization sensu stricto. The second, termed
“reproduction”, consists not in realizing the measurement
unit from its definition but in setting up a highly
reproducible measurement standard based on a physical
phenomenon, as it happens, e.g. in case of use of
frequency-stabilized lasers to establish a measurement
standard for the metre, of the Josephson effect for the
volt or of the quantum Hall effect for the ohm. The third
procedure consists in adopting a material measure as a
measurement standard. It occurs in the case of the measurement
standard of 1 kg.  -  VIM Page 46--&gt;

==Techniques==

===Time===
The realisation of time has gone through three phases. During both the first and second phases, man used [[Solar time]]&amp;mdash;during the first phase, realisation of time was by observing the [[earth's rotation]] using such devices as the [[sundial]] or [[astrolabe]].  During the second phase actual [[Timekeeping|timing devices]] such as [[hourglass]]es or [[clock]]s were used. If the user needed to know [[time of day|time-of-day]] rather than elapsed time, clocks were [[Synchronization|synchronized]] with [[astronomical time]].  The third phase made use of clocks that were sufficiently accurate that they could measure variations in the earth's rotation&amp;mdash;such clocks taking over from the rotation of the earth as the prime measure of time.   &lt;!--Early man measured two aspects of time - seasons and time of day. The seasons were measured by keeping a record on how many days had passed since an astronomical phenomena as is believed to have happened at [[Stonehenge]].  Time of day was measured using . One of the earliest time-measuring devices was the introduced into Europe by Luitprand, a monk at the cathedral in [[Chartres]], France in the 8th century AD.--&gt;

===Length===
Units of length, along with mass (or weight) and time, are one of the earliest quantities that was measured by man.  Historically two distinct approaches were used - one was to use a naturally occurring phenomenon such as a particular seed or part of the human body, the other was to use a standard length that was held by a community leader.  
*[[Natural units]] - barleycorn, feet
*Regal units - measures held by ruler
*Using speed of light
An example of a modern realisation is the realisation of the [[meter]] in terms of optical frequency standards.&lt;ref name=Quinn2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quinn|first=T.

A '''recall election''' (also called a '''recall referendum''' or '''representative recall''') is a procedure by which, in certain [[Polity|polities]], voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before that official's term has ended. Recalls, which are initiated when sufficient voters sign a petition, have a history dating back to ancient [[Athenian democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Constitution of Athens'' 43.4&lt;/ref&gt; and feature in several contemporary constitutions. In indirect or [[representative democracy]], people's representatives are elected and these representatives rule for a specific period of time. However, where the facility to recall exists, should any representative come to be perceived as not properly discharging their responsibilities, then they can be called back with the written request of specific number or proportion of voters.

==Argentina==
The recall referendum arrived in Latin America shortly after its introduction at the US subnational level, in 1923 and 1933, to Cordoba and Entre Ríos provinces, respectively, both in Argentina. There, recall exists at the provincial level in Chaco (introduced in 1957), Chubut (1994), Córdoba (1923, 1987), Corrientes (1960), La Rioja (1986), Rio Negro (1988), Santiago del Estero and Tierra del Fuego (1991); other provinces include it for their municipalities, namely, Entre Ríos (1933), Neuquén (1957), Misiones (1958), San Juan (1986), San Luis (1987). It is also included in Buenos Aires City (1996).&lt;ref&gt;Welp, Yanina (2018) "Recall referendum around the world: origins, institutional designs and current debates", in Morel, Laurence &amp; Qvortrup, Matt. Compendium on Direct Democracy. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
===British Columbia===
In 1995, the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]] enacted representative recall. In the province of [[British Columbia]], voters in a provincial [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] can petition to have their representative in parliament removed from office, even if that MLA is also the premier. (Holding a seat in the legislature is not constitutionally necessary to be premier, however.) If enough registered voters sign the [[petition]], the speaker of the legislature announces in parliament that the member has been recalled and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|lieutenant governor]] drops the writ for a [[by-election]] as soon as possible, giving voters the opportunity to replace the politician in question. By January 2003, 22 recall efforts had been launched. No-one has been recalled so far, but one representative, [[Paul Reitsma]], resigned in 1998 when it looked as if the petition to recall him would have enough signatures to spur a recall election. Reitsma resigned during the secondary verification stage and the recall count ended.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Nova Scotia===
In [[Nova Scotia]], the [[Atlantica Party]] campaigned for a recall in the [[Nova Scotia general election, 2017|2017 provincial election]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Colombia==
In Colombia, the recall referendum was included by the [[constitution]] in 1991. The constitutional replacement was launched as an answer to the movement known as [[Colombian Constitution of 1991#Student movement and the séptima papeleta|''la séptima papeleta'']] (the seventh ballot), which requested a constitutional reform to end violence, narcoterrorism, corruption and increasing citizenship apathy. The definition of recall referendum in relation to programmatic vote was approved. It obliges candidates running for office to register a government plan which is later on considered to activate the recall. Since the time the mechanism was regulated by Law 134 in 1994, until 2015, 161 attempts led 41 referendums and none of them succeeded since the threshold of participation was not reached. In 2015, a new law (303/2015) reduced the number of signatures required to activate a recall referendum (from 40 per cent to 30 per cent of the total of votes obtained by the elected authority) and the threshold (dropping from the 50 per cent to the 40 per cent of valid votes on the day of the elections of the challenged authority). The change in the regulation, also quickening the registration of promoters, led to a considerable increase in the number of attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Yanina Welp &amp; Juan Pablo Milanese (2018): [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2017.1421176 Playing by the rules of the game: partisan use of recall referendums in Colombia], Democratization, DOI: 10.1080/13510347.2017.1421176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latvia==
Article 14 of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] enables the recall of the entire [[Saiema]], though not of specific representatives:

:&lt;u&gt;Article 14&lt;/u&gt;: Not less than one tenth of electors has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.
:If the majority of voters and at least two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections of the Saeima vote in the national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima, then the Saeima shall be deemed recalled.
:The right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima may not be exercised one year after the convening of the Saeima and one year before the end of the term of office of the Saeima, during the last six months of the term of office of the President, as well as earlier than six months after the previous national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima.
:
:The electors may not recall any individual member of the Saeima.

==Philippines==
Article 10 of the [[constitution of the Philippines]] allows for the recall of local officials. The Local Government Code, as amended, enabled the provisions of the constitution to be applied. Elected officials from provincial governors to the [[barangay]] councilors are allowed to be recalled. At least 25% of the electorate in a specific place must have their signatures verified in a petition in order for the recall to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bueza|first1=Michael|title=Fast Facts: The recall process|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/70044-fast-facts-process-recall|accessdate=5 February 2018|work=Rappler|date=2014-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president, vice president, members of Congress, and the elected officials of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] cannot be removed via recall.

The last recall election above the [[barangay]] level was the [[Puerto Princesa mayoral recall election, 2015|2015 Puerto Princesa mayoral recall election]].

==Peru==
Recall regulations were introduced in Peru by the [[Democratic Constituent Congress]] (''Congreso Constituyente Democrático'') which drafted a new constitution after [[Alberto Fujimori]]'s [[Self-coup|''autogolpe'']] in 1992. Between 1997 and 2013, more than 5000 recall referendums were activated against democratically elected authorities from 747 Peruvian municipalities (45.5% of all municipalities). This makes Peru the world's most intensive user of this mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Welp, Yanina (2016) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2015.1060222 “Recall referendums in Peruvian municipalities: a political weapon for bad losers or an instrument of accountability?”], Democratization 23 (7): 1162-1179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
While recalls are not provided for at the federal level in Switzerland, six [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] allow them:&lt;ref name=NZZ&gt;{{cite news|last=Jankovsky|first=Peter|title=Der Versuch, eine Exekutive zu stoppen|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Serd ült (2015) THE HISTORY OF A DORMANT INSTITUTION: LEGAL NORMS AND THE PRACTICE OF RECALL IN SWITZERLAND, Representation, 51:2, 161-172, DOI:  10.1080/00344893.2015.1056219&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Canton of Bern|Bern]]: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1846. 30,000 signatures (4% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive in 1852 (the 'Schatzgelder' affair).
*[[Schaffhausen]]: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1876. 1,000 signatures (2% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive in 2000, triggered by the lawyer and cantonal MP Gerold Meier.
*[[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]]: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1869. 6,000 signatures (3% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful attempt to recall the executive and legislative in 1995 (related to a banking scandal). Three further attempts (in 1887, 1961 and 1973) failed to collect the necessary number of signatures.
*[[Ticino]]: Recall of the executive has been possible since 1892. 15,000 signatures (7% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There has been one unsuccessful recall attempt in 1942. In addition, recall of municipal executives has been possible since 2011. Signatures of 30% of all adult citizens are required to trigger a recall referendum.
*[[Thurgau]]: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1869. 20,000 signatures (13% of all adult citizens) are required to trigger a recall referendum. There have been no recall attempts.
*[[Canton of Uri|Uri]]: Recall of the executive and legislative has been possible since 1888. Since 1979, 600 signatures (3% of all adult citizens) have been required to trigger a recall referendum. In addition, recall of municipal executives and legislatives has been possible since 2011. Signatures of 10% of registered voters are required to trigger a recall referendum. There have been no recall attempts either at the cantonal or municipal levels.

The possibility of recall referendums (together with the popular election of executives, the [[initiative]] and the legislative referendum) was introduced into several cantonal constitutions after the 1860s in the course of a broad movement for democratic reform. The instrument has never been of any practical importance—the few attempts at recall so far have failed, usually because the required number of signatures was not collected—and it was abolished in the course of constitutional revisions in [[Aargau]] (1980), [[Baselland]] (1984) and [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]] (2007). The only successful recall so far happened in the Canton of Aargau in the year 1862. However, the possibility of recalling municipal executives was newly introduced in Ticino in 2011, with 59% of voters in favor, as a reaction to the perceived problem of squabbling and dysfunctional municipal governments.&lt;ref name=NZZ /&gt;

== Taiwan ==
In [[Taiwan]], according to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]], the recall of the president or the vice president shall be initiated upon the proposal of one-fourth of all members of the [[Legislative Yuan]], and also passed by two-thirds of all the members. The final recall must be passed by more than one-half of the valid ballots in a vote in which more than one-half of the electorate in the free area of the Republic of China takes part.

== Ukraine ==
A year after the [[2015 Ukrainian local elections]], voters can achieve a recall election of an elected deputy or mayor if as many signatures as voters are collected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bunews.com.ua/politics/item/local-vote-international-implications Local vote, global implications], [[Business Ukraine]] (1 October 2015)&lt;br&gt;[http://www.unian.info/society/1154212-poroshenko-responds-to-petition-on-recalling-mps.html Poroshenko responds to petition on recalling MPs], [[UNIAN]] (16 October 2015)&lt;br&gt;[http://uacrisis.org/33146-elections-law What the new Local Elections Law changed?], [[Ukrainian Crisis Media Center]] (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:Presenting Seattle recall petitions 1910.jpg|thumb|400 px|Submitting petitions for the recall of [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] mayor [[Hiram Gill]] in December 1910; Gill was removed by a recall election the following February, but voters returned him to the office in 1914]]
Recall first appeared in Colonial America in the laws of the General Court of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1631.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Spivak, History News Network, http://hnn.us/articles/1660.html&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the recall involved one elected body removing another official. During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Articles of Confederation]] stipulated that state legislatures might recall delegates from the [[Continental Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Article V of the Articles of Confederation provided, "a power reserved to each state, to recall its delegates, or any of them, at any time within the year, and to send others in their stead, for the remainder of the Year."&lt;/ref&gt; According to New York Delegate John Lansing, the power was never exercised by any state. The [[Virginia Plan]], issued at the outset of the [[Philadelphia Convention]] of 1787, proposed to pair recall with rotation in office and to apply these dual principles to the lower house of the national legislature. The recall was rejected by the Constitutional Convention. However, the anti-Federalists used the lack of recall provision as a weapon in the ratification debates.

Several states proposed adopting a recall for US senators in the years immediately following the adoption of the Constitution. However, it did not pass.

Only two governors have ever been successfully recalled. In 1921, Governor [[Lynn Frazier]] of [[North Dakota]] was [[North Dakota gubernatorial recall election|recalled during a dispute about state-owned industries]]. In 2003, Governor [[Gray Davis]] of [[California]] was [[California gubernatorial recall election|recalled over the state budget]]. Additionally, in 1988, a recall was approved against Governor [[Evan Mecham]] of [[Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watkins |first=Ronald J.|title=High Crimes and Misdemeanors : The Term and Trials of Former Governor Evan Mecham|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-688-09051-6|pages=194–195, 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was impeached and convicted before it got on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/13/us/arizona-s-supreme-court-blocks-a-special-gubernatorial-election.html |title=Arizona's Supreme Court Blocks A Special Gubernatorial Election |pages=A20:1 |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alaska]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], specific grounds are required for a recall. Some form of malfeasance or misconduct while in office must be identified by the petitioners. The target may choose to dispute the validity of the grounds in court, and a court then judges whether the allegations in the petition rise to a level where a recall is necessary. In the November 2010 general election, [[Illinois]] passed a [[referendum]] to amend the state constitution to allow a recall of the state's governor, in light of former Governor [[Rod Blagojevich corruption charges|Rod Blagojevich's corruption scandal]]. In the other eleven states that permit statewide recall, no grounds are required and recall petitions may be circulated for any reason. However, the target is permitted to submit responses to the stated reasons for recall.

The minimum number of signatures to qualify a recall, and the time limit to do so, vary among the states. In addition, the handling of recalls, once they qualify, differs. In some states a recall triggers a simultaneous special election, where the vote on the recall, as well as the vote on the replacement if the recall succeeds, are on the same ballot. In the 2003 California recall election, over 100 candidates appeared on the replacement portion of the ballot. In other states, a separate special election is held after the target is recalled, or a replacement is appointed by the Governor or some other state authority.

===2011 recalls===
In 2011, there were at least 150 recall elections in the United States. Of these, 75 officials were recalled, and nine officials resigned under threat of recall. Recalls were held in 17 states in 73 different jurisdictions. [[Michigan]] had the most recalls (at least 30). The year set a record for number of state legislator recall elections (11 elections) beating the previous one-year high (three elections). Three jurisdictions adopted the recall in 2011.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"&gt;http://recallelections.blogspot.com/2011/12/year-in-recalls-150-recalls-in-2011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Of recall elections, 52 were for [[city council]], 30 were for [[mayor]], 17 were for [[school board]], 11 were for [[state legislators]], and one was for a [[prosecuting attorney]] ([[York County, Nebraska]]). The largest municipality to hold a recall was [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], for mayor.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;

The busiest day was November 8 ([[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]) with 26 recalls. In 34 jurisdictions, recalls were held over multiple days.&lt;ref name="blogspot1"/&gt;

===Unsuccessful attempts to qualify recall elections===
* 1967 [[United States Senator]] [[Frank Church]] of [[Idaho]] was the subject of an unsuccessful recall effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.boisestate.edu/special/church/CHURCH1.HTM Frank Church Chronology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210191235/http://library.boisestate.edu/special/church/CHURCH1.HTM |date=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts ruled that a federal official is not subject to state recall laws.
* 1988 [[Evan Mecham]], Governor of [[Arizona]], was scheduled for a recall election on May 17 of that year, after a successful petition drive (301,000 signatures).  However, the Supreme Court of Arizona canceled the election, since Mecham had already been impeached and removed from office by the Senate on April 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arizona's Supreme Court Blocks A Special Gubernatorial Election |pages=A20:1 |publisher=The [[New York Times]] |date=April 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1992-93 California Governor [[Pete Wilson]] was targeted for recall by the ''[[Bite 'Em Back]]'' campaign, which was a [[grassroots]] effort that came about as a result of a piece by ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' [[columnist]] [[San Jose Mercury News West Magazine|Pat Dillon]], in response to the then-ongoing California budgetary crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://titanyearbook.com/archives/1992/1992-11-18.pdf Daily Titan], "''Group asks for Wilson's recall''," by Matt Cliff (November 18th, 1992 - retrieved on June 18th, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-10-04/local/me-780_1_valley-college Los Angeles Times], "''VALLEY COLLEGE:  Wilson Recall Campaign Started''," by Jennifer Case (October 4th, 1992 - retrieved on June 19th, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bite 'Em Back'' campaign also intended to recall then-[[List of Speakers of the California State Assembly|Speaker]] of the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] [[Willie L. Brown]], and then-[[President pro tempore of the California State Senate|President Pro Tem]] of the [[California State Senate|state Senate]], [[David Roberti]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
*2003 [[H. Brent Coles]], mayor of Boise, Idaho, was the subject of a recall petition drive. Coles resigned on February 14, 2003, before the recall drive could proceed.&lt;ref name="coles"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/15/us/charged-with-getting-free-olympics-trip-boise-mayor-resigns.html "Charged With Getting Free Olympics Trip, Boise Mayor Resigns"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 15, 2003. (accessed 8 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
*2009 [[Joseph Cao]] [[U.S. representative]] for [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]], was determined to be inelligble for recall as per his status as a [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] office holder.
*2009 a petition failed to garner sufficient signatures to oblige an election for [[Eddie Price III#Failure of recall petition|recall of Eddie Price III]], mayor of [[Mandeville, Louisiana]].
*2009 a petition for [[Malcolm Suber|recall of Stacy Head]], [[New Orleans]] city councilwoman, likewise failed to gain the requisite number of signatures.
*2010 there were two unsuccessful recall petitions for [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] mayor of [[Portland, OR]].
*2010 there was one unsuccessful recall petition for [[Lisa Poppaw]] city council member of [[Fort Collins, CO]].
*2010 there was one unsuccessful recall petition for [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] mayor of [[Los Angeles]].
*2010, a recall proposal aimed at mayor [[Ron Littlefield]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] failed after a judge of the [[Hamilton County, Tennessee]] [[circuit court]] ruled that too many of the petition signatures were invalid and that the petitioners had failed to properly adhere to the state's recall law, leaving "pages without dates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chattanoogan.com/articles/article_183480.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2011, the [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] ruled in November that the Hamilton County Circuit Court Judge [[Jeff Hollingsworth]] did not have the jurisdiction in entering an injunction against the Hamilton County Election Commission. In its judgment summary the Appeals Court said, "The trial court acted without jurisdiction in entering an injunction against the Election Commission. The judgment of the trial court is vacated and the complaint dismissed." Mayor Littlefield is continuing legal action to stop the recall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_212673.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2011, as part of the [[Wisconsin Senate recall elections, 2011]], there were a number of failed recall petitions.  Petitions against senators [[Lena Taylor]] (D), [[Spencer Coggs]] (D), [[Mark F. Miller|Mark Miller]] (D), [[Glenn Grothman]] (R), [[Julie Lassa]] (D), [[Fred Risser]] (D), and [[Mary Lazich]] (R), were unsuccessful.  Many senators had multiple recall petitions filed against them, and in the case of both Wirch and Hansen, one succeeded while others failed.
*2011, an effort to recall [[Michigan]] [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]] was ended after organizers did not obtain enough petition signatures to appear on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2011/09/report_effort_to_recall_michig.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==
Article 72 of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]] enables the recall of any elected representative, including the President. This provision was used in the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004]], which attempted to remove President [[Hugo Chavez]]:

:&lt;u&gt;Article 72&lt;/u&gt;: All &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; offices filled by popular vote are subject to revocation.
:Once one-half of the term of office to which an official has been elected has elapsed, a number of voters representing at least 20% of the registered voters in the affected constituency may petition for the calling of a referendum to revoke that official's mandate.
:When a number of voters equal to or greater than the number of those who elected the official vote in favour of the recall, provided that a number of voters equal to or greater than 25% of the total number of registered voters vote in the recall referendum, the official's mandate shall be deemed revoked and immediate action shall be taken to fill the permanent vacancy as provided for by this Constitution and by law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9785">In mathematics, a '''regular semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] ''S'' in which every element is '''regular''', i.e., for each element ''a'', there exists an element ''x'' such that ''axa'' = ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular semigroups are one of the most-studied classes of semigroups, and their structure is particularly amenable to study via [[Green's relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Howie 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Regular semigroups were introduced by [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]] in his influential 1951 paper "On the structure of semigroups"; this was also the paper in which [[Green's relations]] were introduced.  The concept of ''regularity'' in a semigroup was adapted from an analogous condition for [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], already considered by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was Green's study of regular semigroups which led him to define his celebrated [[Green's relations|relations]].  According to a footnote in Green 1951, the suggestion that the notion of regularity be applied to [[semigroup]]s was first made by [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]].

The term '''inversive semigroup''' (French: demi-groupe inversif) was historically used as synonym in the papers of [[Gabriel Thierrin]] (a student of [[Paul Dubreil]]) in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|date=16 July 2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~gab/pubr.html&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still used occasionally.&lt;ref name="Golan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan S. Golan|title=Power Algebras over Semirings: With Applications in Mathematics and Computer Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JuvyWYv7f4C&amp;pg=PA104|year=1999|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-5834-3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The basics ==
There are two equivalent ways in which to define a regular semigroup ''S'':
:(1) for each ''a'' in ''S'', there is an ''x'' in ''S'', which is called a '''pseudoinverse''',&lt;ref&gt;Klip, Knauer and Mikhalev : p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; with ''axa'' = ''a'';
:(2) every element ''a'' has at least one '''inverse''' ''b'', in the sense that ''aba'' = ''a'' and ''bab'' = ''b''.
To see the equivalence of these definitions, first suppose that ''S'' is defined by (2).  Then ''b'' serves as the required ''x'' in (1).  Conversely, if ''S'' is defined by (1), then ''xax'' is an inverse for ''a'', since ''a''(''xax'')''a'' = ''axa''(''xa'') = ''axa'' = ''a'' and (''xax'')''a''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')(''xax'') = ''xa''(''xax'') = ''x''(''axa'')''x'' = ''xax''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : Lemma 1.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of inverses (in the above sense) of an element ''a'' in an arbitrary [[semigroup]] ''S'' is denoted by ''V''(''a'').&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, another way of expressing definition (2) above is to say that in a regular semigroup, ''V''(''a'') is nonempty, for every ''a'' in ''S''.  The product of any element ''a'' with any ''b'' in ''V''(''a'') is always [[idempotent]]: ''abab'' = ''ab'', since ''aba'' = ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of regular semigroups ===
*Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a regular semigroup.
*Every [[band (mathematics)|band]] (idempotent semigroup) is regular in the sense of this article, though this is not what is meant by a [[band (mathematics)#Regular bands|regular band]].
*The [[bicyclic semigroup]] is regular.
*Any [[transformation semigroup|full transformation semigroup]] is regular.
*A [[Rees matrix semigroup]] is regular.
* The [[homomorphic image]] of a regular semigroup is regular.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Lemma 2.4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unique inverses and unique pseudoinverses ===
A regular semigroup in which idempotents commute is an [[inverse semigroup]], or equivalently, every element has a ''unique'' inverse.  To see this, let ''S'' be a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.  Then every element of ''S'' has at least one inverse.  Suppose that ''a'' in ''S'' has two inverses ''b'' and ''c'', i.e.,
:''aba'' = ''a'', ''bab'' = ''b'', ''aca'' = ''a'' and ''cac'' = ''c''. Also ''ab'', ''ba'', ''ac'' and ''ca'' are idempotents as above.
Then
:''b'' = ''bab'' = ''b''(''aca'')''b'' = ''bac''(''a'')''b =''bac''(''aca'')''b = ''bac''(''ac'')(''ab'') = ''bac''(''ab'')(''ac'') = ''ba''(''ca'')''bac'' = ''ca''(''ba'')''bac'' = ''c''(''aba'')''bac'' = ''cabac'' = ''cac'' = ''c''.
So, by commuting the pairs of idempotents ''ab'' &amp; ''ac'' and ''ba'' &amp; ''ca'', the inverse of ''a'' is shown to be unique.  Conversely, it can be shown that any [[inverse semigroup]] is a regular semigroup in which idempotents commute.&lt;ref name="Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1"&gt;Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of a unique pseudoinverse implies the existence of a unique inverse, but the opposite is not true. For example, in the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]], the empty transformation Ø does not have a unique pseudoinverse, because Ø = Ø''f''Ø for any transformation ''f''. The inverse of Ø is unique however, because only one ''f'' satisfies the additional constraint that ''f'' = ''f''Ø''f'', namely ''f'' = Ø. This remark holds more generally in any semigroup with zero. Furthermore, if every element has a unique pseudoinverse, then the semigroup is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], and the unique pseudoinverse of an element coincides with the group inverse.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=objects&amp;id=6391&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green's relations ==
Recall that the [[principal ideal]]s of a semigroup ''S'' are defined in terms of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the ''semigroup with identity adjoined''; this is to ensure that an element ''a'' belongs to the principal right, left and two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s which it generates.  In a regular semigroup ''S'', however, an element ''a'' = ''axa'' automatically belongs to these ideals, without recourse to adjoining an identity.  [[Green's relations]] can therefore be redefined for regular semigroups as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{L}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''Sa'' = ''Sb'';
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{R}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''aS'' = ''bS'';
:&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{J}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, ''SaS'' = ''SbS''.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a regular semigroup ''S'', every &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-class contains at least one [[idempotent]].  If ''a'' is any element of ''S'' and α is any inverse for ''a'', then ''a'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;-related to ''αa'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-related to ''aα''.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Preston 1961 : Lemma 1.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem.'''  Let ''S'' be a regular semigroup, and let ''a'' and ''b'' be elements of ''S''.  Then
*&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{L}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, there exist α in ''V''(''a'') and β in ''V''(''b'') such that α''a'' = β''b'';
*&lt;math&gt;a\,\mathcal{R}\,b&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, there exist α in ''V''(''a'') and β in ''V''(''b'') such that ''a''α = ''b''β.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Proposition 2.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]], then the idempotent in each &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;- and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;-class is unique.&lt;ref name="Howie 1995 : Theorem 5.1.1"/&gt;

== Special classes of regular semigroups ==
Some special classes of regular semigroups are:&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : Section 2.4 &amp; Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Locally inverse semigroups'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is '''locally inverse''' if ''eSe'' is an inverse semigroup, for each [[idempotent]] ''e''.
*''[[Orthodox semigroup]]s'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is '''orthodox''' if its subset of [[idempotent]]s forms a subsemigroup.
*''Generalised inverse semigroups'': a regular semigroup ''S'' is called a '''generalised inverse semigroup''' if its [[idempotent]]s form a normal band, i.e., ''xyzx'' = ''xzyx'', for all [[idempotent]]s ''x'', ''y'', ''z''.
The [[class (set theory)|class]] of generalised inverse semigroups is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the class of locally inverse semigroups and the class of orthodox semigroups.&lt;ref&gt;Howie 1995 : 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

All inverse semigroups are orthodox and locally inverse. The converse statements do not hold.

'''Siemon Allen''' (born in [[Durban]], South Africa) is an artist working mainly with [[installation art|installations]]. He is living and working in the United States. Allen is considered one of the most prominent exponents of the South African arts diaspora in the Northeastern USA.&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Sue |author2=Perryer, Sophie (ed.) |others= |title=10 years 100 artists: art in a democratic South Africa |publisher=Struik |year=2004 |pages=34–37 |isbn=978-1-86872-987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Siemon Allen studied fine arts at the Technikon Natal in Durban, where he graduated with a Master of Arts in 1999. During his studies he got to know his future wife, an American, and together they moved to the US later on. Today, Allen is working as a visiting professor at the department for sculpture and extended media at the [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.vcu.edu/sculpture/portfolios/siemon-allen/ Allen's profile on Virginia University's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

While still living in South Africa, Allen was founding member of the FLAT Gallery (1993–1995) within the context of an artists' initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siemonallen.org/flat.html Flat-project on the artist's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen's works were exhibited at the 2nd Johannesburg Biennale as part of the exhibition "Graft".he hasn't talked mostly about his private life in public life His works are part of many collections in- and outside of South Africa, including the collections of the Durban Art Gallery, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City&lt;ref name="Williamson" /&gt; and the [[Standard Bank]] Collection.

== Work philosophy ==
Siemon Allen is a passionate collector and [[archivist]] of South African [[ephemera]], which he uses to create large-scale visual and informational [[installation art|installations]]. Accordingly, these works are entitled "collection projects" and primarily explore the concept of creating identity through distance and the image of South Africa in general.

For his installations, Allen systematically accumulates mass-produced printed materials, which he catalogues and exhibits. The working process thus is similar to the one of an archivist.
As a South African living abroad, Allen is especially interested in exploring and understanding how a country is seen from outside and what is the country's role in building this image. In the early 2000s he came across a website of the South African government that strongly advertised an appeal for positive branding-politics outside of the country as well as for the recruitment of non-governmental South Africans living abroad to act as "ambassadors" for the country. Allen's installations both debunk this essentialist thought of a South African "brand" and contribute to it.

Allen's actual project is about the creation of a vast, internet-based archive of audio-documents regarding the South African history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flatinternational.org/ Homepage of his project "Flat International"]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition which resulted from this archive was called "Records" and was shown in South Africa in 2009 and in the US in 2010.

'''Social cognition''' is "a sub-topic of [[social psychology]] that focuses on how people process, store, and apply information about other people and social situations. It focuses on the role that [[cognitive processes]] play in social interactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Park |first=Mina |last2= Song |first2=Jae-Jin |last3=Oh |first3=Seo Jin |last4=Shin |first4=Min-Sup |last5=Lee |first5=Jun Ho |last6=Oh |first6= Seung Ha |journal= BioMed Research International |language=en |volume=2015 |pages=1–7 |doi= 10.1155/2015/313274 |pmid= 26236723 |pmc= 4506840 |issn= 2314-6133 |title=The Relation between Nonverbal IQ and Postoperative CI Outcomes in Cochlear Implant Users: Preliminary Result |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More technically, social cognition refers to how people deal with [[conspecifics]] (members of the same species) or even across species (such as pet) information, include four stages: encoding, storage, retrieval, and processing. In the area of [[social psychology]], social cognition refers to a specific approach in which these processes are studied according to the methods of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[information processing theory]]. According to this view, social cognition is a level of analysis that aims to understand social psychological phenomena by investigating the cognitive processes that underlie them.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt; The major concerns of the approach are the processes involved in the perception, judgment, and memory of social stimuli; the effects of social and affective factors on information processing; and the behavioral and interpersonal consequences of cognitive processes. This level of analysis may be applied to any content area within social psychology, including research on intrapersonal, interpersonal, intragroup, and intergroup processes.

The term ''social cognition'' has been used in multiple areas in [[psychology]] and [[Social cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience]], most often to refer to various social abilities disrupted in [[autism]],&lt;ref name="Striano"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Cognition: Development, Neuroscience and Autism|editor=Striano, T.|editor2=Reid, V.|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-1-4051-6217-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref name="Billeke-Aboitiz-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 =Billeke | first1 = P. | last2 = Aboitiz | first2 = F.  | title = Social cognition in schizophrenia: from social stimuli processing to social engagement| journal =Frontiers in Psychiatry  | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = eCollection 2013 |date=February 2013 | doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00004 | pmid = 23444313 | pmc=3580762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other disorders.&lt;ref name="BlairMitchellBlair"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain|last=Blair|first=J.|author2=Mitchel, D. |author3=Blair, K.  |year=2005|isbn=978-0-631-23336-7|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|pages=25–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cognitive neuroscience the biological basis of social cognition is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cacioppo, J.T.|author2=Berntson, G.G.|author3=Sheridan, J.F.|author4=McClintock, M.K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Multilevel integrative analyses of human behavior: social neuroscience and the complementing nature of social and biological approaches|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=126|issue=6|pages=829–43|pmid=11107878|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.6.829|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806233305/http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cbsm00.pdf|archivedate=2015-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cacioppo, J.T.|year=2002|title=Social neuroscience: understanding the pieces fosters understanding the whole and vice versa|journal=American Psychologist|volume=57|issue=11|pages=819–31|pmid=12564179|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.11.819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=R.|title=Social cognition and the human brain|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=3|pages=469–79|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01399-6|pmid=10562726|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.207.7847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Developmental psychologist]]s study the development of social cognition abilities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|title= Developmental Psychology: Childhood and Adolescence|last=Shaffer |first=D.R.|author2=Kipp, K. |isbn=978-0-495-60171-5|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|chapter=Chapter 12: Theories of social and cognitive development |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Social cognition came to prominence with the rise of [[cognitive psychology]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s and is now the dominant model and approach in mainstream [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name=Husain&gt;{{cite book|title= Social Psychology|last=Husain |first=A. |isbn=9788131760000 |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]]|chapter=Chapter 5: Social Perception and Cognition |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common to social cognition theories is the idea that information is represented in the brain as "[[mentalism (psychology)|cognitive elements]]" such as [[schema (psychology)|schemas]], [[attribution theory|attributions]], or [[stereotype]]s. A focus on how these cognitive elements are processed is often employed. Social cognition therefore applies and extends many themes, theories, and paradigms from cognitive psychology that can be identified in [[cognitive bias|reasoning]] ([[representativeness heuristic]], [[base rate fallacy]] and [[confirmation bias]]), [[attention]] ([[automaticity]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]) and [[memory]] (schemas, [[primacy effect|primacy and recency]]). It is likely that social psychology has always had a more [[cognitive]] than general psychology approach, as it traditionally discussed internal mental states such as [[belief]]s and desires when mainstream psychology was dominated by [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=S.T.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |title=Social Cognition |isbn=978-0-07-100910-2|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]], Inc.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable theory of social cognition is social schema theory, although it is not the basis of all social cognition studies (for example, see [[attribution theory]]).&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; It has been suggested that other disciplines in social psychology such as [[social identity theory]] and [[social representations]] may be seeking to explain largely the same phenomena as social cognition, and that these different disciplines might be merged into a "coherent integrated whole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augustinos|first=M. |author2=Walker, I. |author3=Donaghue, N.|title=Social Cognition an Integrated Introduction|isbn=978-0-7619-4218-4|publisher=[[Sage Publications]] Ltd|year=2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel paradigm has arisen in the study of action, termed [[motor cognition]], which is concerned with understanding the representation of action and the associated process.

==Social schemas==
Social schema theory builds on and uses terminology from [[schema theory]] in cognitive psychology, which describes how ideas or "[[concept]]s" are [[representation (psychology)|represented in the brain]] and how they are [[categorized]]. According to this view, when we see or think of a concept a mental representation or [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is "activated" bringing to mind other information which is linked to the original concept by association. This activation often happens unconsciously. As a result of activating such schemas, judgements are formed which go beyond the information actually available, since many of the associations the schema evokes extend outside the given information. This may influence social cognition and behaviour regardless of whether these judgements are accurate or not. For example, if an individual is introduced as a teacher, then a "teacher schema" may be activated. Subsequently, we might associate this person with wisdom or authority, or past experiences of teachers that we remember and consider important.

When a schema is more accessible it can be more quickly activated and used in a particular situation. Two cognitive processes that increase accessibility of schemas are [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] and [[priming (psychology)|priming]]. Salience is the degree to which a particular social object stands out relative to other social objects in a situation. The higher the salience of an object the more likely that schemas for that object will be made accessible. For example, if there is one female in a group of seven males, female gender schemas may be more accessible and influence the group's thinking and [[behavior]] toward the female group member.&lt;ref name="Fiske"/&gt; Priming refers to any experience immediately prior to a situation that causes a schema to be more accessible. For example, watching a scary movie late at night might increase the accessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood that a person will perceive shadows and background noises as potential threats.

Social cognition researchers are interested in how new information is integrated into pre-established schemas, especially when the information contrasts with the existing schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpay |first=L.|author2=Verhoef, J. |author3=Teeni, D. |author4=Putter, H. |author5=Toussaint, P. |author6= Zwetsloot-Schonk, J.  |year=2008 |title=Can contextualisation increase understanding during man-machine communication? A theory driven study |journal=The Open Medical Informatics Journal |volume=2 |pages=82–91|doi=10.2174/1874431100802010082|pmid=19415137|pmc=2669642}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a student may have a pre-established schema that all teachers are assertive and bossy. After encountering a teacher who is timid and shy, a social cognition researcher might be interested in how the student will integrate this new information with his/her existing teacher schema. Pre-established schemas tend to guide attention to new information, as people selectively attend to information that is consistent with the schema and ignore information that is inconsistent. This is referred to as a [[confirmation bias]]. Sometimes inconsistent information is sub-categorized and stored away as a special case, leaving the original schema intact without any alterations. This is referred to as subtyping.

Social cognition researchers are also interested in the [[regulation]] of activated schemas. It is believed that the situational activation of schemas is automatic, meaning that it is outside individual conscious control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In many situations however, the schematic information that has been activated may be in conflict with the [[social norms]] of the situation in which case an individual is [[motivate]]d to [[social inhibition|inhibit]] the influence of the schematic information on their thinking and [[social behavior]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Whether a person will successfully regulate the application of the activated schemas is dependent on individual differences in self-regulatory ability and the presence of situational impairments to executive control.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} High self-regulatory ability and the lack of situational impairments on executive functioning increase the likelihood that individuals will successfully inhibit the influence of automatically activated schemas on their thinking and social behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When people stop suppressing the influence of the unwanted thoughts, a rebound effect can occur where the thought becomes hyper-accessible.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Cultural differences==
Social psychologists have become increasingly interested in the influence of culture on social cognition.&lt;ref name= "Aronson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |author2=Wilson, T |author3=Akert, R.|title=Social Psychology |publisher=Pearson |chapter=Chapter 3: Social Cognition |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the content of schemas has been found to differ for individuals based on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study interviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from Swaziland and compared their schemas about cattle.&lt;ref name=Bartlett&gt;{{cite book |title= Remembering |last=Bartlett |first=F. |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press |page=249 |year=1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because cattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the Bantu herdsmen's schemas for cattle were far more extensive than the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen was able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while the Scottish settler was not.

Cultural influences have been found to shape some of the basic ways in which people automatically perceive and think about their environment.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; For example, a number of studies have found that people who grow up in East Asian cultures such as [[China]] and [[Japan]] tend to develop holistic thinking styles, whereas people brought up in Western cultures like Australia and the USA tend to develop analytic thinking styles.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nisbett |first=R. |author2=Peng, K. |author3=Choi, I. |author4= Norenzayan, A.  |title=Culture and Systems of thought: Holistic vs. analytic cognition |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |pages=291–310 |year=2001 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.291 |pmid=11381831 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Takahiko Masuda |last1=Masuda |first1=T. |last2=Nisbett|first2=R. |title=Culture and change blindness |journal=Cognitive Science: A Multidisciplinary Journal. |volume=30 |pages=381–389 |year=2006 |doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0000_63 |pmid=21702819 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typically Eastern holistic thinking style is a type of thinking in which people focus on the overall context and the ways in which objects relate to each other.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett" /&gt; For example, if an Easterner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling then he/she might scan everyone's face in the class, and then use this information to judge how the individual is feeling.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masuda |first=T. |author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|authorlink2=Phoebe C. Ellsworth|authorlink3=Batja Mesquita |author3=Mesquita, B.  |title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=94 |pages=365–381 |year=2008 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365 |pmid=18284287 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the typically Western analytic thinking style is a type of thinking style in which people focus on individual objects and neglect to consider the surrounding context.&lt;ref name= "Masuda 2006" /&gt; For example, if a Westerner was asked to judge how a classmate is feeling, then he or she might focus only on the classmate's face in order to make the judgment.&lt;ref name = "Masuda 2008" /&gt;

Nisbett (2003) suggested that cultural differences in social cognition may stem from the various philosophical traditions of the East (i.e. [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) versus the Greek philosophical traditions (i.e. of Aristotle and Plato) of the West.&lt;ref name= "Aronson" /&gt; However, recent research indicates that differences in social cognition may originate from physical differences in the environments of the two cultures. One study found that scenes from Japanese cities were 'busier' than those in the USA as they contain more objects which compete for attention. In this study, the Eastern holistic thinking style (and focus on the overall context) was attributed to the busier nature of the Japanese physical environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miyamoto |first=Y. |author2=Kitayama, S.  |title=Cultural variation in correspondence bias: The critical role of attitude diagnosticity of socially constrained behaviour |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |pages=1239–1248 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.5.1239 |pmid=12416925 |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.319.6787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social cognitive neuroscience==
{{See also|Social cognitive neuroscience}}
Early interest in the relationship between brain function and social cognition includes the case of [[Phineas Gage]], whose behaviour was reported to have changed after an accident damaged one or both of his frontal lobes. More recent [[neuropsychological]] studies have shown that [[acquired brain injury|brain injuries]] disrupt social cognitive processes.

The development of social cognitive processes in infants and children has also been researched extensively (see [[developmental psychology]]). For example, it has been suggested that some aspects of psychological processes that promote social behavior (such as [[Face perception|facial recognition]]) may be [[psychological nativism|innate]]. Consistent with this, very young babies recognize and selectively respond to social stimuli such as the voice, face and scent of their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |pages=182–3 |chapter=Chapter 5: Social Development |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-631-14809-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}

The '''Ten suchnesses''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 十如是 ''shí rúshì''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 十如是 ''jū nyoze'') are a [[Mahayana]] doctrine which is important, as well as unique, to that of the [[Tiantai]] ([[Tendai]]) and [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] [[Buddhist]] schools of thought.  The doctrine is derived from a passage found within the second chapter of Kumarajiva's Chinese translation of the [[Lotus Sutra]], that "characterizes the ultimate reality (literally, “real mark”) of all dharmas in terms of ten suchnesses."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=845}} This concept is also known as the '''ten reality aspects''', '''ten factors of life''', or the '''Reality of all Existence'''.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee"&gt;{{harvnb|Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2002|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kato&gt;{{harvnb|Kato|1993|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The list of ten suchnesses is neither found in [[Dharmaraksha]]'s Chinese translation nor in the Tibetan edition or any of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts.{{sfn|Robert|2011|pp=148-153}}{{sfn|Pye|2003|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7}} 
  
The Sanskrit editions of the Lotus Sutra list only five elements:{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7}}{{refn |group=note|Similar translations of this passage in Sanskrit manuscripts were published by Kern and Burnouf.{{sfn|Kern |1884|p=32}}{{sfn|Burnouf|1925|p=20}}}}
{{quote|Only the Thus Come One knows all the dharmas:
what are the dharmas,
how are the dharmas,
what are the dharmas like,
of what characteristics are the dharmas,
of what nature are the dharmas;
what they are,
how they are,
what they are like,
of what characteristics they are,
of what nature are the dharmas,
only the Thus Come One has had direct experience in those dharmas.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=148}}{{sfn|Wogihara|1934|p=20}}}}

[[Kumarajiva]] translates the passage in Chapter Two as:{{refn |group=note|For alternative English translations of Kumarajiva's text, see Kato, Kubo and Watson.{{sfn|Kato|1975|p=31}}{{sfn|Kubo|2007|p=23}}{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=57}}}}
{{quote|Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaust their reality, namely the suchness of the dharmas, the suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their powers, the suchness of their functions, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the absolute identity of their beginning and end.{{sfn|Hurvitz |1976|pp=22-23}}}}

The discrepancy between Kumarajivas translation and  the Sanskrit editions might be due to Kumarajiva's use of a manuscript variant but Groner and Stone suggest that "the expansion of this list to ten is probably
Kumarajiva's invention and may well be presaged in a passage in the Dazhidulun that includes nine aspects."{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=148}}{{refn |group=note|The Great Perfection of Wisdom Treatise (Chinese Dazhidu lun, Japanese Daichido ron), a work traditionally attributed to [[Nagarjuna]], translated by [[Kumarajiva]] in 406 CE (T 25.298c). It contains a broad commentary on the Pancavimsatisahasrikaprajnaparamitasutra and Buswell describes it as an "authoritative source" of Mahayana doctrine for Chinese scholars like Sengzhao, Fazang, Zhiyi and Tanluan.{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=227}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1944|p=}}}}

== Definitions ==
The following definitions are given by the Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describe what each suchness means in more detail:

* Appearance (form): the attributes of everything that is discernible, such as color, shape, or behavior.
* Nature (nature): the inherent disposition or quality of a person or thing that cannot be discerned from the outward appearance.
* Entity (embodiment): the substance of life that permeates as well as integrates both appearance and nature.
The above three suchnesses describe the reality of life itself.  The next six suchnesses, from the fourth through the ninth, explain the functions and workings of life.
* Power (potency): life's potential energy.
* Influence (function): the activity produced when life's inherent power or potential energy is activated.
* Internal cause (primary cause): the potential cause in life that produces an effect of the same quality as itself, i.e., good, evil, or neutral.
* Relation (secondary Cause): the relationship of secondary, indirect causes to the internal cause. Secondary causes are various conditions, both internal and external, that help the internal cause produce an effect.
* Latent effect (effect): the dormant effect produced in life when an internal cause is activated through its related conditions.
* Manifest effect (recompense): the tangible, perceivable effect that emerges in time as an expression of a dormant effect and therefore of a potential cause, again through its related conditions.
* Consistency from beginning to end (complete fundamental whole): the unifying factor among the ten suchnesses. It indicates that all of the other nine suchnesses from ''Appearance'' to ''Manifest Effect'' are consistently interrelated. All nine suchnesses thus harmoniously express the same condition of existence at any given moment.

==Interpretation==
The ten suchnesses, or categories, are what led the sixth century [[Chinese Buddhist]] philosopher [[Zhiyi]] to establish the doctrine of the "three thousand [worlds] in one thought."&lt;ref name=Kato /&gt;  
The Tiantai school describes [[Ten spiritual realms|ten dharma realms]] (ch. shi fajie) of sentient beings, the realms of hell dwellers, [[hungry ghosts]], beasts, [[asuras]], humans, gods ([[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s), [[sravaka]]s, [[pratyekabuddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s and [[Buddhas]].{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=804}}{{sfn|Pocezki|2014|p=168}} According to Zhiyi, each of these ten dharma realms mutually includes all of the other realms, resulting in 100 "states of existence" that share the characteristics of the ten suchnesses.{{sfn|Swanson|1989|pp=11-12}} The one thousand suchnesses are active in each of the three spheres (the five [[skandha]]s, sentient beings,and their environment) forming three thousand worlds in one thought moment.{{sfn|Gregory|2002|pp=410-411, 437}}{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=1029}}

[[Nichiren]] regarded the doctrine of "three thousand [worlds] in one thought" (''ichinen-sanzen'') as the fundamental principle of the Lotus Sutra{{sfn|Endo|2014|p=59}} and the very essence of the [[Buddha]]'s teachings.&lt;ref name=Niwano&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his work ''Kaimoku-shō'' (Essay on the Eye-opener) concerning ''ichinen-sanzen'': "The very doctrine of the Three Thousand Realms in One Mind of the Tendai sect appears to be the way to lead man to [[buddhahood]]."&lt;ref name=Niwano /&gt;

[[Nikkyo Niwano]] states that the principle of the Reality of All Existence not only analyzes what modern science would analyze in physical substances to the extent of [[subatomic particles]], but also extends to [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, everyone's mind has existing within it the [[Ten spiritual realms|ten realms of existence]] which are said to be found within one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suchnesses reveal the deepest reality inherent within all things, and, consequently, innumerable embodied substances existing in the universe are interrelated with all things.
The suchnesses, one through nine, operate according to the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|law of the universal truth]], namely from the "complete fundamental whole" under which no one, no thing, and no function can depart.  All things, including man, along with their relations with everything else are formed from the Reality of All Existence that is the Ten Suchnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yerkes–Dodson law''' is an [[empirical]] relationship between [[arousal]] and performance, originally developed by [[psychologist]]s [[Robert Yerkes|Robert M. Yerkes]] and [[John Dillingham Dodson]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yerkes RM, Dodson JD |title=The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation |journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology |volume=18 |pages=459–482 |year=1908 |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Yerkes/Law/ |doi=10.1002/cne.920180503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases. The process is often illustrated graphically as a bell-shaped curve which increases and then decreases with higher levels of arousal.

== Levels of arousal ==
Research has found that different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. For example, difficult or intellectually demanding tasks may require a lower level of arousal (to facilitate concentration), whereas tasks demanding stamina or persistence may be performed better with higher levels of arousal (to increase motivation).

Because of task differences, the shape of the curve can be highly variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=David M.|author2=Adam M. Campbell |author3=Collin R. Park |author4=Joshua Halonen |author5=Phillip R. Zoladz |title=The Temporal Dynamics Model of Emotional Memory Processing: A Synthesis on the Neurobiological Basis of Stress-Induced Amnesia, Flashbulb and Traumatic Memories, and the Yerkes-Dodson Law|journal=Neural Plasticity|date=2007-03-28|volume=2007|pages=60803|doi=10.1155/2007/60803|pmid=17641736|pmc=1906714}}&lt;/ref&gt; For simple or well-learned tasks, the relationship is monotonic, and performance improves as arousal increases. For complex, unfamiliar, or difficult tasks, the relationship between arousal and performance reverses after a point, and performance thereafter declines as arousal increases.

The effect of task difficulty led to the hypothesis that the Yerkes–Dodson Law can be decomposed into two distinct factors as in a [[bathtub curve]]. The upward part of the inverted U can be thought of as the energizing effect of arousal. The downward part is caused by negative effects of arousal (or stress) on cognitive processes like [[attention]] (e.g., "tunnel vision"), [[memory]], and [[problem-solving]].

There has been research indicating that the correlation suggested by Yerkes and Dodson exists (such as that of Broadhurst (1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broadhurst|first=P.L. |title=Emotionality and the Yerkes-Dodson Law|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1956 |volume=54|pages=345|pmid=13481281|doi=10.1037/h0049114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffy (1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Elizabeth |title=The psychological significance of the concept of "arousal" or "activation"|journal=Psychological Review|date=1957 |volume=64|pages=265–275|doi=10.1037/h0048837}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anderson (1988) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=KJ|author2=W. Revelle|author3=M.J. Lynch|title=Caffeine, impulsivity, and memory scanning: A comparison of two explanations for the Yerkes-Dodson Effect|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=1989 |volume=13|pages=1–20|doi=10.1007/bf00995541}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but a cause of the correlation has not yet successfully been established (Anderson, Revelle, &amp; Lynch, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson KJ, Revelle W, Lynch MJ |title=Caffeine, impulsivity, and memory scanning: A comparison of two explanations for the Yerkes-Dodson Effect |journal=Motivation and Emotion |volume=13 |pages=1–20 |year=1989 |doi=10.1007/bf00995541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to glucocorticoids==
A 2007 review of the effects of stress hormones ([[glucocorticoids]], GC) and human cognition revealed that memory performance vs. circulating levels of glucocorticoids does manifest an upside down U shaped curve and the authors noted the resemblance to the Yerkes–Dodson curve. For example, [[long-term potentiation]] (the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high GC state).&lt;br&gt;
This review also revealed that in order for a situation to induce a stress response, it has to be interpreted as one or more of the following:
* novel
* unpredictable
* not controllable by the individual
* a [[social evaluative threat]] (negative social evaluation possibly leading to [[social rejection]]).

It has also been shown that elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lupien SJ, Maheu F, Tu M, Fiocco A, Schramek TE |title=The effects of stress and stress hormones on human cognition: Implications for the field of brain and cognition |journal=Brain and Cognition |volume=65 |pages=209–237 |year=2007 |pmid=17466428 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2007.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
