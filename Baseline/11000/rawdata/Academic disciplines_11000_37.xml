An '''altered level of consciousness''' is any measure of [[arousal]] other than normal.  '''Level of consciousness''' ('''LOC''') is a measurement of a person's arousability and responsiveness to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the environment.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"&gt;
{{cite book |author =Kandel ER |author2=Jessell, Thomas M. |author3 = Schwartz, James H. |title=Principles of neural science |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=901 |isbn=0-8385-7701-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=yzEFK7Xc87YC&amp;pg=PA901&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mildly depressed level of [[consciousness]] or [[alertness]] may be classed as [[lethargy]]; someone in this state can be aroused with little difficulty.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;  People who are [[Obtundation|obtunded]] have a more depressed level of consciousness and cannot be fully aroused.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;  Those who are not able to be aroused from a sleep-like state are said to be [[stupor]]ous.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt; [[Coma]] is the inability to make any purposeful response.&lt;ref name="Kandel00"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;   Scales such as the [[Glasgow coma scale]] have been designed to measure the level of consciousness.

An altered level of consciousness can result from a variety of factors, including alterations in the chemical environment of the brain (e.g. exposure to [[poison]]s or [[intoxicant]]s), insufficient [[oxygen]] or [[blood flow]] in the brain, and excessive [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]]. &lt;!--Level of consciousness may decline abruptly or slowly, or it may increase and decrease intermittently.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;--&gt; Prolonged unconsciousness is understood to be a sign of a [[medical emergency]].&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  A deficit in the level of consciousness suggests that both of the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s or the [[reticular activating system]] have been injured.&lt;ref name="Porth071"&gt;Porth, p. 838&lt;/ref&gt;  A decreased level of consciousness correlates to increased [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] (sickness) and [[mortality rate|mortality]] (death).&lt;ref name="Scheld041"&gt;Scheld ''et al.''. p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is a valuable measure of a patient's medical and neurological status. In fact, some sources consider level of consciousness to be one of the [[vital sign]]s.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forgey99"&gt;

==Definition==
Scales and terms to classify the levels of consciousness differ, but in general, reduction in response to stimuli indicates an altered level of consciousness:

{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''Levels of consciousness'''
! Level !! Summary (Kruse)&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt; !! Description
|-
! [[Metacognition|Metaconscious]]
| Preternatural
| People who possess the ability to monitor and control their own cognitive processes in addition to meeting all the criteria indicative of a normal level of consciousness. In the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control have been viewed as functions of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives sensory input signals from divergent cortical regions and implements control through feedback loops which are established utilizing the underlying mechanisms of [[neuroplasticity]] (see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"&gt;Dunlosky, J. &amp; Bjork, R.

|-
! [[Conscious]]
| Normal
| Assessment of LOC involves checking [[Orientation (mental)|orientation]]: people who are able promptly and spontaneously to state their name, location, and the date or time are said to be oriented to self, place, and time, or "oriented X3".&lt;ref name="Kruse86"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  A normal [[sleep]] stage from which a person is easily awakened is also considered a normal level of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; "Clouding of consciousness" is a term for a mild alteration of consciousness with alterations in attention and wakefulness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;
|-
! [[Confused]]
|Disoriented; impaired thinking and responses
| People who do not respond quickly with information about their name, location, and the time are considered "obtuse" or "[[confusion|confused]]".&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;  A confused person may be bewildered, disoriented, and have difficulty following instructions.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  The person may have slow thinking and possible memory time loss.  This could be caused by sleep deprivation, malnutrition, allergies, environmental pollution, drugs (prescription and nonprescription), and infection.
|-
![[Delirium|Delirious]]
|Disoriented; restlessness, hallucinations, sometimes delusions
|Some scales have "delirious" below this level, in which a person may be restless or agitated and exhibit a marked deficit in [[attention]].&lt;ref name="Porth07"/&gt;
|-
![[somnolence|Somnolent]]
| Sleepy
| A ''[[somnolence|somnolent]]''&lt;!--obtunded--&gt; person shows excessive [[drowsiness]] and responds to stimuli only with incoherent mumbles or disorganized movements.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;
|-
![[Obtundation|Obtunded]]
|Decreased alertness; slowed psychomotor responses
| In ''[[obtundation]]'', a person has a decreased interest in their surroundings, slowed responses, and sleepiness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;
|-
![[Stuporous]]
| Sleep-like state (not unconscious); little/no spontaneous activity
|People with an even lower level of consciousness, stupor, only respond by [[Facial expression|grimacing]] or drawing away from painful stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt; 
|-
![[Coma]]tose
| Cannot be aroused; no response to stimuli
| Comatose people do not even make this response to stimuli, have no [[corneal reflex|corneal]] or [[gag reflex]], and they may have no [[pupillary response]] to light.&lt;ref name="Kruse86"/&gt;
|}

Altered level of consciousness is sometimes described as altered [[sensorium]].

===Glasgow Coma Scale===
{{Main|Glasgow Coma Scale}}
The most commonly used tool for measuring LOC objectively is the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] (GCS).  It has come into almost universal use for assessing people with [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]],&lt;ref name="Porth07"&gt;{{cite book |author =Porth C |title=Essentials of Pahtophysiology: Concepts of Altered Health States |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages=835 |isbn=0-7817-7087-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-03 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=57RQC-3OPtUC&amp;pg=PT858&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an altered level of consciousness. Verbal, motor, and eye-opening responses to stimuli are measured, scored, and added into a final score on a scale of 3–15, with a lower score being a more decreased level of consciousness.

===Others===
The [[AVPU]] scale is another means of measuring LOC: people are assessed to determine whether they are '''a'''lert, responsive to '''v'''erbal stimuli, responsive to '''p'''ainful stimuli, or '''u'''nresponsive.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forgey99"/&gt;  To determine responsiveness to voice, a caregiver speaks to, or, failing that, yells at the person.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  Responsiveness to pain is determined with a mild painful stimulus such as a pinch; moaning or withdrawal from the stimulus is considered a response to pain.&lt;ref name="Pollak02"/&gt;  The ACDU scale, like AVPU, is easier to use than the GCS and produces similarly accurate results.&lt;ref name="Posner07"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Posner JB, Saper CB, Schiff ND, Plum F |title=Plum and Posner's Diagnosis of Stupor and Coma |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2007 |pages=41 |isbn=0-19-532131-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using ACDU, a patient is assessed for '''a'''lertness, '''c'''onfusion, '''d'''rowsiness, and '''u'''nresponsiveness.&lt;ref name="Posner07"/&gt;

The [[Grady Coma Scale]] classes people on a scale of I to V along a scale of confusion, stupor, deep stupor, [[abnormal posturing]], and coma.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Although the neural science behind alertness, wakefulness, and arousal are not fully known, the [[reticular formation]] is known to play a role in these.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  The [[ascending reticular activating system]] is a postulated group of neural connections that receives sensory input and projects to the [[cerebral cortex]] through the [[midbrain]] and [[thalamus]] from the retucular formation.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; Since this system is thought to modulate wakefulness and sleep, interference with it, such as injury, illness, or metabolic disturbances, could alter the level of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

Normally, stupor and coma are produced by interference with the [[brain stem]], such as can be caused by a [[lesion]] or indirect effects, such as [[brain herniation]].&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;  Mass lesions in the brain stem normally cause coma due to their effects on the reticular formation.&lt;ref name="Tindall901"&gt;
{{

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Mass [[lesion]]s that occur [[supratentorial|above]] the [[tentorium cerebelli]] (pictured) normally do not significantly alter the level of consciousness unless they are very large or affect both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
Assessing LOC involves determining an individual's response to external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Speed and accuracy of responses to questions and reactions to stimuli such as touch and pain are noted.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[Reflex]]es, such as the [[coughing|cough]] and gag reflexes, are also means of judging LOC.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;  Once the level of consciousness is determined, clinicians seek clues for the cause of any alteration.&lt;ref name="Tindall90"/&gt; Usually the first tests in the ER are pulse oximetry to determine if there is hypoxia, serum glucose levels to rule out hypoglycemia. A urine drug screen may be sent. A CT head is very important to obtain to rule out bleed. In cases where meningitis is suspected, a lumbar puncture must be performed. A serum TSH is an important test to order. In select groups consider vitamin B12 levels. Checking serum ammonia is not advised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
===Differential diagnosis===
A lowered level of consciousness indicate a deficit in brain function.&lt;ref name="Porth071" /&gt;  Level of consciousness can be lowered when the brain receives insufficient oxygen (as occurs in [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]); insufficient blood (as occurs in [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]); or has an alteration in the [[brain chemistry|brain's chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Pollak02"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Pollak AN, Gupton CL |title=Emergency Care and Transportation of the Sick and Injured |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=2002 |pages=140 |isbn=0-7637-1666-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2008-07-04 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xAPuKkKA6FEC&amp;pg=PT177&amp;dq=%22level+of+consciousness%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metabolic disorder]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus]] and [[uremia]] can alter consciousness.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[hyponatremia|Hypo-]] or [[hypernatremia]] (decreased and elevated levels of [[sodium]], respectively) as well as [[dehydration]] can also produce an altered LOC.&lt;ref name="Johnson98"&gt;

Increases in [[intracranial pressure]] (the pressure within the skull) can also cause altered LOC.  It can result from [[traumatic brain injury]] such as [[concussion]].&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt;   [[Stroke]] and [[intracranial hemorrhage]] are other causes.&lt;ref name="Dohert05"/&gt; [[Infection]]s of the [[central nervous system]] may also be associated with decreased LOC; for example, an altered LOC is the most common symptom of [[encephalitis]].&lt;ref name="Scheld04"&gt;

A [[concussion]], which is a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) may result in decreased LOC.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the degree of decrease in consciousness and its underlying cause.  Initial treatment often involves the administration of [[dextrose]] if the blood sugar is low as well as the administration of [[oxygen]], [[naloxone]] and [[thiamine]].

'''Arthur Raistrick''' (1896–1991) was a British geologist, [[archaeology|archaeologist]], academic, and writer. He was born in a working class home in [[Saltaire]], [[Yorkshire]]. He was a scholar in many related, and some unrelated, fields. He published some 330 articles, books, pamphlets and scholarly treatises.

==Early life and work==
In his early life he was imprisoned as a [[conscientious objector]] to the [[First World War]]. During his confines in [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]] prisons he began an association with, and later membership of, the [[Society of Friends]], that lasted throughout his life. As well as a [[pacifist]], he was a [[Socialism|socialist]] and had close ties to the early [[Independent Labour Party]] which he greatly valued into his old age.

His interests ranged widely. His early academic life was spent at [[Former colleges of Durham University|Armstrong and Kings Colleges]], Newcastle part of [[Durham University]] (later to become [[Newcastle University]]) where he attained the role of Reader in Applied Geology. His academic writings start from this period of his life, in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Croucher (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

After work in mine safety, he once again settled into an academic life. His interests widened from geology and mining engineering into what would now be termed landscape studies. At the same time, his interest in mechanical engineering led him to carry out pioneering work on the lead mining industry of his native Yorkshire and elsewhere, including ''Two centuries of Industrial Welfare''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; (on the [[London Lead Company]]).

Once again refusing war service in 1939, Arthur Raistrick was forced to leave his academic post in Newcastle. He stated that King's College "just had to suspend me", without pay.&lt;ref&gt;Joy (1991) p. 13, quoted in Jennings (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II|war years]], he refused to earn sufficient money to pay income tax which would fund the war effort and he spent much of the time in converting a one-time barn into a home for himself and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth (née Chapman).

As a Friend, Arthur Raistrick became interested in the history of Quaker involvement in science and industry, leading him to publish widely on this subject. In the course of this, he was responsible, with others, for pioneering work on the industrial archaeology of the [[Coalbrookdale]] area. His ''Dynasty of Ironfounders''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1989), originally published in 1953&lt;/ref&gt; remains a seminal work on [[Abraham Darby (disambiguation)|the Darbys]] of [[Coalbrookdale]] and their work in the cradle of the industrial revolution.

==An industrial archaeologist==
Raistrick was also a field archaeologist of some renown, specialising in the Craven area of the Yorkshire Dales, around his long-time home at Linton, near [[Grassington]]. His work in the field of industrial archaeology occupied much of his mature years. He published an early work on the subject, ''Industrial Archaeology''&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; which remains in use in undergraduate courses to this day.

As well as his master's degree and doctorate, Arthur Raistrick received Honorary Doctorates from the [[University of Leeds|Universities of Leeds]] and [[University of Bradford|Bradford]]. He was particularly associated with the latter university and bequeathed his extensive mineral collection to it, together with an unrivalled collection of closely annotated maps of the Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines, which form a commentary to his extensive fieldwork. Raistrick worked closely with the [[Craven Museum &amp; Gallery]] donated many finds from his excavations to the museum and in 1969 was chair of the Friends of the Craven Museum group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalesman of the millennium|url=http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/nostalgia/nostalgia_history/11725884.Dalesman_of_the_Millennium/|website=www.cravenherald.co.uk|publisher=Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speak up if you can help Craven Museum and Gallery|url=http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/news/localnews/10958113.Speak_up_if_you_can_help_Craven_Museum_and_Gallery_heritage_project/|website=www.cravenherald.co.uk|publisher=Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Harland obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/13/richard-harland-obituary|website=www.the guardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also left the bulk of his large library to [[Bradford University]].&lt;ref&gt;See external links&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other lifelong interests Raistrick was a keen walker, venturing far and wide amongst his beloved Yorkshire Dales and moors. He had been a founder member of the [[Holiday Fellowship]] and was a one time vice-president of the [[Youth Hostels Association (England &amp; Wales)|Youth Hostels Association]]. His interest in landscape and its conservation led to him serving several terms upon the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority]].

==Honours refused==
Offered an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] by Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], Raistrick wrote a letter declining the honour, which started, characteristically, "Dear Harold, I am deeply disappointed in you…".&lt;ref&gt;Unpublished letter in the possession of his family&lt;/ref&gt; His lifelong dislike of privilege made it impossible for him even to consider accepting Wilson's offer.

Raistrick was a true polymath. He was a self-taught expert on the organ works of [[J.S. Bach]]. He immersed himself in studies of ancient Chinese civilisation. Until the end of his long life, he retained the daily routine of a working man, rising at 5 am to work through the day until an early bed at 8 pm.

As a tribute to his accomplishments, the Yorkshire Dales Society named him the ''Dalesman of the Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;Speakman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">The '''artificial pancreas''' is a technology in development to help people with [[diabetes]], primarily type 1, automatically and continuously control their [[blood glucose level]] by providing the substitute [[endocrine]] functionality of a healthy [[pancreas]].

The endocrine functionality of the pancreas is provided by [[Pancreatic islets|islet cells]] which produce the hormones [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. Artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body's changing blood glucose levels. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain, liver, and kidneys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://columbiasurgery.org/pancreas/pancreas-and-its-functions|title=The Pancreas and Its Functions {{!}} Columbia University Department of Surgery|website=columbiasurgery.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for type 1 patients, it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The artificial pancreas is a broad term for different [[Biological engineering|bio-engineering]] strategies currently in development to achieve these requirements. Different bio-engineering approaches under consideration include:

* the [[medical equipment]] approach—using an [[insulin pump]] under [[control theory|closed loop control]] using real-time feedback data from a [[continuous glucose monitor|continuous blood glucose monitor]].
* the [[Physiology|physiological]] approach—the development of a treatment with engineered [[Stem cell|stem cells]] to be integrated into the body to provide functional blood glucose regulation.

==Approaches==

===Medical equipment===
The medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer-controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas.&lt;ref name="Gingras2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gingras V, Taleb N, Roy-Fleming A, Legault L, Rabasa-Lhoret R | title = The challenges of achieving postprandial glucose control using closed-loop systems in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes, Obesity &amp; Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–256 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28675686 | doi = 10.1111/dom.13052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uduku C, Oliver N | title = Pharmacological aspects of closed loop insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 36 | pages = 29–33 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28802779 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graf A, McAuley SA, Sims C, Ulloa J, Jenkins AJ, Voskanyan G, O'Neal DN | title = Moving Toward a Unified Platform for Insulin Delivery and Sensing of Inputs Relevant to an Artificial Pancreas | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–314 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28264192 | pmc = 5478040 | doi = 10.1177/1932296816682762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apablaza P, Soto N, Codner E | title = [From insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring to the artificial pancreas] | journal = Revista Medica De Chile | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–640 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28898340 | doi = 10.4067/S0034-98872017000500011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continuous Glucose Monitors ====
[[Image:Artificial Pancreas.jpg|thumb|Artificial pancreas feedback system |alt=]]

The original devices for use in type 1 diabetes were [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]]. Continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system, the other being an insulin pump, and a glucose meter to calibrate the device.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#artificial|title=Artificial Pancreas Device System - What is the pancreas?  What is an artificial pancreas device system?|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use after approval from the FDA. Both the traditional and the continuous monitor require manual insulin delivery or carbohydrate intake depending on the readings from the devices. While the traditional blood glucose meters require the user to prick their finger every few hours to obtain data, continuous monitors use sensors placed just under the skin on the arm or abdomen to deliver blood sugar level data to receivers or smartphone apps as often as every few minutes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sensors can be used for up to ten days.  A number of different continuous monitors are currently approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/7/first-four-continuous-glucose-monitors|title=The First Four Continuous Glucose Monitors|date=2018-07-04|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was approved in December 2016. Developed by [[Dexcom]], the G5 Mobile Continuous Monitoring System requires users to prick their fingers twice a day (as opposed to the typical average 8 times daily with the traditional meters) in order to calibrate the sensors. The sensors last up to seven days. The device uses Bluetooth technology to warn the user either through a handheld receiver or app on a smartphone if blood glucose levels reach below a certain point. The cost for this device excluding any co-insurance is an estimated $4,800 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:BGM twopart.JPG|alt=The white sensor is fixed to the upper arm and scanned with the reader. The reader is showing (top to bottom) days to replacement of sensor (11), current BG (7,4) &amp; change (-&gt; i.e. steady) and a diagram of the latest BG levels.|thumb|Blood glucose meter FreeStyle Libre from Abbott. ]]
[[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Laboratories']] FreeStyle Libre CGM was approved in September 2017. It does not support smartphone use. This device does not require finger pricks at all and the sensor, placed on the upper arm, lasts 10 days. The estimated cost for this monitor is $1,300 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dexcom's next G6 model CGM was approved in March 2018, which can last up to ten days and does not need finger prick calibration. Like Medtronic's monitor, it can predict glucose level trends. It is compatible for integration into insulin pumps. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Closed-Loop Systems ====
Unlike the continuous sensor alone, the closed-loop system requires no user input in response to reading from the monitor; the monitor and insulin pump system automatically delivers the correct amount of hormone calculated from the readings transmitted. The system is what makes up the artificial pancreas device.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elleri D, Dunger DB, Hovorka R | title = Closed-loop insulin delivery for treatment of type 1 diabetes | language = En | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 120 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071283 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-9-120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== MiniMed 670G =====
In September 2016, the FDA approved the [[Medtronic MiniMed 670G]], which was the first approved hybrid [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop system]]. The device senses a diabetic person's [[Basal (medicine)|basal]] insulin requirement and automatically adjusts its delivery to the body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111141252/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm522764.htm|title=Recently-Approved Devices - The 670G System - P160017|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=wayback.archive-it.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a glucose meter for calibration. It automatically functions to modify the level of insulin delivery based off the detection of blood glucose levels by continuous monitor. It does this by sending the blood glucose data through an algorithm that analyzes and makes the subsequent adjustments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The system has two modes. Manual mode lets the user choose the rate at which basal insulin is delivered. Auto mode regulates basal insulin levels from the continuous monitor's readings every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/minimed-670g-insulin-pump-system|title=MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump System {{!}} World's First Hybrid Closed Loop System|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was originally available only to those aged 14 or older, and in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for use in children aged 7-14. Families have reported better sleep quality from use of the new system, as they do not have to worry about manually checking blood glucose levels during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/fda-approves-minimed-670g-system-children-7-13/|title=FDA Approves the MiniMed 670G System for Children 7-13 - The LOOP Blog|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full cost of the system is $3700, but patients have the opportunity to get it for less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/update-minimed-670g-availability/|title=Update on MiniMed 670G Availability|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== iLet Bionic Pancreas =====
A team at [[Boston University]] working in collaboration with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] on a dual hormone artificial pancreas system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicpancreas.org/|title=bionicpancreas.org|website=www.bionicpancreas.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; began clinical trials on their device called the Bionic Pancreas in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/beta-bionics-ilet-update#1|title=Update on the iLet Bionic Pancreas Closed Loop System|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Public Benefit Corporation [[Beta Bionics]] was formed. In conjunction with the formation of the company, Beta Bionics changed the preliminary name for their device from the Bionic Pancreas to the iLet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The device uses a closed-loop system to deliver both insulin and glucagon in response to sensed blood glucose levels. While not yet approved for public use, the 4th generation iLet prototype, presented in 2017, is around the size of an iPhone, with a touchscreen interface. It contain two chambers for both insulin and glucagon, and the device is configurable for use with only one hormone, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2017/bionic-pancreas-clinical-trial/|title=Bionic Pancreas Passes Critical Science Hurdle {{!}} BU Today {{!}} Boston University|work=BU Today|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While trials continue to be run, the iLet has a projected final approval for the insulin-only system in 2020.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Current Studies =====
Four studies on different artificial pancreas systems are being conducted starting in 2017 and going into the near future. The projects are funded by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]](NIDDK), and are the final part of testing the devices before applying for approval for use. Participants in the studies are able to live their lives at home while using the devices and being monitored remotely for safety, efficacy, and a number of other factors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/spring17/articles/spring17pg15-16.html|title=The Miracle of an Artificial Pancreas {{!}} NIH MedlinePlus the Magazine|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02844517|International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Research Site Training Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by researchers from the [[University of Virginia]], is testing a closed-loop system called inControl, which has a smartphone user interface. 240 people of ages 14 and up are participating for 6 months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A full-year trial led by researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] started in May 2017 and has enrolled an estimated 150 participants of ages 6 to 18 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The artificial pancreas system being studied uses a smartphone and has a low glucose feature to improve glucose level control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02925299|Day and Night Closed-loop in Young People With Type 1 Diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in collaboration with [[Rabin Medical Center|Schneider Children's Medical Center]] in Petah Tikva, Israel, are planning a 6-month study that will begin in early 2019 and will involve 112 adolescents and young adults, ages 14 to 30.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT03040414|Fuzzy Logic Automated Insulin Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main object of the study is to compare the current Medtronic 670G system to a new Medtronic-developed system. The new system has programming that aims to improve glucose control around mealtime, which is still a big challenge in the field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The current 6-month study lead by the Bionic Pancreas team started in mid-2018 and enrolled 312 participants of ages 18 and above.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
[[Image:Bio-artificial pancreas with Islet Sheet technology.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''The Bio-artificial pancreas''': this diagram shows a cross section of [[tissue engineering|bio-engineered tissue]] with encapsulated [[islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] which deliver [[endocrine]] [[pancreas#Function|hormones]] in response to [[glucose]].]]

The biotechnical company Defymed, based in France, is developing an implantable bio-artificial device called MailPan which features a bio-compatible membrane with [[Semipermeable membrane|selective permeability]] to encapsulate different cells types, including pancreatic [[Beta cell|beta cells]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3749642,00.html|title=Israeli and French Biotech Companies Partner to Fight Diabetes With Bio-Artificial Pancreas|date=2018-11-12|work=CTECH - www.calcalistech.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation of the device does not require conjunctive immuno-supressive therapy because the membrane prevents antibodies of the patient from entering the device and damaging the encapsulated cells. After being surgically implanted, the membrane sheet will be viable for years.The cells that the device holds can be produced from stem cells rather than human donors, and may also be replaced over time using input and output connections without surgery.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defymed.com/mailpan/|title=MailPan ® BioArtificial Pancreas {{!}} Defymed, advanced therapies inspired for you|work=Defymed|access-date=2018-11-28|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defymed is partially funded by JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, but is now defined as an organization for all ages and all stages of type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212005894/en/Innovative-Medical-Devices-Treatment-Diabetes-Defymed-Strengthens|title=Innovative Medical Devices for the Treatment of Diabetes, Defymed Strengthens Its Position as a Worldwide Leader|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdrf.ca/who-we-are/what-does-jdrf-stand-for/|title=What Does JDRF Stand For?|last=Canada|first=JDRF|website=JDRF Canada|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, it was announced that Defymed would partner with the Israel-based Kadimastem, a bio-pharmaceutical company developing stem-cell based regenerative therapies, to receive a two-year grant worth approximately $1.47 million for the development of a bio-artificial pancreas that would treat type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/|title=Kadimastem - Stem Cell to Cure Diseases|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadimastem's stem cell technology uses differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to obtain pancreatic endocrine cells. These include insulin-producing beta cells, as well as alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Both cells arrange in islet-like clusters, mimicking the structure of the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/regenerative-medicine/17/diabetes|title=Diabetes - Kadimastem|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the partnership is to combine both technologies in a bio-artificial pancreas device, which releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, to bring to clinical trial stages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The San Diego, California based biotech company ViaCyte has also developed a product aiming to provide a solution for type 1 diabetes which uses an encapsulation device made of a semi-permeable immune reaction-protective membrane. The device contains pancreatic [[Progenitor cell|progenitor cells]] that have been differentiated from embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-year-data-from-viacytes-step-one-clinical-trial-presented-at-ada-2018-300671013.html|title=Two-year Data from ViaCyte's STEP ONE Clinical Trial Presented at ADA 2018|last=Inc.|first=ViaCyte,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/products/pec%E2%80%90encap-vc-01|title=PEC‐Encap™ (VC-01™)|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surgical implantation in an outpatient procedure, the cells mature into endocrine cells which arrange in islet-like clusters and mimic the function of the pancreas, producing insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/|title=Home|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz TC | title = Concise Review: Manufacturing of Pancreatic Endoderm Cells for Clinical Trials in Type 1 Diabetes | journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 927–31 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26062982 | pmc = 4511151 | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2015-0058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The technology advanced from pre-clinical studies to FDA approval for phase 1 clinical trials in 2014, and presented two-year data from the trial in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They reported that their product, called PEC-Encap, has so far been safe and well tolerated in patients at a dose below therapeutic levels. The encapsulated cells were able to survive and mature after implantation, and immune system rejection was decreased due to the protective membrane. The second phase of the trial will evaluate the efficacy of the product.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; ViaCyte has also been receiving financial support from JDRF on this project.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Initiatives around the globe==
In the United States in 2006, JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) launched a multi-year initiative to help accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdrf.org/artificialpancreas Artificial Pancreas Project : JDRF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/10/type-1-diabetes-insurance-companies/|title=Insurers can profit while improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes|last=KMorandi says|date=2017-08-10|website=STAT|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Askania-Nova''' ({{lang-uk|Асканія-Нова}}) is a [[biosphere reserve]] (sanctuary) located in [[Kherson Oblast]], [[Ukraine]], within the dry [[Taurida]] [[steppe]] near [[Oleshky Sands]]. The reserve consists of a zoological park, a botanical (dendrological) garden, and an open territory of virgin steppes.
[[File:Аскания-Нова (заповедник).jpg|thumb|]]
== History ==
[[File:Rote Insel15.JPG|100px|left|thumb|The tomb of Falz-Fein]]
The nature reserve was established in 1898 by [[Friedrich-Jacob Eduardovych Falz-Fein]] (1863–1920) around the German colony of Askania-Nova, which only in 1890 became an organized settlement, [[Khutir]].

In March 1919, Askania-Nova was confiscated from the Falz-Fein family by the [[Red Army]] as part of the state nationalization programme. The last owner refused to evacuate to Germany. She was Sofia-Louise Bohdanivna (Gottlieb) Knauff (1835–1919), the mother of Friedrich Falz-Fein. Her refusal resulted in her summary execution by two Red Army guardsmen who shot her for failing to surrender her estate in [[Khorly]] (today a port in [[Kherson Oblast]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dezimmer.net/NabokovFamilyWeb/nfw01/nfw01_187.htm Falz-Fein Lineage] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1919, Askania-Nova was declared a People's [[Zapovednik|Sanctuary Park]] by a decree of the [[Council of People's Commissars]] of the Ukrainian SSR; while on February 8, 1921, it was reorganized into a State Steppe Reserve of the Ukrainian SSR. The main purposes of the reserve was to preserve and study the environment of the virgin steppe as well as possibly to acclimatize and study a larger number of animal and plant types. Askania-Nova became a scientific-steppe station, a zoo-technical station with breeding farms, a [[phyto]]-technical station, and included various other scientific institutions. Notably, the zoo and botanical garden were greatly expanded. Part of the reserve included portions of steppe reserve, an acclimatization zoo, and an [[arboretum]]. From 1932 to 1956, the reserve was transformed into the All-Union scientific-research institute for the hybridization and acclimatization of animals of M. Ivanov. It consisted of 12 departments (including the botanical garden, steppe reserve steppe, and zoo), nine laboratories, conducting experimental farming, and four breeding centres for agricultural animals. The institute became the centre of scientific-researching works in the field of breed creation and the major hub for breeding farms. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], the reserve was devastated.

In 1983, Askania-Nova was reorganized into a [[biosphere reserve]] and the following year it was designated as the Soviet member of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]] of [[UNESCO]]. After the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1993, [[Ukraine]] confirmed the status of the biosphere reserve Askania-Nova.

[[Image:Askania.jpg|thumb|Jubilee coin dedicated to 100th Anniversary of Ascania Nova Reserve]]

The reserve consists of the acclimatization zoo, arboretum (2.1&amp;nbsp;km², or 518.9 acre), and virgin [[steppe]] sanctuary (110&amp;nbsp;km², or 42.5 sq mi), the last such area in Europe) and has total area of 825&amp;nbsp;km² (318.5 sq mi).

In addition to local species it hosts ostriches, bison, antelopes, wild horses, llamas, zebras and many bird species. More than 200 species of foliaceous and coniferous plants were brought from different parts of the world and planted in the dendrologic garden during 1885 – 1902. About 600 higher plants (both perennial and annual), 16 species of which were entered to the Red Data Book of Ukraine, have been preserved in their primary natural form.

The reserve is known for a group of [[Przewalski's Horse]], the largest group kept in captivity, living on area around 30&amp;nbsp;km² (11.5 sq mi).

The [[Turkmenian kulan]] (''Equus hemionus kulan'') has been reintroduced to the Askania-Nova reserve.

The Askania-Nova wetland Great Chapli Depression is registered on the International list of [[Ramsar Convention]] and has an area of 4x6 km.

Part of the sanctuary include a small town and six villages with total population of 10,000 people (1997). There is no direct railroad station in the area and the sanctuary can be reached by bus.

In 2008, Askania was named one of [[Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine]].

The sanctuary is located in a relatively remote area. Its territory completely overlaps the Askania Nova municipality which beside its [[Askania-Nova (settlement)|main town]] includes five small rural settlements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/z7502/A004SNP?rdat1=27.03.2011&amp;rf7571=35215 List of settlements of Askania-Nova municipality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211545/http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/z7502/A004SNP?rdat1=27.03.2011&amp;rf7571=35215 |date=September 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinka (569), Komysh (313), Molochne (762), Novyi Etap (72), Pytomnyk (859); and a separate rural municipality of Markeyevo (783) consisting a former village of the same name. Towards the sanctuary and the town of Askania-Nova leads a "spur" of the regional route &lt;small&gt;{{Road marker simple|Road P47 (Ukraine)|P47|white|black|black}}&lt;/small&gt; which branches out from the main route near the village of Chkalove (Novotroitske Raion). The main route of &lt;small&gt;{{Road marker simple|Road P47 (Ukraine)|P47|white|black|black}}&lt;/small&gt; runs from [[Kherson]] to [[Henichesk]] and intersects European routes &lt;small&gt;{{European route E|58}}&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;{{European route E|105}}&lt;/small&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Bradford's law''' is a pattern first described by [[Samuel C. Bradford]] in 1934 that estimates the [[exponential decay|exponentially]] [[diminishing returns]] of searching for references in  [[science journal]]s. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n².&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Black |first=Paul E. 
|title=''Bradford's law'', in Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures 
|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |date=2004-12-12 |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/bradfordsLaw.html |accessdate=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of related  formulations of the principle.

In many disciplines this pattern is called a [[Pareto distribution]]. As a practical example, suppose that a researcher has five core [[scientific journal]]s for his or her subject. Suppose that in a month there are 12 articles of interest in those journals. Suppose further that in order to find another dozen articles of interest, the researcher would have to go to an additional 10 journals. Then that researcher's Bradford multiplier ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is 2 (i.e. 10/5). For each new dozen articles, that researcher will need to look in ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; times as many journals. After looking in 5, 10, 20, 40, etc. journals, most researchers quickly realize that there is little point in looking further.

Different researchers have different numbers of core journals, and different Bradford multipliers. But the pattern holds quite well across many subjects, and may well be a general pattern for human interactions in social systems. Like [[Zipf's law]], to which it is related, we do not have a good explanation for why it works, but knowing that it does is very useful for librarians. What it means is that for each specialty it is sufficient to identify the "core publications" for that field and only stock those; very rarely will researchers need to go outside that set.

However its impact has been far greater than that. Armed with this idea and inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s famous article ''[[As We May Think]]'', [[Eugene Garfield]] at the [[Institute for Scientific Information]] in the 1960s developed a comprehensive index of how scientific thinking propagates. His [[Citation index|Science Citation Index]] (SCI) had the effect of making it easy to identify exactly which scientists did science that had an impact, and which journals that science appeared in. It also caused the  discovery, which some did not expect, that a few journals, such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', were core for all of [[hard science]]. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences.

The result of this is pressure on scientists to publish in the best journals, and pressure on universities to ensure access to that core set of journals. On the other hand, the set of "core journals" may vary more or less strongly with the individual researchers, and even more strongly along schools-of-thought divides. There is also a danger of over-representing majority views if journals are selected in this fashion.

Bradford's law is also known as '''Bradford's law of scattering''' and as the '''Bradford distribution'''. This law or distribution in bibliometrics can be applied to the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Don 
|title=Bibliometrics and the World Wide Web 
|publisher=University of Toronto Technical Report |year=1997 |url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~donturn/research/bibweb.html |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scattering==
Hjørland and Nicolaisen (2005, p.&amp;nbsp;103) identified three kinds of scattering:
#Lexical scattering. The scattering of words in texts and in collections of texts.
#Semantic scattering. The scattering of concepts in texts and in collections of texts.
#Subject scattering. The scattering of items useful to a given task or problem.

They found that the literature of Bradford's law (including Bradford's own papers) is unclear in relation to which kind of scattering is actually being measured.

==Law's interpretations==

The interpretation of Bradford's law in terms of a geometric progression was suggested by V. Yatsko &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/3q8305kq4154w846 Yatsko V. A. The Interpretation of Bradford’s Law in Terms of Geometric Progression IN: Automatic Documentation and Mathematical Linguistics, 2012, Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 112–117.]&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced an additional constant and demonstrated that Bradford distribution can be applied to a variety of objects, not only to distribution of articles or citations across journals.  V. Yatsko's interpretation (Y-interpretation) can be effectively used to compute threshold values in case it is necessary to distinguish subsets within a set of objects (e.g. successful/unsuccessful applicants, developed/underdeveloped regions, etc.).

The Leiden Ranking ranks universities worldwide by number of academic publications according to the volume and [[citation impact]] of the publications at those institutions.&lt;ref name="data collection" /&gt; The rankings take into account differences in language, [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] and institutional size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7328/full/469034a.html | title=Non-English papers decrease rankings | first=Ton | last=van Raan | first2=Thed | last2=van Leeuwen | first3=Martijn |last3=Visser |journal=Nature | volume=469 | number=34 | date=2011-01-06 | doi=10.1038/469034a |accessdate=6 November 2011 | pages=34 | pmid=21209649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple ranking lists are released according to various bibliometric normalization and impact indicators, including the number of publications, citations per publication, and field-normalized impact per publication.&lt;ref name="ranking"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leidenranking.com/ranking|title=Leiden Ranking |publisher=Universiteit Leiden Centre for Science and Technology Studies |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to citation impact, the Leiding Ranking also ranks universities by scientific collaboration, including collaboration with other institutions and collaboration with an industry partner.&lt;ref name="indicators"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leidenranking.com/methodology/indicators|title="Indicators", CWTS Leiden Ranking|publisher=Universiteit Leiden Centre for Science and Technology Studies |accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the Leiden Ranking was produced in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Waltman, Ludo et al., [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/19353/CWTS-WP-2012-007.pdf?sequence=1 ''The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012:  Data collection, indicators, and interpretation''], Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) , Leiden University, 16 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 rankings include 750 universities worldwide, which were selected based on the number of articles and reviews published by authors affiliated with those institutions in 2009–2012 in so-called "core" journals, a set of English-language journals with international scope and a "sufficiently large" number of references in the Web of Science database.&lt;ref name="data collection" /&gt;

== Results ==
[[File:Rockefeller University.JPG|thumb|[[Rockefeller University]] was ranked first in 2014 by [[citation impact]] ]]
As in other university rankings, Leiden's top 20 is heavily dominated by [[United States|American]] universities. In the 2014 rankings, [[Rockefeller University]] was first by citation impact, as measured by both mean citation score and mean normalized citation score, as well as by the proportion of papers belonging to the top 10% in their field. Notably, the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Cambridge]], and other  [[United Kingdom|British]] universities score much lower than in other university rankings, such as the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] and [[QS World University Rankings]], which are based in part on reputational surveys among academics.&lt;ref name="ranking" /&gt;

When measuring by collaboration with other universities (the proportion of number of publications co-authored with other institutions), the top three spots were occupied by [[National Yang-Ming University]] and two other institutions from [[Taiwan]] in 2014, followed by universities from [[France]], the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries. [[King Abdulaziz University]] and [[King Saud University]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] led the list in 2014 when measured by international collaboration.&lt;ref name="ranking" /&gt;

== Indicators ==
The Leiden Ranking ranks universities by the following indicators:&lt;ref name="indicators" /&gt;

=== Citation impact ===
* '''MCS''' - mean citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university.
* '''MNCS''' - mean normalized citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university, normalized for field differences and publication year. For example, an MNCS value of 2 means that the publications of a university have been cited twice above world average.
* '''PP(top 10%)''' - proportion of top 10% publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that belong to the top 10% most frequently cited, compared with other publications in the same field and in the same year.

=== Scientific collaboration ===
* '''PP(collab)''' - proportion of interinstitutionally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more other organizations.
* '''PP(int collab)''' - proportion of internationally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored by two or more countries.
* '''PP(UI collab)''' - proportion of collaborative publications with industry. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more industrial partners. 
* '''PP(&lt;100&amp;nbsp;km)''' - proportion of short-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of less than 100&amp;nbsp;km.
* '''PP(&gt;1000&amp;nbsp;km)''' - proportion of long-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.

== Criticism ==
In a 2010 article, [[Loet Leydesdorff]] criticized the method used by the Leiden Ranking to normalize citation impact by subject field. The mean normalized citation score (MNCS) indicator is based on the ISI subject category classification used in Web of Science, which was "not designed for the scientometric evaluation, but for the purpose of information retrieval".&lt;ref&gt;Leydesdorff, Loet &amp; Opthof, Tobias, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3977.pdf ''Normalization, CWTS indicators, and the Leiden Rankings: Differences in citation behavior at the level of fields''], 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also, normalizing at a higher aggregation level, rather than at the level of individual publications, gives more weight to older publications, particularly reviews, and to publications in fields where citation levels are traditionally higher.&lt;ref&gt;Andrejs Rauhvargers, [http://www.eua.be/pubs/global_university_rankings_and_their_impact.pdf ''Global University Rankings And Their Impact''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222105553/http://www.eua.be/pubs/global_university_rankings_and_their_impact.pdf# |date=2014-12-22 }}, European University Association, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3657">A '''cistron''' is an alternative term to a [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewin | first = Benjamin | name-list-format = vanc | authorlink = Benjamin Lewin | title = Genes VII | year = 2000 | publisher = Oxford University Press and Cell Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-19-879276-X | page = 955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word cistron is used to emphasize that genes exhibit a specific behavior in a [[complementation test|cis-trans test]]; distinct positions (or [[locus (genetics)|loci]]) within a [[genome]] are '''cistronic'''.

== History ==
The words ''cistron'' and ''gene'' were coined before the advancing state of [[biology]] made it clear that the concepts they refer to are practically equivalent. The same historical naming practices are responsible for many of the [[synonym]]s in the life sciences.

The term cistron was coined by [[Seymour Benzer]] in an article entitled ''The elementary units of heredity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1957 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = The Chemical Basis of Heredity | veditors =  McElroy WD, Glass B | pages = 70–93 | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore, Maryland }} also reprinted in {{cite book | vauthors = Benzer S | date = 1965 | chapter = The elementary units of heredity | title = Selected papers on Molecular Genetics | veditors = Taylor JH | pages = 451–477 | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cistron was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is sometimes referred to as a cis-trans test, but more often as a [[complementation test]].

== Definition ==
For example, suppose a [[mutation]] at a chromosome position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is responsible for a change in [[recessive trait]] in a [[diploid]] organism (where chromosomes come in pairs). We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the [[wild type]] [[phenotype]] (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation ([[homozygous]] mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, is responsible for the same recessive trait. The positions &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are said to be within the same cistron when an organism that has the mutation at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on one chromosome and has the mutation at position &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. It's important to know that cistron localization has been studied for several years, and, depending of the organism, this gene can be found in different places. For example, the gene can be found in RNA phage and is related to the cistron coat in some particular organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindley J, Staples DH, Billeter MA, Weissmann C | title = Location of the coat cistron on the RNA of phage Q-beta | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 1180–7 | date = November 1970 | pmid = 5274447 | jstor = 60432 | doi=10.1073/pnas.67.3.1180 | pmc=283334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of the organisms that have been study are Tobacco, grapevine.

For example, an [[operon]] is a stretch of DNA that is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] to create a contiguous segment of [[RNA]], but contains more than one cistron / gene. The operon is said to be polycistronic, whereas ordinary genes are said to be monocistronic.

In the later 20th century, the use of CE and BCE was popularized in academic and scientific publications, and more generally by authors and publishers wishing to emphasize [[secularism]] or sensitivity to non-Christians, by not explicitly referencing [[Jesus]] as "[[Christ (title)|Christ]]" and ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' ("Lord") through use of the abbreviation{{efn|AD is shortened from ''{{lang|la|anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi}}'' ("in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ").&lt;ref name=Irvin /&gt;}}  "AD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1620546.html |title=BCE date designation called more sensitive |author=Andrew Herrmann |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=27 May 2006 |quote=Herrmann observes, "The changes – showing up at museums, in academic circles and in school textbooks – have been touted as more sensitive to people of faiths outside of Christianity."

== History ==

=== Origins ===
{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an initial reference date ("[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]"), an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW_1mt4oebQC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;dq=jesus+birth+year+before |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1995 |isbn= 978-0-8028-3781-3 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as "''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al.

Numbering years in this manner became more widespread in Europe with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of not using a year zero.{{efn|As noted in [[History of zero|History of the zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the twelfth century.}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to the system]] begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name="CathEncy-Chron" /&gt;

=== Vulgar Era ===
[[File:Johannes Kepler 1610.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Kepler]] first used "Vulgar Era" to distinguish dates on the Christian calendar from the [[regnal year]] typically used in national law.]]
The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "[[wikt:Vulgar|Vulgar]] Era" to distinguish dates on the Ecclesiastic calendar in popular use from dates of the [[regnal year]], the year of reign of a sovereign, typically used in national law.

The first use of the Latin term ''vulgaris aerae''{{Efn|name=VulgarisAerae0|In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.}} discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;{{cite book |title=Second use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1616) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kElSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|publisher=Plancus |author=Kepler, Johann |year=1616 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum caelestium, ab Ānno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII en observationibus potissimum Tychonis Brahei hypothesibus physicis, et tabulis Rudolphinis... |first=Johann |last=Kepler |publisher=Plancus |year=1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1617.&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w47twAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|title=Third use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1617) |publisher=sumptibus authoris, excudebat Iohannes Plancus |author1=Kepler, Johannes |author2=Fabricus, David |year=1617 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum coelestium, ab anno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII[-XXXVI]... |quote=Part 3 has title: Tomi L Ephemeridvm Ioannis Kepleri pars tertia, complexa annos à M.DC.XXIX. in M.DC.XXXVI.

Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often use the [[Gregorian calendar]], without the AD prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our [[L-rd]]," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). |author=Tracey R Rich |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/plymouthinscriptions.htm |title=Plymouth, England Tombstone inscriptions |publisher=Jewish Communities &amp; Records |quote=Here is buried his honour Judah ben his honour Joseph, a prince and honoured amongst philanthropists, who executed good deeds, died in his house in the City of Bath, Tuesday, and was buried here on Sunday, 19 Sivan in the year 5585.

In general publications, in the 200 years between 1808 and 2008 the ratio of usage of BCE to BC has increased by about 20% and CE to AD by about 50%, primarily since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=BCE,BC,CE,AD&amp;year_start=1808&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=10&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,BCE;,c0;.t1;,BC;,c0;.t1;,CE;,c0;.t1;,AD;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (common era), B.P. (before present), or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C." (In section I 5 the Society explains how to use "years B.P." in connection with [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon ages]].) {{cite web |url=https://sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052334/http://www.sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-16 |deadurl=no |df=}} whereas the [[American Anthropological Association]] style guide takes a different approach calling for "C.E." and "B.C.E." {{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm |title=AAA Style Guide |format=PDF |author=American Anthropological Society
|date=2009 |accessdate=2015-05-26 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world. Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.egyptstudy.org/ostracon/guidelines.html |journal=The Ostracon – Journal of the Egyptian Studies Society |title=Submission Guidelines for ''The Ostracon'' |quote=For dates, please use the now-standard "BCE–CE" notation, rather than "BC–AD."

Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620230309/http://ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2006 |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[England and Wales]] introduced the BCE/CE notation system into the official school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220120909/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |archivedate=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032052/http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710123618/http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=School board keeps traditional historic designations |author=Joe Biesk |publisher=Louisville Courier-Journal |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926165947/http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2006|title=Kentucky Board of Education Report |publisher=Kentucky Board of Education Report |date=10 June 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033225/Australia-goes-PC-ban-BC-Birth-Jesus-removed-reference-point-dates-school-history-books.html |title=Australia goes all PC with a ban on BC: Birth of Jesus to be removed as reference point for dates in school history books |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation ''AD''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice|year=1910|page=1116|quote=It has been said of the Latin words anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions At Your Fingertips|author1=Michael McDowell |author2=Nathan Robert Brown |publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-1-101-01469-1|page=38|quote=Marked by the turn of the Common Era, C.E., originally referred to as A.D., an abbreviation of the Latin ''Anno Domini'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord." This was a shortening of ''Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord Jesus Christ."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name="RelTolrnc" /&gt;

Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], himself a [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="kofifaith"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lefevere |first=Patricia |title=Annan: 'Peace is never a perfect achievement'&amp;nbsp;– United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |date=11 December 1998 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713031248/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |title=Common values for a common era: Even as we cherish our diversity, we need to discover our shared values |author=Annan, Kofi A., (then Secretary-General of the United Nations) |date=28 June 1999 |publisher=Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020027/http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adena K. Berkowitz, when arguing at the Supreme Court opted to use BCE and CE because "Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations – B.C.E. and C.E. – cast a wider net of inclusion" &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202630/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=Safire, William |date=17 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus, some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to him in era notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2007|last=Whitney|first=Susan|title=Altering history?

Two thousand six years since what? Most people know, regardless of their belief system, and aren't offended by a historical fact.|accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations.&lt;ref name=SBC /&gt;

There are also secular concerns. English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The short lived [[French Republican Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[French First Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the [[Book of Genesis]]) for a ten-day week.
Priest and writer on interfaith issues [[Raimon Panikkar]] contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism" towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".&lt;ref name=Panikkar&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-vYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Panikkar,+Raimon+(2004).+Christophany:+The+Fullness+of+Man.

In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age "the Common Era," even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.|accessdate=2011-05-18|isbn=978-1-57075-564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the teacher and politician [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19 |date=22 June 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Thus, the current year is written as {{currentyear}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{currentyear}} CE, or as AD {{currentyear}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., "&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/span&gt;" or "C.E.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html |title=Major Rule Changes in The Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=Certain abbreviations traditionally set in small caps are now in full caps (AD, BCE, and the like), with small caps an option. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909071543/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html|archivedate=9 September 2007|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.&lt;ref&gt;''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS – The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §&amp;nbsp;7.1.3.2.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar conventions in other languages ==
* In [[Germany]], Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using "(Before the) Common Era" in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke" /&gt; The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums. Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse'', II. Jahrgang, No. 60, Leipzig, 19. Mai 1838 (19 May 1838). See page 175 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=pwxFAAAAcAAJ Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums: Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse in Betreff von Politik, Religion, Literatur, Geschichte, Sprachkunde und Belletristik, Volume 2] (Leipzig 1838).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|[[Julius Fürst]]}}, ''Geschichte des Karäerthums von 900 bis 1575 der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (Leipzig 1862–1869).&lt;/ref&gt;
:In 1938 [[Nazi Germany]], the use of this convention was also prescribed by the [[National Socialist Teachers League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=149 |first=Karl Ludwig Freiherr |last=von und zu Guttenberg |author-link=Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg |url=http://www.monarchieforum.org/ARCHIV/WeisseBlaetter/MAI1938.pdf |date=May 1938 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119145938/http://www.monarchieforum.org/ARCHIV/WeisseBlaetter/MAI1938.pdf |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |title=Weiße Blätter: Monatschrift für Geschichte, Tradition u. Staat |accessdate=15 April 2018 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and they found it ironic to see "[[Aryan]]s following Jewish example nearly 200 years later".&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759195,00.html |title=GERMANY: Jewish Joke |date=7 March 1938|accessdate=2012-02-05 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Common forms used for "BC" are aC and a. de C. (for antes de Cristo, "before Christ"), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of J.C.(Jesucristo) instead of C. In scholarly writing, AEC is the equivalent of the English "BCE", antes de la Era Común or Before the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spanish.about.com/od/writtenspanish/qt/dates.htm |title=Writing Dates in Spanish |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (''Oed Crist'') and CE (''Oes Cyffredin''); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ''Cyn Crist'') is used exclusively, as ''Cyn yr Oes Cyffredin'' would abbreviate to a mild obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=welsh-termau-cymraeg;982a203b.0610 |title=Welsh-Termau-Cymraeg Archives |publisher=JISCMail |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[genetics]], two [[organism]]s that differ in only one [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] and a linked segment of chromosome are defined as '''congenic'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Congenic | title = Congenic - definition from Biology-Online.org | work = Biology-Online.org dictionary | publisher = Biology-Online.org |  access-date = 25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, organisms that are [[Coisogenic strain|coisogenic]] differ in one locus only and not in the surrounding chromosome. Unlike congenic organisms, coisogenic organisms cannot be bred and only occur through spontaneous or targeted mutation at the locus.

==Generating congenic strains==
Congenic strains are generated in the laboratory by mating two inbred strains (usually rats or mice), and back-crossing the descendants 5–10 generations with one of the original strains, known as the ''recipient'' strain. Typically selection for either phenotype or genotype is performed prior to each back-cross generation. In this manner either an interesting phenotype, or a defined chromosomal region assayed by genotype, is passed from the ''donor'' strain onto an otherwise uniform ''recipient'' background.  Congenic mice or rats can then be compared to the pure recipient strain to determine whether they are phenotypically different if selection was for a genotypic region, or to identify the critical genetic locus, if selection was for a phenotype.

This is also known as ''marker-assisted'' congenics, due to the use of genetic markers, typically [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] markers, but now, more commonly, [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] markers (SNPs). The process can be further aided by the [[superovulation]] of females, to produce many more eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9340">[[File:Bagsv2.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Jørn Utzon, Bagsvaerd Church (1973–6), Denmark; combinations of local culture and universal civilization.]]
'''Critical regionalism''' is an approach to [[architecture]] that strives to counter the placelessness and lack of identity of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but also rejects the whimsical individualism and ornamentation of [[Postmodern architecture]]. The stylings of critical regionalism seek to provide an architecture rooted in the modern tradition, but tied to geographical and cultural context. Critical regionalism is not simply [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the sense of [[vernacular architecture]]. It is a progressive approach to design that seeks to mediate between the global and the local languages of architecture.

The phrase "critical regionalism" was first used by the architectural theorists [[Alexander Tzonis]] and Liane Lefaivre and, with a slightly different meaning, by the historian-theorist [[Kenneth Frampton]].

Critical Regionalists thus hold that both modern and post-modern architecture are "deeply problematic".&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, "Postmodernism: A Preface", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kenneth Frampton ==
In "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", Frampton recalls [[Paul Ricoeur]]'s "how to become modern and to return to sources; how to revive an old, dormant civilization and take part in universal civilization". According to Frampton's proposal, critical regionalism should adopt modern architecture, critically, for its universal progressive qualities but at the same time value should be placed on the geographical context of the building. Emphasis, Frampton says, should be on topography, climate, light; on tectonic form rather than on scenography (i.e. painting theatrical scenery) and should be on the sense of touch rather than visual sense. Frampton draws on [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] for his argument.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Frampton, "Towards a Critical Regionalism: Six points for an architecture of resistance", in ''"Anti-Aesthetic. Essays on Postmodern Culture."'' Seattle: Bay Press, 1983. {{ISBN|0-941920-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:SaynatsaloTownHall.jpg|thumb|150px|Alvar Aalto, Saynatsalo Town Hall (1952), Finland: the grass steps appeal to the tactile sense.]]

Two examples Frampton briefly discusses are [[Jørn Utzon]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. In Frampton's view, Utzon's [[Bagsværd Church]] (1973–6), near Copenhagen is a self-conscious synthesis between universal civilization and world culture. This is revealed by the rational, modular, neutral and economic, partly prefabricated concrete outer shell (i.e. universal civilization) versus the specially-designed, 'uneconomic', organic, reinforced concrete shell of the interior, signifying with its manipulation of light sacred space and 'multiple cross-cultural references', which Frampton sees no precedent for in Western culture, but rather in the Chinese [[pagoda]] roof (i.e. world culture). In the case of Aalto, Frampton discusses the red brick [[Säynätsalo Town Hall]] (1952), where, he argues, there is a resistance to universal technology and vision, affected by using the tactile qualities of the building's materials.  He notes, for instance, feeling the contrast between the friction of the brick surface of the stairs and the springy wooden floor of the council chamber.

== William J. R. Curtis and Suha Ozkan ==
There have been two different perceptions of Regionalism in architecture. One of which is of Western writers, like [[William J. R. Curtis|Curtis]], whose definitions are not encompassing enough to analyse architectural styles especially in the last two centuries in the Islamic countries, like Iran. However, Ozkan's definition of Regionalism is more objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Theoretical Inapplicability of Regionalism to Analysing Architectural Aspects of Islamic Shrines in Iran in the Last Two Centuries|journal=The Collection of articles of the International Congress of Imam's Descendants (Imamzadegan)|year=2013|volume=4|pages=16–32|url=http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/18145|publisher=The Charity Organisation|location=Esfahan, Iran|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Tzonis and Liane Lefaivre ==
According to [[Alexander Tzonis]] and [[Liane Lefaivre]], critical regionalism need not directly draw from the context; rather elements can be stripped of context but used in unfamiliar ways. Here the aim is to make evident a disruption and loss of place, that is already a ''[[fait accompli]]'', through reflection and self-evaluation.

== Critical regionalist architects ==
In addition to Aalto and Utzon, the following architects have used Critical Regionalism (in the Frampton sense) in their work: [[Studio Granda]], [[Mario Botta]], [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], Mahesh Naik, Sahil Ahmed, [[Mazharul Islam]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Charles Correa]], [[Christopher Benninger]], [[Alvaro Siza]], [[Jorge Ferreira Chaves]], [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Geoffrey Bawa]], [[Raj Rewal]], Dharmesh Vadavala, [[Ashok "Bihari" Lall]] Neelkanth Chhaya (Kaka), Soumitro Ghosh, Nisha Mathew Ghosh, [[Ngô Viết Thụ]], [[Tadao Ando]], Mack Scogin / Merrill Elam, [[Glenn Murcutt]], [[Johnsen Schmaling Architects]], [[Ken Yeang]], Philippe Madec, [[William S.W. Lim]], Tay Kheng Soon, [[WOHA]] Architects (Singapore), [[Juhani Pallasmaa]], [[Wang Shu]], [[Juha Leiviskä]], [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Carlo Scarpa]], Tan Hock Beng. Peter Stutchbury, Lake Flato, Rick Joy, Tom Kundig, and Sverre Fehn. Dimitris &amp; Suzana Antonakakis are the two Greek architects for whom the term was first used by [[Tzonis]] and Lefaivre.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2016). Intersecting Itineraries Beyond the Strada Novissima: The Converging Authorship of Critical Regionalism. Architectural Histories, 4(1), 11. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/ah.192&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical regionalism has developed into unique sub-styles across the world. [[Glenn Murcutt]]'s simple vernacular architectural style is representative of an Australian variant to critical regionalism. In [[Architecture_of_Singapore|Singapore]], [[WOHA]] has developed a unique architectural vocabulary based on an appreciation of the local climate and culture.

== In cultural studies ==
Subsequently, the phrase "critical regionalism" has also been used in cultural studies, literary studies, and political theory, specifically in the work of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]. In her 2007 work "Who Sings the Nation-State?", co-authored with [[Judith Butler]], Spivak proposes a deconstructive alternative to nationalism that is predicated on the [[deconstruction]] of borders and rigid national identity.&lt;ref name="Spivak on Regionalism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/page/252/spivaks-abstracts.htm|title=Spivak on Regionalism|accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Reichert Powell's book ''Critical Regionalism: Connecting Politics and Culture in the American Landscape'' (2007) traces the trajectory of the term critical regionalism from its original use in architectural theory to its inclusion in literary, cultural, and political studies and proposes a methodology based on the intersection of those fields.

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[Digital technology|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last=Lorenzano|first=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as [[Refrigerator|refrigerators]], [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Günther Anders]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Mike Cooley (engineer) | Mike Cooley]] and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last=Jeronimo|first=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0824072006|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the cases of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crises]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]] - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">'''Cynical realism''' is a [[contemporary art|contemporary]] movement in [[Chinese art]], especially in the form of [[painting]], that began in the 1990s. Beginning in [[Beijing]], it has become one of the most popular Chinese [[contemporary art]] movements in [[mainland China]]. It arose through the pursuit of individual expression by Chinese artists who broke away from the collective mindset that existed since the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The major themes tend to focus on [[socio-political]] issues and events since [[Revolutionary China]] (1911) to the present. These include having a usually humorous and [[post-irony|post-ironic]] take on a realist perspective and interpretation of the transition that Chinese society has been through, from the advent of [[Communism]] to today's [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]].

'''Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute''' also referred to as '''Deccan College''' is a post-graduate institute of [[Archeology]], [[Linguistics]] and [[Sanskrit]] &amp; [[Lexicography]] [[Pune]], [[India]].

==History==
===Early years (1821 to 1939)===
Established on 6 October 1821 as Hindoo College, it is one of the oldest institutions of modern learning in India. It was started under [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] (Lt. Governor of [[Bombay Presidency]]), with funds diverted from the erstwhile Peshwa's Dakshina Fund, later disbursed by Sardar Khanderao Dabhade after the Territories of the [[Peshwa]] were annexed in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccancollegepune.ac.in/ Deccan College website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as the Poona Sanskrit College. The first principal was Major [[Thomas Candy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, English and other modern subjects were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;R.N. Dandekar, "Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and the Academic Renaissance in Maharashtra" in ''Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute'', Vol. 69, No. 1/4 (1988), pp. 283-294.&lt;/ref&gt; An English school was added to the college in 1842; on 7 June 1851 the English school was merged with the Hindoo College to form [[Poona College]]. In 1857, the principal was Sir [[Edwin Arnold]], followed by W.A. Russell in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its original location in [[Vishrambaug Wada]] and later in [[Wanwadi]], the Poona College was shifted to its present large campus near Yerwada. The land was donated by the Bombay government. The foundation stone of the main building was laid on 15 October 1864. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian neo-Gothic]] building was constructed by Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] with a munificent 1,00,000 rupees from [[Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, 2nd Baronet]], between [[Kirkee]] and [[Yerwada]].

The college started functioning on the new campus on 23 March 1868. At this stage it was renamed as Deccan College in recognition of the enrollment of students from the entire [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. Until 1881, Deccan College was staffed by four professors, one acting as principal. Another of the four, the professor of Oriental languages, supervised five traditional Sanskrit [[shastri]]s and an expert in Zend [[Pahlevi]] in an extensive program of research and text publication, in addition to his teaching duties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen E. McDonald, "English Education and Social Reform in Late Nineteenth Century Bombay: A Case Study in the Transmission of a Cultural Ideal" in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (May, 1966), pp. 453-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Student enrollment rose to a peak of 210 in 1885. William Wordsworth (grandson of the poet [[William Wordsworth]]) and E.A. Wodehouse (brother of [[P.G. Wodehouse]]) were principals of the college during 1862-74 and 1934-39 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/A-golden-era-of-history-rusts-at-Deccan-college/articleshow/134146.cms | title=A golden era of history rusts at Deccan college | date=17 August 2003 | newspaper=The Times of India | first=Neil | last=Pate | accessdate=24 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history (1939 till present)===
Deccan College temporarily shut down its teaching activities in 1934 due to lack of funding. It was reopened by order of the [[Bombay High Court]] on 17 August 1939 as a post-graduate and research institute for promoting higher learning and research in [[Indology]] and [[Social Sciences]]. The re-opened institute originally had four teaching and research departments: Archaeology, Linguistics, History, and Sociology-Anthropology.

A Transfer Deed was passed by the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 16 August 1939 by which the court enjoined the state government to run the institute in perpetuity. As per the Transfer Deed the Deccan College Poona Trust came into existence in which were vested the properties including the land and buildings. In accordance with the provision in the Transfer Deed, the appointments of the Trustees today are made by the State Government.

It was incorporated by the Poona University (now [[University of Pune]]) in 1948, becoming one of its recognized institutions.

The state government was entrusted with preparing the rules for the administration and management of the Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, which was to cater to studies in post-graduate and research in heritage-related subjects. Thus the Management Council came into existence. In the next half-century the institute, apart from giving instruction to postgraduate students and producing over 500 Ph.D. dissertations, carried out outstanding research in Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Medieval and Maratha History, Sociology-Anthropology and Sanskrit Studies.

In recognition of the excellence achieved by the institute in teaching and research, the H.R.D. Ministry, Government of India, awarded it the status of a Deemed University on 5 March 1990. It started functioning as Deemed University from 1 June 1994. Since then the institute has conducted its own courses for M.A. degree and P.G. diploma in Archaeology, M.A. degree in Linguistics, and M.A. degree in Sanskrit and Lexicography, and has enrolled a large number of students for the Ph.D. degree in these disciplines.

Currently, Deccan College has only two teaching and research departments: Archaeology and Linguistics. On the premises are two museums: the Museum of Maratha History, and the Museum of Archaeology. As of 2016, it is currently involved in the ongoing multi-year excavation of the largest [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site of [[Rakhigarhi]] in [[Hisar district]] of [[Haryana]].

==Extra-academic==
Deccan College had the oldest boat club in India, called the Poonah Boat Club. The site has since been discontinued and is completely overrun by the slums behind Shadal Baba Dargah.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration 'India: The Poonah Boat Club: Bringing Down the Boats' in ''The Graphic'' (6 October 1877), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eco-Schools''' is an international programme of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE)  that aims to empower students to be the change our sustainable world needs by engaging them in fun, action-orientated and socially responsible learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoschools.global/ |title=Eco Schools |website=Ecoschools.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fee.global/ |title=Foundation for Environmental EducationFoundation for Environmental Education |website=Fee.global |accessdate=October 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each school follows a seven step change process and empowers their young people to lead processes and actions wherever they can.

Over time and through commitment to the Eco-Schools Seven Step process, improvements will be seen in both the learning outcomes, attitude and behaviour of students and the local community, and ultimately the local environment. Evidence of success in these areas will eventually lead to a school being awarded with the International Green Flag.

Eco-Schools is one of the programmes recognised by the [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005 – 2104), awarding certificates to thousands of schools around the world.&lt;ref name=decade&gt;[https://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/a33_un_decade_final_report_2014_230171e.pdf ‘Shaping the Future We Want’ – UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005-2014) Final Report], p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Eco-Schools programme extends from kindergartens to universities and is implemented in 67 countries, involving 51,000 schools and institutions, and over 19,000,000 students.  It is the largest international network of teachers and students in the world.&lt;ref name=decade /&gt; FEE EcoCampus is the name of the programme at university level.    
[[File:The Green Flag.gif|thumb|The Eco-Schools Green Flag]]

== History ==

The programme was developed in 1992 in response to the need to involve young people in environmental projects at the local level as identified at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] of 1992.

Eco-Schools was launched in 1994 in Denmark, Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom with the support of the European Commission. When the Foundation for Environmental Education became global in 2001, countries outside of Europe began joining the Eco-Schools programme, as well.  South Africa was the first country to do so.

In 2003 Eco-Schools was identified by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) as a model initiative for [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spirala.sk/wp-content/uploads/100201-memorandum-o-porozumeni-fee-unep.pdf FEE – UNEP Memorandum of Understanding] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
[[File:Eco-Schools in South Africa.jpg|thumb|Eco-Schools in South Africa]]
The International Eco-Schools Programme takes a holistic, participatory approach to learning for sustainability. The aim of the programme is to engage students through classroom study, school and community action to raise awareness of sustainable development issues.&lt;ref&gt;‘Greenrock expands Eco-School Programme’, Bermuda Sun, 20 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Les Clés De Demain, ‘L'Eco-Ecole fête ses 20 ans’, LeMonde.fr, 28 Aug. 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages students and teachers to conduct research on the amount of waste, energy or water use at their school and work towards making it a more sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;Arandjelovic, Nadia “Eco-Schools programme helps students ‘change their place of learning’”, The Royal Gazette, 28 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Schools provide an integrated system for the environmental management of schools and involve all stakeholders in this process.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves, LG (2008) [http://www.developmenteducationreview.com/issue6-perspectives2 'The whole-school approach to education for sustainable development: From pilot projects to systemic change'], Policy &amp; Practice: A Development Education Review, Vol. 6, Spring, pp. 69-74&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The whole schools approach embedded in the Eco-Schools programme emphasises the importance of an ongoing focus on the issues linked to environmental, climate and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, V.V., Doyle, D., Klein, J., &amp; Didham, R.J. (2015) ''‘Responsible Living: Concepts, Education and Future Perspectives’'', Springer, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme’s methodology consists of Seven Steps&lt;ref&gt;Andreou, Nicole (2017). Schools Turning Communities Green in International School Magazine, p.39-40 https://cloud.3dissue.com/2389/3124/7031/is19-3/offline/download.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/seven-steps/ ''’Seven Steps Towards an Eco-School’'']&lt;/ref&gt; that the school needs to adopt.

'''Step 1'''  Establishment of the Eco-Schools Committee &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 2'''  Environmental review &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 3'''  Action Plan &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 4'''  Monitoring and Evaluation &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 5'''  Curriculum Linking &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 6'''  Informing and involving the wider community &lt;br&gt;
'''Step 7'''  Eco Code

Schools are encouraged to work on eleven Themes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/themes/ ''’Eco-Schools Themes’'']&lt;/ref&gt; which are as follows: Biodiversity &amp; Nature, Climate Change, Energy, Global Citizenship, Health &amp; Wellbeing, Litter, Marine and Coast, School Grounds, Transport, Waste, Water.

== Participation and awards ==

Any school may participate in the scheme by registering with the FEE member organisation in their country. Once registered, each school must review and improve their impact on the environment and in recognition of their commitment and progress they can then apply for an award.

Successful Eco-Schools are awarded the International Green Flag, an internationally acknowledged symbol for environmental excellence. In some countries, this recognition happens through a three level system, where schools are awarded either bronze and silver awards before receiving the  International Green Flag.

There is flexibility to the ceremony and awarding process but the criteria for assessing schools for the award must follow the guidelines of FEE's International Eco-Schools programme.

== Process ==

To qualify for an award the school must follow the following programme:

* Register – usually done by an adult (teacher or parent).
* Eco-Schools Committee – a group of pupils and adults – some elected by their peers are assembled to manage the process.
* Environmental Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must organise the school to carry out a review of the school's energy and water usage, waste production and state of the school grounds with respect to litter.
* Action Plan – formed from issues identified by the review
* Eco Code – the Eco-Schools Committee, with the participation of the whole school must develop a mission statement to be prominently advertised inside and outside the school.
* Link to Curriculum and Take Action – demonstrable progress must be made in three areas of the curriculum and involve as much of the school as possible.
* Monitor and Review – the Eco-Schools Committee must record and analyse the progress made

After these processes are complete the school can apply for one of the awards mentioned above dependent on the level of environmental progress made.

== FEE EcoCampus ==
[[File:EcoCampus UCC.jpg|thumb|University College Cork was awarded the Green Flag in 2010]] 
The FEE EcoCampus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoschools.global/ecocampus/ FEE EcoCampus]&lt;/ref&gt; programme is an evolution of the Eco-Schools programme. It targets students in third level education in various countries and is implemented in the same way as Eco-Schools. The only real difference is that students devise an Eco Charter instead of an Eco Code. &lt;br&gt;
This Charter is a document which is a guide to environmental management on site.

EcoCampus began in Russia in 2003 and the first whole institution Green Flags were awarded in Ireland in 2010, to [[University College Cork]].&lt;ref&gt;Green-Campus Ireland [http://www.greencampusireland.org/news/19th-february-2010-ucc-raising-the-green-flag- ''‘19th February 2010: UCC Raising the Green Flag!’''] 30 Nov. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-Schools compensates for their CO2 emissions from their flight travels when they go to, for example, conferences and National Operator Meetings through the Global Forest Fund. FEE has established the Global Forest Fund to help minimise the effects of CO2 emissions from the increased travel activity worldwide. The Fund supports schools and organisations by funding CO2 compensation efforts such as planting trees and environmental education activities.

{{Economics sidebar}}

An '''economist''' is a practitioner in the [[social sciences|social science]] discipline of [[economics]].

The individual may also study, develop, and apply theories and concepts from economics and write about [[economic policy]]. Within this field there are many sub-fields, ranging from the broad [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[theory|theories]] to the focused study of minutiae within specific [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] analysis, [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] analysis or [[financial statement analysis]], involving analytical methods and tools such as [[econometrics]], [[statistics]], [[Computational economics|economics computational model]]s, [[financial economics]], [[mathematical finance]] and [[mathematical economics]].

==In academia==
The professionalization of economics, reflected in academia, has been described as "the main change in economics since around 1900."&lt;ref&gt;[[Orley Ashenfelter|O. Ashenfelter]] (2001), "Economics: Overview", The Profession of Economics, ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 6, p. 4159.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists debate the path they believe their profession should take.  It is, primarily, a debate between a scholastic orientation, focused on mathematical techniques, and a public discourse orientation, which is more focused on communicating to lay people pertinent economic principles as they relate to [[public policy]].  Surveys among economists indicate a preference for a shift toward the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first= William L. |title=Preference Falsification in the Economics Profession|date=August 2004|url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/DavisCharacterIssuesAugust2004.pdf|format=PDF|website=www.econjournalwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major universities have an economics faculty, school or department, where [[academic degree]]s are awarded in economics. Getting a PhD in economics takes six years, on average, with a median of 5.3 years.&lt;ref&gt;Siegried JF, Stock WA. (2001). [https://ideas.repec.org/p/van/wpaper/0037.html So You Want to Earn a Ph.D. in Economics: How Long Do You Think it Will Take?]. ''Journal of Human Resources''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], established by [[Sveriges Riksbank]] in 1968, is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field of economics. The prize winners are announced in October every year. They receive their awards (a prize amount, a gold medal and a diploma) on December 10, the anniversary of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/ |title=The Nobel Prize |accessdate=2008-03-14 |publisher=Nobel Web AB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professions==
[[Image:Mvc-017x.jpg|thumb|[[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Fed Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]] testifies before the [[U.S. House Committee on Financial Services]]]]
Economists work in many fields including academia, government and in the private sector, where they may also "...study data and statistics in order to spot trends in economic activity, economic confidence levels, and consumer attitudes. They assess this information using advanced methods in statistical analysis, mathematics, computer programming [and] they make recommendations about ways to improve the efficiency of a system or take advantage of trends as they begin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonreview.com/cte/profiles/dayInLife.asp?careerID=56 Economist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to regulated professions such as engineering, law or medicine, there is not a legally required educational requirement or license for economists. In academia, to be called an economist requires a Ph.D. degree in Economics. In the US government, on the other hand, a person can be hired as an economist provided that they have a degree that included or was supplemented by 21 semester hours in economics and three hours in statistics, accounting, or calculus.&lt;ref name="http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/standards/IORs/gs0100/0110.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economist Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional working inside of one of many fields of economics or having an academic degree in this subject is often considered to be an economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/Life-Physical-and-Social-Science/Economists.htm|title=Economists :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|publisher=|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to government and academia, economists are also employed in [[bank]]ing, [[finance]], [[accountancy]], [[commerce]], [[marketing]], [[management|business administration]], [[lobbying]] and non- or not-for profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ-jobs.com/|title=Economics Jobs and Economist Jobs - Econ-Jobs.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Politician]]s often consult economists before enacting economic [[policy]]. Many statesmen have academic degrees in economics.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==By country==
Economics [[Alumnus|graduate]]s are employable in varying degrees depending on the regional economic scenario and [[labour economics|labour market]] conditions at the time for a given country. Apart from the specific understanding of the subject, employers value the skills of numeracy and analysis, the ability to [[communication|communicate]] and the capacity to grasp broad issues which the graduates acquire at the [[university]] or [[college]]. Whilst only a few{{how many|date=July 2016}} economics graduates may be expected to become professional economists,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} many find it a base for entry into a career in [[finance]] – including accounting, insurance, tax and banking, or [[management]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} A number of economics graduates from around the world have been successful in obtaining employment in a variety of major national and international firms in the financial and commercial sectors, and in manufacturing, retailing and IT, as well as in the public sector – for example, in the health and education sectors, or in [[government]] and [[politics]]. Small numbers{{how many|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} go on to undertake postgraduate studies, either in economics, research, teacher training or further qualifications in specialist areas.
===Brazil===
In Brazil, unlike most countries in the world where the profession is not regulated, the profession of Economist is regulated by Law. 1411 of August 13, 1951. The professional designation of economist, according to the said law, is exclusive to the bachelors in economics graduates in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coreconrs.org.br/area-de-atuacao.html|title=Guia do mercado de trabalho do economista CORECON|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], there were about 15,000 non-academic economists in the United States in 2008, with a median salary of roughly $83,000 the top ten percent earning more than $147,040 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ US Bureau of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430185238/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos055.htm#earnings/ |date=April 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 135 colleges and universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AEA/gradstudents/Schools.htm|title=Subscription Application}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2016}} grant around 900 new [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s every year. Incomes are highest for those in the private sector, followed by the federal government, with academia paying the lowest incomes. As of January 2013, PayScale.com showed Ph.D. economists' salary ranges as follows: all Ph.D. economists, $61,000 to $160,000; Ph.D. corporate economists, $71,000 to $207,000; economics full professors, $89,000 to $137,000; economics associate professors, $59,000 to $156,000, and economics assistant professors, $72,000 to $100,000.&lt;ref name="Pay Scale, US income of Economists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Ph.D._Economics/Salary|title=Pay Scale, US income of Economists|accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The largest single professional grouping of economists in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are the more than 1000 members of the [[Government Economic Service]], who work in 30 government departments and agencies.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Analysis of destination surveys for economics graduates from a number of selected top schools of economics in the United Kingdom (ranging from [[Newcastle University]] to the [[London School of Economics]]), shows nearly 80 percent in employment six months after graduation – with a wide range of roles and employers, including regional, national and international organisations, across many sectors.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} This figure compares very favourably with the national picture, with 64 percent of economics graduates in employment.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''embodied agent''', also sometimes referred to as an interface agent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[intelligent agent]] that interacts with the environment through a physical body within that environment.  Agents that are represented graphically with a body, for example a human or a cartoon animal, are also called embodied agents, although they have only virtual, not physical, embodiment. A branch of artificial intelligence focuses on empowering such agents to interact autonomously with [[human being]]s and the environment. [[Mobile robot]]s are one example of physically embodied agents; [[Ananova]] and [[Microsoft Agent]] are examples of graphically embodied agents. '''Embodied conversational agents''' are embodied agents (usually with a graphical front-end as opposed to a robotic body) that are capable of engaging in conversation with one another and with humans employing the same verbal and nonverbal means that humans do (such as gesture, facial expression, and so forth).

==Embodied conversational agents==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a form of intelligent [[user interface]].  Graphically embodied agents aim to unite gesture, facial expression and speech to enable face-to-face communication with users, providing a powerful means of [[human-computer interaction]].

==Advantages==
Face-to-face communication allows communication protocols that give a much richer communication channel than other means of communicating. It enables pragmatic communication acts such as conversational [[turn-taking]], facial expression of [[emotion]]s, information structure and emphasis, visualisation and iconic gestures, and orientation in a three-dimensional environment.  This communication takes place through both verbal and non-verbal channels such as [[gaze]], [[gesture]], spoken intonation and body posture.

Research has found that users prefer a non-verbal visual indication of an embodied system's internal state to a verbal indication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating the value of additional non-verbal communication channels.  As well as this, the face-to-face communication involved in interacting with an embodied agent can be conducted alongside another task without distracting the human participants, instead improving the enjoyment of such an interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Embodied agents also provide a social dimension to the interaction.  Humans willingly ascribe social awareness to computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

One example result from a recent study indicates the power of a character when moderating search inquiries. When a character asked people to type search requests into a window, people used, on average, three more words in their requests (averaging about 7 words per inquiry) compared to identical requests made without a character. Character suggest that a conversational style is appropriate, resulting in higher liking for the
interaction on the part of the user, and better accuracy for the engine generating the required results.&lt;ref name="The Benefits of Interactive Online Characters"&gt;{{cite web

This rich style of communication that characterises human [[conversation]] makes conversational interaction with embodied [[conversational agents]] ideal for many non-traditional interaction tasks. A familiar application of graphically embodied agents is [[computer games]]; embodied agents are ideal for this setting because the richer communication style makes interacting with the agent enjoyable.  Embodied conversational agents have also been used in [[E-Learning|virtual training environments]], portable personal navigation guides, interactive fiction and [[storytelling]] systems, [[interactive online character]]s and automated presenters and commentators.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

[[File:British Museum Flood Tablet.jpg|thumb|Tablet containing a fragment of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'']]
{{Literature}}
An '''epic poem''', '''epic''', '''epos''', or '''epopee'''  is a lengthy [[narrative poem]], ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who, in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the moral universe that their descendants, the poet and his audience, must understand to understand themselves as a people or nation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'' (Bedford: St. Martin's, 2005), 2128. {{ISBN|0312412428}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of epic poetry is [[epyllion]] (plural: epyllia), which is a brief narrative poem with a [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[Mythology|mythological]] [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. The term, which means "little [[:wikt:epic|epic]]", came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἐπικός}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} (''epos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "word, story, poem".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Camões, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.

The oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500–1300 BCE}}), which was recorded In ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The poem details the exploits of [[Gilgamesh]], the king of [[Uruk]]. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lawall |editor1-first=Sarah N. |editor2-last=Mack |editor2-first=Maynard |date=1999 |title=Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition |volume=1 |edition=7 |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=10–11 |isbn=978-0393972894 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest epic written is the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which consists of 100,000 [[śloka]]s or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at about 1.8 million words it is about four times the length of the ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', and roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Oral epics==
The first epics were products of [[literacy|preliterate]] [[societies]] and [[oral history]] poetic traditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Oral tradition]] was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread culture.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0521337946 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.

[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Composition and conventions===

In his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"&gt;Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Begins [[in medias res]].
# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.
# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).
# Begins with a statement of the theme.
# Includes the use of [[epithets]].
# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].
# Features long and formal speeches.
# Shows divine intervention on human affairs.
# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.
# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].

The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates [[Characteristics of Epic Heroes|traits]], performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native culture.

Conventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battles|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Toward a Theory of Old English Poetic Genres: Epic, Elegy, Wisdom Poetry, and the "Traditional Opening"|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy|volume=111,1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1353/sip.2014.0001|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This convention is restricted to cultures influenced by European Classical culture. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)
# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s "rosy-fingered dawn" and "wine-dark sea".

== Form ==
Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set. Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Line (poetry)|lines]] did not have consistent lengths;&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"&gt;{{citation|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|author-link=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0226452388|pages=184–185|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], with subtle variations between lines.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] epic poetry, by contrast, usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; Ancient Greek and Latin poems were written in dactylic [[hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/hexameter Hexameter, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; Old English, German and Norse poems were written in [[alliterative verse]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/alliterative-verse Alliterative verse literature at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; usually without [[rhyme]]. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese long poems were usually written in [[terza rima]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/terza-rima Terza rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; or especially [[ottava rima]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/ottava-rima Ottava rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century English epic poems were written in [[heroic couplet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/heroic-couplet Heroic couplet, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rhyme royal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rhyme-royal Rhyme royal, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; though in the 16th century the [[Spenserian stanza]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Spenserian-stanza Spenserian stanza, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blank verse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/blank-verse  Blank verse, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; were also introduced. The [[French alexandrine]] is currently the heroic line in French literature, though in earlier periods the [[decasyllable]] took precedence. In Polish literature, couplets of [[Polish alexandrine]]s (syllabic lines of 7+6 syllables) prevail.&lt;ref&gt;See: Trzynastozgłoskowiec, [in:] Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, [[iambic tetrameter]] verse is the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;[Alexandra Smith, Montaging Pushkin: Pushkin and Visions of Modernity in Russian Twentieth Century Poetry, p. 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbian poetry, the decasyllable is the only form employed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pl/books?id=6qTpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=serbian+decasyllable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MktD0VfvNW&amp;sig=E-2QFetJSwJHIDDl_ADj3mAK7i0&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq_a-ztjQAhWBXCwKHd9HAJkQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20decasyllable&amp;f=falseDavid Meyer, Early Tahitian Poetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebritic.com/?p=146369  Robert William Seton-Watson, The Spirit of the Serb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Institute of Oncology''' ({{lang-it|Istituto Europeo di Oncologia}}, '''IEO''') is a non-profit private-law comprehensive [[cancer]] centre located in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  It is a clinic, a research centre and a training institution.

The European Institute of [[Oncology]] works on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer by developing clinical and scientific research coupled with organisation and management.

==History==
 
The European Institute of Oncology was conceived by [[Umberto Veronesi]], who developed a new model for health and advanced research in the international oncology field.  The institute was inaugurated in May 1994, and is managed by Division and Unit Directors from eight European countries.

The Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or “Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico”) through the [[Ministerial decree|Ministerial Decree]] issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology provides services through agreements with Italy’s National Health Service. Professor Gordon McVie performs outreach activities on behalf of the IEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=WG|title=International health experts attend research and development conference hosted by Yeovil District Hospital|url=http://www.westerngazette.co.uk/International-health-experts-attend-research/story-20959561-detail/story.html|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Institute integrates various activities involved in the fight against cancer: prevention and diagnosis, health education and training, research and treatment.

At its centre in Via Ripamonti  all clinical, research and training activities take place.  In 2002 the institute opened IEO CENTRO, an integrated cancer diagnosis centre located in Milan downtown.

[[Image:Tujunga Wash.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tujunga Wash]] is an example of a concrete flood control channel.]]
'''Flood control channels''' are large and empty basins which let water flow in and out (except during [[flood]]ing) or dry channels that run below the street levels of some larger [[cities]], so that if and when a flood occurs, the water will run into these channels, and eventually drain into a [[river]] or other body of [[water]]. Flood channels are sometimes built on the former courses of waterways as a way to reduce flooding.

Flood control channels are not to be confused with watercourses which are simply confined between [[levee]]s. These structures may be made entirely of [[concrete]], with concrete sides and an exposed bottom, with [[riprap]] sides and an exposed bottom, or completely unlined. They often contain grade control sills or [[weir]]s to prevent [[erosion]] and maintain a level streambed.

By definition, flood control channels range from the size of a [[street gutter]] to a few hundred or even a few thousand feet wide in some rare cases. Flood control channels are found in most heavily developed areas in the world. One city with many of these channels is [[Los Angeles]], as they became mandatory with the passage of the [[Flood Control Act of 1941]] passed in the wake of the [[Los Angeles Flood of 1938]].

== Life and Work ==
Gillis, who grew up in Detroit, first began his musical studies learning the violin. It was not until age 17 that he began studying piano.

[[File:Sarcophagus_archmus_Heraklion.jpg|thumb|320px|The Hagia Triada sarcophagus. Funereal cult. Lyre with seven strings]]
The '''Hagia Triada sarcophagus''' is an early [[Bronze Age]] 137&amp;nbsp;cm-long limestone [[sarcophagus]]. It was originally dated to 1400 BC and was rediscovered in [[Hagia Triada]] on [[Crete]] in 1903. It provides probably the most comprehensive iconography of a pre-Homeric ''thysiastikis'' ceremony and one of the best pieces of information on noble burial customs when Crete was under [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] rule, combining features of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and Mycenaean style and subject matter. The sarcophagus is on display in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]].

==Description==
Coated in plaster and painted in [[fresco]], it has posed an art historical conundrum ever since its rediscovery, since the Minoans (unlike the [[ancient Egypt]]ians) otherwise only used frescoes for the enjoyment of the living and not in funerary practice.&lt;ref&gt;See also A. Papagiannopoulou 1999, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only limestone sarcophagus of its era discovered to date and the only sarcophagus with a series of narrative scenes of Minoan funerary ritual (later sarcophagi found in the Aegean were decorated with abstract designs and patterns). It was originally used for the burial of a prince. The painted frieze around the sarcophagus shows all the stages of the sacred ceremony which was performed at the burial of important personages. In the centre of one of the long sides of the sarcophagus is a scene with bull sacrifice. On the left of the second long side a woman wearing a crown is carrying two vessels. By her side a man dressed in a long robe is playing a seven string [[lyre]]. This is the earliest picture of the lyre known in classical Greece. In front of them another woman is emptying the contents of a vessel-perhaps the blood of the sacrificed bull-into a second vessel, possibly as an invocation to the soul of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis"Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum" pp. 113,114. Ekdotike Athinon. Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; (This scene brings to mind a description in Homer, where the dead needed blood.) On the right three men holding animals and a boat are approaching a male figure without arms and legs and presumably he represents the dead man receiving gifts (the boat for his journey to the next world).&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis"Herakleion Museum. Illustrated guide to the Museum" p. 114. Ekdotike Athinon. Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that they believed that the dead were living in a different state and he could probably reappear.

==Age==
Recent 20th century excavations on the same site have allowed the sarcophagus's dating to be tightened up to 1370-1320 BC, which coincides with the end of the [[18th Dynasty]] in Egypt, a period of extensive contact between Crete and Egypt, thus allowing the sarcophagus's technical and artistic elements to be related to similar decorative techniques in Egyptian temples and tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, Paula 2005, 10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Some miniature sculpture found in other places of Crete (Kamilari, Archanes) during this period are connected with the worship of the dead and there are traces of a true funereal Egyptian cult at the same period. Funereal cults were not common in Crete, but they were practised in certain instances:  at the tombs of dead kings, or possibly of higher officials and kings.&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Sakellarakis."Herakleion Museum.Illustrated guide to the Museum" p 53.Ekdotike Athinon.Athens 1987&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Iconography==
The sacrifice scene may in part be interpreted by the following criteria from classical and archaic Greece used in worshiping two sets of deities, the ouranioi, deities of the heavens, and the chthonioi, earth deities: position of the hands of the worshipers, level of the altar and color of the deity. The position of the hands of the participants is hands down, palms down indicating the deity invoked is a chthonic deity who is the deity in epiphany as a black bird on the betyl behind the low altar, the altar for the chthonioi, who has black color, the color of the chthonioi. The position of the throat of sacrificial animal, the bull, is down indicating the sacrifice is for the chthonioi or chthonic deity. The high altar is reserved for the ouranioi, deities of the heavens. Above the low altar, chthonic altar, are two objects, a jug of water and a basket of fruits of the earth (standard Egyptian icon). The jug of water is for purification of the sacrifice participants who wash their hands before sacrificing the bull. In Classical Greece the offering of fruits of the earth was made to a chthonic deity just as on the Hagia Triada Sarcophagus. On the high altar, altar for the ouranioi, are the horns of consecration and a tree with seven branches. Most often, but not always, the horns of consecration are found in high places in Minoan religious art indicating they related to the ouranioi. The tree, with seven branches, may be a tree representing regeneration and the seven branches is an Egyptian number signifying completeness.
There are seven participants in the sacrifice scene with hands down palms down possibly indicating a forceful prayer or invocation of the chthonic deity behind the low altar
in epiphany. Also, the sacrifice scene has three other elements common in sacrifices in Classical Greece, the presence of a pipe player, incense in the hand of one of the four
rear participants and the jug of water for purification. The time of day of the sacrifice is night because chthonic rituals took place during the night, ouranic rituals took place during the day. The action of both the sacrifice scene and the libation scene moves from left to right. In Egyptian religion, the left was the side of death and right was the side of life.

The libation scene has seven participants giving force to the offering. The two birds in gold color on betyls sit on double axes and are the highest objects in the scene indicating they are deities in epiphany. The blood in the sacrifice scene is transformed into water because it quenches lips of the "thirsty dead" as mentioned in the Pylos Linear B tablets. The dead man (lowest object)receives the "water" as nourishment because the dead did not feed on solid food, but rather on liquids. Therefore, the calves are symbolic food for dead. The stairs in front of the dead man's tomb, an Egyptian concept, allows the spirit of the dead man to ascend into the realm of the living. The tree on a sarcophagus in ancient Egypt represented resurrection or regeneration. &lt;ref&gt;Stewart E Brekke "The Hagia Triada Sarcophagus: Egyptian Influence on Minoan Religion" The Ancient World, Spring 2010, p.155-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of sound recording''' - which has progressed in waves, driven by the invention and commercial introduction of new technologies&amp;nbsp;— can be roughly divided into four main periods:
* the "Acoustic" era, 1877 to 1925
* the "Electrical" era, 1925 to 1945 (including sound on film)
* the "Magnetic" era, 1945 to 1975
* the "Digital" Era, 1975 to the present day.

Experiments in capturing sound on a recording medium for preservation and reproduction began in earnest during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 1800s. Many pioneering attempts to record and reproduce sound were made during the latter half of the 19th century&amp;nbsp;– notably Scott's [[Phonautograph]] of 1857&amp;nbsp;– and these efforts culminated in the invention of the [[phonograph]] by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877. Digital recording emerged in the late 20th century, and has since flourished with the popularity of digital music and online streaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartmanski|first=Dominik|last2=Woodward|first2=Ian|title=The vinyl: The analogue medium in the age of digital reproduction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.proxyau.wrlc.org/doi/full/10.1177/1469540513488403|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1177/1469540513488403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Actor portraying Alexander Graham Bell in an AT&amp;T promotional film (1926).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In the early days of sound recording, acoustic recording devices still used horns instead of microphones. Image displays a mid-1920s re-enactment of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] inventing the telephone]]
===The Acoustic Era (1877 to 1925)===
The earliest practical recording technologies were entirely mechanical devices. These recorders typically used a large conical horn to collect and focus the physical air pressure of the sound waves produced by the human voice or musical instruments. A sensitive membrane or diaphragm, located at the apex of the cone, was connected to an articulated scriber or stylus, and as the changing air pressure moved the diaphragm back and forth, the stylus scratched or incised an [[analog recording|analogue]] of the sound waves onto a moving recording medium, such as a roll of coated paper, or a cylinder or disc coated with a soft material such as [[wax]] or a soft metal. These early recordings were necessarily of low fidelity and volume, and captured only a narrow segment of the audible sound spectrum&amp;nbsp;— typically only from around 250&amp;nbsp;Hz up to about 2,500&amp;nbsp;Hz — so musicians and engineers were forced to adapt to these sonic limitations. Bands of the period often favored louder instruments such as trumpet, cornet and trombone, lower-register brass instruments (such as the tuba and the euphonium) replaced the string bass, and blocks of wood stood in for bass drums; performers also had to arrange themselves strategically around the horn to balance the sound, and to play as loudly as possible. The reproduction of domestic phonographs was similarly limited in both frequency-range and volume. By the end of the acoustic era, the disc had become the standard medium for sound recording, and its dominance in the domestic audio market lasted until the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/history/p20_4_1.html|title=A Brief History of Recording to ca. 1950|website=www.charm.rhul.ac.uk|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Electrical Era (1925 to 1945) (including sound on film)===
[[File:Microphone - Bayernhof Museum - DSC06319.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Ring-and-spring microphones, such as this Western Electric microphone, were common during the electrical age of sound recording c. 1925-1945]]
The 'second wave' of sound recording history was ushered in by the introduction of [[Western Electric]]'s integrated system of electrical microphones, electronic signal amplifiers and electromechanical recorders,&lt;!-- Only the recording heads were installed by WE when a licensee's "disc-cutting machines" were changed over to the new technology; their existing turntables and feed screw mechanisms, typically powered by a weight-driven motor rather than electricity, usually worked well and were not altered --&gt; which was adopted by major US record labels in 1925. Sound recording now became a [[:wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] process&amp;nbsp;— sound could now be captured, amplified, filtered and balanced electronically, and the disc-cutting head was now electrically powered, but the actual recording process remained essentially mechanical&amp;nbsp;– the signal was still physically inscribed into a wax 'master' disc, and consumer discs were mass-produced mechanically by stamping a metal [[Electroforming|electroform]] made from the wax master into a suitable substance, originally a [[shellac]]-based compound and later [[polyvinyl]] plastic. The Western Electric system greatly improved the fidelity of sound recording, increasing the reproducible frequency range to a much wider band (between 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 6000&amp;nbsp;Hz) and allowing a new class of professional&amp;nbsp;– the audio engineer&amp;nbsp;– to capture a fuller, richer and more detailed and balanced sound on record, using multiple microphones connected to multi-channel electronic amplifiers, compressors, filters and [[Mixing console|mixers]]. Electrical microphones led to a dramatic change in the performance style of singers, ushering in the age of the "[[crooner]]", while electronic amplification had a wide-ranging impact in many areas, enabling the development of  broadcast radio, public address systems, and electronically-amplified home record players&lt;!-- "record player" nicely avoids the UK-US "gramophone"-"phonograph" conflict --&gt;. In addition, the development of electronic amplifiers for musical instruments now enabled quieter instruments such as the guitar and the string bass to compete on equal terms with the naturally louder wind and horn instruments, and musicians and composers also began to experiment with entirely new electronic musical instruments such as the [[Theremin]], the [[Ondes Martenot]], the [[electronic organ]], and the Hammond [[Novachord]], the world's first analogue polyphonic [[synthesiser]].

Contemporaneous with these developments, several inventors were engaged in a race to develop practical methods of providing synchronised sound with films. Some early [[sound film]]s&amp;nbsp;— such as the landmark 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''&amp;nbsp;– used [[Vitaphone|large soundtrack records]] which were played on a turntable mechanically interlocked with the [[Movie projector|projector]]. By the early 1930s the movie industry had almost universally adopted [[sound-on-film]] technology, in which the audio signal to be recorded was used to modulate a light source that was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing it to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a "sound track" running along a dedicated area of the film. The projector used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert the variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. The adoption of sound-on-film also helped movie-industry audio engineers to make rapid advances in the process we now know as "multi-tracking", by which multiple separately-recorded audio sources (such as voices, sound effects and background music) can be replayed simultaneously, mixed together, and synchronised with the action on film to create new 'blended' audio tracks of great sophistication and complexity. One of the best-known examples of a 'constructed' composite sound from that era is the famous "[[Tarzan yell]]" created for the series of Tarzan movies starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].

Among the vast and often rapid changes that have taken place over the last century of audio recording, it is notable that there is one crucial audio device, invented at the start of the "Electrical Era", which has survived virtually unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s: the electro-acoustic transducer, or [[loudspeaker]]. The most common form is the [[dynamic loudspeaker]]&amp;nbsp;– effectively a [[dynamic microphone]] in reverse. This device typically consists of a shallow conical diaphragm, usually of a stiff paper-like material concentrically pleated to make it more flexible, firmly fastened at its perimeter, with the coil of a moving-coil electromagnetic driver attached around its apex. When an audio signal from a recording, a microphone, or an electrified instrument is fed through an amplifier to the loudspeaker, the varying electromagnetic field created in the coil causes it and the attached cone to move backward and forward, and this movement generates the audio-frequency pressure waves that travel through the air to our ears, which hear them as sound. Although there have been numerous refinements to the technology, and other related technologies have been introduced (e.g. the [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]), the basic design and function of the dynamic loudspeaker has not changed substantially in 90 years, and it remains overwhelmingly the most common, sonically accurate and reliable means of converting electronic audio signals back into audible sound.

===The Magnetic Era (1945 to 1976)===
[[File:Studer1969.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|During the magnetic era, sound recordings were usually made on magnetic tape before being transferred to other media]]
The third wave of development in audio recording began in 1945, when the allied nations gained access to a new German invention - [[magnetic tape]] recording. The technology was invented in the 1930s, but remained restricted to Germany (where it was widely used in broadcasting) until the end of World War II. Magnetic tape provided another dramatic leap in audio fidelity&amp;nbsp;— indeed, Allied observers first became aware of the existence of the new technology because they noticed that the audio quality of obviously pre-recorded programs was practically indistinguishable from live broadcasts. From 1950 onwards, magnetic tape quickly became the standard medium of audio master recording in the radio and music industries, and led to the development of the first hi-fi [[stereo]] recordings for the domestic market, the development of [[multi-track tape recording]] for music, and the demise of the disc as the primary mastering medium for sound. Magnetic tape also brought about a radical reshaping of the recording process&amp;nbsp;— it made possible recordings of far longer duration and much higher fidelity than ever before, and it offered recording engineers the same exceptional plasticity that film gave to cinema editors&amp;nbsp;— sounds captured on tape could now easily be manipulated sonically, edited, and combined in ways that were simply impossible with disc recordings. These experiments reached an early peak in the 1950s with the recordings of [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]], who pioneered the use of tape editing and "multi-tracking" to create large 'virtual' ensembles of voices and instruments, constructed entirely from multiple taped recordings of their own voices and instruments. Magnetic tape fueled a rapid and radical expansion in the sophistication of popular music and other genres, allowing composers, producers, engineers and performers to realize previously unattainable levels of complexity. Other concurrent advances in audio technology led to the introduction of a range of new consumer audio formats and devices, on both disc and tape, including the development full-frequency-range disc reproduction, the change from shellac to polyvinyl plastic for disc manufacture, the invention of the 33rpm, 12-inch long-playing (LP) disc and the 45rpm 7-inch "single", the introduction of domestic and professional portable tape recorders (which enabled high-fidelity recordings of live performances), the popular [[4-track cartridge]] and [[compact cassette]] formats, and even the world's first "sampling keyboards" - the pioneering tape-based keyboard instrument the [[Chamberlin]], and its more famous successor, the [[Mellotron]].

===The Digital Era (1975 to Present)===
[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In the digital era, audio recording becomes increasingly dominated by [[digital audio workstation]]s (DAW)]]
The fourth and current "phase", the "digital" era, has seen the most rapid, dramatic and far-reaching series of changes in the history of audio recording. In a period of less than 20 years, all previous recording technologies were rapidly superseded by digital sound encoding, which was perfected by the Japanese electronics corporation [[Sony]] in the 1970s. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Unlike all previous technologies, which captured a continuous analogue of the sounds being recorded, digital recording captured sound by means of a very dense and rapid series of discrete  samples of the sound&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

When played back through a digital-to-analogue converter, these audio samples are recombined to form a continuous flow of sound. The first all-digitally-recorded popular music album, [[Ry Cooder]]'s ''[[Bop 'Til You Drop]]'', was released in 1979, and from that point, digital sound recording and reproduction quickly became the new standard at every level, from the professional recording studio to the home hi-fi.

Although a number of short-lived "hybrid" studio and consumer technologies appeared in this period (e.g. Digital Audio Tape or DAT, which recorded digital signal samples onto standard magnetic tape), Sony assured the preeminence of its new digital recording system by introducing, together with Philips, the most advanced consumer audio format to date&amp;nbsp;— the digital [[compact disc]] (CD). The Compact disc rapidly replaced both the 12" album and the 7" single as the new standard consumer format, and ushered in a new era of high-fidelity consumer audio&amp;nbsp;— CDs were small, portable and durable, and they could reproduce the entire audible sound spectrum, with unrestricted dynamic range, perfect clarity and no distortion. Because CDs were encoded and read optically, using a [[laser]] beam, there was no physical contact between the disc and the playback mechanism, so a well-cared-for CD could be played over and over, with absolutely no degradation or loss of fidelity. CDs also represented a considerable advance in both the physical size of the medium, and its storage capacity&amp;nbsp;— LPs could only practically hold about 50 minutes of audio, because they were physically limited by the size of the disc itself and the density of the grooves that could be cut into it&amp;nbsp;— the longer the recording, the closer together the grooves and thus the lower the overall fidelity; CDs, on the other hand they were less than half the overall size of the old 12" LP format, but offered about double the duration of the average LP, with up to 80 minutes of audio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society

The Compact Disc almost totally dominated the consumer audio market by the end of the 20th century, but within another decade, rapid developments in computing technology saw it rendered virtually redundant in just a few years by the most significant new invention in the history of audio recording&amp;nbsp;— the digital audio file (.wav, .mp3 and other formats). When combined with newly developed digital signal compression algorithms, which greatly reduced file sizes, digital audio files rapidly came to dominate the domestic market, thanks to commercial innovations such as Apple's [[iTunes]] media application, and their hugely popular [[iPod]] portable media player.

However, the introduction of digital audio files, in concert with the rapid developments in home computing, soon led to an unforeseen consequence&amp;nbsp;— the widespread unlicensed distribution of audio and other digital media files. The uploading and downloading of large volumes of digital media files at high speed was facilitated by [[freeware]] file sharing technologies such as [[Napster]] and [[BitTorrent]]. The concurrent development of high-volume private data storage networks, combined with rapidly increasing internet signal speeds and continuous improvements in data storage devices, fuelled an explosion in the illegal sharing of copyrighted digital media. This has caused great consternation among record labels and copyright owners such as [[ASCAP]], who have strongly pressured government agencies to make trans-national efforts to shut down data-storage and file-sharing networks, and to prosecute site operators, and even individual downloaders.

Although infringement remains a significant issue for copyright owners, the development of digital audio has had considerable benefits for consumers. In addition to facilitating the high-volume, low-cost transfer and storage of digital audio files, this new technology has also powered an explosion in the availability of so-called "back-catalogue" titles stored in the archives of recording labels, thanks to the fact that labels can now convert old recordings and distribute them digitally at a fraction of the cost of physically reissuing albums on LP or CD. Digital audio has also enabled dramatic improvements in the restoration and remastering of acoustic and pre-digital electric recordings, and even freeware consumer-level digital software can very effectively eliminate scratches, surface noise and other unwanted sonic artefacts from old 78rpm and vinyl recordings and greatly enhance the sound quality of all but the most badly damaged records. In the field of consumer-level digital data storage, the continuing trend towards increasing capacity and falling costs means that consumers can now acquire and store vast quantities of high-quality digital media (audio, video, games and other applications), and build up media libraries consisting of tens or even hundreds of thousands of songs, albums, or videos&amp;nbsp;— collections which, for all but the wealthiest, would have been both physically and financially impossible to amass in such quantities if they were on 78 or LP, yet which can now be contained on storage devices no larger than the average hardcover book.

The Digital Audio File marked the end of one era in recording and the beginning of another. Digital files effectively eliminated the need to create or use a discrete, purpose-made physical recording medium (a disc, or a reel of tape, etc.) as the primary means of capturing, manufacturing and distributing commercial sound recordings. Concurrent with the development of these digital file formats, dramatic advances in home computing and the rapid expansion of the [[Internet]] mean that digital sound recordings can now be captured, processed, reproduced, distributed and stored entirely electronically, on a range of magnetic and optical recording media, and these can be distributed almost anywhere in the world, with no loss of fidelity, and crucially, without the need to first transfer these files to some form of permanent recording medium for shipment and sale.

Music streaming services have gained popularity since the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=8b7c5da7-05b0-4bb1-8a3a-60ca93d18302@sessionmgr4008|title=The Spotify Paradox: How the Creation of a Compulsory License Scheme for St...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streaming audio does not require the listener to download or own the audio files.

==Acoustical recording==
The earliest method of [[sound recording and reproduction]] involved the live recording of a performance directly to a [[recording medium]] by an entirely mechanical process, often called "acoustical recording". In the standard procedure used until the mid-1920s, the [[sound]]s generated by the performance vibrated a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] with a recording [[stylus]] connected to it while the stylus cut a groove into a soft recording medium rotating beneath it. To make this process as efficient as possible, the diaphragm was located at the apex of a hollow cone that served to collect and focus the acoustical energy, with the performers crowded around the other end. Recording balance was achieved empirically. A performer who recorded too strongly or not strongly enough would be moved away from or nearer to the mouth of the cone. The number and kind of instruments that could be recorded were limited. Brass instruments, which recorded well, often substituted instruments such as cellos and bass fiddles, which did not. In some early [[jazz]] recordings, a block of wood was used in place of the [[bass drum]], which could easily overload the recording diaphragm.

===Phonautograph===
{{Main|Phonautograph}}

In 1857, [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]] invented the [[phonautograph]], the first device that could record sound waves as they passed through the air. It was intended only for visual study of the recording and could not play back the sound. The recording medium was a sheet of soot-coated paper wrapped around a rotating cylinder carried on a threaded rod. A [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|stylus]], attached to a diaphragm through a series of levers, traced a line through the soot, creating a graphic record of the motions of the diaphragm as it was minutely propelled back and forth by the audio-frequency variations in air pressure.

In the spring of 1877 another inventor, [[Charles Cros]], suggested that the process could be reversed by using [[photoengraving]] to convert the traced line into a groove that would guide the stylus, causing the original stylus vibrations to be recreated, passed on to the linked diaphragm, and sent back into the air as sound. An inventor from America{{who|date=April 2018}} soon eclipsed this idea, and it was not until 1887 that yet another inventor, [[Emile Berliner]], actually photoengraved a phonautograph recording into metal and played it back.

Scott's early recordings languished in French archives until 2008, when scholars keen to resurrect the sounds captured in these and other types of early experimental recordings tracked them down. Rather than using rough 19th century technology to create playable versions, they were scanned into a computer and software was used to convert their sound-modulated traces into digital audio files. Brief excerpts from two French songs and a recitation in Italian, all recorded in 1860, are the most substantial results.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstsounds.org Information on the recordings and their resurrection direct from the source. Careless reporting and errors abound in many of the secondary and nth-generation accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonograph/Gramophone===
{{See also|Volta Laboratory|Graphophone}}
[[File:EdisonPhonograph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Edison Home Phonograph for recording and playing brown wax cylinders, c. 1899]]

The [[phonograph]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;Kernfeld, Barry. "Recording." Grove Music Online (2007). Oxford Music Online. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; could both record sound and play it back. The earliest type of phonograph sold recorded on a thin sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder. A stylus connected to a sound-vibrated diaphragm indented the foil into the groove as the cylinder rotated. The stylus vibration was at a right angle to the recording surface, so the depth of the indentation varied with the audio-frequency changes in air pressure that carried the sound. This arrangement is known as vertical or "hill-and-dale" recording. The sound could be played back by tracing the stylus along the recorded groove and acoustically coupling its resulting vibrations to the surrounding air through the diaphragm and a so-called "amplifying" horn.

The crude tinfoil phonograph proved to be of little use except as a novelty. It was not until the late 1880s that an improved and much more useful form of phonograph was marketed. The new machines recorded on easily removable [[Phonograph cylinder|hollow wax cylinders]] and the groove was engraved into the surface rather than indented. The targeted use was business communication, and in that context the cylinder format had some advantages. When entertainment use proved to be the real source of profits, one seemingly negligible disadvantage became a major problem: the difficulty of making copies of a recorded cylinder in large quantities.

At first, cylinders were copied by acoustically connecting a playback machine to one or more recording machines through flexible tubing, an arrangement that degraded the audio quality of the copies. Later, a [[pantograph]] mechanism was used, but it could only produce about 25 fair copies before the original was too worn down. During a recording session, as many as a dozen machines could be arrayed in front of the performers to record multiple originals. Still, a single "take" would ultimately yield only a few hundred copies at best, so performers were booked for marathon recording sessions in which they had to repeat their most popular numbers over and over again. By 1902, successful molding processes for manufacturing prerecorded cylinders had been developed.

[[File:Grammofon, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|150px|Spring-motor-powered disc record player, c. 1909]]

The wax cylinder got a competitor with the advent of the Gramophone, which was [[patent]]ed by [[Emile Berliner]] in 1887. The vibration of the Gramophone's recording stylus was horizontal, parallel to the recording surface, resulting in a zig-zag groove of constant depth. This is known as lateral recording. Berliner's original patent showed a lateral recording etched around the surface of a cylinder, but in practice he opted for the disc format. The Gramophones he soon began to market were intended solely for playing prerecorded entertainment discs and could not be used to record. The spiral groove on the flat surface of a disc was relatively easy to replicate: a negative metal [[electrotype]] of the original record could be used to stamp out hundreds or thousands of copies before it wore out. Early on, the copies were made of [[hard rubber]], and sometimes of [[celluloid]], but soon a [[shellac]]-based compound was adopted.

"Gramophone", Berliner's trademark name, was abandoned in the US in 1900 because of legal complications, with the result that in [[American English]] Gramophones and Gramophone records, along with disc records and players made by other manufacturers, were long ago brought under the umbrella term "phonograph", a word which Edison's competitors avoided using but which was never his trademark, simply a generic term he introduced and applied to cylinders, discs, tapes and any other formats capable of carrying a sound-modulated groove. In the UK, proprietary use of the name Gramophone continued for another decade until, in a court case, it was adjudged to have become [[Generic trademark|genericized]] and so could be used freely by competing disc record makers, with the result that in [[British English]] a disc record is called a "gramophone record" and "phonograph record" is traditionally assumed to mean a cylinder.

Not all cylinder records are alike. They were made of various soft or hard waxy formulations or early plastics, sometimes in unusual sizes; did not all use the same groove pitch; and were not all recorded at the same speed. Early brown wax cylinders were usually cut at about 120&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], whereas later cylinders ran at 160&amp;nbsp;rpm for clearer and louder sound at the cost of reduced maximum playing time. As a medium for entertainment, the cylinder was already losing the format war with the disc by 1910, but the production of entertainment cylinders did not entirely cease until 1929 and use of the format for business dictation purposes persisted into the 1950s.

Disc records, too, were sometimes made in unusual sizes, or from unusual materials, or otherwise deviated from the format norms of their eras in some substantial way. The speed at which disc records were rotated was eventually standardized at about 78&amp;nbsp;rpm, but other speeds were sometimes used. Around 1950, slower speeds became standard: 45, 33⅓, and the rarely used 16⅔&amp;nbsp;rpm. The standard material for discs changed from shellac to [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], although vinyl had been used for some special-purpose records since the early 1930s and some 78&amp;nbsp;rpm shellac records were still being made in the late 1950s.

==Electrical recording==
{{Main|Sound recording and reproduction#Electrical recording}}

Until the mid-1920s records were played on purely mechanical record players usually powered by a wind-up spring motor. The sound was "amplified" by an external or internal horn that was coupled to the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] and [[stylus]], although there was no real amplification: the horn simply improved the efficiency with which the diaphragm's vibrations were transmitted into the open air. The recording process was in essence the same non-electronic setup operating in reverse, but with a recording stylus engraving a groove into a soft waxy master disc and carried slowly inward across it by a feed mechanism.

The advent of electrical recording in 1925 made it possible to use sensitive [[microphone]]s to capture the sound and greatly improved the audio quality of records. A much wider range of frequencies could be recorded, the balance of high and low frequencies could be controlled by elementary electronic filters, and the signal could be amplified to the optimum level for driving the recording stylus. The leading [[record label]]s switched to the electrical process in 1925 and the rest soon followed, although one straggler in the US held out until 1929.

There was a period of nearly five years, from 1925 to 1930, when the top "[[audiophile]]" technology for home sound reproduction consisted of a combination of electrically recorded records with the specially-developed [[Victor Orthophonic Victrola]], an acoustic phonograph that used [[waveguide]] engineering and a [[folded horn]] to provide a reasonably flat [[frequency response]]. The first electronically amplified record players reached the market only a few months later, around the start of 1926, but at first they were much more expensive and their audio quality was impaired by their primitive [[loudspeaker]]s; they did not become common until the late 1930s.

Electrical recording increased the flexibility of the process, but the performance was still cut directly to the recording medium, so if a mistake was made the whole recording was spoiled. Disc-to-disc editing was possible, by using multiple turntables to play parts of different "takes" and recording them to a new master disc, but switching sources with split-second accuracy was difficult and lower sound quality was inevitable, so except for use in editing some [[Vitaphone|early sound films]] and [[Transcription disc#Notable uses|radio recordings]] it was rarely done.

Electrical recording made it more feasible to record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts to a second disc. This and conceptually related techniques, known as ''[[overdubbing]]'', enabled studios to create recorded "performances" that feature one or more artists each singing multiple parts or playing multiple instrument parts and that therefore could not be duplicated by the same artist or artists performing live. The first commercially issued records using overdubbing were released by the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in the late 1920s. However overdubbing was of limited use until the advent of [[audio tape]]. Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by [[Les Paul]] in the 1940s.

==Magnetic recording==
{{Main|Magnetic recording}}

===Magnetic wire recording===
{{Main|Magnetic wire recording}}

Wire recording or magnetic wire recording is an analog type of audio storage in which a magnetic recording is made on thin steel or stainless steel wire.

The wire is pulled rapidly across a recording head, which magnetizes each point along the wire in accordance with the intensity and polarity of the electrical audio signal being supplied to the recording head at that instant. By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level.

Magnetic wire recording was replaced by magnetic tape recording, but devices employing one or the other of these media had been more or less simultaneously under development for many years before either came into widespread use. The principles and electronics involved are nearly identical. Wire recording initially had the advantage that the recording medium itself was already fully developed, while tape recording was held back by the need to improve the materials and methods used to manufacture the tape.

Magnetic recording was demonstrated in principle as early as 1898 by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in his [[telegraphone]]. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, [[magnetic tape recording]], involve the use of a magnetized medium which moves with a constant speed past a [[recording head]]. An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal.

With the addition of electronic amplification developed by Curt Stille in the 1920s, the telegraphone evolved into [[wire recording|wire recorders]] which were popular for voice recording and [[dictation machine|dictation]] during the 1940s and into the 1950s. The reproduction quality of wire recorders was significantly lower than that achievable with phonograph disk recording technology. There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire to become tangled or snarled. Splicing could be performed by knotting together the cut wire ends, but the results were not very satisfactory.

On Christmas Day, 1932 the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] first used a steel tape recorder for their broadcasts. The device used was a Marconi-Stille recorder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm|title=The Marconi-Stille|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge and dangerous machine which used steel tape that had sharp edges.  The tape was {{convert|0.1|in|mm}} wide and {{convert|0.003|in|mm}} thick running at {{convert|5|ft/s|m/s}} past the recording and reproducing heads. This meant that the length of tape required for a half-hour programme was nearly {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} and a full reel weighed {{convert|55|lb|kg}}.

===Magnetic tape sound recording===
{{Main|Magnetic tape sound recording}}
[[File:Reelt ubt.jpeg|right|200px|thumb|7" reel of ¼" recording tape, typical of audiophile, consumer and educational use in the 1950s–60s]]

Engineers at [[AEG]], working with the chemical giant [[IG Farben]], created the world's first practical magnetic tape recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. During [[World War II]], an engineer at the [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]] discovered the [[Tape bias|AC biasing]] technique. With this technique, an inaudible high-frequency signal, typically in the range of 50 to 150&amp;nbsp;kHz, is added to the audio signal before being applied to the recording head. Biasing radically improved the sound quality of magnetic tape recordings. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders.

During the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] became aware of radio broadcasts that seemed to be transcriptions (much of this due to the work of [[Richard H. Ranger]]), but their audio quality was indistinguishable from that of a live broadcast and their duration was far longer than was possible with 78 rpm discs. At the end of the war, the Allies captured a number of German [[Magnetophon]] recorders from Radio Luxembourg that aroused great interest. These recorders incorporated all of the key technological features of analogue magnetic recording, particularly the use of high-frequency bias.

Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the [[Brush Development Company]] and its licensee, [[Ampex]]; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by [[Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing]] corporation (now known as 3M).

American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and entertainer [[Bing Crosby]] were key players in the commercial development of magnetic tape. Mullin served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was posted to Paris in the final months of World War II; his unit was assigned to find out everything they could about German radio and electronics, including the investigation of claims that the Germans had been experimenting with high-energy directed radio beams as a means of disabling the electrical systems of aircraft. Mullin's unit soon amassed a collection of hundreds of low-quality magnetic dictating machines, but it was a chance visit to a studio at [[Bad Neuheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] while investigating radio beam rumours that yielded the real prize.

Mullin was given two suitcase-sized AEG 'Magnetophon' high-fidelity recorders and fifty reels of recording tape. He had them shipped home and over the next two years he worked on the machines constantly, modifying them and improving their performance. His major aim was to interest Hollywood studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.

Mullin gave two public demonstrations of his machines, and they caused a sensation among American audio professionals—many listeners  could not believe that what they were hearing was not a live performance. By luck, Mullin's second demonstration was held at [[MGM]] studios in [[Hollywood]] and in the audience that day was [[Bing Crosby|Bing Crosby's]] technical director, Murdo Mackenzie. He arranged for Mullin to meet Crosby and in June 1947 he gave Crosby a private demonstration of his magnetic tape recorders.

Crosby was stunned by the amazing sound quality and instantly saw the huge commercial potential of the new machines. Live music was the standard for American radio at the time and the major [[radio network]]s did not permit the use of disc recording in many programs because of their comparatively poor sound quality. But Crosby disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts, preferring the relaxed atmosphere of the [[recording studio]]. He had asked [[NBC]] to let him pre-record his 1944–45 series on [[transcription disc]]s, but the network refused, so Crosby had withdrawn from live radio for a year, returning for the 1946–47 season only reluctantly.

Mullin's tape recorder came along at precisely the right moment. Crosby realized that the new technology would enable him to pre-record his radio show with a sound quality that equaled live broadcasts, and that these tapes could be replayed many times with no appreciable loss of quality. Mullin was asked to tape one show as a test and was immediately hired as Crosby's chief engineer to pre-record the rest of the series.

Crosby became the first major American music star to use tape to pre-record radio broadcasts, and the first to master commercial recordings on tape. The taped Crosby radio shows were painstakingly edited through tape-splicing to give them a pace and flow that was wholly unprecedented in radio. Mullin even claims to have been the first to use "[[canned laughter]]"; at the insistence of Crosby's head writer, Bill Morrow, he inserted a segment of raucous laughter from an earlier show into a joke in a later show that had not worked well.

Keen to make use of the new recorders as soon as possible, Crosby invested $50,000 of his own money into [[Ampex]], and the tiny six-man concern soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording, revolutionizing radio and recording with its famous Ampex Model 200 tape deck, issued in 1948 and developed directly from Mullin's modified Magnetophones.

===Multitrack recording===
{{Main|Multitrack recording}}

The next major development in magnetic tape was [[multitrack recording]], in which the tape is divided into multiple tracks parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronization. The first development in multitracking was [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound, which divided the recording head into two tracks. First developed by German audio engineers ca. 1943, 2-track recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently. (The first stereo recordings, on disks, had been made in the 1930s, but were never issued commercially.) Stereo (either true, two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many [[pop music]] and [[jazz]] recordings continued to be issued in [[Monaural|monophonic]] sound until the mid-1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who also helped design the famous [[electric guitar]] that [[Gibson Les Paul|bears his name]]. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]], were the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously&amp;nbsp;— that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them.

Multitrack recording was immediately taken up in a limited way by Ampex, who soon produced a commercial 3-track recorder. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings&amp;nbsp;— including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "[[Wall of Sound]]" productions and early [[Motown]] hits&amp;nbsp;— were taped on Ampex 3-track recorders. Engineer [[Tom Dowd]] was among the first to use multitrack recording for popular music production while working for [[Atlantic Records]] during the 1950s.

The next important development was 4-track recording. The advent of this improved system gave recording engineers and musicians vastly greater flexibility for recording and overdubbing, and 4-track was the studio standard for most of the later 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at a technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which several tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still famed for their ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also enabled the development of [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the surround sound technology that has become standard in many modern [[home cinema|home theatre]] systems.

In a professional setting today, such as a studio, [[audio engineer]]s may use 24 tracks or more for their recordings, using one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing and the ability to record multiple tracks revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and bounce down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of magnetic tape as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm [[vinyl record]]s were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on tape, then transferred to disc, with Bing Crosby leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

===Further developments===
Analog magnetic tape recording introduces noise, usually called "[[tape hiss]]", caused by the finite size of the magnetic particles in the tape. There is a direct tradeoff between noise and economics. [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] is increased at higher speeds and with wider tracks, and decreased at lower speeds and with narrower tracks.

By the late 1960s, disk reproducing equipment became so good that audiophiles soon became aware that some of the noise audible on recordings was not surface noise or deficiencies in their equipment, but reproduced tape hiss. A few specialist companies started making "[[direct to disc recording]]s", made by feeding microphone signals directly to a disk cutter (after amplification and mixing), in essence reverting to the pre-War direct method of recording. These recordings never became popular, but they dramatically demonstrated the magnitude and importance of the tape hiss problem.

[[File:Kaseta magnetofonowa ubt.jpeg|thumb|200px|audio cassette]]
Before 1963, when [[Philips]] introduced the [[Compact audio cassette]], almost all tape recording had used the [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] (also called "open reel") format. Previous attempts to package the tape in a convenient cassette that required no threading met with limited success; the most successful was [[8-track cartridge]] used primarily in automobiles for playback only. The Philips Compact audio cassette added much needed convenience to the tape recording format and a decade or so later had begun to dominate the consumer market, although it was to remain lower in quality than open reel formats.

In the 1970s, advances in solid-state electronics made the design and marketing of more sophisticated analog circuitry economically feasible. This led to a number of attempts to reduce tape hiss through the use of various forms of volume compression and expansion, the most notable and commercially successful being several systems developed by [[Dolby Laboratories]]. These systems divided the frequency spectrum into several bands and applied volume [[Dynamic range compression|compression]]/expansion independently to each band (Engineers now often use the term "compansion" to refer to this process). The Dolby systems were very successful at increasing the effective dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of analog audio recording; to all intents and purposes, audible tape hiss could be eliminated. The original [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby A]] was only used in professional recording. Successors found use in both professional and consumer formats; [[Dolby B]] became almost universal for prerecorded music on cassette. Subsequent forms, including [[Dolby C]], (and the short-lived [[Dolby S]]) were developed for home use.

In the 1980s, [[digital recording]] methods were introduced, and analog tape recording was gradually displaced, although it has not disappeared by any means. (Many professional studios, particularly those catering to big-budget clients, use analog recorders for multitracking and/or mixdown.) Digital audio tape never became important as a consumer recording medium partially due to legal complications arising from "[[Copyright infringement#Terminology|piracy]]" fears on the part of the record companies. They had opposed magnetic tape recording when it first became available to consumers, but the technical difficulty of juggling recording levels, overload distortion, and residual tape hiss was sufficiently high that unlicensed reproduction of magnetic tape never became an insurmountable commercial problem. With digital methods, copies of recordings could be exact, and copyright infringement might have become a serious commercial problem. Digital tape is still used in professional situations and the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] variant has found a home in computer data backup applications. Many professional and home recordists now use hard-disk-based systems for recording, burning the final mixes to recordable [[CD]]s (CD-R's).

Most Police horses in the United Kingdom (and elsewhere) still use analogue compact cassette systems to record Police Interviews as it provides a medium less prone to accusations of tampering.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Recording on film==
The first attempts to record sound to an optical medium occurred around 1900. Prior to the use of recorded sound in film, theaters would have live orchestras present during silent films. The musicians would sit in the pit below the screen and would provide the background noise and set the mood for whatever was occurring in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonderstruckthebook.com/essay_silent-to-sound.htm|title=Wonderstruck {{!}} Essays|website=www.wonderstruckthebook.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] applied for a patent to record [[Sound-on-film]], but was ahead of his time. In 1923, [[Lee de Forest]] applied for a patent to record to film; he also made a number of short experimental films, mostly of [[vaudeville]] performers. [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] began releasing sound-on-film newsreels in 1926, the same year that [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Don Juan]]'' with music and [[sound effects]] recorded on discs, as well as a series of short films with fully-[[synchronized sound]] on discs. In 1927, the sound film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' was released; while not the first sound film, it made a tremendous hit and made the public and the film industry realize that sound film was more than a mere novelty.

''The Jazz Singer'' used a process called [[Vitaphone]] that involved synchronizing the projected film to sound recorded on disc. It essentially amounted to playing a phonograph record, but one that was recorded with the best electrical technology of the time. Audiences used to acoustic phonographs and recordings would, in the theatre, have heard something resembling 1950s "[[high fidelity]]".

However, in the days of analog technology, no process involving a separate disk could hold synchronization precisely or reliably. Vitaphone was quickly supplanted by technologies which recorded an optical [[soundtrack]] directly onto the side of the strip of motion picture [[film]]. This was the dominant technology from the 1930s through the 1960s and is still in use {{As of|2013|lc=on}} although the analog soundtrack is being replaced by [[sound-on-film|digital sound on film formats]].

There are two types of synchronised film soundtrack, optical and magnetic. Optical sound tracks are visual renditions of [[sound wave]] forms and provide sound through a light beam and optical sensor within the projector. Magnetic sound tracks are essentially the same as used in conventional analog tape recording.

Magnetic soundtracks can be joined with the moving image but it creates an abrupt discontinuity because of the offset of the audio track relative to the picture. Whether optical or magnetic, the audio pickup must be located several inches ahead of the projection lamp, [[Movie projector shutter|shutter]] and drive [[sprocket]]s. There is usually a [[flywheel]] as well to smooth out the film motion to eliminate the flutter that would otherwise result from the [[negative pulldown]] mechanism. If you have films with a magnetic track, you should keep them away from strong magnetic sources, such as televisions. These can weaken or wipe the magnetic sound signal. Magnetic sound on a [[cellulose acetate film]] base is also more prone to [[vinegar syndrome]] than a film with just the image.{{why?|date=April 2016}}{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Optical-film-soundtrack.svg|thumb|150px|right|A variable density soundtrack (left)and a bi-lateral variable area soundtrack (right)]]
For optical recording on film there are two methods utilized. Variable density recording uses changes in the darkness of the soundtrack side of the film to represent the soundwave. Variable area recording uses changes in the width of a dark strip to represent the soundwave.

In both cases, light that is sent through the part of the film that corresponds to the soundtrack changes in intensity, proportional to the original sound, and that light is not projected on the screen but converted into an electrical signal by a light sensitive device.

Optical soundtracks are prone to the same sorts of degradation that affect the picture, such as scratching and copying.

Unlike the film image that creates the illusion of continuity, soundtracks are continuous. This means that if film with a combined soundtrack is cut and spliced, the image will cut cleanly but the sound track will most likely produce a cracking sound. Fingerprints on the film may also produce cracking or interference.

In the late 1950s, the cinema industry, desperate to provide a theatre experience that would be overwhelmingly superior to television, introduced [[widescreen#film|widescreen]] processes such as [[Cinerama]], [[Todd-AO]] and [[CinemaScope]]. These processes at the same time introduced technical improvements in sound, generally involving the use of multitrack ''magnetic sound'', recorded on an oxide stripe laminated onto the film. In subsequent decades, a gradual evolution occurred with more and more theatres installing various forms of magnetic-sound equipment.

In the 1990s, [[digital electronics|digital]] audio systems were introduced and began to prevail. In some of them the sound recording is again recorded on a separate disk, as in Vitaphone; others use a digital, [[optical sound]] track on the film itself. Digital processes can now achieve reliable and perfect synchronization.

==Digital recording==
[[File:Dat cartridge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The DAT or Digital Audio Tape]]The first [[digital audio]] recorders were reel-to-reel decks introduced by companies such as Denon (1972), Soundstream (1979) and Mitsubishi. They used a digital technology known as [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] recording. Within a few years, however, many studios were using devices that encoded the digital audio data into a standard video signal, which was then recorded on a [[U-matic]] or other videotape recorder, using the rotating-head technology that was standard for video. A similar technology was used for a consumer format, [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) which used rotating heads on a narrow tape contained in a cassette. DAT records at sampling rates of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz, the latter being the same rate used on compact discs. Bit depth is 16 bits, also the same as compact discs. DAT was a failure in the consumer-audio field (too expensive, too finicky, and crippled by anti-copying regulations), but it became popular in studios (particularly home studios) and radio stations. A failed digital tape recording system was the [[Digital Compact Cassette]] (DCC).

Within a few years after the introduction of digital recording, multitrack recorders (using stationary heads) were being produced for use in professional studios. In the early 1990s, relatively low-priced multitrack digital recorders were introduced for use in home studios; they returned to recording on videotape. The most notable of this type of recorder is the [[ADAT]]. Developed by [[Alesis]] and first released in 1991, the ADAT machine is capable of recording 8 tracks of digital audio onto a single [[S-VHS]] video cassette. The ADAT machine is still a very common fixture in professional and home studios around the world.

In the consumer market, tapes and gramophones were largely displaced by the [[compact disc]] (CD) and a lesser extent the [[minidisc]]. These recording media are fully digital and require complex electronics to play back.

[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interference colours on a compact disc.]]

Digital sound [[Computer file|files]] can be stored on any [[computer storage]] medium. The development of the [[MP3]] audio file format, and legal issues involved in copying such files, has driven most of the innovation in music distribution since their introduction in the late 1990s.

As [[hard disk]] capacities and computer [[CPU speed]]s increased at the end of the 1990s, [[hard disk recorder|hard disk recording]] became more popular. As of early 2005 hard disk recording takes two forms. One is the use of standard desktop or laptop computers, with adapters for encoding audio into two or many tracks of digital audio. These adapters can either be in-the-box soundcards or external devices, either connecting to in-box interface cards or connecting to the computer via USB or Firewire cables. The other common form of hard disk recording uses a dedicated recorder which contains analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as one or two removable hard drives for data storage. Such recorders, packing 24 tracks in a few units of rack space, are actually single-purpose computers, which can in turn be connected to standard computers for editing.

== The revival of vinyl ==
Vinyl records, or long playing (LP) records, have become popular again as a way to consume music despite the rise of digital media. Over 15 million units were sold between 2008 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartmanski|first=Dominik|last2=Woodward|first2=Ian|date=2015-03-01|title=The vinyl: The analogue medium in the age of digital reproduction|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1469540513488403|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1177/1469540513488403|issn=1469-5405}}&lt;/ref&gt;, their sales reaching the highest level in 2012 since 1993. Popular artists have begun releasing their albums on vinyl, and stores such as Urban Outfitters and Whole Foods have started selling them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/16/vinyl-sales-record-store-day/|title=Vinyl Sales Are Not Just a Hipster Thing Anymore|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music corporations, such as Sony, have started manufacturing LP for the first time since 1989 as this medium becomes more popular. However, some companies are facing production problems as there are only 16 record plants currently functioning in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/04/17/400364697/solving-the-vinyl-comebacks-big-problem-one-antique-machine-at-a-time|title=Solving The Vinyl Comeback's Big Problem, One Antique Machine At A Time|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
==Technique==
The analog [[tape recorder]] made it possible to erase or record over a previous recording so that mistakes could be fixed. Another advantage of recording on tape is the ability to cut the tape and join it back together. This allows the recording to be edited. Pieces of the recording can be removed, or rearranged. See also [[audio engineering|audio editing]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]], [[multitrack recording]].

&lt;!-- Mention [[multitrack recording]] here. --&gt;
The advent of [[electronic instrument]]s (especially [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[synthesizer]]s), effects and other instruments has led to the importance of [[MIDI]] in recording. For example, using [[MIDI timecode]], it is possible to have different equipment 'trigger' without direct human intervention at the time of recording.

In more recent times, computers ([[digital audio workstation]]s) have found an increasing role in the [[recording studio]], as their use eases the tasks of [[cutting]] and [[loop (music)|looping]], as well as allowing for instantaneous changes, such as duplication of parts, the addition of effects and the rearranging of parts of the recording.

'''Holmes Rolston III''' (born November 19, 1932) is a philosopher who is University Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Colorado State University]]. He is best known for his contributions to [[environmental ethics]] and the [[relationship between science and religion]]. Among other honors, Rolston won the 2003 [[Templeton Prize]], awarded by [[Prince Philip]] in [[Buckingham Palace]].  He gave the [[Gifford Lectures]], [[University of Edinburgh]], 1997–1998.

The [[Darwinian]] model is used to define the main thematic concepts in Rolston's philosophy and, in greater depth, the general trend of his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index226.html Afeissa, H.

=== Holmes Rolston 1900-1977 ===


Holmes Rolston (1900-1977), father of Holmes Rolston III, was the Editor-in-Chief of the Presbyterian Church Board of Christian Education, in the United States, Richmond, Virginia between 1949 and 1969, and a widely published author of curriculum materials in Christian education. See ''Richmond (Virginia) Times-Dispatch Archive.'' 1977, November, p. 16. Richmond Times Dispatch Link: [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives/?p_product=HA-VARTD&amp;p_action=keyword&amp;p_theme=histpaper#coverageMap Richmond Times Dispatch archive]

He gave the Sprunt Lectures, Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Series XXXI 1941-1942, published as ''The Social Message of the Apostle Paul'' (John Knox Press, 1942). He also wrote a number of books on personalities in the Bible, for example: ''Faces about the Christ'' (John Knox Press, 1959) and ''Personalities Around David'' (John Knox Press, 1968). See ''Who's Who in America'', 39th ed., 1976-1977.

'''ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 Computer graphics, image processing and environmental data representation''' is a [[standardization]] subcommittee of the joint subcommittee [[ISO/IEC JTC1|ISO/IEC JTC 1]] of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which develops and facilitates standards within the field of [[computer graphics]], [[image processing]], and environmental data representation. The international [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 is the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) located in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=countries&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2013-11-07| author=ISO| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=45252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=analysis&gt;{{cite journal| title=Standards Analysis: ICT Sector| author=ILNAS| accessdate=2014-07-14| url=http://www.portail-qualite.public.lu/fr/publications/confiance-numerique/etudes-nationales/Pub-standards-analysis-ict-v3-0/standards-analysis-ict-sector-march-2014.pdf| version=3| pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 was formed in 1987 from ISO/TC 97 as a result of Resolution 21 at the ISO/IEC JTC 1 plenary. The group’s origins began in computer graphics, the standardization of which was originally under ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2. However, when ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 was created, the standardization activity of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2 was carried over to the new subcommittee.&lt;ref name=PHIGS&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Robert Albert Hopgood|author2=David A. Duce|title=A primer for PHIGS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYlRAAAAMAAJ|date=1 August 1991|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-93043-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial five working groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 were titled, “Architecture,” “Application programming interfaces,” “[[Metafile]]s and [[interface (computing)|interfaces]],” “[[Language binding]]s,” and “Validation, testing and registration.” The work of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 began with the [[Graphical Kernel System]] (GKS), which was adopted from ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 21/WG 2. However, since GKS only addressed 2D functionality, attention turned to the standardization of 3D functionality. This resulted in two standards being published: GKS-3D in 1988 and PHIGS in 1989, both of which addressed 3D functionality.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Since 1991, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 has held plenaries in a number of countries, including the Netherlands, Germany, United States, France, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Korea, United Kingdom, Australia, and Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 Standing Document No. 2: History| year=2012| edition=2| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The scope of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 is the “Standardization of interfaces for information technology based applications relating to”:&lt;ref name=analysis/&gt;&lt;ref name=business2012&gt;{{cite report| url=http://jtc1info.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SC-24-Business-Plan-2012.pdf| accessdate=2013-11-07| author1=Kimn, Ha Jine| author2=Whitlock, Charles| date=2012-10-16| title=SC 24 Business Plan for the Period 2012-2013| type=Business Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=General Information About JTC 1 SC 24| date=2007-11-13| author=British Standards Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 Business Plan for 2014-15| author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24| date=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 is made up of four active working groups, each of which carries out specific tasks in standards development within the field of computer graphics, image processing and environmental data representation. As a response to changing standardization needs, working groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 can be disbanded if their area of work is no longer applicable, or established if new working areas arise. The focus of each working group is described in the group’s terms of reference. Active working groups of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 are:&lt;ref name=analysis/&gt;&lt;ref name=business2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=ISO| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=45252| accessdate=2013-11-07| title=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfgang&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolfgang Kresse|author2=David M.

'''Industrial engineering''' is an inter-disciplinary profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex [[process (engineering)|processes]], [[system]]s, or [[organizations]] by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy and materials&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Salvendy, Gabriel. Handbook of Industrial Engineering. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc; 3rd edition p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;.     

Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in business administration, management, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems or processes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  From these results, they are able to create new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of man, materials and machines and improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iienet2.org/details.aspx?id=716|title=What IEs Do|website=www.iienet2.org|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Depending on the sub-specialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, [[operations research]], [[systems engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[production engineering]], [[management science]], [[management engineering]], [[financial engineering]], [[ergonomics]] or [[human factors engineering]], [[safety engineering]], or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user.   

Even though its underlying concepts overlap considerably with certain business-oriented disciplines, such as [[operations management]], Industrial engineering is a longstanding engineering discipline subject to (and eligible for) [[professional engineering]] licensure in most jurisdictions.   

== History ==
{{See also|List of industrial engineers}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

=== Origins ===
==== Industrial Revolution ====
There is a general consensus among historians that the roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4-1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Specialization of labor ====
[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]
Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

==== Interchangeable parts ====
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

=== Pioneers ===
[[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] (1856 – 1915) is generally credited as being the father of the Industrial Engineering discipline.  He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Steven's University and earned several patents from his inventions.  His books, ''Shop Management'' and ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]'' which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of Industrial Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ingenieroindustrialpro.com/ All about industrial engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;  Improvements in work efficiency under his methods was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and reduction in time required to carry out the work.  With an abiding faith in the scientific method, Taylor's contribution to "Time Study" sought a high level of precision and predictability for manual tasks.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

The husband-and-wife team of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]] (1868 – 1924) and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] (1878 – 1972) was the other cornerstone of the Industrial Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering.  They categorized the elements of human motion into 18 basic elements called ''therbligs''.  This development permitted analysts to design jobs without knowledge of the time required to do a job. These developments were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or ergonomics.&lt;ref name=Maynard-Zandin /&gt;

in 1908, the first course on Industrial Engineering was offered as an elective at [[Pennsylvania State University]], which became a separate program in 1909 through the efforts of [[Hugo Diemer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://industryengineering08.blogspot.com/2012/04/industrial-engineering-definition.html|title=Industrial Engineering - Definition, Explanation, History, and Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by [[Cornell University]].

In 1912 [[Henry Laurence Gantt]] developed the [[Gantt chart]] which outlines actions the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form familiar to us today by [[Henry Wallace Clark|Wallace Clark]].

Assembly lines: moving car factory of [[Henry Ford]] (1913) accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare ("welfare capitalism") and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity.

Comprehensive quality management system ([[Total quality management]] or TQM) developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part of the recovery of Japan after the war.

The [[Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers|American Institute of Industrial Engineering]] was formed in 1948. The early work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] as interest grew from merely improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing process; most notably starting with the presentation by [[Henry R. Towne]] (1844 - 1924) of his paper ''The Engineer as An Economist'' (1186).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsof07amer#page/428/mode/2up Engineer as Economist]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern practice ===
In 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), you can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity.  These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility.   Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.

=== Compared to other engineering disciplines ===
Engineering is traditionally decompositional. To understand the whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts and puts them back together, becoming the master of the whole.
Industrial and systems engineering's (ISE) approach is the opposite; any one part cannot be understood without the context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the role of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people understand the parts first, then they can understand the whole. In ISE, they understand the whole first, and then they can understand the role of each part.

Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that influence the entire situation&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehrer|first=Robert|date=|title=The Nature of Industrial Engineering|url=|journal=The Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=5|pages=4|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while other engineering disciplines focuses on the design of inanimate objects 

"Industrial Engineers integrate combinations of people, information, materials, and equipment that produce innovative and efficient organizations. In addition to manufacturing, Industrial Engineers work and consult in every industry, including hospitals, communications, e-commerce, entertainment, government, finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sales, accounting, banking, travel, and transportation."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&amp;context=imsefacpub|title=DETAILS AND DESCRIPTION OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING|last=Savory|first=Paul|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

" Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management. One of the main focuses of an Industrial Engineer is to improve the working environments of people – not to change the worker, but to change the workplace."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"All engineers, including Industrial Engineers, take mathematics through calculus and differential equations. Industrial Engineering is different in that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is based on continuous variable math. We emphasize the use of linear algebra and difference equations, as opposed to the use of differential equations which are so prevalent in other engineering disciplines. This emphasis becomes evident in optimization of production systems in which we are sequencing orders, scheduling batches, determining the number of materials handling units, arranging factory layouts, finding sequences of motions, etc. As, Industrial Engineers, we deal almost exclusively with systems of discrete components."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
== Etymology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

===Etymology===
While originally applied to [[manufacturing]], the use of "industrial" in "industrial engineering" can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. In fact, the "Industrial" in Industrial engineering means the "industry" in its broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Darwish|first=H|last2=van Dyk|first2=L|date=2016|title=The industrial engineering identity: from historic skills to modern values, duties, and roles|url=http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2224-78902016000300006|journal=South African Journal of Industrial Engineering|volume=27|issue=3|pages=50-63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have changed the term "industrial" to broader terms such as Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research, Industrial Engineering &amp; Management. 
== Sub-disciplines ==
Industrial engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are industrial engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them such as Supply Chain and Logistics, and Facilities and Energy Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wonderfulengineering.com/what-is-industrial-engineering/|title=What is Industrial Engineering?|last=|first=|date=|website=Wonderful Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Systems_Engineering_and_Industrial_Engineering|title=Industrial Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mechanics]] (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), [[materials science]], [[computer science]], electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work - which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses | title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/ | title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG) | publisher=University of California, Berkeley | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses | title=Courses | publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/ | title=Courses | publisher=Northwestern University | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html | title=ISE Electives | publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

=== Differences in Teaching ===
While Industrial Engineering as a formal degree has been around for years, consensus on what topics should be taught and studied differs across countries. For example, Turkey focuses on a very technical degree while Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom have a management focus degree, thus making it less technical.  The United States focuses on case-studies and group problem solving&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bachelorsportal.com/articles/636/what-is-industrial-engineering-and-why-should-i-study-it.html|title=What is Industrial Engineering and Why Should I Study It?|last=Oanca|first=Alexandra|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Practicing Engineers ==
Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[computer programming|coding]] skills).

The cavity is filled with concrete to create the permanent wall.]]
'''Insulating concrete form''' or '''insulated concrete form''' (ICF) is a system of [[formwork]] for [[reinforced concrete]] usually made with a rigid [[thermal insulation]] that stays in place as a permanent interior and exterior substrate for walls, floors, and roofs. The forms are interlocking modular units that are dry-stacked (without [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]) and filled with [[concrete]]. The units lock together somewhat like [[Lego]] bricks and create a form for the structural walls or floors of a building. ICF construction has become commonplace for both low rise commercial and high performance residential construction as more stringent energy efficiency and natural disaster resistant [[building code]]s are adopted. ICFs may be used with frost protected shallow foundations (FPSF).

==Development==
The ICF construction technique was first developed in Europe following [[World War II]] as an inexpensive and durable way to rebuild damaged structures. The first patent for an insulated stay-in-place formwork for concrete was registered in the early 1940s using recycled waste wood and cement as the insulating material. This patent was registered by August Schnell and Alex Bosshard in Switzerland. The first polystyrene ICF forms were developed in the late 1960s with the expiration of the original patent and the advent of modern foam plastics. Canadian contractor Werner Gregori filed the first patent for a foam concrete form in 1966 with a block "measuring 16 inches high by 48 inches long with a tongue-and-groove interlock, metal ties, and a waffle-grid core."&lt;ref name="icfhistory"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.icfmag.com/articles/features/history_of_icfs.html
|title=History of ICFs
|first= 
|last= 
|authorlink=
|publisher= ICF Mag

|accessdate=8 June 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of ICF construction has steadily increased since the 1970s, though it was initially hampered by lack of awareness, building codes, and confusion caused by many different manufacturers selling slightly different ICF designs rather than focusing on industry [[standardization]]. ICF construction is now part of most building codes and accepted in most jurisdictions in the developed world.

==Construction==
Insulating concrete forms are manufactured from any of the following materials:

*[[Polystyrene|Polystyrene foam]] (most commonly expanded or extruded)
*[[Polyurethane|Polyurethane foam]] (including soy-based foam)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbuildingsolutions.org/s_greenbuilding/doc.asp?CID=2150&amp;DID=9058 |title=Forms and Function |first=Brian |last=Haefs |publisher=American Chemistry Council, Inc. |work=Green Building Solutions |accessdate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407123201/http://www.greenbuildingsolutions.org/s_greenbuilding/doc.asp?CID=2150&amp;DID=9058 |archivedate=2010-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cement-bonded wood fiber]]
*Cement-bonded polystyrene beads
*[[Types of concrete#Cellular concrete|Cellular concrete]]

Reinforcing steel bars ([[rebar]]) are usually placed inside the forms before concrete is poured to give the concrete [[flexural strength]], similar to bridges and high-rise buildings made of reinforced concrete. Like other concrete formwork, the forms are filled with concrete in 1-foot to 4-foot high "lifts" to manage the concrete pressure and reduce the risk of blowouts.

After the concrete has cured, the forms are left in place permanently to provide a variety of benefits, depending on materials used:
* [[Thermal insulation]]
* [[Soundproofing]]
* Good [[Surface burning characteristics rating]]
* Space to run [[electrical conduit]] and [[plumbing]]. The form material on either side of the walls can easily accommodate electrical and plumbing installations.
* Backing for [[drywall]] or other finishes on the interior and [[stucco]], brick, or other siding on the exterior
* Improved [[indoor air quality]]
* Regulated humidity levels and mitigated mold growth (hygric buffer)

==Categorization==
Insulating concrete forms are commonly categorized in two manners.  Organizations whose first concern relates to the concrete classify them first by the shape of the concrete inside the form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cement.org/think-harder-concrete-/homes/building-systems/insulated-concrete-forms |title=Insulating Concrete Forms |publisher=The Portland Cement Association |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concretebuildings.org/icf/faq.html |title=Commercial Construction Concrete Buildings, Design for Tilt Up and ICF |publisher=The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations whose first concern relates to the fabrication of the forms classify them first by the characteristics of the forms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forms.org/index.cfm/ICFtypes |title=Types of ICF |publisher=The Expanded PolyStyrene – Industry Alliance |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By concrete shape===

====Flat Wall System====
For Flat Wall System ICFs, the concrete has the shape of a flat wall of solid reinforced concrete, similar to the shape of a concrete wall constructed using removable forms.

====Grid System====

=====Screen Grid System=====
For Screen Grid System ICFs, the concrete has the shape of the metal in a screen, with horizontal and vertical channels of reinforced concrete separated by areas of solid form material.

=====Waffle Grid System=====
For Waffle Grid System ICFs, the concrete has the shape of a hybrid between Screen Grid and Flat Wall system concrete, with a grid of thicker reinforced concrete and having thinner concrete in the center areas where a screen grid would have solid ICF material.

====Post and Lintel System====
For Post and Lintel System ICFs, the concrete has a horizontal member, called a [[lintel]], only at the top of the wall (Horizontal concrete at the bottom of the wall is often present in the form of the building's footer or the lintel of the wall below.) and vertical members, called posts, between the lintel and the surface on which the wall is resting.

===By form characteristic===

====Block====
For Block ICFs, the exterior shape of the ICF is similar to that of a [[Concrete masonry unit]], although ICF blocks are often larger in size as they are made from a material having a lower specific gravity.  Very frequently, the edges of block ICFs are made to interlock, reducing or eliminating the need for the use of a bonding material between the blocks.

====Panel====
Panel ICFs have the flat rectangular shape of a section of flat wall they are often the height of the wall and have a width limited by the manipulability of the material at larger sizes and by the general usefulness of the panel size for constructing walls.

====Plank====
Plank ICFs have the size of Block ICFs in one dimension and Panel ICFs in the other dimension.

==Characteristics==

===Energy efficiency===
* Minimal, if any, air leaks, which improves comfort and reduces heat loss compared to walls without a solid [[air barrier]]
* High [[thermal resistance]] ([[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]) typically above 3 K·m²/W (in American customary units: R-17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11640
 | title = Insulating Concrete Forms
 | work = EERE Consumer's Guide
 | publisher = U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;); this results in saving energy compared with uninsulated masonry (see [[R-value (insulation)#Example values|comparison]])
* Continuous insulation without [[thermal bridge]]s or "insulation gaps", as is common in framed construction 
* [[Thermal mass]], when used well and combined with passive solar design, can play an important role in further reductions in energy use, especially in climates where it's common to have outside temperatures swing above inside temperatures during the day and below at night.

===Strength===
* Insulating concrete forms create a structural concrete wall, either monolithic or post and beam, that is up to ten times stronger than wood framed structures.
* Structural integrity for better resistance to forces of nature, compared to framed walls.
* The components of ICF systems&amp;nbsp;— both the poured concrete and the material used to make the ICF&amp;nbsp;— do not rot when they get wet.
* Insulating concrete forms structural system, if used in high seismic risk zones, has an acceptable ductility.&lt;ref name=Asadi&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asadi |first=Pouria |date=March 2016 |title=Response modification factor due to ductility of screen-grid ICF wall system in high seismic risk zones |journal=KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering|issn=1226-7988 |doi=10.1007/s12205-016-0083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound absorption===
ICF walls have much lower rates of [[acoustic transmission]]. Standard thickness ICF walls have shown sound transmission coefficients (STC) between 46 and 72 compared to 36 for standard fiberglass insulation and drywall. The level of sound attenuation achieved is a function of wall thickness, mass, component materials and air tightness.

===Fire protection===
ICF walls can have four- to six-hour fire resistance rating and negligible surface burning properties. It is worth pointing out that the International Building Code: 2603.5.2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/ibc/2012/icod_ibc_2012_26_sec003_par021.htm |title=Chapter 26 – Plastic |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084325/http://publicecodes.cyberregs.com/icod/ibc/2012/icod_ibc_2012_26_sec003_par021.htm |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires plastic foam insulation (e.g. Polystyrene foam, Polyurethane foam) to be separated from the building interior by a thermal barrier (e.g. [[drywall]]), regardless of the fire barrier provided by the central concrete. Forms made from cement bonded – wood fibers (eg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://durisolbuild.com/Webdocs/Durisol%20Material%20Properties.pdf |title=Property Value Units Test Standard – Durisol Material Properties |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;), polystyrene beads (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastra.com/technicaldata.html |title=Rastra Technical Data |accessdate=2014-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.performwall.com/testing.sstg |title=Performwall Panel System Testing |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610031124/http://www.performwall.com/testing.sstg |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), or air (i.e. cellular concrete – e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greisel.de/Cellular-concrete-sh.93972.0.html?&amp;L=2 |title=Greisel Klimanorm:Cellular Concrete shows what it is made of in the event of a fire |accessdate=2014-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083645/http://www.greisel.de/Cellular-concrete-sh.93972.0.html?&amp;L=2 |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) have a fire rating inherently.

===Indoor air quality===
Because they are generally constructed without a sheet plastic vapor barrier, ICF walls can regulate humidity levels, mitigate the potential for mold and facilitate a more comfortable interior while maintaining high thermal performance.  Foams, however, can give off gasses, something that is not well studied.

=== Environmental sensitivity ===
ICF walls can be made with a variety of recycled materials that can minimize the environmental impact of the building.  The large volume of concrete used in ICF walls has been criticized, as concrete production is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Mahasenan, Natesan; Steve Smith; Kenneth Humphreys; Y. Kaya (2003). "The Cement Industry and Global Climate Change: Current and Potential Future Cement Industry CO2 Emissions". Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies – 6th International Conference. Oxford: Pergamon. pp. 995–1000. doi:10.1016/B978-008044276-1/50157-4. {{ISBN|978-0-08-044276-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermin===
Because the entire interior space of ICF walls is continuously occupied (no gaps as can occur between blown or fiberglass insulation and a wood frame wall) they pose more difficulty for casual transit by insects and vermin. Additionally, while plastic foam forms can occasionally be tunneled through, interior concrete wall, and the Portland cement of cement-bonded type forms create a much more challenging barrier to insects and vermin than do walls made of wood.

==Building design considerations==
When designing a building to be constructed with ICF walls, consideration must be given to supporting the weight of any walls not resting directly on other walls or the building's foundation. Consideration must also be given to the understanding that the load bearing part of an ICF wall is the concrete, which, without special preparations, does not extend in any direction to the edge of the form. For grid and post &amp; lintel systems, the placement of vertical members of the concrete must be organized in such a fashion (e.g., starting at opposite corners or breaks (e.g. doorways) and working to meet in unbroken wall) as to properly transfer load from the lintel (or bond beam) to the surface supporting the wall.

==Building process==
ICF construction is less demanding, owing to its [[modularity]]. Less-skilled labor can be employed to lay the ICF forms, though careful consideration must be made when pouring the concrete to make sure it consolidates fully and [[Curing (chemistry)|cures]] evenly without cracking. Unlike traditional wood beam construction, no additional structural support other than temporary [[scaffolding]] is required for openings, doors, windows, or utilities, though modifying the structure after the concrete cures requires special concrete cutting tools.

===Floors and foundations===
ICF walls are conventionally placed on a [[concrete slab|monolithic slab]] with embedded rebar [[Dowel#In stonemasonry|dowels]] connecting the walls to the foundation.

ICF decking is becoming an increasingly popular addition to general ICF wall construction. ICF decking weighs up to 40% less than standard concrete flooring and provides superior insulation. ICF decking can also be designed in conjunction with ICF walls to form a continuous monolithic structure joined together by rebar. ICF deck roofs are popular in storm-areas&lt;ref&gt;Resilient, Insulated Roofs with Concrete http://www.insuldeck.com/resilient-insulated-roofs/ retrieved 2018-08-16&lt;/ref&gt;, but it is harder to build complex roof shapes and concrete can be poured only up to a point on angled surfaces, often 7:12 maximum pitch.&lt;ref name = "Panushev, p. 58"&gt;Panushev, Ivan S.; Pieter A. Vanderwerf (2004). Insulating Concrete Forms Construction. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-143057-1}}."&gt; Panushev, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walls===
ICF walls are constructed one row at a time, usually starting at the corners and working toward the middle of the walls. End blocks are then cut to fit so as to waste the least material possible. As the wall rises, blocks are staggered to avoid long vertical seams that can weaken the polystyrene formwork.&lt;ref name = "Panushev, p. 80"&gt;Panushev, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;  Structure frames known as ''bucks'' are placed around openings to give added strength to the openings and to serve as attachment points for windows and doors.

Interior and exterior finishes and facades are affixed directly to the ICF surface or tie ends, depending on the type of ICF.  Brick and masonry facades require an extended ledge or shelf angle at the main floor level, but otherwise no modifications are necessary. Interior ICF polystyrene wall surfaces must be covered with drywall panels or other wall coatings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icfmag.com/articles/features/icf_interior_finishes.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the first months immediately after construction, minor problems with interior humidity may be evident as the concrete cures, which can damage the drywall. Dehumidification can be accomplished with small residential dehumidifiers or using the building's air conditioning system.

Depending on the experience of the contractor and their quality of work, improperly installed exterior foam insulation could be easy access for groundwater and insects. To help prevent these problems, some manufacturers make insecticide-treated foam blocks and promote installation of drainage sheeting and other methods for waterproofing.  Drain tiles are installed to eliminate water.

===Plumbing and electrical===
Plumbing and [[electrical conduit]] can be placed inside the forms and poured into place, though [[settling]] problems could cause pipes to break, creating costly repairs. For this reason, plumbing and conduit as well as electrical cables are usually embedded directly into the foam before the wall coverings are applied. A hot knife or electric chainsaw is commonly used to create openings in the foam to lay piping and cabling. electrical cables are inserted into the ICF using a [[Cable Punch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cable Punch|url=http://journeymantools.com/cable-punch/|website=JourneymanTools|publisher=Journeyman Tools|accessdate=20 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620230034/http://journeymantools.com/cable-punch/|archivedate=20 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ICFs made from other materials are typically cut or [[Router (woodworking)|routed]] with simple carpentry tools. Versions of simple carpentry tools suitable for cement-bonded type forms are made for similar use with [[autoclaved aerated concrete]].

==Cost==
The initial cost of using ICFs rather than conventional construction techniques is sensitive to the price of materials and labor, but building using ICF may add 3 to 5 percent to the total purchase price over building using wood frame.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/destech/icfbenefits.html&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases ICF construction will cost about 40% less than conventional (basement) construction because of the labor savings from combining multiple steps into one step. Above grade, ICF construction is typically more expensive, but when adding large openings, ICF construction becomes very cost effective. Large openings in conventional construction require large headers and supporting posts, whereas ICF construction reduces the cost, as only reinforcing steel is needed directly around the opening.

ICF construction can allow up to 60% smaller heating and cooling units to service the same floor area, which can cut the cost of the final house by an estimated $0.75 per square foot. So, the estimated net extra cost can be as much as $0.25 to $3.25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concretebuildings.org/ICF%20financial.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801234542/http://www.concretebuildings.org/ICF%20financial.html |archivedate=2010-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.concretenetwork.com/concrete-homes/cost.html&lt;/ref&gt; ICF homes can also qualify for [[tax credit]]s, further lowering the costs.

ICF buildings are less expensive over time, as they require less energy to heat and cool the same size space compared to a variety of other common construction methods. Additionally, [[insurance]] costs can be much lower, as ICF homes are much less susceptible to damage from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, fires, and other natural disasters. Maintenance and upkeep costs are also lessened, as ICF buildings do not contain wood, which can rot over time or be attacked by insects and rodents.&lt;ref name = "pan16"&gt;Panushev, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and drawbacks==
In seismic and hurricane-prone areas, ICF construction provides strength, impact-resistance, durability, excellent sound insulation, and airtightness. ICF construction is ideal in moderate and mixed climates with significant daily temperature variations, in buildings designed to benefit from [[thermal mass]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;["The homeowner’s handbook to energy efficiency, p. 166"], John Krigger and Chris Dorsi&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Insulating R-Value alone ([[R-value (insulation)|R-value]]) of ICFs range from R-12 to R-28, which can be a good R-value for walls.&lt;ref&gt;[American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation: C976]&lt;/ref&gt; The energy savings compared to framed walls is in a range of 50% to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;["The ICF Effect"] ICFA access at http://www.forms.org/images/cmsIT/fckeditorfile/ICFA%20Tech%20-%20ICF%20Effect(1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;    &lt;ref&gt; "Energy Comparisons of Concrete Homes vs Wood Frame Homes"], RP119 Vanderwerf &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Las Campanas [[Redshift survey|Redshift Survey]]''' is considered the first attempt to map a large area of the universe out to a [[redshift]] of ''z'' = 0.2. It was begun in 1991 using the [[Las Campanas Observatory|Las Campanas telescope]] in [[Chile]] to catalog 26418 separate galaxies.&lt;ref name="utoronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qold.astro.utoronto.ca/~lin/lcrs.html|publisher=qold.astro.utoronto.ca|title=The Las Campanas Redshift Survey|accessdate=2016-12-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630215300/http://qold.astro.utoronto.ca/~lin/lcrs.html|archivedate=2012-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of the first surveys to document the so-called "[[end of greatness]]" where the [[Cosmological Principle]] of isotropy could be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20894">In [[persuasion|persuasive]] communication, the order of the information's presentation influences opinion formation.  The '''law of primacy in persuasion''', otherwise known as a primacy effect, as postulated by [[Frederick Hansen Lund]] in 1925 holds that the side of an issue presented first will have greater effectiveness in persuasion than the side presented subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Vernon A.|year=1969|title=A Primacy Effect in Decision-Making by Jurors|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=19|issue=3|pp=239–247|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1969.tb00846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lund presented college students with a document in support of one side of a controversial issue and then presented a second document which supported the opposite position. He found the document read first had greater influence, regardless of which position it expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ciadvertising.org/student_account/fall_01/adv382j/mgautam/minx_paper/primacy.html | work= ADV 382J: Fall 2001, "Theories of Persuasive Communication &amp; Consumer Decision Making"|title= Primacy-Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=2007-11-04 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This empirical evidence was generally accepted until 1950, when Cromwell published findings of the opposite: a '''recency effect''' in which arguments presented later had greater effectiveness in persuasion than arguments presented first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/sa/spring_04/adv382j/christine/primacy.html |title= Order Effects Theory : Primacy versus Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |author = Kohler, Christine|accessdate=2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now appears that both primacy and recency effects occur in persuasion.

==Theoretical background==

There are many different theoretical models proposed to explain the occurrence of primacy and recency effects.

=== Sensory-variation===
Schultz (1963) developed the "sensory-variation" hypothesis for order effects, which suggests that humans seek high activation and will respond to novel stimuli more strongly than to stimuli they are familiar with. Novel stimuli should provide higher activation than familiar information, according to this theory. Shultz developed four postulates from this general hypothesis: 
# When a person encounters a topic for the first time, the communication is perceived as novel and causes high activation. Any subsequent communication on the same topic produces less activation, and so the person will react according to the initial communication in an attempt to experience the higher activation. A primacy effect should be observed in this scenario.
# If the person is allowed to record his opinion after each communication, the person will respond more to the communication that he encounters either second in a group of two or last in a group of three or more  in order to maintain a high level of activation. Therefore, a recency effect is hypothesized. 
# When a time delay or another task is inserted between the two communications, the higher level of activation will be dissipated by the time the second communication occurs. The second communication acts as a novel stimulus in this scenario. Either a recency effect or no order effect will occur in this scenario. 
# When communications are familiar, such as social issues or current issues, the first communication will not produce activation that is less than the activation for unfamiliar communication. However, some aspect of the communication may be novel, and so there may be some increased activation. Therefore, either a small primacy effect or no  order effect will be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schultz, D. P.|year=1963|title=Primacy-recency within a sensory variation framework|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=13|issue=2|pp=129–139|doi=10.1007/BF03393511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention decrement===

Anderson (1981) theorized that order effects occur due to "attention decrement". According to this theory,  when the first piece of information is presented about an opinion, people tend to pay less attention to subsequent information that may provide evidence to the contrary opinion. Therefore, people's opinions about something are influenced strongly by the information that they paid attention to, which was the first information presented to them. This model of "attention decrement" predicts a primacy effect in opinion formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, N.H.|year=1981|title=Foundations of information integration theory|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The belief-adjustment model===
Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) proposed the belief-adjustment model to try to predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based on the type of mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hogarth, R. M.|author2=Einhorn, H. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Order effects in belief updating: The belief-adjustment model|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pp=1–55|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90002-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when processing changes to step-by-step processing, or processing that occurs after each new piece of information, recency effects are predicted. Each new piece of information received will be processed separately. This new piece of information will then become the new anchor, which forms a new impression. Beliefs are being adjusted with the processing of each new anchor, which leads to more weight being placed to the information most recently received. Therefore, recency effects are predicted to occur when information is processed in a step-by-step manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Factors that moderate order effects==

There are factors that can [[Moderation (statistics)|moderate]] the occurrence of order effects. Moderating factors affect the likelihood of order effects occurring.

===Need for cognition===

[[Need for cognition]] moderates the occurrence of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror's need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by one side of the case, and then both sides commented that the confession fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented the confession spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed the confession fit with whichever side presented the confession as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that the confession supported the case for the side who did not submit the confession.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kassin, S. M.|author2=Reddy, M. E.|author3=Tulloch, W. F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Juror interpretations of ambiguous evidence: The need for cognition, presentation order, and persuasion|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=14|issue=1|pp=43–55|doi=10.1007/BF01055788|jstor=1393555|url=http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_Reddy_Tulloch_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) believed that the reason for this effect was due to the nature of processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads to agreeing with the initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This impact of need for cognition is supported by a study conducted by Huagtvedt and Petty (1992). The experimenters played a message for two groups of people, one group that was high in need for cognition and one group that was low in need for cognition. The two groups were determined by their own need for cognition, and were not experimentally manipulated into the two groups. Initially, both groups were equally persuaded by the message. However, the two groups then listened to a weak counter-message, which was not as strong as the evidence for the initial message. The group that had high need for cognition were not persuaded by the weak counter-message, and their opinions were still in line with the initial message. The other group, the low need for cognition group, was persuaded by the new message. The high need for cognition demonstrated a primacy effect, while the low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haugtvedt, C. P.|author2=Petty, R. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Personality and persuasion: Need for cognition moderates the persistence and resistance of attitude changes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=2|p=308|url=http://psyc604.stasson.org/haugtvedt.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chunking===
[[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]] interacts with the order of information and need for cognition to moderate the occurrence of order effects. Petty, Tormala, Hawkins, and Wegener (2001) conducted a study which examined the effect chunking has on order effects in people with high and low need for cognition. Participants read arguments for and against an exam policy, and this information was presented as being either chunked or unchunked. When the information was chunked, those who show high need for cognition were prone to primacy effects, while those with low need for cognition were prone to recency effects. However, when the information was presented in an unchunked nature, the opposite results were found. People who had high need for cognition demonstrated recency effects, whereas people who had low need for cognition showed a primacy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Petty, R. E.|author2=Tormala, Z. L.|author3=Hawkins, C.|author4=Wegener, D. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Motivation to think and order effects in persuasion: The moderating role of chunking|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=3|pp=332–344|doi=10.1177/0146167201273007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745085_Motivation_to_Think_and_Order_Effects_in_Persuasion_The_Moderating_Role_of_Chunking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, chunking appears to interact with need for cognition to allow for order effects to occur.

===Familiarity of information===

A study conducted by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In the study, a topic of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with the topic and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with the topic. A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against the topic twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for the topic first and then the argument against the topic, and the second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a [[Likert scale]] questionnaire on their opinions on the topic. The results show that prior familiarization with a topic increased the likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on the topic that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, R. E. |year=1961|title=Familiarity and the order of presentation of persuasive communications|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=62|issue=3|pp=573–577|doi=10.1037/h0046634|pmid=14461892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy of the topic===

A study conducted by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students and high school students read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the presentation of arguments for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, Robert E.|year=1963|title=Controversy of the topic and the order of presentation in persuasive communications|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=12|issue=1|pp=163–170|doi=10.2466/pr0.1963.12.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in jury trials==

==Order effects in judgment formation==

===Sports===

Smith, Greenlees, and Manley (2009) found that order effects can occur in assessment of sports ability. The researchers had participants watch a video composed of an [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] player performing certain skills. Two videos were shown, either in descending ability or increasing ability. The participants were then asked to make assessments of the overall ability of the players and three aspects of their ability. However, the assessments occurred at differing times in the video. One group made the assessments at the end of the video, one group made delayed assessments at the end of the video, a third group made the assessments after each skill in the video, and a fourth group that made the overall assessment after each skill but then made the assessment of the ability after viewing the entire video. Results indicate that a primacy effect was exhibited in each of the conditions, except for the third group, which did not demonstrate any order effects. The assessment of ability tended to agree with the initial ability level shown. However, the group that made assessments in an extended step-by-step manner were not influenced by the order the abilities were shown. Therefore, a primacy effect can occur in ability assessment, unless extended step-by-step processing is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, M. J.|author2=Greenlees, I.|author3=Manley, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Influence of order effects and mode of judgement on assessments of ability in sport|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=27|issue=7|pp=745–752|doi=10.1080/02640410902939647|pmid=19437187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service encounters===

In a study conducted by Garnefeld and Steinhoff (2013), order effects were demonstrated for opinions regarding service encounters. Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then tested for customer satisfaction regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnefeld, I.|author2=Steinhoff, L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Primacy versus recency effects in extended service encounters|journal=Journal of Service Management|volume=24|issue=1|pp=64–81|doi=10.1108/09564231311304198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in health care==

Order effects may be used to influence a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group received information in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups received information ordered based on their values. One of the groups received information that aligned with their values first, and the other group received information that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients receive information appears to influence which treatment option they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bansback, N.|author2=Li L. C.|author3=Lynd, L.|author4=Bryan S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=Exploiting order effects to improve  the quality of decisions|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|volume=96|issue=2|pp=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.021|pmid=24961445|url=http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(14)00226-2/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in politics==
===Voter mobilization===

In a study conducted by Panagopoulos (2010), order effects were found in terms of voter mobilization. Calls were made to residents of an American city at different times before an election. Some residents received a call 4 weeks prior to an election, some received a call two weeks prior to an election, some received a call three days before an election, and some residents did not receive a call. The call made was a nonpartisan attempt to mobilize people to vote. Results indicate that the timing of the call may not have an effect on the general voter population, but that the timing can affect certain populations and get certain populations to vote at higher rates. According to Panagopoulos, high-propensity voters, voters who typically turn out in higher numbers, voted at higher percentages when they received the call four weeks prior to the election, demonstrating a primacy effect. However, for lower propensity voters, voters who typically do not vote, calls made three days prior to the election were more effective at getting this population to vote, demonstrating a recency effect. Therefore, for voter mobilization, propensity to vote appears to be a moderating variable influencing the effect of timing of a mobilization call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panagopoulos, C.|year=2011|title=Timing Is Everything?

{{Linguistics |applied}}

'''Linguistic anthropology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study of how language influences social life. It is a branch of [[anthropology]] that originated from the endeavor to document [[endangered language]]s, and has grown over the past century to encompass most aspects of [[language structure]] and use.&lt;ref name="Duranti2004"&gt;Duranti, Alessandro (ed.), 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jMmmQjssaEC ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''], Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropology explores how language shapes communication, forms social identity and group membership, organizes large-scale cultural beliefs and ideologies, and develops a common cultural representation of natural and [[social world]]s.&lt;ref name="SLA"&gt;Society for Linguistic Anthropology. n.d. [http://www.linguisticanthropology.org/about/ About the Society for Linguistic Anthropology] (accessed 7 July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct [[paradigm]]s.These paradigms set the ways of approaching linguistic anthropology: the first, now known as "[[anthropological linguistics]]", focuses on the documentation of languages; the second, known as "linguistic anthropology", engages in theoretical studies of language use; the third, developed over the past two or three decades, studies issues from other sub-fields of anthropology with linguistic tactics. Though they developed sequentially, all three paradigms are still practiced today.&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 2003. Language as Culture in U.S. Anthropology: Three Paradigms. ''Current Anthropology'' 44(3):323–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Paradigm: Anthropological linguistics===
{{main|Anthropological linguistics}}
The first paradigm is known as anthropological linguistics. The field is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline: documentation of [[language]]s that were then seen as doomed to [[extinction]], with special focus on the languages of native North American tribes. It is also the paradigm most focused on linguistics.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; The themes include:

* Grammatical description,
*[[Linguistic typology|Typological classification]] and
*[[Linguistic relativity]]

===Second Paradigm: Linguistic anthropology===
 The second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology, signalling a more anthropological focus on the study. This term was coined by [[Dell Hymes]], who was also responsible for the idea of [[ethnography]] of [[communication]].  This term was Hymes' vision for the future of linguistic anthropology, where language would be studied in the context of the situation, and relative to the community speaking it.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; This new era would involve many of the new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.

Hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology, the first of which was a new [[unit of analysis]]. Unlike the first paradigm, which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of [[phoneme]]s and [[morpheme]]s, the second paradigm's unit of analysis was the "speech event". A speech event is an event defined by speech occurring during it (ex. a lecture, debate). This is different from a speech situation, where speech could possibly occur (ex. dinner). Hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to [[ethnopoetics]]. Hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology. However, Hymes' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, Richard. 1977. "Verbal Art as Performance." ''American Anthropologist'' 77:290–311. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1975.77.2.02a00030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hymes1981"&gt;Hymes, Dell. 1981 [1975] Breakthrough into Performance.

=== Third Paradigm: Anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data ===
The third paradigm, which began in the late 1980s, refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues. Rather than focusing on exploring language, third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools. Themes include:

* investigations of personal and social [[Identity (social science)|identities]]
* shared [[Ideology|ideologies]]
* construction of [[narrative]] in interactions among individuals

Furthermore, like how the second paradigm made use of new technology in its studies, the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt;

== Areas of interest ==
Contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above: documentation of languages, study of language through context, and study of identity through linguistic means. The third paradigm, the study of anthropological issues, is a particularly rich area of study for current linguistic anthropologists.

===Identity and intersubjectivity===
A great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural [[cultural identity|identity]] linguistically and discursively. Linguistic anthropologist [[Don Kulick]] has done so in relation to identity, for example, in a series of settings, first in a village called Gapun in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Kulick1992&gt;Kulick, Don. 1992. ''Language Shift and Cultural Reproduction: Socialization, Self and Syncretism in a Papua New Guinea Village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He explored how the use of two languages with and around children in Gapun village: the traditional language ([[Taiap language|Taiap]]), not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially "indexical" of Gapuner identity, and [[Tok Pisin]], the widely circulating official language of New Guinea. ("indexical" points to meanings beyond the immediate context.)&lt;ref name=Silverstein1976&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1976. Shifters, Linguistic Categories, and Cultural Description. In ''Meaning in Anthropology''. K. Basso and H.A. Selby, eds. Pp. 11–56. Albuquerque: School of American Research, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To speak the [[Taiap language]] is associated with one identity: not only local but "Backward" and also an identity based on the display of *hed* (personal autonomy). To speak Tok Pisin is to [[Indexicality|index]] a modern, Christian (Catholic) identity, based not on *hed* but on *save*, an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate. In later work, Kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in Brazil called *um escândalo*, Brazilian ''travesti'' (roughly, 'transvestite') sex workers shame clients. The travesti community, the argument goes, ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger Brazilian public might try to foist off on them, again by loud public discourse and other modes of [[performance]].&lt;ref name=Kulick&amp;Klein&gt;Kulick, Don, and Charles H. Klein. 2003. Scandalous Acts: The Politics of Shame among Brazilian Travesti Prostitutes. In ''Recognition Struggles and Social Movements: Contested Identities, Agency and Power''. B. Hobson, ed. Pp. 215–238. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, scholars such as [[Émile Benveniste]]&lt;ref&gt;Benveniste, Emile. 1971. Problems in general linguistics. Miami: University of Miami Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Mary Bucholtz]] and [[Kira Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz, M., &amp; Hall, K. 2005. Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach. Discourse Studies, 7(4–5), 585–614.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Lee (academic)|Benjamin Lee]]&lt;ref&gt; Lee, Benjamin. 1997. Talking Heads: Language, Metalanguage, and the Semiotics of Subjectivity. Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Paul Kockelman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kockelman, Paul. 2004. Stance and Subjectivity. Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 14(2), 127–150.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Stanton Wortham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Stanton. 2006. Learning identity: The joint emergence of social identification and academic learning. New York, NY, US: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many others) have contributed to understandings of identity as "intersubjectivity" by examining the ways it is discursively constructed.

===Socialization===
In a series of studies, linguistic anthropologists [[Elinor Ochs]] and [[Bambi Schieffelin]] addressed the anthropological topic of [[socialization]] (the process by which infants, children, and foreigners become members of a community, learning to participate in its culture), using linguistic and other ethnographic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, Elinor. 1988. ''Culture and language development: Language acquisition and language socialization in a Samoan village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Bambi Schieffelin. 1984. Language Acquisition and Socialization: Three Developmental Stories and Their Implications. In ''Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Self, and Emotion''. R. Shweder and R.A. LeVine, eds. Pp. 276–320. New York: Cambridge University.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Carolyn Taylor. 2001. The “Father Knows Best” Dynamic in Dinnertime Narratives. In ''Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 431–449. Oxford. Malden, MA: Blackwell.
*Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1990. ''The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that the processes of [[enculturation]] and socialization do not occur apart from the process of [[language acquisition]], but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that [[baby talk]] is not [[universal proposition|universal]], that the direction of adaptation (whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa) was a variable that correlated, for example, with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver's body. In many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life.

Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both ''to'' and ''through'' the use of language. Ochs and Schieffelin uncovered how, through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white [[middle class]] households in [[Southern California]], both mothers and fathers participated in replicating [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] (the "father knows best" syndrome) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist (often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father) and "problematizer" (often the father, who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist). When mothers collaborated with children to get their stories told, they unwittingly set themselves up to be subject to this process.

Schieffelin's more recent research has uncovered the socializing role of [[pastor]]s and other fairly new Bosavi converts in the [[Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea]] community she studies.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1995. Creating evidence: Making sense of written words in Bosavi. ''Pragmatics'' 5(2):225–244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2000. Introducing Kaluli Literacy: A Chronology of Influences. In ''Regimes of Language''. P. Kroskrity, ed. Pp. 293–327. Santa Fe: School of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2002. Marking time: The dichotomizing discourse of multiple temporalities. ''Current Anthropology'' 43(Supplement):S5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2006. PLENARY ADDRESS: Found in translating: Reflexive language across time and texts in Bosavi, PNG. Twelve Annual Conference on Language, Interaction, and Culture, University of California, Los Angeles, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge,  new linguistic [[epistemic]] markers&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995/&gt;—and new ways of speaking about time.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002/&gt; And they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the Bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others (e.g. the [[gospel of Mark]], chapter 2, verses 6–8).&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006/&gt;

===Ideologies===
In a third example of the current (third) paradigm, since [[Roman Jakobson]]'s student [[Michael Silverstein]] opened the way, there has been an efflorescence of work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of [[ideologies]],&lt;ref name=Silverstein1979&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1979. Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology. In ''The Elements: A Parasession on Linguistic Units and Levels''. R. Cline, W. Hanks, and C. Hofbauer, eds. Pp. 193–247. Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;—in this case "[[language ideology|language ideologies]]", sometimes defined as "shared bodies of [[commonsense]] notions about the nature of language in the world."&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;Rumsey, Alan. 1990. "Word, meaning, and linguistic ideology." ''American Anthropologist'' 92(2):346–361. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00060}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere [[false consciousness]] but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures, including the dropping of "[[thee]]" and "[[thou]]" from everyday [[English language|English]] usage.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1985. Language and the Culture of Gender: At the Intersection of Structure, Usage, and Ideology. In ''Semiotic Mediation: Sociocultural and Psychological Perspectives''. E. Mertz and R. Parmentier, eds. Pp. 219–259. Orlando: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolard, in her overview of "[[Code-switching|code switching]]", or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology. It is the ideology that people should "really" be monoglot and efficiently targeted toward referential clarity rather than diverting themselves with the messiness of multiple varieties in play at a single time.&lt;ref&gt;Woolard, Kathryn A. 2004. Codeswitching. In ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 73–94. Malden: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language, such as the pull exerted on Tewa, a Kiowa-Tanoan language spoken in certain New Mexican pueblos and on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, by "kiva speech", discussed in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. 1998. Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In ''Language ideologies: Practice and theory''. B.B. Schieffelin, K.A. Woolard, and P. Kroskrity, eds. Pp. 103–122. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of [[language contact]], [[language endangerment]], and '[[English as a global language]]'. For instance, Indian linguist [[Braj Kachru]] investigated local varieties of English in South Asia, the ways in which [[English as a lingua franca|English functions as a lingua franca]] among multicultural groups in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Braj B. Kachru|title=Asian Englishes: Beyond the Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTW-AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7|year=2005|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-665-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; British linguist David Crystal has contributed to investigations of [[language death]] attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Crystal|title=Language Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8K0BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-43181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social space===
In a final example of this third paradigm, a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space. Duranti published a groundbreaking article on [[Samoan language|Samoan]] [[greetings]] and their use and transformation of social space.&lt;ref name=Duranti1992&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 1992. "Language and Bodies in Social Space: Samoan Greetings." ''American Anthropologist'' 94:657–691. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1992.94.3.02a00070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, Indonesianist Joseph Errington, making use of earlier work by Indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se, brought linguistic anthropological methods (and [[semiotic]] theory) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center, the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Errington, J. Joseph. 1988.  ''Structure and Style in Javanese: A Semiotic View of Linguistic Etiquette''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Errington demonstrated how the [[Java]]nese *[[priyayi]]*, whose ancestors served at the Javanese royal courts, became emissaries, so to speak, long after those courts had ceased to exist, representing throughout Java the highest example of "refined speech." The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of [[Sumba]], [[Indonesia]]. And, even though it pertains to [[Tewa people|Tewa]] Indians in [[Arizona]] rather than Indonesians, [[Paul Kroskrity]]'s argument that speech forms originating in the Tewa [[kiva]] (or underground ceremonial space) forms the dominant model for all Tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel.

Silverstein tries to find the maximum theoretical significance and applicability in this idea of exemplary centers. He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology's three most important findings. He generalizes the notion thus, arguing "there are wider-scale institutional 'orders of interactionality,' historically contingent yet structured. Within such large-scale, macrosocial orders, in-effect [[ritual]] centers of [[semiosis]] come to exert a structuring, [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive [[Social interaction|interaction]] with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 2004. {{"'}}Cultural' Concepts and the Language-Culture Nexus." ''Current Anthropology'' 45(5):621–652.&lt;/ref&gt; Current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a {{"'}}hypertrophic' set of parallel orders of [[iconicity]] and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears, often, to be the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] of textual and nontextual metricalizations, synchronized."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilce, James M. 2006. Magical Laments and Anthropological Reflections: The Production and Circulation of Anthropological Text as Ritual Activity. ''Current Anthropology''. 47(6):891–914.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race, Class, and Gender===
Addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories, many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race (and ethnicity), class, and gender (and sexuality). These works generally consider the roles of social structures (e.g., ideologies and institutions) related to race, class, and gender (e.g., marriage, labor, pop culture, education) in terms of their constructions and in terms of individuals' lived experiences. A short list of linguistic anthropological texts that address these topics follows:

The '''Malta Environment and Planning Authority''' (MEPA) was the national agency responsible for the environment and planning in [[Malta]]. The national agency was established to regulate the environment and planning on the Maltese islands of Malta, [[Gozo]] and other small islets of the Maltese [[archipelago]].  MEPA is bound to follow the regulations of the Environment Protection Act (2001) and the Development Planning Act (1992) of the Laws of Malta. The national agency is also responsible for the implementation of Directives, Decisions and [[Regulations]] under the EU Environmental [[Acquis]] as Malta is a member of the [[European Union]], while considering other recommendations and opinion of the Union. The Authority employs over 420 government workers, from a wide range of educational backgrounds, all within their merit of [[profession]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/organisation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818062627/http://www.mepa.org.mt/organisation |archivedate=2015-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mepa.org.mt/home?l=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002073155/http://www.mepa.org.mt/home?l=1 |archivedate=2009-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Officio delle Case''' was the planning authority during the [[Order of St. John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolnet.gov.mt/history/wirt/Kavallieri/bini-belt/UnderneathVal.htm|title=Underneath Valletta|website=www.schoolnet.gov.mt|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==

MEPA acts as the national representation under a number of international environmental conventions and multilateral agreements.
These include information supported by the [[Aarhus Convention]]:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*On access to information;
*Public participation in decision-making;
*Access to justice in environmental matters.

==Governance==

The Agency is governed by a board of professional, whose responsibility is to provide strategic guidance within, laid by the laws of Malta. The board comprising a maximum of 15 personnel led by the [[Executive Chairman]], Perit Vincent Cassar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20of%20Malta/Ministries%20and%20Entities/Officially%20Appointed%20Bodies/Pages/Authorities/Malta-Environment-and-Planning-Authority.aspx|title=Malta Environment and Planning Authority|website=www.gov.mt|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members within the board, include two representative members of the [[Parliament of Malta]], who are knowledgeable and experienced about matters relating to the environment and development such ranging from: commercial, industrial and [[social affairs]]. A number of appointed boards and committees provide strategic guidance or expert advise to the [[wikt:Special:Search/directorate|directorates]] to ensure that the organization fulfils its functions and responsibilities efficiently and effectively, in line with legal obligations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Responsibility==

MEPA’s operational functions and responsibilities are carried out by the work of four main [[structures]], namely:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*The Chairman’s Office is responsible for providing the framework within which the MEPA Board together with the [[Government agency|Commissions]] and [[Committee]]s operate.
*The [[secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] is the point of reference for issuing and communicating the Board's and Commissions' decisions and in this context are a primary point of contact for ministries, departments and agencies as well as the general public.
*The [[Communication]]s Office and Complaints office are an integral part of the function of this office.

==Aim==

The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the implementation of the aims and supervise and control the Directorates. The CEO and other directors, are responsible for developing the necessary strategies. The Planning Directorate processes environment and planning applications. It is responsible for enforcement, policy development and plan making, transport planning and research and other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/56189/mepa_executive_chairman_at_governments_mercy#.VdxvAsRHmrU|title=MEPA executive chairman at government’s mercy|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==

The [[Enforcement]] Directorate is responsible for both Development Control and [[Environmental Protection]] and for supporting the Authority in enforcement campaigns including Direct Action, enforcement, [[surveillance]] and actions as necessary to ensure compliance with the building development permits and to protect the environment to help achieve a sustainable environmental improvement. The Environment Protection Directorate advises Government on environmental standards and policies, draws up plans and provides a licensing regime to safeguard and monitor the environment and controls the activities having environmental impact. The Directorate for Corporate Services, is responsible for [[Human Resources]], [[Information Technology]], [[Cartography|Mapping]] and Land-surveying, support services and [[Finance]]. There are a number of boards and committees, which provide strategic guidance for the Directorates to ensure the organization fulfils its functions and responsibilities efficiently and effectively, in line with its legal obligations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the deep ocean, '''marine snow''' is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the [[water column]]. It is a significant means of exporting [[energy]] from the [[light]]-rich [[photic zone]] to the [[aphotic zone]] below.  The term was first coined by the explorer [[William Beebe]] as he observed it from his [[bathysphere]].  As the origin of marine snow lies in activities within the productive photic zone, the prevalence of marine snow changes with seasonal fluctuations in [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity and [[ocean current]]s. Marine snow can be an important food source for organisms living in the aphotic zone, particularly for organisms which live very deep in the water column.

==Composition==
Marine snow is made up of a variety of mostly organic matter, including dead or dying animals and [[phytoplankton]], [[protist]]s, fecal matter, sand, and other inorganic dust. Most trapped particles are more vulnerable to grazers than they would be as free floating individuals and can be classified as "olive green" or "gray body" cells, which are plant parts and degrading plant material. A majority of marine snow composition is actually made up of aggregates of smaller particles held together by a sugary mucus, transparent extracellular [[polysaccharide]]s (TEPs). These are natural [[polymer]]s exuded as waste products mostly by phytoplankton and [[bacterium|bacteria]]. [[Mucus]] secreted by [[zooplankton]] (mostly [[salps]], [[appendicularia]]ns, and [[pteropoda|pteropods]]) also contribute to the constituents of marine snow aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Charles B. | title=Biological Oceanography | year=2004 | publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd.| pages=94–5, 266–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aggregates grow over time and may reach several centimeters in diameter, traveling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor.

Marine snow often forms during [[algal bloom]]s. As phytoplankton accumulate, they aggregate or get captured in other aggregates, both of which accelerate the sinking rate. Aggregation and sinking is actually thought to be a large component of sources for algae loss from surface water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mann| first=K.H. |last2=Lazier |first2=J.R.N | title=Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems | year=2006 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing| page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. The small percentage of material not consumed in shallower waters becomes incorporated into the muddy "ooze" blanketing the ocean floor, where it is further decomposed through biological activity.

Marine snow aggregates exhibit characteristics that fit Goldman's "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". This hypothesis states that phytoplankton, microorganisms and bacteria live attached to aggregate surfaces and are involved in rapid nutrient recycling. Phytoplankton have been shown to be able to take up nutrients from small local concentrations of organic material (e.g. fecal matter from an individual zooplankton cell, regenerated nutrients from organic decomposition by bacteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCarthy J.J |author2=Goldman J.C. | title=Nitrogenous nutrition of marine phytoplankton in nutrient-depleted waters | doi=10.1126/science.203.4381.670  | year=1979 | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=203 | pages=670–672 | pmid=17813381}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the aggregates slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean, the many microorganisms residing on them are constantly respiring and contribute greatly to the [[microbial loop]].

==Aggregation==
Aggregates begin as the colloidal fraction, which typically contains particles sized between 1&amp;nbsp;nm and several micrometers.  The colloidal fraction of the ocean contains a large amount of organic matter unavailable to grazers.  This fraction has a much higher total mass than either phytoplankton or bacteria but is not readily available due to size characteristics of the particles in relation to potential consumers.  The colloidal fraction must aggregate in order to be more [[bioavailability|bioavailable]].  Aggregation theory outlines main mechanisms by which marine aggregates may form and are as follows:
;[[Brownian motion]]
:Brownian motion, also known as the Brownian Pump in this case, describes the interaction between individual particles in the colloid fraction.  Particles in Brownian motion interact randomly due to the impact of solute molecules.  These interactions lead to collision and aggregation of these small particles.  The small aggregates then collide and aggregate with other aggregates and particles until the aggregate in question is several micrometers in diameter.
;[[shear (fluid)|Shear]]
:Once particles have aggregated to several micrometers in diameter, they begin to accumulate bacteria, since there is sufficient site space for feeding and reproduction. At this size it is large enough to undergo sinking.  It also has the components necessary to fit the "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". Evidence for this has been found by Alldredge and Cohen (1987) who found evidence of both respiration and photosynthesis within aggregates, suggesting the presence of both [[autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alldredge, A.L.  |author2=Cohen, Y.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Can microscale chemical patches persist in the sea?  Microelectrode study of marine snow, fecal pellets. | year=1987 | journal=Science | volume=235| pages=689–691 | doi = 10.1126/science.235.4789.689 | issue=4789 | pmid=17833630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Differential [[settling]]
:This form of aggregation involves particles sinking at different rates and their collision to form aggregates.
;[[diffusion|Diffusive]] capture
:Diffusive capture describes a particle that is advected into the diffusion-limited boundary layer of another particle and is eventually captured/collides with that particle.
;Surface [[coagulation]]
:Aggregates may also form from colloids trapped on the surface of rising [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s.  For example, Kepkay et al. found that bubble coagulation leads to an increase in bacterial respiration since more food is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kepkay, P.E.| title=Particle aggregation and the biological activity of colloids| year=1994 | journal=Marine Ecology Project Series | volume=109 | pages=293–304 | doi=10.3354/meps109293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, a storm at sea could increase bacterial respiration by up to 36 fold for two to four hours.
;[[Filtration]]
:Particles and small organisms floating through the water column can become trapped within aggregates.  Marine snow aggregates are porous, however, and some particles are able to pass through them.
;Bacterial motility
:It is unclear how relevant this mode of aggregation is to marine snow, but there have been limited observations of bacteria moving fast and far enough to capture colloidal particles.

Aggregation theory represents a two state system.  At low cell concentrations aggregation is relatively unimportant and somewhat more unlikely.  However, at higher cell concentrations it becomes increasingly important.  A model has been proposed to characterize the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} C_{1} }{\mathrm{d} t} = g C_1 - 20.8\alpha r^{3} G C_1^2|&lt;/math&gt;}}
where
*''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration of the cells
*''r'' is the radius of each cell
*''G'' is the shearing rate
*''&amp;alpha;'' is the stickiness coefficient
*''g'' is the growth rate.

Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms)

==Study==
'''Export production''' is the amount of [[organic matter]] produced in the [[ocean]] by [[primary production]] that is not recycled ([[remineralisation|remineralised]]) before it sinks into the [[aphotic zone]].  Because of the role of export production in the ocean's [[biological pump]], it is typically measured in units of [[carbon]] (e.g. [[milligram|mg]] C [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[day|d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]]).

The fraction of primary production that is exported to the aphotic zone is generally higher when primary production occurs in short (seasonal) bursts, than when it occurs more evenly spread out across a year.

Because of the relatively long residence time of the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]], carbon transported as marine snow into the deep ocean by the [[biological pump]] can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years.  That is, when the marine snow is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved [[carbon dioxide]], these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to [[ocean circulation]].  Consequently, enhancing the quantity of marine snow that reaches the deep ocean is the basis of several [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] schemes to enhance [[carbon sequestration]] by the ocean.  [[Ocean nourishment]] and [[iron fertilisation]] seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in marine snow reaching the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lampitt | first=Richard | title=Ocean fertilisation: a potential means of geoengineering? | year=2008 | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A]] | volume=366 | pages=3919–3945 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0139 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system.

Increases in ocean temperatures, a projected indicator of [[climate change]], may result in a decrease in the production of marine snow due to the enhanced [[stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column.  Increasing stratification decreases the availability of phytoplankton nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicic acid]], and could lead to a decrease in primary production and, thus, marine snow.

Marine snow has also begun to garner interest from [[microbiology|microbiologists]], owing to the microbial communities associated with it. Recent research indicates transported bacteria may exchange [[gene]]s with previously thought to be isolated populations of bacteria inhabiting the breadth of the ocean floor. In such an immense area there may be as yet undiscovered species tolerant of high pressures and extreme cold, perhaps finding use in [[bioengineering]] and [[pharmacy]].

'''Music archaeology''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study field that combines [[musicology]] and [[archaeology]]. As it includes music from numerous cultures, it is often seen as being a part of [[ethnomusicology]], and indeed a study group looking into music archaeology first emerged from ethnomusicological group the ICTM, not from within archaeology.

==Definitions==

"In its broadest sense, music archaeology is the study of the phenomenon of past musical behaviours and sounds", as music archaeologist Adje Both connects several definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Adje Both, Music Archaeology: Some Methodological and Theoretical Considerations, in: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 Yearbook for Traditional Music, Vol. 41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513001609/https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 |date=13 May 2018 }}, 2009, published by the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219215540/http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Music archaeologists use methods of both musicology and archaeology. A theoretical and methodological basic work is still missing and one of the desiderata of the international community of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Eichmann, [http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all Einführung in die Musikarchäologie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413221402/http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all |date=13 April 2014 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different goals in music archaeology: One of the most important is the exploration of excavated artefacts that are relevant for the reconstruction of ancient music, such as sound-producing devices, representations of musical scenes and textual evidence. The archaeological analysis and documentation of such artefacts, their dating and description as well as the explanation of find contexts and cultural contexts can shed light on its use and function in everyday life of the past, and can help us to rebuild them - i.e., to construct playable replicas.
To produce music in a broader sense may also mean the investigation of early musical notations and literary sources that are "excavated" in libraries or other hidden places. These results may illuminate how instruments were played or how music was sung. But ultimately what was played in ancient times must remain in the dark of the past, and much fantasy is needed by modern musicians to imagine how melodies and rhythms may have been composed. Strictly speaking, only the sound of the instruments can be revived - these are the possibilities and limits of Music Archaeology.
In the last few years the field has expanded considerably, with the inclusion of neurophysiological, biological, and psychological research. These approaches explore the possible beginnings of sound production by seeking the earliest prerequisites in the evolution of mankind for music making and musical 'understanding'.
At the other end of the continuum, newly published evidence for musical notations and theoretical writings, or new literary and iconographic sources relevant to ancient music, can add to our understanding of mostly vanished music cultures. The observation and integration of ethnographic analogies in recent or contemporary societies may also help us discover long lasting traditions in making music which are comparable to the silent past.

==History==

A first attempt to join the two distinct disciplines of Musicology and Archaeology took place at the conference of the International Musicological Society at Berkeley in 1977. One of the round tables was designated "Music and Archaeology", to which were invited specialists to discuss the musical remains of ancient cultures - Bathia Bayer (Israel), Charles Boilès (Mexico), Ellen Hickmann (Egypt), David Liang (China), Casja Lund (Scandinavia). The main stimulus for this was the sensational discovery of an ancient Mesopotamian musical system by Anne D. Kilmer, assyriologist in Berkeley. On the basis of this she was able to advance a decipherment and transcription into Western notation of a late Bronze Age hymn in the Hurrian language, excavated from Ugarit, which contained notation based on the Mesopotamian system. With the help of musicologist Richard L. Crocker (Berkeley) and instrument maker Robert Brown, a replica of a Sumerian lyre was made, and Kilmer's version of the Hurrian hymn was recorded, accompanied by a carefully prepared commentary, as Kilmer/Crocker/Brown, Sounds from Silence, Recent Discoveries in Ancient Eastern Music (LP with information booklet, Bit Enki Publications, Berkeley, 1976). At the round table in Berkeley, Kilmer explained their method of reconstruction and demonstrated the resulting sound. This was the starting point of the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], officially founded within the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) in Seoul/Korea in 1981, and recognized by the ICTM in New York in 1983 following its first meeting on current music-archaeological research in Cambridge/UK in 1982.

The ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology went on to hold international conferences in Stockholm (1984), Hannover/Wolfenbüttel (1986), Saint Germain-en-Laye (1990), Liège (1992), Istanbul (1993), Jerusalem (1994/1995, together with the ICTM-Study Group for Iconography), and Limassol, Cyprus (1996). These meetings resulted in comprehensive conference reports.

The [[International Study Group on Music Archaeology]] ([http://www.musicarchaeology.org/index.php ISGMA]) has been founded by Ellen Hickmann and Ricardo Eichmann in 1998. The Study Group emerged from the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology with the objective to obtain closer cooperation with archaeologists. Since then, the ISGMA has worked continuously with the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Berlin). A new series called "Studien zur Musikarchäologie" was created as a sub-series of "Orient-Archäologie" to present the conference reports of the ISGMA, and to integrate music-archaeological monographs independent of the Study Group's meetings; it is published by the Orient Department of the DAI through the Verlag Marie Leidorf. Between 1998 and 2004, conferences of ISGMA were held every two years at Michaelstein Monastery, Music Academy of Sachsen-Anhalt (Kloster Michaelstein, Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt), sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).

In close cooperation with the Department for Ethnomusicology at the Ethnological Museum Berlin (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv), the 5th and 6th Symposium of the ISGMA were held in 2006 respectively in 2008 at the Ethnological Museum Berlin. In friendly cooperation with the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, the 7th Symposium of the ISGMA was held in Tianjin, China, in 2010. The 8th Symposium of the ISGMA (2012) was also held in China, in Suzhou and Beijing, and the 9th Symposium is being planned for September 2014, again held at the Ethnological Museum Berlin.

Meanwhile, the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology continued separately, and holds its own events, although a number of researchers are involved in both groups. After a couple of years of no activities, Julia L. J. Sanchez re-established the Study Group in 2003 on the initiative of Anthony Seeger, beginning with meetings in Los Angeles, California (2003), and Wilmington, North Carolina (2006). These were followed by a joint-conference in New York (2009), the 11th of the Study Group since its foundation in 1981 (also the 12th Conference of the Research Center for Music Iconography). The 12th conference was then held in Valladolid, Spain (2011), which was the largest meeting of the ICTM Study Group so far, followed by the 13th symposium of the Study Group held in Guatemala 2013. In 2015, the 14th symposium will be held in Poland. In 2013 it was decided to establish a new series, [http://www.ekho-verlag.com/category/series/publications-of-the-ictm-study-group-on-music-archaeology/ Publications of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], published through [https://www.facebook.com/ekhoverlag Ekho Verlag].

On 27 May 2011 a public concert under the banner of ''Palaeophonics'', funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) ''Beyond Text'' programme and the University of Edinburgh Campaign, took place at the George Square Theatre in Edinburgh. The event showcased the outcomes of collaborative research and creative practice by archaeologists, composers, filmmakers and performers from across Europe and the Americas. Whilst inspired and driven by research in music archaeology, ''Palaeophonics'' represents the emergence of a new, possibly significant, development within the field and within musicology which approaches the subject through the production and performance of new sound and music based multi-media creative works instead of through direct representation and reproduction. Said by some observers as 'experimental' and 'avant-garde', the event provoked mixed feedback from a wide public audience of around 250 people. A related publication is planned and further ''Palaeophonics'' events are thought to be taking place in the future, although none are currently programmed, whilst funding for developing the project is sourced.

In 2013, the [http://www.emaproject.eu European Music Archaeology Project] (EMAP) has been funded by the EU funding programme [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php EACEA], for the period of 5 years. The project will develop a touring exhibition on ancient music in Europe and an elaborate concert and event program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|title=Musik früherer Jahrhunderte: Von wegen alte Leier|first=Angelika|last=Franz|date=28 December 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428122446/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaiologia.gr/en/blog/2013/06/13/listening-to-the-past/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ninian Smart.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ninian Smart]]
'''Roderick Ninian Smart''' (6 May 1927 – 9 January 2001) was a Scottish writer and university educator. He was a pioneer in the field of secular [[religious studies]]. In 1967 he established the first department of [[religious studies]] in the United Kingdom at the new [[University of Lancaster]] where he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor, having already chaired one of the largest and most prestigious departments of theology in Britain at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1976, he became the first J.F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Smart presented the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1979–80. In 1996, he was named the Academic Senate's Research Professor, the highest professorial rank at [[UC Santa Barbara]]. In 2000, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]], while simultaneously retaining his status as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. Smart held both titles at the time of his death.

Smart became widely known outside the Academy, at least in Britain, when he was editorial consultant for the major [[BBC]] television series, ''[[The Long Search]]'' (1977). His book ''The World's Religions'' (1989) also reached a considerable popular readership. His defence of religious studies as a secular discipline helped the formation of departments in many public universities, especially in the United States. He distanced religious studies from traditional theology in that evaluating truth claims and apology have no role but regarded investigation into the "truth and worth" of religion ''per se'' as a valid academic enterprise in the public arena of [[Public university|state-funded education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ninian Smart was born in [[Cambridge]], England, where his father, [[William Marshall Smart]] (1889–1975) was the [[John Couch Adams|John Couch Adams Astronomer]] in the [[University of Cambridge]].  His mother was Isabel (née Carswell). W. M Smart, who died in 1975, also served as President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1950).
Both parents were Scottish. They moved to Glasgow in 1937, when W. M. Smart became [[Regius Professor of Astronomy, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Astronomy]] (retiring in 1959).

Smart was one of three brothers, all of whom became professors: [[J. J. C. Smart|Jack]] (1920–2012) became a professor of philosophy; Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at the [[University of Nottingham]]. 

Smart attended the [[Glasgow Academy]] before joining the military in 1945, serving until 1948, in the [[British Army Intelligence Corps]] where he learned Chinese (via [[Confucian]] texts) mainly at the London School of Oriental and African Studies and had his first extended contact with Sri Lankan [[Buddhism]]. It was this experience that roused him from what he called his "Western slumber with the call of diverse and noble cultures."&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the army – as a captain – with a scholarship to Queen's College, [[University of Oxford]], he reverted to his Glasgow major, classics and philosophy, mainly because Chinese and Oriental studies in those days had "pathetic curricula". However, for his B.Phil. work he returned to world religions, writing what he later described as "the first dissertation in Oxford on philosophy of religion after World War II".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Lancaster University Chaplaincy Centre 1024.jpg|thumb|right|Lancaster University's Chaplaincy Centre]]

==Career==
After teaching in the [[University of Wales]] from 1952 until 1955, Smart spent a year as a visiting lecturer at [[Yale University]], where he also studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]], the language of the [[Buddhist scriptures]]. In 1956, he was appointed Lecturer in the [[University of London]], then in 1961 at the very young age of 34 – extraordinarily young for a full chair in the British system – he became the first H. G. Wood Professor of Theology at the [[University of Birmingham]] – one of the largest departments of theology, where he also served as head of department. By now author of several publications, including ''Reasons and Faiths'' (1958), based on his B.Phil work and ''World Religions: A Dialogue'' (1960), Smart was a rising star in the newly developing field of Religious Studies, rather than in Theology, despite the name of the chair he occupied. Already known internationally, he received several offers to take up positions in North America, including as Chair of the [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] Departments, and an invitation to apply for a chair at Oxford. However, he was already involved in a consultative capacity in forming the first major department of Religious Studies at the new [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], and found himself "cajoled from being adviser to being candidate" for the Chair.

Despite the attraction of prestigious posts elsewhere, he chose [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] because it represented a "[[tabula rasa]], a new field" where he could practice his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took up appointment in 1967, as Foundation Professor of Religious Studies. His tenure at [[Birmingham University]] had also done much to shift the department from an exclusive focus on [[Christianity]] to encompass [[world religions]]. His successor at Birmingham, [[John Hick]], would emerge as the most well-known exponent of a pluralist [[theology of religions]]. Between 1969 and 1972, he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor at Lancaster. In 1977, Smart started to divide his time between Lancaster and another new venture, the Religious studies department at the [[University of California|University of California, Santa Barbara]] (1976–98) where he became the first J. F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at Santa Barbara, from 1988 (he was a professor from 1976). As at Birmingham and Lancaster, he was again also department chair.  He spent six months of each year at each campus. In 1996, he was named Research Professor at Santa Barbara, the highest academic honour.  Toward the end of his career, he was elected President of the [[American Academy of Religion]].  Proud of his [[Scottish identity]], he often wore his [[kilt]] on campus at Santa Barbara, where he was renowned for riding his bicycle very slowly, for "his bow ties and the ever-present flower in his lapel, and most of all the twinkle in his eye."&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Hecht|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/roderickniniansmart.htm |title=In Memoriam: Roderick Ninian Smart |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ucsbuniversitycenterandstorketower.jpg|thumb|right|The University of California at Santa Barbara University Center and Lagoon]]At Lancaster he was respected by his students for being so accessible, for his willingness to engage his formidable intellect without pretension in informal debate over a pint in the bar.{{cn|date=June 2015}}&lt;!-- do not remove this unless you have a proper referenced source to replace it.--&gt;

===Visiting professorships and lectures===
Smart was also visiting professor at [[Varanasi]] in India, [[Yale]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Queensland|Queensland]], and the respected Religious Studies department at [[University of Wales, Lampeter|Lampeter]], in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Lectures delivered in Delhi were published as ''The Yogi and the Devotee'' (1968). In 1967, he presented the Heslington Lectures at the [[University of York]], in which he set out his ideas about secular Religious Studies subsequently published as ''Secular Education and the Logic of Religion'' (1967), further developing these in his inaugural lecture at Lancaster, published as ''Concept and Empathy'' (1986). In 1979–80, he presented the prestigious [[Gifford Lectures]], published as ''Beyond Ideology'' (1981).

===Activism===
In addition to teaching, research, and writing, Smart was something of an activist in promoting improved cross-cultural understanding.  In the 1970s, he was involved in several initiatives in Britain to broaden the public [[religious education]] curriculum, previously purely [[Christian]], to include the range of [[world religions]].  He also served on the [[National Schools Council]] advising on broadening the religious education curriculum. The teaching of religion in the state school system in the United Kingdom, which is mandatory, distinguishes teaching about religion from faith-nurture, which is not properly part of the task.  Smart was involved in the Assembly of the World's Religions series of meetings (1985, 1990, 1992) sponsored by [[Sun Myung Moon]], founder of the [[Unification Church|Unification movement]] and served as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. In 1999, he was co-convener of the First Assembly of the Inter-religious and International Federation for World Peace, established by Moon. Smart reiterated his conviction that without improved understanding of the religious and cultural [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], peace in the world would remain elusive. His concept of religions as [[worldviews]], and his value-free approach to religious studies – that is, refraining from elevating a single understanding of "truth" as some sort of evaluative criterion of religious authenticity-opened up for him the study of non-religious [[ideologies]] or worldviews (he preferred this term because it does not imply that theism is an essential element) as well as of new religious movements, which he saw as one result of globalisation.  He also wrote the foreword for the Unification publication, ''World Scripture,'' edited by [[Andrew Wilson (academic)|Andrew Wilson]], in which he stated that, "it is obvious that as we move toward a world civilization, in which so many cultures and spiritual traditions will impinge on one another, all of us should understand one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Wilson|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart was also a member of the International Board of the Global Ethics and Religion Forum, an educational, non-profit NGO dedicated to increasing global ethical responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;The Global Ethics and Religion Forum, [http://www.gerforum.org/ The Global Religion and Ethics Forum.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic honours===
Smart received honorary doctorates from [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola]] (1970), [[Glasgow University]] (1984), [[Stirling University]] (1986) [[University of Kelaniya]], Sri Lanka (1991), and Lancaster (1995) as well as an Honorary Fellowship from [[the Queen's College, Oxford]] (1999). He was made a Life Member of the International Association for the History of Religion (1995).

In 1994, the volume ''Aspects of Religion'', edited by Peter Masefield and Donald Wiebe, was published in his honour.

===Retirement and death===
Smart officially retired from Lancaster in 1982 (he was Honorary Professor from 1982 to 1989, then Professor Emeritus) and from Santa Barbara in 1998, but remained active as a professor emeritus in both universities, living mainly in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], where he died in 2001 from a massive stroke, aged 73.

==Scholarly contribution==
Smart is mainly noted for his contribution in the area of methodology, although he saw his contribution as conceptual as well as methodological, commenting that while expertise in languages was not to be dismissed, it should not be "rated above conceptual insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular Religious Studies dates from the mid-1960s, when new departments were established, several in state universities in the United States. At the time, it was only just beginning to earn academic recognition and Smart was a pivotal figure in this process and, as Cunningham comments, "it is difficult not to recall that the emergence of Religious Studies as a higher education subject was then controversial."&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Cunningham, [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article34994.ece Professor Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart's early work involved linguistic analysis, in which he had trained at Oxford. Later, he said that this came close to "cross-cultural study" but had stopped short, since he was still too captive to "our language" and "various assumptions of our culture".&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_21"/&gt; However, when he came to publish this he included later conceptual ideas, expanding his dissertation. Interested in [[Rudolf Otto]]'s concept of the Holy as a key to understanding religion, he found this too restrictive, since [[Buddhism]] is [[non-theistic]]. Instead, he suggested that religious experience can be either [[numinous]] or [[mystical]].  He was also influenced by [[R.C. Zaehner]]'s interest in mysticism, having consulted him at Oxford. He then examined what he took as key religious concepts, such as [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[Religious conversion|conversion]] and [[knowledge]] and analysed what these meant in Christianity, [[Hinduism]], and Buddhism without evaluating any belief in terms of truth or falsity. He was consciously attempting to break out of captivity to Western modes of thought so that for example theism is not taken as an essential component of religion, thus such ideas as [[theophany]] or a single ultimate focus or sacrifice do not necessarily translate from the Christian into other religious contexts.  "She who knows but one religion knows none," said Smart.&lt;ref name="Smart_2000_20"/&gt; Western concern for [[doctrine]] overlooked the importance of [[religious experience]]. Early in his career, he insisted that an [[ideology]] such as [[Marxism]] as well as [[nationalism]] and [[rationalism]] could be considered religious, because they resemble religious traditions in how they function, and therefore properly belong to Religious Studies, the subject matter of which was "non-finite".  

He situated Religious Studies in contrast to [[theology]] as [[agnostic]] on the truth of religious claims but he was critical of [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] for "assuming the non-existence of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies is, however, interested in why people believe that their religious statements or experience is true, thus description, although vital, must "transcend the informative" and engage in dialogue with "the para-historical claims of religions and anti-religious outlooks". It need not be hostile to the type of committed approach pursued in theology "provided it is open, and does not artificially restrict understanding and choice". It is not concerned with evangelising but with elucidating understanding, or meaning. Religious Studies, too, has a vital role to play in combating tribalism, that is, human captivity to its own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious Studies as a non-confessional, methodologically agnostic discipline takes its place in the secular academy, where it draw heavily on [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], history, [[archaeology]], and other disciplines.  At bottom, it has a place in the public or state sector because, as an aspect of human experience, it is also the study of people – of what they believe, why they believe and act as they do, both individually and within society. It is a constantly changing field because religions change as religious people adapt to new circumstances.  Religious Studies is never exclusively interested in what might be termed orthodoxy—however a religion itself might enforce or police conformity to an official version – but with religion as it is lived, with "religion on the ground," a term he first used in 1978.&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; Responses to modernity, to globalisation, as well as trends towards religious eclecticism, properly concern Religious Studies. Smart did not anticipate a single, eclectic religion emerging but that religions would increasingly borrow from one another and that a global consensus on the value of religion in society would evolve. In interview with Scott London, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I … believe we are moving toward a global ideology that has a place for religion and recognizes the contributions of the different traditions. Hopefully, it will have an overarching view as to how we can work together for the promotion of human values and spirituality.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;Scott London, [http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/smart.html The Future of Religion: An Interview with Ninian Smart.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dimensions of religion===
Smart is widely known for his seven-part definition of religion, or rather scheme of study; as this approach avoids the problem of defining altogether. Whatever else religion may or may not be – whether theistic or non-theistic, religions possess certain recognisable elements, which can be studied. These dimensions vary in importance but are almost always present. Smart divided these into "historical" and "para-historical," meaning by the latter those dimensions that take the investigation into the experience, or inner lives, or religious people. The "historical" can be studied empirically, the para-historical takes the student into the realm of belief and concepts and requires dialogue and participation; "since the study of man is in an important sense participatory – for one has to enter into men's intentions, beliefs, myths, desires, in order to understand why they act as they do – it is fatal if cultures including our own are described merely externally, without entering into dialogue with them".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Smart|1968|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Smart's sevenfold scheme of study:
#Doctrinal
#Mythological
#Ethical
#Ritual
#Experiential
#Institutional
#Material (added in his 1989 text, ''The World's Religions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rennie|first1=Bryan S|title=The View of the Invisible World: Ninian Smart's Analysis of the Dimensions of Religion and of Religious Experience|url=http://www.westminster.edu/staff/brennie/RennieCSSR28.3.pdf|website=Westminster|publisher=ATLAS|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Note:  Smart categorised 1–3 as para-historical and 4–6 as historical.

==Legacy==
Smart’s contribution to Religious Studies continues to influence curricula, syllabi and methodology. In particular, his "dimensions of religion," a framework for comparing religions, has been influential within the academy. His willingness to take seriously what others saw as "illegitimate," such as ideologies and new religious movements, did much to allow Religious Studies to distinguish itself from theology and from any charge of privileging any particular faith or version of a faith. Hecht commented that, "When the definitive history of the study of religion in the 20th century is written..." Ninian Smart "will certainly be seen as a giant among his peers" since Smart's "many books opened religion to scholar and layperson alike".&lt;ref name="Hecht"/&gt; The Ninian Smart Annual Memorial Lecture, created in his honour, alternates between Lancaster and Santa Barbara. At Loyola, he is honoured by the Ninian Smart Award for Excellence in Religious Studies. In April 2001, the Santa Barbara Templeton Research Lecture series was dedicated to the memory of Smart, and a commemorative plaque was presented to the Smart family. He had been due to deliver a Templeton lecture himself.

==Personal life==
Smart married [[Libushka Baruffaldi]] in 1954. Their children were Roderick, Luisabel, Caroline and Peregrine. Smart had eight grandchildren at the time of his death.

Libushka was originally from [[Lake Como]], [[Italy]], where Smart regularly spent his summer vacations at his family home. Ninian and Libushka were the first from the Western academy to have their marriage blessed by [[Sun Myung Moon]] and [[Hak Ja Han|Mrs. Moon]] in August 1992.

Towards the end of his life, Smart described himself as a "Buddhist-[[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]", saying, "No religion, it seems to me, contains the whole truth. I think it's mad to think that there is nothing to learn from other traditions and civilizations. If you accept that other religions have something to offer and you learn from them, that is what you become: a Buddhist-Episcopalian or a Hindu-Muslim or whatever".&lt;ref name="London"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2746">'''Online aggregation''' is a technique for improving the interactive behavior of [[database systems]] processing expensive analytical queries. Almost all [[database]] operations are performed in batch mode, i.e. the user issues a query and waits till the database has finished processing the entire query. On the contrary, using online aggregation, the user gets estimates of an [[Aggregate function|aggregate query]] in an online fashion as soon as the query is issued. For example, if the final answer is 1000, after k seconds, the user gets the estimates in form of a confidence interval like [990, 1020] with 95% probability. This confidence keeps on shrinking as the system gets more and more samples. 

Online aggregation was proposed in 1997 by Hellerstein, Haas and Wang&lt;ref name=OLA-Hellerstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hellerstein|first1=Joseph M.|last2=Haas|first2=Peter J.|last3=Wang|first3=Helen J.|authorlink1=Joseph M. Hellerstein|title=Online aggregation|journal=SIGMOD Rec.|date=June 1997|volume=26|pages=171–182|doi=10.1145/253262.253291}}&lt;/ref&gt; for group-by aggregation queries over a single table. Later, the authors showed how to evaluate joins in an online fashion.&lt;ref name=RippleJoin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=Peter|last2=Hellerstein|first2=Joseph M.|title=Ripple joins for online aggregation|journal=SIGMOD Rec.|date=June 1999|volume=28|issue=2|pages=287–298|doi=10.1145/304181.304208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Jermaine et al. designed and implemented a prototype database system called Database-Online (or DBO) that computes group-by aggregate query over multiple tables in an online and more importantly in a scalable fashion.&lt;ref name=DBO&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jermaine|first1=Chris|last2=Arumugam|first2=Subramanian|last3=Pol|first3=Abhijit|last4=Dobra|first4=Alin|title=Scalable approximate query processing with the DBO engine|journal=SIGMOD|year=2007|pages=725–736|doi=10.1145/1247480.1247560}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the approaches for online aggregation use [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]], which is non-trivial in a distributed environment due to [[Renewal_theory#The_inspection_paradox|inspection paradox]] of renewal reward theory. In 2011, Pansare et al. proposed a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] model to deal with the inspection paradox and implemented online aggregation for a [[MapReduce]]-like environment.&lt;ref name=OLA-MapReduce&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pansare|first1=Niketan|last2=Borkar|first2=Vinayak|last3=Jermaine|first3=Chris|last4=Condie|first4=Tyson|title=Online Aggregation for Large MapReduce Jobs|journal=VLDB|date=August 2011|url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/~np6/Papers/OnlineAggregationForLargeMapReduceJobs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8586">[[File:Isolator PA070099a.jpg|thumb|Insulator of a telephone transmission line]]
A '''pin insulator''' is a device that isolates a wire from a physical support such as a pin (a wooden or metal dowel of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm diameter with screw threads) on a telegraph or [[utility pole]]. It is a formed, single layer shape that is made out of a non-conducting material, usually porcelain or glass. It is thought to be the earliest developed overhead insulator and is still popularly used in power networks up to 33 KV. Single or multiple pin insulators can be used on one physical support, however, the number of insulators used depends upon the application's voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Electrical Insulator {{!}} Overhead Insulator {{!}} Electrical4u|url=http://www.electrical4u.com/types-of-electrical-insulator-overhead-insulator/|website=www.electrical4u.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pin insulators are one of three types of overhead insulators, the others being Strain insulators and Suspension insulators. Unlike the others, pin insulators are directly connected to the physical support compared to being suspended from the wire. Pin insulators are shaped to allow the secure attachment of the conducting wire and avoid it coming adrift. The wire is usually attached to the insulator by being wrapped around it or in other circumstances, fixed into grooves on the insulator itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Electrical Insulator {{!}} Overhead Insulator {{!}} Electrical4u|url=http://www.electrical4u.com/types-of-electrical-insulator-overhead-insulator/|website=www.electrical4u.com|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When insulator is wet, its outer surface becomes conducting making the insulator less effective. The insulator has an umbrella-like design so that it can protect the lower part of the insulator from rain. To keep the inner side of the insulator dry, ridges around the insulator, "rain sheds" are made. These increase the [[creepage distance]] from energized wire to mounting pin.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artificial rain test of outdoor long rod insulators (PDF Download Available)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234035283_Artificial_rain_test_of_outdoor_long_rod_insulators|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collecting pin insulators==
Pin insulators have become [[Collectable|collectible items]]. All glass pin insulators are assigned a Consolidated Design (CD) number, a system first implemented by hobbyist N.R. Woodward in 1954. Each CD number corresponds to a specific glass style, shape or manufacturer. Also, CD numbers are only hobby-specific for collectors, and are not used or recognised by insulator manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/hall_of_fame/bios/n_r_woodward.htm|title=2012 NIA Hall of Fame Inductee, Nathan R. Woodward|last=|first=|date=|website=nia.org|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Insulators, at the time of manufacturing, were simply viewed as an engineering product and were not meant to be an entertainment product for spectators. This meant that the quality of the insulators was not a primary concern of the manufacturers that made them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insulators|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/tools-and-hardware/insulators|website=Collectors Weekly|accessdate=19 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished product was usually discoloured from impurities and foreign objects diffused within the molten glass and metal moulds. These impurities give the insulator a unique character and high value as collectors would rather obtain an imperfect product rather than a perfect, common product. Impurities in the glass can create amber swirls; milk swirls; graphite inclusions and two or three-tone insulators. Foreign objects contained within the glass are known to be nails; pennies and screws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/history_and_guide/index.htm|title=A History and Guide to North American Pintype Insulators|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although glass insulators are the most popular for the majority of collectors, a number of people collect porcelain insulators as well. These also come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porcelain Insulator Collectors Reference Site|url=http://www.insulators.info/porcelain/|website=www.insulators.info|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are clubs in the US that are dedicated to collecting pin insulators. A list of these clubs by US State can be found at http://www.insulators.info/clubs/ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insulator Clubs|url=http://www.insulators.info/clubs/|website=www.insulators.info|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
[[Image:145CREB-pole.jpg|thumb|150px|A sparkling CD145 or "beehive" insulator, from the telegraph era, made by the Brookfield Glass Company circa 1882]]
[[Image:CREB145 7 Olean 2.jpg|thumb|The same snowy CREB 145 sitting on its side]]
One of the major US manufacturers that produced glass insulators during the 19th century and early 20th century in the USA was [[Brookfield Glass Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassbottlemarks.com/brookfield-glass-company/|title=Brookfield Glass Company|last=|first=|date=|website=www.glassbottlemarks.com|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that Brookfield may have had poor quality control as their insulators seem to be found with the most imperfections, however, this could be disputed.

Another major US manufacturer that produced glass insulators was The [[Hemingray Glass Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassbottlemarks.com/hemingray/|title=Hemingray Glass Company|last=|first=|date=|website=www.glassbottlemarks.com|publisher=|access-date=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known for producing the most variety of colors. Some examples of colors that the company produced are: yellow, golden yellow, butterscotch, glowing orange, amber, whiskey amber, "root beer" amber, orange-amber, red-amber, oxblood, green, lime green, sage green, depression green, emerald green, olive green, yellow-olive green, aqua, cornflower blue, electric blue, cobalt blue, sapphire blue, glowing peacock blue, and many others. Different colors were produced to allow two or more different utility companies to quickly identify which wires were theirs by the color of insulator if multiple wires were strung over the same utility pole. For example, one company may have a string of amber insulators, while another, on the same poles, might have their insulators in cobalt blue.

There are many manufacturers in the US, Canada and international countries that can be found embossed on all styles of insulators. A non-comprehensive list of these manufacturers is below:

In [[botany]], a '''section''' ({{lang-la|sectio}}) is a [[taxonomic rank]] below the [[genus]], but above the [[species]].&lt;ref name="Stuessy"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tod F. Stuessy |year=2009 |title=Plant Taxonomy: the Systematic Evaluation of Comparative Data |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-14712-5 |chapter=The Genus |pages=163–171 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bYs8F0Mb9gC&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenus, if present, is higher than the section, and the rank of [[Series (botany)|series]], if present, is below the section. Sections may in turn be divided into subsections.&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 in {{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG|isbn=978-3-87429-425-6|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections are typically used to help organise very large genera, which may have hundreds of species.&lt;ref name="Stuessy"/&gt; A botanist wanting to distinguish groups of species may prefer to create a taxon at the rank of section or series to avoid making [[combinatio nova|new combinations]], i.e. many new [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]] for the species involved.&lt;ref name="Stuessy"/&gt;

Examples:
* ''[[Lilium]]'' section ''Martagon'' &lt;small&gt;Rchb.&lt;/small&gt; are the Turks' cap lilies
* ''[[Plagiochila]] aerea'' &lt;small&gt;Taylor&lt;/small&gt; is the [[type species]] of ''Plagiochila'' sect. ''Bursatae''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1596">The term '''''seriation''''' [mise en série] was proposed for use in [[semiotics]] by [[Jean Molino]] and derived from classical [[philology]]. Seriation "invokes the idea that any investigator, in order to assign some plausible meaning to a given phenomenon, must interpret it within a ''series'' of comparable phenomena." One cannot interpret what philology calls a ''hapax''; that is, an isolated phenomenon. Art historian Erwin Panofsky has explained the situation in very clear terms:
*'Whether we deal with historical or natural phenomena, the individual observation of phenomena assumes the character of a 'fact' only when it can be related to other, analogous observations in such a way that the whole series 'makes sense.' This 'sense' is, therefore, fully capable of being applied, as a control, to the interpretation of a new individual observation within the same range of phenomena. If, however, this new individual observation definitely refuses to be interpreted according to the 'sense' of the series, and if an error proves to be impossible, the 'sense' of the series will have to be reformulated to include the new individual observation' (1955, p.&amp;nbsp;35)" (1990, pp.&amp;nbsp;230–231).

A seriation is determined by the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].

'''Sheet music''' is a handwritten or printed form of [[music notation]] that uses [[List of musical symbols|modern musical symbols]] to indicate the pitches (melodies), [[rhythm]]s or [[chord (music)|chord]]s of a [[song]] or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs &amp;ndash; printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages &amp;ndash; the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on [[computer screen]]s and the development of [[scorewriter]] computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, "play back" the notated music using a [[synthesizer]] or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]].

Use of the term "sheet" is intended to differentiate written or printed forms of music from [[sound recording]]s (on [[vinyl record]], [[compact cassette|cassette]], [[Compact disc|CD]]), radio or TV broadcasts or recorded live performances, which may capture film or video footage of the performance as well as the audio component. In everyday use, "sheet music" (or simply "music") can refer to the print publication of commercial sheet music in conjunction with the release of a new [[Movie|film]], [[TV show]], [[record album]], or other special or popular event which involves music. The first printed sheet music made with a [[printing press]] was made in 1473.

Sheet music is the basic form in which Western [[classical music]] is notated so that it can be learned and performed by solo singers or instrumentalists or [[musical ensemble]]s. Many forms of [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music|popular]] Western music are commonly learned by singers and musicians "by ear", rather than by using sheet music (although in many cases, traditional and pop music may also be available in sheet music form).

The term ''score'' is a common alternative (and more generic) term for sheet music, and there are several types of scores, as discussed below. The term ''score'' can also refer to [[theatre music]], [[orchestra]]l music or [[song]]s written for a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[musical theatre|musical]], [[opera]] or [[ballet]], or to music or songs written for a [[television program]]me or [[Movie|film]]; for the last of these, see [[Film score]].

==Elements==
[[File:Hector Berlioz, Béatrice et Bénédict score title page - Restoration.jpg|thumb|The title page for the first-edition vocal score for [[Hector Berlioz]]'s ''[[Béatrice et Bénédict]]''.]]

===Title and credit===
Sheet music from the 20th and 21st century typically indicates the title of the song or composition on a [[title page]] or cover, or on the top of the first page, if there is no title page or cover. If the song or piece is from a [[movie]], [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]], or [[opera]], the title of the main work from which the song/piece is taken may be indicated.

If the [[songwriter]] or [[composer]] is known, her or his name is typically indicated along with the title. The sheet music may also indicate the name of the [[lyrics|lyric-writer]], if the lyrics are by a person other than one of the songwriters or composers. It may also the name of the [[arranger]], if the song or piece has been arranged for the publication. No songwriter or composer name may be indicated for old [[folk music]], [[traditional music|traditional]] songs in genres such as [[blues]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and very old traditional [[hymn]]s and [[spirituals]], because for this music, the authors are often unknown; in such cases, the word ''Traditional'' is often placed where the composer's name would ordinarily go.

===Musical notation===
The type of [[musical notation]] varies a great deal by genre or style of music. In most [[classical music]], the [[melody]] and [[accompaniment]] parts (if present) are notated on the lines of a [[staff (music)|staff]] using round note heads. In classical sheet music, the staff typically contains:

# a [[clef]], such as [[bass clef]] {{music|bass}} or [[treble clef]] {{music|treble}}
# a [[key signature]] indicating the [[key (music)|key]]—for instance, a key signature with three [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] {{music|a major}} is typically used for the key of either [[A major]] or [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|sharp}} minor]]
# a [[time signature]], which typically has two numbers aligned vertically with the bottom number indicating the [[note value]] that represents one [[Beat (music)|beat]] and the top number indicating how many beats are in a [[Bar (music)|bar]]—for instance, a time signature of {{music|time|2|4|}} indicates that there are two [[quarter note]]s (crochets) per bar.

Most songs and pieces from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1750) onward indicate the piece's [[tempo]] using an [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|expression]]—often in Italian—such as ''Allegro'' (fast) or ''Grave'' (slow) as well as its [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness or softness). The [[lyrics]], if present, are written near the melody notes. However, music from the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) or earlier eras may have neither a tempo marking nor a dynamic indication. The singers and musicians of that era were expected to know what tempo and loudness to play or sing a given song or piece due to their musical experience and knowledge. In the [[contemporary classical music]] era (20th and 21st century), and in some cases before (such as the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period in German-speaking regions), composers often used their native language for tempo indications, rather than Italian (e.g., "fast" or "''schnell''") or added [[metronome]] markings (e.g., {{music|quarternote}} = 100 beats per minute).

[[File:DwtkII-as-dur-fuga.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|A page from the autograph score of Fugue No. 17 in A{{music|flat}} major from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.]]

These conventions of classical music notation, and in particular the use of English tempo instructions, are also used for sheet music versions of 20th and 21st century [[popular music]] songs. Popular music songs often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "uptempo rock". Pop songs often contain chord names above the staff using letter names (e.g., C Maj, F Maj, G7, etc.), so that an [[acoustic guitar]]ist or pianist can improvise a chordal [[accompaniment]].

In other styles of music, different musical notation methods may be used. In [[jazz]], while most professional performers can read "classical"-style notation, many jazz tunes are notated using [[chord chart]]s, which indicate the [[chord progression]] of a song (e.g., C, A7, d minor, G7, etc.) and its [[song form|form]]. Members of a jazz [[rhythm section]] (a [[jazz piano|piano]] player, [[jazz guitar]]ist and [[jazz bass|bassist]]) use the chord chart to guide their [[jazz improvisation|improvised]] [[accompaniment]] parts, while the "lead instruments" in a jazz group, such as a [[saxophone]] player or [[trumpet]]er, use the chord changes to guide their solo improvisation. Like popular music songs, jazz tunes often indicate both the tempo and genre: "slow blues" or "fast bop".

Professional [[country music]] [[session musician]]s typically use music notated in the [[Nashville Number System]], which indicates the chord progression using numbers (this enables [[bandleader]]s to change the key at a moment's notice). Chord charts using letter names, numbers, or [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]] (e.g., I–IV–V) are also widely used for notating music by [[blues]], [[R&amp;B]], [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musicians. Some chord charts do not provide any rhythmic information, but others use slashes to indicate beats of a bar and [[rhythm]] notation to indicate [[syncopation|syncopated]] "hits" that the songwriter wants all of the band to play together. Many guitar players and [[electric bass]] players learn songs and note tunes using [[tablature]], which is a graphic representation of which frets and strings the performer should play. "Tab" is widely used by rock music and heavy metal guitarists. Singers in many [[popular music]] styles learn a song using only a lyrics sheet, learning the melody "by ear" from the recording.

== Purpose and use ==
[[File:Oregon, My Oregon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The sheet music for the song "[[Oregon, My Oregon]]".]]
Sheet music can be used as a record of, a guide to, or a means to perform, a [[song]] or piece of music. Sheet music enables instrumental performers who are able to read [[music notation]] (a pianist, [[orchestra|orchestral instrument players]], a [[jazz]] band, etc.) or singers to perform a song or piece. In [[classical music]], authoritative musical information about a piece can be gained by studying the written [[Sketch (music)|sketches]] and early versions of compositions that the composer might have retained, as well as the final autograph score and personal markings on proofs and printed scores.

Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of literacy: the ability to read [[music notation]]. An ability to read or write music is not a requirement to compose music. There have been a number of [[composer]]s and [[songwriter]]s who have been capable of producing music without the capacity themselves to read or write in musical notation, as long as an [[amanuensis]] of some sort is available to write down the [[melody|melodies]] they think of. Examples include the blind 18th-century composer [[John Stanley (composer)|John Stanley]] and the 20th-century songwriters [[Lionel Bart]], [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. As well, in [[traditional music]] styles such as the [[blues]] and [[folk music]], there are many prolific songwriters who could not read music, and instead played and sang music "by ear".

The skill of [[sight reading]] is the ability of a musician to perform an unfamiliar work of music upon viewing the sheet music for the first time. Sight reading ability is expected of professional musicians and serious amateurs who play classical music, jazz and related forms. An even more refined skill is the ability to look at a new piece of music and hear most or all of the sounds ([[Melody|melodies]], [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[timbre]]s, etc.) in one's head without having to play the piece or hear it played or sung. Skilled composers and conductors have this ability, with [[Beethoven]] being a noted historical example.
[[File:Full score.jpg|thumb|A [[Conductor (music)|conductor]]'s score and [[Baton (conducting)|baton]]|left]]
Classical musicians playing [[orchestra]]l works, [[chamber music]], [[sonata]]s and singing [[choral]] works ordinarily have the sheet music in front of them on a [[music stand]] when performing (or held in front of them in a music folder, in the case of a [[choir]]), with the exception of solo instrumental performances of solo pieces, [[concerto]]s, or solo vocal pieces ([[art song]], [[opera]] [[aria]]s, etc.), where memorization is expected. In [[jazz]], which is mostly [[improvisation|improvised]], sheet music (called a ''[[lead sheet]]'' in this context) is used to give basic indications of [[melody|melodies]], [[chord (music)|chord]] changes, and [[arrangement]]s. Even when a jazz band has a lead sheet, chord chart or arranged music, many elements of a performance are improvised.

Handwritten or printed music is less important in other traditions of musical practice, however, such as [[traditional music]] and [[folk music]], in which singers and instrumentalists typically learn songs "by ear" or from having a song or tune taught to them by another person. Although much [[popular music]] is published in notation of some sort, it is quite common for people to [[Learning music by ear|learn a song by ear]]. This is also the case in most forms of western [[folk music]], where songs and dances are passed down by oral &amp;ndash; and aural &amp;ndash; tradition. Music of other cultures, both folk and classical, is often transmitted orally, though some non-Western cultures developed their own forms of [[musical notation]] and sheet music as well.

Although sheet music is often thought of as being a platform for new music and an aid to composition (i.e., the composer "writes" the music down), it can also serve as a visual record of music that already exists. Scholars and others have made transcriptions to render Western and non-Western music in readable form for study, analysis and re-creative performance. This has been done not only with folk or traditional music (e.g., [[Béla Bartók|Bartók's]] volumes of [[Magyars|Magyar]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] folk music), but also with sound recordings of improvisations by musicians (e.g., [[jazz piano]]) and performances that may only partially be based on notation.  An exhaustive example of the latter in recent times is the collection ''The Beatles: Complete Scores'' (London: Wise Publications, 1993), which seeks to transcribe into [[Staff (music)|staves]] and [[tablature]] all the songs as recorded by [[the Beatles]] in instrumental and vocal detail.

==Types==&lt;!--[[Short score]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
Modern sheet music may come in different formats. If a piece is composed for just one instrument or voice (such as a piece for a solo instrument or for ''[[a cappella]]'' solo voice), the whole work may be written or printed as one piece of sheet music. If an instrumental piece is intended to be performed by more than one person, each performer will usually have a separate piece of sheet music, called a [[Part (music)|''part'']], to play from. This is especially the case in the publication of works requiring more than four or so performers, though invariably a ''full score'' is published as well. The sung parts in a vocal work are not usually issued separately today, although this was historically the case, especially before music printing made sheet music widely available.

Sheet music can be issued as individual pieces or works (for example, a popular song or a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] sonata), in collections (for example works by one or several composers), as pieces performed by a given artist, etc.

When the separate instrumental and vocal parts of a musical work are printed together, the resulting sheet music is called a ''score''. Conventionally, a score consists of [[musical notation]] with each instrumental or vocal part in vertical alignment (meaning that concurrent events in the notation for each part are orthographically arranged). The term ''score'' has also been used to refer to sheet music written for only one performer. The distinction between ''score'' and ''part'' applies when there is more than one part needed for performance.

Scores come in various formats.

=== Full scores, variants, and condensations {{anchor|full score}} ===

A '''full score''' is a large book showing the music of all instruments or voices in a composition lined up in a fixed order. It is large enough for a [[Conducting|conductor]] to be able to read while directing [[orchestra]] or [[opera]] rehearsals and performances. In addition to their practical use for conductors leading ensembles, full scores are also used by [[musicologist]]s, [[music theory|music theorists]], [[composer]]s and music students who are studying a given work.

A '''miniature score''' is like a full score but much reduced in size. It is too small for use in a performance by a conductor, but handy for studying a piece of music, whether it be for a large ensemble or a solo performer. A miniature score may contain some introductory remarks.

A '''study score''' is sometimes the same size as, and often indistinguishable from, a miniature score, except in name. Some study scores are [[Octavo (book)|octavo]] size and are thus somewhere between full and miniature score sizes. A study score, especially when part of an anthology for academic study, may include extra comments about the music and markings for learning purposes.

A '''piano score''' (or [[reduction (music)|'''piano reduction''']]) is a more or less literal [[Transcription (music)|transcription]] for piano of a piece intended for many performing parts, especially orchestral works; this can include purely instrumental sections within large vocal works (see ''vocal score'' immediately below). Such arrangements are made for either piano solo (two hands) or piano [[duet]] (one or two pianos, four hands). Extra small staves are sometimes added at certain points in piano scores for two hands to make the presentation more complete, though it is usually impractical or impossible to include them while playing.

As with vocal score (below), it takes considerable skill to reduce an orchestral score to such smaller forms because the reduction needs to be not only playable on the keyboard but also thorough enough in its presentation of the intended [[Harmony|harmonies]], [[Texture (music)|textures]], [[Figuration (music)|figurations]], etc. Sometimes markings are included to show which instruments are playing at given points.

While piano scores are usually not meant for performance outside of study and pleasure ([[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|concert transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies]] being one group of notable exceptions), [[ballet]]s get the most practical benefit from piano scores because with one or two pianists they allow the ballet to do many rehearsals at a much lower cost, before an [[orchestra]] has to be hired for the final rehearsals. Piano scores can also be used to train beginning conductors, who can conduct a pianist playing a piano reduction of a symphony; this is much less costly than conducting a full orchestra. Piano scores of operas do not include separate staves for the vocal parts, but they may add the sung text and stage directions above the music.

A [[Part (music)|'''part''']] is an extraction from the full score of a particular instrument's part. It is used by orchestral players in performance, where the full score would be too cumbersome. However, in practice, it can be a substantial document if the work is lengthy, and a particular instrument is playing for much of its duration.
[[File:CuiVil3 2p204.png|thumb|upright=1.5|An excerpt of a piano-vocal score for [[César Cui]]'s opera ''[[William Ratcliff (Cui)|William Ratcliff]]''. {{audio|CuiVil3 2p204.mid|Play}}|left]]

===Vocal scores===
A '''[[vocal score]]''' (or, more properly, '''piano-vocal score''') is a reduction of the full score of a vocal work (e.g., [[opera]], [[Musical theatre|musical]], [[oratorio]], [[cantata]], etc.) to show the vocal parts (solo and [[Choir|choral]]) on their [[musical staff|staves]] and the orchestral parts in a [[Piano Reduction|piano reduction]] (usually for two hands) underneath the vocal parts; the purely orchestral sections of the score are also reduced for piano. If a portion of the work is ''[[a cappella]]'', a piano reduction of the vocal parts is often added to aid in [[rehearsal]] (this often is the case with ''a cappella'' religious sheet music).

Piano-vocal scores serve as a convenient way for vocal soloists and choristers to learn the music and rehearse separately from the orchestra. The vocal score of a [[Musical theatre|musical]] typically does not include the spoken dialogue, except for cues. Piano-vocal scores are used to provide piano accompaniment for the performance of operas, musicals and oratorios by amateur groups and some small-scale professional groups. This may be done by a single piano player or by two piano players. With some 2000s-era musicals, keyboardists may play [[synthesizer]]s instead of piano.
[[File:Chichester-Psalms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A choral score for [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[Chichester Psalms]]''.]]
The related but less common '''choral score''' contains the choral parts with reduced accompaniment.

The comparable '''organ score''' exists as well, usually in association with church music for voices and orchestra, such as arrangements (by later hands) of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. It is like the piano-vocal score in that it includes staves for the vocal parts and reduces the orchestral parts to be performed by one person. Unlike the vocal score, the organ score is sometimes intended by the arranger to substitute for the orchestra in performance if necessary.

A collection of songs from a given [[Musical theatre|musical]] is usually printed under the label '''vocal selections'''. This is different from the vocal score from the same show in that it does not present the complete music, and the piano accompaniment is usually simplified and includes the melody line.

===Other types===
A '''short score''' is a reduction of a work for many instruments to just a few staves. Rather than composing directly in full score, many composers work out some type of short score while they are composing and later expand the complete orchestration. An opera, for instance, may be written first in a short score, then in full score, then reduced to a vocal score for rehearsal. Short scores are often not published; they may be more common for some performance venues (e.g., band) than in others. Because of their preliminary nature, short scores are the principal reference point for those composers wishing to attempt a 'completion' of another's unfinished work (e.g. Movements 2 thru 5 of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|10th Symphony]] or the third Act of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'').

An '''open score''' is a score of a [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] piece showing each voice on a separate staff. In Renaissance or Baroque keyboard pieces, open scores of four staves were sometimes used instead of the more modern convention of one staff per hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Open score|author=Lalage Cochrane|access-date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes synonymous with full score (which may have more than one part per staff).

Scores from the Baroque period (1600-1750) are very often in the form of a [[bass line]] in the bass clef and the melodies played by instrument or sung on an upper stave (or staves) in the treble clef. The bass line typically had figures written above the bass notes indicating which intervals above the bass (e.g., chords) should be played, an approach called ''[[figured bass]]''. The figures indicate which intervals the [[harpsichord]]ist, [[pipe organ]]ist or [[lute]] player should play above each bass note.
[[File:Trifle In Pyjamas lead sheet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The lead sheet for the song "Trifle in Pyjamas"|left]]

===Popular music===
A '''[[lead sheet]]''' specifies only the melody, lyrics and harmony, using one staff with [[chord symbol]]s placed above and lyrics below. It is commonly used in [[popular music]] and in [[jazz]] to capture the essential elements of song without specifying the details of how the song should be arranged or performed.

A '''[[chord chart]]''' (or simply, '''chart''') contains little or no melodic information at all but provides fundamental harmonic information. Some chord charts also indicate the rhythm that should be played, particularly if there is a [[syncopation|syncopated]] series of "hits" that the arranger wants all of the rhythm section to perform. Otherwise, chord charts either leave the rhythm blank or indicate slashes for each beat.

This is the most common kind of written music used by professional [[session musician]]s playing [[jazz]] or other forms of [[Genres (popular music)|popular music]] and is intended for the [[rhythm section]] (usually containing piano, guitar, bass and drums) to improvise their [[accompaniment]] and for any [[jazz improvisation|improvising]] soloists (e.g., [[saxophone]] players or [[trumpet]] players) to use as a reference point for their extemporized lines.

A [[fake book]] is a collection of [[jazz]] songs and tunes with just the basic elements of the music provided. There are two types of fake books: (1) collections of lead sheets, which include the melody, chords, and lyrics (if present), and (2) collections of songs and tunes with only the chords. Fake books that contain only the chords are used by [[rhythm section]] performers (notably chord-playing musicians such as [[electric guitar]]ists and [[piano]] players and the bassist) to help guide their improvisation of [[accompaniment]] parts for the song. Fake books with only the chords can also be used by "lead instruments" (e.g., [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]]) as a guide to their improvised solo performances. Since the melody is not included in chord-only fake books, lead instrument players are expected to know the melody.
[[File:Diatonic scale on C tablature clef.png|thumb|A C major scale in regular notation (above) and in [[tabulature]] for [[guitar]] (below).]]
A '''[[tablature]]''' (or '''tab''') is a special type of musical score &amp;ndash; most typically for a solo instrument &amp;ndash; which shows ''where'' to play the pitches on the given instrument rather than ''which'' pitches to produce, with rhythm indicated as well. Tabulature is widely used in the 2000s for guitar and electric bass songs and pieces in popular music genres such as [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music]]. This type of notation was first used in the late [[Middle Ages]], and it has been used for keyboard (e.g., [[pipe organ]]) and for fretted string instruments (lute, guitar).

== History ==

===Precursors to sheet music===
[[Musical notation]] was developed before parchment or paper were used for writing. The earliest form of musical notation can be found in a [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablet that was created at [[Nippur]], in [[Sumer]] (today's [[Iraq]]) in about 2,000 BC. The tablet represents fragmentary instructions for performing music, that the music was composed in harmonies of thirds, and that it was written using a [[diatonic scale]].&lt;ref name="Kilmer1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kilmer |first1=Anne D. |date=1986 |title=Old Babylonian Musical Instructions Relating to Hymnody |jstor=1359953 |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |publisher=The American Schools of Oriental Research  |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=94–98 |doi=10.2307/1359953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tablet from about 1,250 BC shows a more developed form of notation.&lt;ref name="Kilmer 1965"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kilmer |first=Anne D. |editor1-last=Güterbock |editor1-first=Hans G. |editor2-last=Jacobsen |editor2-first=Thorkild |date=21 April 1965 |title=The Strings of Musical Instruments: their Names, Numbers, and Significance |url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/as16.pdf |journal=Assyriological Studies |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |volume=16 |pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the interpretation of the notation system is still controversial, it is clear that the notation indicates the names of strings on a [[lyre]], the tuning of which is described in other tablets.&lt;ref name="West 1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=M.L. |author-link1=Martin Litchfield West |date=1994 |title=The Babylonian Musical Notation and the Hurrian Melodic Texts |jstor=737674  |journal=[[Music &amp; Letters]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=161–179 |doi=10.1093/ml/75.2.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are fragmentary, these tablets represent the earliest notated [[melody|melodies]] found anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="West 1994" /&gt;

[[File:Delphichymn.jpg|thumb|The original stone at Delphi containing the second of the two [[Delphic Hymns]] to [[Apollo]]. The music notation is the line of occasional symbols ''above'' the main, uninterrupted line of Greek lettering.|left]]
[[Music of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] musical notation was in use from at least the 6th century BC until approximately the 4th century AD; several complete compositions and fragments of compositions using this notation survive. The notation consists of symbols placed above text syllables. An example of a complete composition is the [[Seikilos epitaph]], which has been variously dated between the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD.

In [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]], three hymns by [[Mesomedes]] of [[Crete]] exist in manuscript. One of the oldest known examples of music notation is a papyrus fragment of the Hellenic era play ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' (408 BC) has been found, which contains musical notation for a choral ode. Ancient Greek notation appears to have fallen out of use around the time of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]].

===Western manuscript notation===
Before the 15th century, Western music was written by hand and preserved in [[manuscript]]s, usually bound in large volumes. The best-known examples of Middle Ages music notation are medieval manuscripts of [[Monophony|monophonic]] [[chant]]. Chant notation indicated the notes of the chant melody, but without any indication of the rhythm. In the case of [[Medieval music|Medieval]] [[polyphony]], such as the [[motet]], the parts were written in separate portions of facing pages. This process was aided by the advent of [[mensural notation]], which also indicated the [[rhythm]] and was paralleled by the medieval practice of composing parts of [[polyphony]] sequentially, rather than simultaneously (as in later times). Manuscripts showing parts together in score format were rare and limited mostly to [[organum]], especially that of the [[Notre Dame school]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], if an [[Abbess]] wanted to have a copy of an existing composition, such as a composition owned by an Abbess in another town, she would have to hire a [[copyist]] to do the task by hand, which would be a lengthy process and one that could lead to transcription errors.

Even after the advent of music printing in the mid-1400s, much music continued to exist solely in composers' hand-written manuscripts well into the 18th century.

===Printing===
{{see also|History of music publishing|Music engraving}}

====15th century====
There were several difficulties in translating the new [[printing press]] technology to music. In the first printed book to include music, the ''[[Mainz Psalter]]'' (1457), the music notation (both staff lines and notes) was added in by hand. This is similar to the room left in other [[Incunabulum|incunabulae]] for [[Capital letters|capitals]]. The psalter was printed in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], and one now resides in [[Windsor Castle]] and another at the [[British Library]]. Later, staff lines were printed, but scribes still added in the rest of the music by hand. The greatest difficulty in using [[movable type]] to print music is that all the elements must line up &amp;ndash; the note head must be properly aligned with the staff. In vocal music, text must be aligned with the proper notes (although at this time, even in manuscripts, this was not a high priority).

[[Music engraving]] is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The first machine-printed music appeared around 1473, approximately 20 years after [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] introduced the [[printing press]]. In 1501, [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] published ''[[Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A]]'', which contained 96 pieces of printed music. Petrucci's printing method produced clean, readable, elegant music, but it was a long, difficult process that required three separate passes through the printing press. Petrucci later developed a process which required only two passes through the press. But it was still taxing since each pass required very precise alignment for the result to be legible (i.e., so that the note heads would be correctly lined up with the staff lines). This was the first well-distributed printed polyphonic music. Petrucci also printed the first [[tablature]] with movable type. Single impression printing, in which the staff lines and notes could be printed in one pass, first appeared in London around 1520. [[Pierre Attaingnant]] brought the technique into wide use in 1528, and it remained little changed for 200 years.
[[File:Petrucci2.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece to Petrucci's Odhecaton]]

A common format for issuing multi-part, polyphonic music during the Renaissance was ''[[partbook]]s''. In this format, each voice-part for a collection of five-part [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]], for instance, would be printed separately in its own book, such that all five part-books would be needed to perform the music. The same partbooks could be used by singers or instrumentalists. Scores for multi-part music were rarely printed in the Renaissance, although the use of score format as a means to compose parts simultaneously (rather than successively, as in the late Middle Ages) is credited to [[Josquin des Prez]].

The effect of printed music was similar to the effect of the printed word, in that information spread faster, more efficiently, at a lower cost, and to more people than it could through laboriously hand-copied manuscripts. It had the additional effect of encouraging amateur musicians of sufficient means, who could now afford sheet music, to perform. This in many ways affected the entire [[music industry]]. Composers could now write more music for amateur performers, knowing that it could be distributed and sold to the [[middle class]].

This meant that composers did not have to depend solely on the patronage of wealthy aristocrats. Professional players could have more music at their disposal and they could access music from different countries. It increased the number of amateurs, from whom professional players could then earn money by teaching them. Nevertheless, in the early years, the cost of printed music limited its distribution. Another factor that limited the impact of printed music was that in many places, the right to print music was granted by the monarch, and only those with a special dispensation were allowed to do so, giving them a [[monopoly]]. This was often an honour (and economic boon) granted to favoured court musicians or composers.

====16th century====
Mechanical [[Engraving|plate engraving]] was developed in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although plate engraving had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century, [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html |title = Music Engraving |date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014 |website = G. Henle Publishers |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As musical composition increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate musical scores. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

====19th century====
[[File:Tinpanalley.jpg|thumb|left|Buildings of New York City's [[Tin Pan Alley]] music publishing district in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/insearch/tinpanalley/tinpanalley.php |title=America's Music Publishing Industry — The story of Tin Pan Alley |website=The Parlor Songs Academy }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 19th century, the music industry was dominated by sheet music publishers. In the United States, the sheet music industry rose in tandem with [[blackface minstrelsy]]. The group of New York City-based music publishers, songwriters and composers dominating the industry was known as "[[Tin Pan Alley]]". In the mid-19th century, [[copyright]] control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit.  New York City publishers concentrated on vocal music. The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers &amp;ndash; often connected with commercial printers or music stores &amp;ndash; continued to flourish throughout the country. An extraordinary number of East European immigrants became the music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley-the most famous being [[Irving Berlin]]. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

The late-19th century saw a massive explosion of [[parlor music]], with ownership of, and skill at playing the [[piano]] becoming ''de rigueur'' for the middle-class family. In the late-19th century, if a middle-class family wanted to hear a popular new song or piece, they would buy the sheet music and then perform the song or piece in an amateur fashion in their home. But in the early 20th century the [[phonograph]] and recorded music grew greatly in importance. This, joined by the growth in popularity of [[radio broadcasting]] from the 1920s on, lessened the importance of the sheet music publishers. The [[record industry]] eventually replaced the sheet music publishers as the music industry's largest force.

===20th century and early 21st century===
[[File:Screenshot general 3 large.png|thumb|The screenshot from a 2000s-era [[scorewriter]] program. While the first scorewriter programs from the 1980s had poor-quality notation, 2016-era scorewriters provide professional-looking music notation.]]
In the late 20th and into the 21st century, significant interest has developed in representing sheet music in a computer-readable format (see [[Scorewriter|music notation software]]), as well as downloadable files. [[Music OCR]], software to "read" scanned sheet music so that the results can be manipulated, has been available since 1991.

In 1998, virtual sheet music evolved further into what was to be termed [[digital sheet music]], which for the first time allowed publishers to make copyright sheet music available for purchase online. Unlike their hard copy counterparts, these files allowed for manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and [[MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) playback. The popularity of this instant delivery system among musicians appears to be acting as a catalyst of new growth for the industry well into the foreseeable future.

An early computer notation program available for home computers was [[Music Construction Set]], developed in 1984 and released for several different platforms. Introducing concepts largely unknown to the home user of the time, it allowed manipulation of notes and symbols with a pointing device such as a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]; the user would "grab" a note or symbol from a palette and "[[Drag and drop|drop]]" it onto the staff in the correct location. The program allowed playback of the produced music through various early sound cards, and could print the musical score on a graphics printer.

Many software products for modern [[digital audio workstation]] and [[List of scorewriters|scorewriters]] for general personal computers support generation of sheet music from MIDI files, by a performer playing the notes on a MIDI-equipped keyboard or other [[MIDI controller]] or by manual entry using a mouse or other computer device.

In 1999, [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] invented a system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6348648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connick's invention is a device with a computer screen which is used to show the sheet music for the musicians in an orchestra instead of the more commonly used paper. Connick uses this system when touring with his [[big band]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2002/03/07.6.shtml |title=Harry Connick Jr. Uses Macs at Heart of New Music Patent |publisher=The Mac Observer |date=2002-03-07 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the classical music world, some [[string quartet]] groups use computer screen-based parts. There are several advantages to computer-based parts. Since the score is on a computer screen, the user can adjust the contrast, brightness and even the size of the notes, to make reading easier. In addition, some systems will do "page turns" using a foot pedal, which means that the performer does not have to miss playing music during a page turn, as often occurs with paper parts.

Of special practical interest for the general public is the [[Mutopia project]], an effort to create a library of [[public domain]] sheet music, comparable to [[Project Gutenberg]]'s library of public domain books. The [[International Music Score Library Project]] (IMSLP) is also attempting to create a virtual library containing all [[public domain]] musical scores, as well as scores from composers who are willing to share their music with the world free of charge.

Some [[scorewriter]] computer programs have a feature that is very useful for composers and arrangers: the ability to "play back" the notated music using [[synthesizer]] sounds or [[virtual instrumentation|virtual instruments]]. Due to the high cost of hiring a full symphony orchestra to play a new composition, before the development of these computer programs, many composers and arrangers were only able to hear their orchestral works by arranging them for piano, organ or string quartet. While a scorewiter program's playback will not contain the nuances of a professional orchestra recording, it still conveys a sense of the tone colors created by the piece and of the interplay of the different parts.

'''Simulation Open Framework Architecture''' ('''SOFA''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Allard|first1=Jérémie|last2=Cotin|first2=Stéphane|last3=Faure|first3=François|last4=Bensoussan|first4=Pierre-Jean|last5=Poyer|first5=François|last6=Duriez|first6=Christian|last7=Delingette|first7=Hervé|last8=Grisoni|first8=Laurent|title=SOFA - an Open Source Framework for Medical Simulation|booktitle=Medicine Meets Virtual Reality (MMVR'15)|date=2007|url=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00319416/document|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source framework primarily targeted at real-time [[physical simulation]], with an emphasis on '''medical simulation'''. &lt;br/&gt;
It is mostly intended for the research community to help develop newer algorithms, but can also be used as an efficient prototyping tool or as a [[physics engine]].

==Features==
Based on an advanced software architecture, SOFA allows users to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sofa-framework.org/about/features/|title=SOFA Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Create '''complex and evolving simulations''' by combining new algorithms with existing algorithms
* Modify most parameters of the simulation (deformable behavior, surface representation, solver, constraints, collision algorithm, ...) by simply editing a XML file
* Build complex models from simpler ones using a [[scene graph]] description
* Efficiently simulate the dynamics of interacting objects using '''abstract equation solvers'''
* Reuse and easily compare a variety of available methods
* Transparently '''parallelize''' complex computations using semantics based on data dependencies
* Use new generations of GPUs through the CUDA API to greatly improve computation times

===Scene graph===
A key aspect of SOFA is the use of a [[scene graph]] to organize and process the elements of a simulation while clearly separating the computation tasks from their possibly parallel scheduling. The description of a SOFA simulation can easily be done in an '''XML file'''. For even more flexibility, a Python plugin allows scripting simulations using the Python language. &lt;br/&gt;
Basically, a SOFA scene-graph is composed with:
* '''Nodes''': used to categorise the components and keep the XML file clean (mechanical node, collision node, visual node, ...)
* '''Components''': main elements used to build a scene (solver component, forcefield component, rendering component, ...)
* '''Datas''': everything that components have to deal with (forces, velocities, positions, ratios, ...)

===Plugins===
To extend its capacities and provide more features, SOFA is bundled with a lot of plugins:
* Drivers for VR / '''haptic''' / simulation devices (Geomagic®, ARTTrack™, Novint® Falcon™…)
* Visualization and simulation of medical images
* Python scripting
* Parallelization:
** Multithreading
** GPU computing using the '''CUDA''' API

==Community==

===SOFA Day===
Organized each year, the SOFA Day is a one-day event dedicated to SOFA. This event is '''open to everyone''' interested in SOFA, from beginner to advanced users. It contains an introduction to SOFA, several tutorials (adapted to the audience) and a large time to experience SOFA with the help of the instructors.

===SOFA Consortium===
Exactly ten years after the first commit in SOFA, [[Inria]] founded the SOFA Consortium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/|title=SOFA Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2015. &lt;br/&gt;
The Consortium missions are to:
* Represent the '''identity of SOFA'''
* Organize and develop the '''community'''
* Distribute and make SOFA more '''stable'''

{{cosmology}}
The '''Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect''' (named after [[Rashid Sunyaev]] and [[Yakov B. Zel'dovich]] and often abbreviated as the '''SZ effect''') is the distortion of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) through [[Compton scattering#Inverse Compton scattering|inverse Compton scattering]] by high energy [[electrons]] in galaxy clusters, in which the low energy CMB [[photons]] receive an average energy boost during collision with the high energy cluster electrons. Observed distortions of the [[cosmic microwave background]] spectrum are used to detect the density perturbations of the universe. Using the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect, dense [[Groups and clusters of galaxies|clusters of galaxies]] have been observed.

== Introduction ==
The Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect can be divided into:

* [[thermal]] effects, where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their temperature
* [[kinematic]] effects, a second-order effect where the CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their bulk motion (also called the '''Ostriker–Vishniac effect''', after [[Jeremiah P. Ostriker]] and [[Ethan Vishniac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ostriker |first=Jeremiah P. |last2=Vishniac |first2=Ethan T. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1986 |title=Effect of gravitational lenses on the microwave background, and 1146+111B,C |journal=Nature |volume=322 |issue=6082 |page=804 |doi=10.1038/322804a0 |bibcode = 1986Natur.322..804O }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]

[[Rashid Sunyaev]] and [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] predicted the effect, and conducted research in 1969, 1972, and 1980. The Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect is of major [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] interest. It can help determine the value of the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]]. To distinguish the SZ effect due to galaxy clusters from ordinary density perturbations, both the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] dependence and the spatial dependence of fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]] are used. Analysis of CMB data at higher angular resolution (high [[multipole|&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-values]]) requires taking into account the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect.

Current research is focused on modelling how the effect is generated by the intracluster plasma in [[galaxy cluster]]s, and on using the effect to estimate the [[Hubble constant]] and to separate different components in the angular average statistics of fluctuations in the background. Hydrodynamic structure formation simulations are being studied to gain data on thermal and kinetic effects in the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cunnama D. |first=Faltenbacher F. |last2=Passmoor S. |first2=Cress C.  |last3=Cress |date=2009 |first3=C. |last4=Passmoor |first4=S. |title=The velocity-shape alignment of clusters and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect |journal=MNRAS Letters |volume=397 |issue=1 |page=L41–L45 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3933.2009.00680.x |bibcode = 2009MNRAS.397L..41C |arxiv = 0904.4765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations are difficult due to the small amplitude of the effect and to confusion with experimental error and other sources of CMB temperature fluctuations. However, since the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect is a scattering effect, its magnitude is independent of redshift. This is very important: it means that clusters at high redshift can be detected just as easily as those at low redshift. Another factor which facilitates high-redshift cluster detection is the [[angular size redshift relation|angular scale versus redshift relation]]: it changes little between redshifts of 0.3 and 2, meaning that clusters between these redshifts have similar sizes on the sky. The use  of surveys of clusters detected by their Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect for the determination of cosmological parameters has been demonstrated by Barbosa et al. (1996). This might help in understanding the dynamics of dark energy in surveys ([[South Pole Telescope]], [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]], ''[[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]'').

'''''The Faith Healers''''' is a 1987 book by magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] with a foreword by [[Carl Sagan]], that documents Randi's exploration of the world of [[faith healing]], and his exposing the [[sleight of hand]] trickery and deceit by its practitioners.

In eighteen chapters Randi explores the origins of faith healing and [[psychic surgery]], and critically analyzes the claims made by [[A. A. Allen]], [[Ernest Angley]], [[Willard Fuller]], [[WV Grant]], [[Peter Popoff]], [[Oral Roberts]], [[Pat Robertson]], and [[Ralph DiOrio]] for his claims of miracles at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in the town of [[Lourdes]]. Randi shows how people are tricked with [[Magician (illusion)|magician's]] tricks under the guise of religion.

In 1988, Earl Hautala in a review wrote "an eye opener for the naïve, this book provides a crash course in the methods of skeptical inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Hautala, Earl. (1988). ''The Faith Healers by James Randi''. [[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]].

'''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Comparative Religion''''' (retitled '''''The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion''''' in its second edition) is a wide-ranging, comparative study of [[mythology]] and [[religion]], written by the Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[James George Frazer]]. ''The Golden Bough'' was first published in two volumes in 1890; in three volumes in 1900; and in twelve volumes in the third edition, published 1906–15. It has also been published in several different one-volume abridgments. The work was aimed at a wide literate audience raised on tales as told in such publications as [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology|The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes]]'' (1855). The influence of ''The Golden Bough'' on contemporary [[European literature]] and thought was substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Karbiener, K. &amp; Stade, G., |title=Encyclopedia of British Writers, 1800 to the Present|volume =2|publisher= Infobase Publishing|date= 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7pVTz46T3cC&amp;pg=PA189#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages= 188–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Mirror Judgement of Paris Louvre Bj1734.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]''—an Etruscan bronze-handled mirror of the fourth or third century BC that relates the often misunderstood myth as interpreted by Frazer, showing the three goddesses giving their apple or [[pomegranate]] to the new king, who must kill the old king - Campana Collection, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Sully]]

Frazer attempted to define the shared elements of religious belief and scientific thought, discussing fertility rites, [[human sacrifice]], the [[dying god]], the [[scapegoat]], and many other symbols and practices whose influences had extended into 20th-century culture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamel, Frazer (Editor)|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[thesis]] is that old religions were [[fertility cult]]s that revolved around the [[worship]] and periodic [[sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]]. Frazer proposed that mankind progresses from [[Magic and religion|magic]] through [[religious belief]] to scientific thought.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Frazer's thesis was developed in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of ''The Golden Bough'', a sacred grove where a certain tree grew day and night. It was a transfigured landscape in a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of [[Nemi]], "[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s Mirror", where religious ceremonies and the "fulfillment of vows" of priests and kings were held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who underwent a mystic marriage to a [[goddess]] of the Earth. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend of rebirth is central to almost all of the world's mythologies.

Frazer based his thesis on the pre-Roman priest-king at the [[wiktionary:fane|fane]] of [[Rex Nemorensis|Nemi]], who was ritually murdered by his successor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first put pen to paper to write ''The Golden Bough'' I had no conception of the magnitude of the voyage on which I was embarking; I thought only to explain a single rule of an ancient Italian priesthood. (''Aftermath'', p. vi)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book's title was taken from an incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', illustrated by Turner, in which [[Aeneas]] and the [[Sibyl]] present the golden bough to the gatekeeper of [[Hades]] to gain admission.

Frazer wrote in a preface to the third edition of ''The Golden Bough'' that while he had never studied [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], his friend James Ward, and the philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], had both suggested to him that Hegel had anticipated his view of "the nature and historical relations of magic and religion". Frazer saw the resemblance as being that "we both hold that in the mental evolution of humanity an age of magic preceded an age of religion, and that the characteristic difference between magic and religion is that, whereas magic aims at controlling nature directly, religion aims at controlling it indirectly through the mediation of a powerful supernatural being or beings to whom man appeals for help and protection." Frazer included an extract from Hegel's ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]]'' (1832).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frazer, James George |title=The Golden Bough.

==Critical reception==
''The Golden Bough'' scandalized the British public when first published, as it included the Christian story of [[Jesus]] and the [[Resurrection]] in its comparative study. Critics thought this treatment invited an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] reading of the [[Lamb of God]] as a relic of a [[pagan]] religion. For the third edition, Frazer placed his analysis of the [[Crucifixion]] in a speculative appendix; the discussion of [[Christianity]] was excluded from the single-volume abridged edition.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Leach, Edmund R. |url= http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |title= Kingship and divinity: The unpublished Frazer Lecture |location= Oxford |origyear= 28 October 1982 |journal= ''HAU: ''Journal of Ethnographic Theory ''1.1'' |date= 2011 |pages= 279–298 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150922093723/http://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau1.1.012/1106 |archivedate= 22 September 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Smith, Jonathan Z. |title= When the bough breaks |work= History of Religions ''12.4'' |date=1973 |pages= 342–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer himself accepted that his theories were speculative and that the associations he made were circumstantial and usually based only on resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=E.C.|last=Cawte|page=38|chapter=It's an Ancient Custom—But How Ancient?|isbn=1850752435|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote: "Books like mine, merely speculation, will be superseded sooner or later (the sooner the better for the sake of truth) by better induction based on fuller knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R. Angus|last=Downie|title=Frazer and the Golden Bough|location=London|publisher=Victor Gallancz|page=112|isbn=978-0-575-00486-3|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, at the inauguration of the [[Frazer Lecture|Frazer Lectureship in Anthropology]], he said: "It is my earnest wish that the lectureship should be used solely for the disinterested pursuit of truth, and not for the dissemination and propagation of any theories or opinions of mine."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey Lienhardt notes that even during Frazer's lifetime, social anthropologists "had for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Robert Ackerman writes that, for British social anthropologists, Frazer is still "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" while they now dissociate themselves "from much that he wrote." While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology. Lienhardt himself dismissed Frazer's interpretations of primitive religion as "little more than plausible constructs of [Frazer's] own Victorian rationalism", while 
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], in his ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'' (1979), wrote: "Frazer is much more savage than most of his 'savages' [since] his explanations of [their] observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances themselves."&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Initially, the book's influence on the emerging discipline of [[anthropology]] was pervasive. For example, the Polish anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]] read Frazer's work in the original English, and afterwards wrote: "No sooner had I read this great work than I became immersed in it and enslaved by it. I realized then that anthropology, as presented by Sir James Frazer, is a great science, worthy of as much devotion as any of her elder and more exact studies and I became bound to the service of Frazerian anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Hays &amp; L.L. Langness (Editor) |title= From Ape to Angel: An Informal History of Social Anthropology |pages= 75, 314 |work= The Study of Culture |location= Corte Madera |publisher= Chandler &amp; Sharp |date= 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1920s, Frazer's ideas "began to belong to the past": {{Quote|In 1922, simultaneously with the publication of the first abridged edition of ''The Golden Bough'', came Malinowski's ''Argonauts of the Western Pacific'' and Radcliffe-Brown's ''The Andaman Islanders'', the first outstanding products of the British field research tradition that Frazer had very actively encouraged. As every first-year student knows, these monographs began to point students towards empirical studies of Frazer's 'savages', who, when spoken to in their own homes and languages, were found to have much more of interest to say for themselves than Frazer had to say about them. The central theme (or, as he thought, theory) of ''The Golden Bough''—that all mankind had evolved intellectually and psychologically from a superstitious belief in magicians, through a superstitious belief in priests and gods, to enlightened belief in scientists—had little or no relevance to the conduct of life in an Andamanese camp or a Melanesian village, and the whole, supposedly scientific, basis of Frazer's anthropology was seen as a misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;}}

[[Edmund Leach]], "one of the most impatient critics of Frazer's overblown prose and literary embellishment of his sources for dramatic effect", was scathing of the [[artistic license]] exercised by Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'', saying: "Frazer used his ethnographic evidence, which he culled from here, there and everywhere, to ''illustrate'' propositions which he had arrived at in advance by ''a priori'' reasoning, but, to a degree which is often quite startling, whenever the evidence did not fit he simply altered the evidence!"&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

[[René Girard]], a French historian, literary critic, and [[Philosophy of social science|philosopher of social science]], "grudgingly" praised Frazer for recognising kingly sacrifice as "a key primitive ritual", but described his interpretation of the ritual as "a grave injustice to ethnology."&lt;ref name="Segal"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Frazerian roots of contemporary theories of religion and violence|journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]]|first=Robert A.|last=Segal|pages=4–25|issue=1|volume=37|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scapegoat|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1986|page=120|isbn=978-0-801-83315-1|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girard's "grievances" against ''The Golden Bough'' were numerous, particularly concerning Frazer's assertion that Christianity was merely a perpetuation of primitive myth-ritualism and that the [[New Testament]] Gospels were "just further myths of the death and resurrection of the king who embodies the god of vegetation."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt; Girard himself considered the Gospels to be "revelatory texts" rather than myths or the remains of "ignorant superstition", and rejected Frazer's idea that the death of Jesus was a sacrifice, "whatever definition we may give for that sacrifice."&lt;ref name=Segal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Girard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|first=René|last=Girard|authorlink=René Girard|year=1978|page=180|isbn=978-0-804-72215-5|publisher=Athlone Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influence==
Despite the controversy generated by the work, and its critical reception amongst other scholars, ''The Golden Bough'' inspired much of the creative literature of the period. The poet [[Robert Graves]] adapted Frazer's concept of the dying king sacrificed for the good of the kingdom to the romantic idea of the poet's suffering for the sake of his Muse-Goddess, as reflected in his book on poetry, rituals, and myths, ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948). [[W. B. Yeats|William Butler Yeats]] refers to Frazer's thesis in his poem "[[Sailing to Byzantium]]". The horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s understanding of religion was influenced by ''The Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joshi, S. T. |title=H. P. Lovecraft: A Life |publisher=Necronomicon Press |location=West Warwick |year=1996 |page=209 |isbn=0-940884-88-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lovecraft mentions the book in his short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lovecraft, H.

Eliot]] acknowledged indebtedness to Frazer in his first note to his poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''. [[William Carlos Williams]] refers to ''The Golden Bough'' in Book Two, part two, of his extended poem in five books ''[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/PatersonWCW|title=Paterson - William Carlos Williams|first=|last=William Carlos Williams|date=5 May 1963|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Golden Bough'' influenced [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Ronald W. |title=Freud: The Man and the Cause |publisher=Jonathan Cape and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |location=London |year=1980 |page=353 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer's work also influenced the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref name="Paglia" /&gt; the novelist [[James Joyce]],&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt; [[Ernest Hemingway]], and the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]].&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon" /&gt;

The mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] drew on ''The Golden Bough'' in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), where he accepted Frazer's view that mythology is a primitive attempt to explain the world of nature, though considering it only one among a number of valid explanations of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Hero with a Thousand Faces |publisher=New World Library |location=Novato, California |year=2008 |pages=330 |isbn=978-1-57731-593-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later described Frazer's work as "monumental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Joseph |title=The Masks of God: Primitive Mythology |publisher=Secker &amp; Warburg |location=London |year=1960 |page=164 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Weston La Barre]], writing in ''[[The Human Animal (book)|The Human Animal]]'' (1955), described Frazer as "the last of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]]" and wrote that Frazer's work was "an extended footnote to a line in [[Virgil]] he felt he did not understand."&lt;ref&gt;''The Human Animal'' (Chicago, 1954), cited in Langness, ''The Study of Culture'', pp. 24f&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics of the musician [[Jim Morrison]]'s song "[[Not to Touch the Earth]]" were influenced by the table of contents of ''The Golden Bough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hopkins, Jerry |author2=Sugarman, Danny |title=No One Here Gets Out Alive |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=179 |isbn=978-0446602280 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s commentaries on ''The Golden Bough'' have been compiled as ''[[Remarks on Frazer's Golden Bough]]'', edited by Rush Rhees, originally published in 1967 (the English edition followed in 1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|title=Phil.uni-passau.de|author=|date=|website=uni-passau.de|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202203/http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/dlwg/ws04/21-2-95.txt|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman, in his ''The Myth and Ritual School: J. G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists'' (1991), sets Frazer in the broader context of the [[history of ideas]]. The [[myth and ritual school]] includes scholars [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[F. M. Cornford]], and [[Arthur Bernard Cook|A.B. Cook]], who were connecting the new discipline of myth theory and anthropology with traditional literary classics at the end of the 19th century, influencing [[Modernism|Modernist literature]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has cited ''The Golden Bough'' as one of the most important influences on her book ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' (1990),&lt;ref name="Paglia"&gt;{{cite book |author=Paglia, Camille |title=Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1993 |page=114 |isbn=0-14-017209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described it as "a model of intriguing specificity wed to speculative imagination." Paglia acknowledged that "many details in Frazer have been contradicted or superseded", but maintained that the work of Frazer's Cambridge school of classical anthropology "will remain inspirational for enterprising students seeking escape from today's sterile academic climate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | date= 10 November 2009 | title= Pelosi’s victory for women | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 22 April 2015 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171608/http://www.salon.com/2009/11/11/pelosi_7/ | archivedate= 1 May 2015 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia has also commented, however, that the one-volume abridgement of ''The Golden Bough'' is "bland" and should be "avoided like the plague."&lt;ref name="Paglia Salon"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | date= 10 March 1999 | title= In defense of "The Golden Bough" | website= [[Salon.com]] | first= Camille | last= Paglia | accessdate= 28 April 2017 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160512072038/http://www.salon1999.com/it/col/pagl/1999/03/10pagl.html | archivedate= 12 May 2016 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8''''' is a 1982 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fourth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relates the fate of a planet, under the care of the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]], that is plunged into an [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/thethe.html |title=The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in the United States in January 1982 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in March 1982 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

[[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a review of this book that "the effect of the story is powerful and immediate – with all the drama of good polar-exploration literature, and the eloquence, at its best, of the King James Bible."&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3DD1F38F93AA15752C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 |first=Christopher |last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=29 January 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[John Leonard (American critic)|John Leonard]], also of The New York Times, was critical of Lessing's switch to science fiction and in a review of this book, complained that "Mrs. Lessing is no longer very interested in people. She has come to feel that individuality is a 'degenerative disease'... She seems ... to be in the process of junking not only traditional narrative and conventional characters but the details of feeling as well..."&lt;ref name=NYT-JL&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DE163BF934A35751C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The Spacing Out of Doris Lessing |first=John |last=Leonard |authorlink=John Leonard (American critic) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 | date=7 February 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' can be read as a stand-alone book, although it does make reference to the planet ''[[Shikasta]]'', introduced in the first book of the ''Canopus'' series.

==Plot==
Planet 8 is a small [[planet|world]] that was colonised by the benevolent galactic empire [[Canopus]] and populated with a new [[species]] created from the stock of four different species originating on several other Canopean planets. Planet 8 has a warm [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] and, under Canopus's skilled guidance, the inhabitants live comfortably and at peace with themselves and their world.

One day Canopus instructs them to build a huge wall, to exact Canopean specifications, right around the girth of the planet. The construction takes the inhabitants years to complete, and when it is finished, Canopus tells the planet's representatives, leaders of each of the planet's main disciplines, to relocate all settlements north of the wall to the south. Canopus informs everyone that unfortunate interstellar "re-alignments" have taken place and that Planet 8 will soon experience an [[ice age]]. After a while temperatures start to drop and the climate begins to change. [[Glacier]]s form in the north and slowly advance towards the wall. Canopus, however, assures Planet 8 that Canopus has a new home for them, a peaceful and prosperous world called Rohanda (the subject of the first book in this series, ''[[Shikasta]]''), and that when it has reached a certain level of development, Canopus will space-lift the inhabitants of Planet 8 to Rohanda. This fills the people of Planet 8 with hope as they are forced to adapt their lifestyles to cope with this new and unfamiliar climate.

By the time the glaciers reach the wall, much of the vegetation in the south has been destroyed by snow and ice and conditions grow worse. Conflict breaks out amongst the erstwhile peaceful villagers as food becomes scarce. But the wall holds the glaciers back and the people still remain resolute in their faith that Canopus will rescue them. Then Canopean agent Johor (first introduced in ''Shikasta'') arrives on Planet 8 with the devastating news that disaster has struck Rohanda: it has been renamed Shikasta (the stricken) and is no longer available for re-settlement. But Johor does not leave Planet 8. He remains to endure the hardships with the villagers and does what he can to help them face their inevitable demise.

In time, when the population is now faced with starvation, the wall, which was only a temporary barrier, gives way and the glaciers start over-running settlements in the south. The senior representatives, at a loss as to what to do, head north over the wall and onto the glacier. Johor travels with them as they try to reach the [[Geographical pole|pole]], but they soon all succumb to cold and hunger. Their physical bodies perish, but their "[[being]]s" rise and merge into a single [[consciousness]] that becomes the Representative for Planet 8 and all its memories. After watching Planet 8 freeze over completely, the Representative departs for a place "where Canopus tends and guards and instructs."{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc=p. 161}}

==Afterword==
The book contains a 30-page [[afterword]] in which Lessing states that ''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' and the previous book in this series, ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' were inspired by her 50-year fascination in the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition|1910–13 Antarctic expedition]] of [[Robert Falcon Scott]],&lt;ref name=NYT-CLH/&gt; though not, she points out, by the element of ice and polar conditions in itself.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

Lessing expresses a concern that Scott and his explorers, heroes in their day, were vilified by recent generations. She analyses the disastrous expedition and the changes as to how it, and Scott himself, have been viewed by posterity, and discusses these changes in the popular views of the journey in connection with the changing fashions of thought and the decline of imperialist ideas. The efforts of Scott and his men, she concludes, should be understood as a deliberate wager with destiny rather than a scientific project: they tried to transcend themselves by taking on responsibilities they knew they might not be fully equipped for or experienced enough to handle, which ultimately cost many of them their lives. Lessing explicitly likens this view of the pride in sacrifice and self-transcending to the expectations and propaganda imagery of the [[First World War]] soon after.{{sfn|Lessing|1994|loc="Afterword", p. 162}}

==Adaptations==
*''[[The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera)|The Making of the Representative for Planet 8]]'' (opera, 1986)

''The Making of the Representative for Planet 8'' was adapted for the opera in 1986 by composer [[Philip Glass]] with [[libretto|story-libretto]] by [[Doris Lessing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2431&amp;State_2905=2&amp;composerId_2905=540 |title=Philip Glass |work=Chester Music and Novello &amp; Company |accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-act opera, for orchestra, small chorus and soloists was commissioned by the [[Houston Grand Opera]], the [[English National Opera]] and the Landestheater Kiel in Germany. It first premiered on 8 July 1988 at the Houston Grand Opera in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://philipglass.com/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8/ |title=Compositions: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Philipglass.com |accessdate=23 June 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227063031/http://www.philipglass.com/music/compositions/making_rep_for_planet_8.php |archivedate=27 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dorislessing.org/therepresentative.html |title=Opera: The Making Of The Representative For Planet 8 |work=Dorislessing.org |accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British premiere was on 9 November 1988 by the English National Opera at the [[London Coliseum]]. The premiere received a lukewarm review by ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music critic [[John Rockwell]].&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/11/arts/reviews-music-new-opera-by-lessing-and-glass.html | title = Reviews/Music; New Opera By Lessing And Glass | first = John | last = Rockwell | work = The New York Times | date=11 July 1988 | accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Glass adapted another of Lessing's books from this series for the opera, ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]''.

The '''Institute for [[social research|Social Research]]''' ({{lang-de|Institut für Sozialforschung}}, '''IfS''') is a research organization for [[sociology]] and [[continental philosophy]], best known as the institutional home of the [[Frankfurt School]] and [[critical theory]].

==History==
[[Image:InstitutfuerSozialforschung3.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The current building of the Institute for Social Research, at Senckenberganlage 26 in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] {{coord|50.118414|8.65385|type:landmark_region:DE_source:enwiki| display=inline}}]]
The Institute was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1923, where it was (and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} once again is) affiliated with the [[University of Frankfurt am Main]]. It was founded by [[Felix Weil]], a student of the [[Marxist philosopher]] [[Karl Korsch]], with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father [[Hermann Weil]]. Its first director, [[Kurt Albert Gerlach]], died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by [[Carl Grünberg]], a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow "orthodox" [[Marxist]]s at the Institute, including his former pupil [[Henryk Grossman]].   Grünberg was followed by co-founder [[Friedrich Pollock]].

Following a non-fatal heart attack, Grünberg was succeeded in 1930 by [[Max Horkheimer]].  Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a [[critical theory of society]].

The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal" by {{Interlanguage link multi|Helmut Dubiel|de}} in ''Telos'' 49&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, after the rise of [[Hitler]], the Institute left [[Germany]] for [[Geneva]] and then in 1934 moved to [[New York City]].  In New York it became affiliated with [[Columbia University]], and its journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung]]'' was renamed ''[[Studies in Philosophy and Social Science]]''.  It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English [[academia]].

The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock.

The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current director is [[Axel Honneth]].
