[[File:Alexander Ariipaea Salmon.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander Salmon, Jr., c. 1885.]]
'''Alexander Ari{{okina}}ipaea Vehiaitipare Salmon Jr.''' (1855–1914) was the English-Jewish-Tahitian co-owner of the Maison Brander plantations on [[Tahiti]] and ''de facto'' ruler of [[Easter Island]] from 1878 till its cession to [[Chile]] in 1888.

==Family==
Salmon's father, [[Alexander Salmon]] (Solomon, 1822–1866), was an English Jewish merchant. While secretary to [[Pomare IV|Pōmare IV]] of Tahiti, he fell in love with her twenty-year-old adoptive sister Oehau. For three days the queen cancelled the law forbidding a Tahitian to marry a foreigner, gave Princess Oehau the title ''[[Aliʻi|ari'i]]'' Taimai, and they married.

Their daughter, Salmon's sister, [[Queen Marau|Johanna Marau Ta'aroa]] (1846–1934),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1870.htm Women Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; married her uncle, the future King [[Pōmare V]], and was ''de facto'' ruler as Queen Marau (1877–1880) until he abdicated to the French colonial government. Another daughter married the Scottish merchant [[John Brander (merchant)|John Brander]].

Their son, Alexander Jr, known as "Pa'ea" (Mangarevan for 'hobble'), inherited his father's business interests and became co-owner with Brander of the ''Maison Brander'' [[copra]] and [[coconut oil]] plantations in Tahiti, the [[Marquesas]], and the [[Cook Islands|Cooks]].

==Easter Island==
The ''Maison Brander'' owned a large sheep ranch on Easter Island for exporting wool. The ranch was managed by the power-hungry convicted murderer [[Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier]], who had acquired additional land and appointed his [[Rapanui]] wife "Queen". This was the low point in the island's history; by 1872 its resident population had been reduced to 111.

In 1871 Alexander Jr had picked up rudimentary [[Rapanui language|Rapanui]] from his hundreds of indentured Easter Island labourers at the [[Mahina, French Polynesia|Mahina]] coconut plantation on Tahiti. In 1877 Queen Pōmare IV died, and Alexander's sister became regent. John Brander also died that year, and Dutrou-Bornier was assassinated. Alexander set off for Easter Island to manage the sheep station in around October 1878 with twenty Tahitian workers and an unknown number of Rapanui whose indentures had expired and ran the island for a decade. He introduced the [[coconut]], the first sizeable tree on the island since its deforestation two centuries earlier, apart from some fruit trees at the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary|SSCC]] Catholic mission and Dutrou-Bornier's estate.

Salmon returned to Tahiti in 1883–1884 for business. Upon his return to Easter Island he bought up all remaining land apart from the SSCC mission at [[Hanga Roa]]. As owner of nearly all the island and sole source of employment, Salmon was ''de facto'' ruler.

As he was not a religious man, and a Jew, the priests did not like him, especially [[Hippolyte Roussel]], who had been forced to leave the island in 1871 due to conflict with Dutrou-Bornier but who visited again in 1879. Bishop [[Florentin-Étienne Jaussen|Jaussen]] in Tahiti appointed a Rapanui, [[Atamu te Kena]], "king" to protect church interests from the ''Maison Brander'', but Salmon ignored him and he never had any influence. However, Salmon was an honest man and sincerely interested in the welfare of the people, and the population started to recover. This was the era of the strong Tahitian influence on the Rapanui language and culture.

In addition to wool exports, Salmon developed a tourist industry. He encouraged the manufacture of Rapanui artworks, including imitation ''[[rongorongo]]'' inscriptions, and helped sell them to passing ships for good prices as cultural artefacts, though he never claimed they were genuine. The artisans knew currency exchange rates and could deal with Europeans and Americans on their own terms.

Salmon served as the principal informant for the British and [[:de:SMS Hyäne|German archaeological expeditions]] to the island in 1882 and for the Americans in 1886, as guide, translator, and hotelier.

Cooke, surgeon of the [[USS Mohican (1883)|USS ''Mohican'']], which dropped anchor in December 1886, said,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer pp 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Mr Salmon, who is guide, philosopher, and friend to these people, unites in his person (and being a giant in stature, he can well contain them) the duties of referee, arbiter, judge. They entertain the greatest respect for him; evince the utmost affection; look up to him as their master; go to him with all their troubles; refer to him all their disputes and grievances. His word is law, and his decisions final and undisputed.}}

The information Salmon provided, despite its often poor quality, is still among the most important of Easter Island's early historical period. He also sent three genuine ''rongorongo'' tablets to his niece's husband, Heinrich August Schlubach, the German consul of [[Valparaíso]], which are now kept in Vienna and Berlin.

[[File:Prince Kuhio with Alexander Ariipaea Salmon (PP-97-1-048).jpg|thumb|Salmon with Hawaiian [[Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole|Prince Kūhiō]] in 1907]]
Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on 2 January 1888 and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December of that year. He left for the remote [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] after being arrested and put in prison for assault and battery. He collected the oral histories of the people of the Tuamotus. He moved to San Francisco in later life and was involved in a scheme to marry ex-Queen [[Liliuokalani]] of Hawaii, who he claimed he had been engaged to from birth. The plot was merely a heist to take Liliuokalani's money to pay his debt.
He died in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/tandf/journals/content/cjph20/2005/cjph20.v040.i02/00223340500176574/production/images/medium/cjph_a_10043846_o_art001.gif Tandfonline]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">A '''budget process''' refers to the process by which governments create and approve a [[budget]], which is as follows:

* The Financial Service Department prepares worksheets to assist the department head in preparation of department budget estimates
* The Administrator calls a meeting of managers and they present and discuss plans for the following year’s projected level of activity.
* The managers can work with the Financial Services, or work alone to prepare an estimate for the departments coming year.
* The completed budgets are presented by the managers to their Executive Officers for review and approval. 
* Justification of the budget request may be required in writing.  In most cases, the manager talks with their administrative officers about budget requirements.  Adjustments to the budget submission may be required as a result of this phase in the process.

Budgeting is the setting of expenditure levels for each of an organization’s functions. It is the estimation and allocation of available capital used to achieve the designated targets of a firm.

== Terminology ==
* '''Revenue Estimation''' performed in the executive branch by the finance director, clerk's office, budget director, manager, or a team.
* '''Budget Call''' issued to outline the presentation form, recommend certain goals.
* '''Budget Formulation''' reflecting on the past, set goals for the future and reconcile the difference.
* '''Budget Hearings''' can include departments, sections, the executive, and the public to discuss changes in the budget.
* '''Budget Adoption''' final approval by the legislative body.
* '''Budget Execution''' amending the budget as the fiscal year progresses.

== Constitutional economics ==

[[Constitutional economics]] is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the [[judiciary]] which in many transitional and [[developing countries]] is completely controlled by the executive.  It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of [[political corruption|corruption]] of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.  The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit.  The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the [[civil society]] in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Barenboim, Defining the rules, The European Lawyer, Issue 90, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the originator of [[Krating Daeng]] ({{lang|th|กระทิงแดง}}) and was co-creator of the [[Red Bull]] brands of [[energy drink]]s.

==Background==
Various news sources suggest Chaleo was born in [[central Thailand]] at some point between 1922 and 1932.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120318"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=David|title=Chaleo Yoovidhya, Who Created Red Bull Beverage, Is Dead| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/business/chaleo-yoovidhya-dies-created-red-bull-energy-drink.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2012-03-18|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' notes that three birthdates have been put forward by different sources: "''The Nation'', a Thai newspaper, reported that he was 90, while several other news media outlets in Thailand said he was 88. ''[[Forbes]]'' recently put his age at 80." BBC News states, "Mr Chaleo was born of poor Chinese immigrant parents in the northern province of Phichit, reportedly in 1932, local media say".&lt;ref name="BBC-20120317"&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bull creator and Thai tycoon Chaleo Yoovidhya dead|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-17416385|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=BBC News|date=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Australian'' and ''Time'' say he was 89.&lt;ref name="Australian-20120319"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai billionaire inventor of Red Bull Chaleo Yoovidhya dies aged 89|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/thai-billionaire-inventor-of-red-bull-chaleo-yoovidhya-dies-aged-89/news-story/8cbdc736278663f6f07439c15730891d|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The Australian|date=2012-03-19|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=Robert|title=Duck Farmer to Billionaire: Red Bull Co-Founder Dies|url=https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2109386,00.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Time|date=2012-03-18|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph'' and ''The Independent'' say he was born in 1923 to a poor Thai-Chinese family that raised ducks and traded fruit in [[Phichit Province|Phichit]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childs|first1=Martin|title=Chaleo Yoovidhya: Recluse who created the Red Bull energy drink|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/chaleo-yoovidhya-recluse-who-created-the-red-bull-energy-drink-7579362.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The Independent|date=2012-03-21|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an immigrant from [[Hainan]].

With little formal education, he worked for his parents, then moved to [[Bangkok]]. He became an [[antibiotics]] salesman, before quitting to set up his own small pharmaceutical company, TC Pharmaceuticals, in the early-1960s.&lt;ref name="TCP-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.tcp.com/en/about/history.php#1956-1967|website=T.C. Pharma (TCP)|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; Later, after a claimed stroke of "divine inspiration", he developed an energy-boosting beverage that was first introduced in 1976. The logo depicts two large, red bulls charging each other, which are not [[cattle]], but wild [[gaur]], a bovine species native to Southeast Asia called ''krathing'' (กระทิง) in Thai. 

[[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian salesman for a German company, found the drink cured his [[jet lag]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; and entered into partnership with Chaleo in 1984.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319" /&gt; In 1987, the two launched an export version labelled "Red Bull", for which Chaleo provided the original formula (adapted for Western tastes under Mateschitz's guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrO3O0h6I0wC |title=Asian Brand Strategy: How Asia Builds Strong Brands |last1=Roll |first1=Martin |isbn=9780230513068 |page=199 |publisher=Springer |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Mateschitz the marketing. Each put up US$500,000 for 49 per cent of the Red Bull energy drink franchise, with Chaleo's son, [[Chalerm Yoovidhya|Chalerm]], owning the remaining two per cent.&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; Chaleo continued to own TC Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured other energy drinks in Thailand, and was part-owner of [[Piyavate Hospital]], a private hospital in Thailand.

The Yoovidhya family co-owns the sole authorized importer of [[Ferrari]] cars into Thailand.

==Death==
Chaleo died in [[Bangkok]] on 17 March 2012.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319" /&gt;

'''Chinamex''' (short for '''China Middle East Investment and Trade Promotion Centre''') is a Chinese real estate developer specializing in the design and management of large malls and mixed use developments branded as Dragon Mart and Dragon City respectively that are located in foreign countries. The malls are shopping hubs for retail and especially wholesale sales of Chinese products.

== Active projects ==
=== Dragon Market Dubai ===
The first mall developed by the company is Dragon Market Dubai, a sprawling development located at [[Dubai International City]] that was referenced in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article as a key project in the expansion of Chinese ties in the Gulf countries.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Avoiding Political Talk, Saudis and Chinese Build Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/world/asia/23saudi.html|publisher=New York Times|date=April 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dragon City Bahrain ===
In September 2013, Chinamex signed a memorandum of understanding with the [[Diyar Al Muharraq]] authorities for the construction of a 120,000 m2 wholesale and retail mall entertainment complex in Bahrain branded as Dragon City.&lt;ref name=bahrain&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinamex to oversee Dragon Mart Bahrain|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-24477-chinamex-to-oversee-dragon-mart-bahrain/|publisher=Construction Week|date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nass Corporation]] was commissioned to build the mall. With an investment of $100 million, the Dragon City opened in December 2015. Characterized by its oriental architecture, it also included 300 residential apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/RET_296691.html|title=Bahrain gears up for $100m China Town launch|website=Tradearabia.com|date=14 December 2015|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bahrain's $100m Dragon City set for official launch on Dec 27|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/bahrain-s-100m-dragon-city-set-for-official-launch-on-dec-27-615312.html|website=Arabianbusiness.com|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dragon City Bahrain]] is a first of its kind development that encompasses over 787 commercial units, making it the largest wholesale and retail trading centre in the [[ Kingdom of Bahrain]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dragoncitybahrain.com/about-dragon-city/|title=About Dragon City Bahrain|website=Arabianbusiness.com|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

6 months after the opening, 95% of store occupancy was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dragon-city-dining-outlets-open-in-bahrain-in-2016-637848.html|title=Dragon City dining outlets to open in Bahrain in 2016|website=Arabianbusiness.com|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Chinamex allocated an extra $200 million to roll out the second part of the project: a palatial hotel, restaurants area, and a recreational area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weetas.com/gccnews/chinamex-allocates-200m-second-phase-dragon-city/|title=Chinamex allocates $200m for the second phase of Dragon City|date=21 November 2016|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canceled projects ==
=== Dragon Mart Cancún ===
In conjunction with Mexican investors, Chinamex commenced construction of Dragon Mart Cancún, a $US180-million investment that includes 3,000 storefronts along with apartments for the families of mall workers. ONGs and national institutions heavily criticized the project as soon as it was announced in 2011, arguing that the Mexican government did not conduct environmental impact assessments. Facing bad publicity, Chinamex rearranged its deal with its Mexican partners, allowing more countries to partake to the project, reducing the number of units reserved to Chinese businessmen, and giving up 10% of its 50-50 investment deal to the Mexican investors (60% MX, 40% CN). The project was approved on government and state levels by the end of 2012, but local authorities blocked and completely reversed the approval on all government levels.&lt;ref name="Diplo Fiasco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/01/the-dragon-mart-fiasco-still-haunts-china-mexico-relations/|title=The Dragon Mart Fiasco Still Haunts China-Mexico Relations|website=Thediplomat.com|date=24 January 2017|author=Edmund Downie|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was then halted due to an environmental enforcement action by Profepa, the Mexican environmental protection agency. Dragon Mart was fined $555,000 in 2014 by Profepa for neglecting the conduction of environmental impact assessments. In January 2015, Profepa canceled the project and fined Dragon Mart an additional $1,5 million.&lt;ref name="Diplo Fiasco" /&gt; A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article noted that the planned DragonMart had unsettled Mexican business leaders who were anxious about losing market share to Chinese competition.&lt;ref name=chinamex&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexico Halts Chinese Expo Center on Environmental Concerns|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-halts-chinese-expo-center-on-environmental-concerns-1422399848|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panama: Dragon City ===
In 2014, Chinamex started investing in the development of a Dragon City in Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/estados/2014/07/27/alistan-proyecto-gemelo-dragon-mart-panama|title=Alistan proyecto gemelo de Dragon Mart en Panamá|website=Eleconomista.com.mx|date=27 July 2014|language=es|author=Jesus Vazquez|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Panama became effective, and Chinamex was planning to turn the China-Panama-Mexico axis into a major export outlet of Chinese products towards the North and South American markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expansion.mx/negocios/2014/08/05/dragon-city-panama-amenaza-a-empresarios|title=Dragon City Panama|website=Expansion.mx|date=6 August 2014|author=Sara Cantera|language=es|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Chinamex opened offices in Atlanta. It had 14,000-square-foot facility used as a showroom of China-manufactured products. However, in July 2011, Chinamex closed its Atlanta offices, marking its retreat from the USA's markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/chinamex-closing-atlanta-office/|title=Chinamex Closing Atlanta Office|website=Globalatlanta.com|date=20 July 2011|author=Trevor Williams|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8211">'''Cohort analysis''' is a subset of [[behavioral analytics]] that takes the [[data]] from a given [[data set]] (e.g. an [[e-commerce]] platform, [[web application]], or online game) and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]s, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.  Cohort analysis allows a company to “see patterns clearly across the life-cycle of a customer (or user), rather than slicing across all customers blindly without accounting for the natural cycle that a customer undergoes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastopol, CA|isbn=1449335675|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=VJS5qQWOKUIC|author=Alistair Croll|author2=Benjamin Yoskovitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By seeing these patterns of time, a company can adapt and tailor its service to those specific cohorts. While cohort analysis is sometimes associated with a [[cohort study]], they are different and should not be viewed as one and the same. Cohort analysis is specifically the analysis of cohorts in regards to [[big data]] and [[business analytics]], while in cohort study, data is broken down into similar groups.

==Examples==
The goal of a business analytic tool is to analyze and present actionable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aukeman|first=Mark|title=Cohort Analysis — understanding your customers|url=http://edwblog.com/adhoc/cohort-analysis-%E2%80%94-understanding-customer-behavior/32|work=edwblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a company to act on such information it must be relevant to the situation under analysis. A database full of thousands or even millions of entries of all user data makes it tough to gain actionable data, as that data spans many different categories and time periods. Actionable cohort analysis allows for the ability to drill down to the users of each specific cohort to gain a better understanding of their behaviors, such as if users checked out, and how much did they pay.  In cohort analysis "each new group [cohort] provides the opportunity to start with a fresh set of users,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balogh|first=Jonathon|title=Introduction to Cohort Analysis for Startups|url=http://jonathonbalogh.com/2012/03/24/introduction-to-cohort-analysis-for-startups/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  allowing the company to look at only the data that is relevant to the current query and act on it.

In eCommerce, a firm may only be interested in customers who signed up in the last two weeks and who made a purchase, which is an example of a specific cohort. A software developer may only care about the data from users who sign up after a certain upgrade, or who use certain features of the platform.

[[File:Cohort Analysis Chart - Gaming Example.png|200px|thumbnail|right]]An example of cohort analysis of gamers on a certain platform: Expert gamers, cohort 1, will care more about advanced features and lag time compared to new sign-ups, cohort 2. With these two cohorts determined, and the analysis run, the gaming company would be presented with a visual representation of the data specific to the two cohorts. It could then see that a slight lag in load times has been translating into a significant loss of revenue from advanced gamers, while new sign-ups have not even noticed the lag. Had the company simply looked at its overall revenue reports for all customers, it would not have been able to see the differences between these two cohorts. Cohort analysis allows a company to pick up on patterns and trends and make the changes necessary to keep both advanced and new gamers happy.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Deep actionable cohort analytics==
"An actionable metric is one that ties specific and repeatable actions to observed results [like user registration, or checkout]. The opposite of actionable metrics are vanity metrics (like web hits or number of downloads) which only serve to document the current state of the product but offer no insight into how we got here or what to do next."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maurya|first=Ash|title=3 Rules to Actionable Metrics in a Lean Startup|url=http://leanstack.com/3-rules-to-actionable-metrics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without actionable analytics the information that is being presented may not have any practical application, as the only data points represent vanity metrics that do not translate into any specific outcome. While it is useful for a company to know how many people are on their site, that metric is useless on its own. For it to be actionable it needs to relate a "repeatable action to [an] observed result".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Performing cohort analysis==
In order to perform a proper cohort analysis, there are four main stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Cohort Analysis to Optimize Customer Experience|url=http://uxmag.com/articles/using-cohort-analysis-to-optimize-customer-experience|work=UX Magazine|author=James Torio|author2=Rishabh Dayal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Determine what question you want to answer.''' The point of the analysis is to come up with actionable information on which to act in order to improve business, product, user experience, turnover, etc. To ensure that happens, it is important that the right question is asked. In the gaming example above, the company was unsure why they were losing revenue as lag time increased, despite the fact that users were still signing up and playing games.
* '''Define the metrics that will be able to help you answer the question.''' A proper cohort analysis requires the identification of an event, such as a user checking out, and specific properties, like how much the user paid. The gaming example measured a customer's willingness to buy gaming credits based on how much lag time there was on the site.
* '''Define the specific cohorts that are relevant.''' In creating a cohort, one must either analyze all the users and target them or perform attribute contribution in order to find the relevant differences between each of them, ultimately to discover and explain their behavior as a specific cohort. The above example splits users into "basic" and "advanced" users as each group differs in actions, pricing structure sensitivities, and usage levels.
* '''Perform the cohort analysis.''' The analysis above was done using [[data visualization]] which allowed the gaming company to realize that their revenues were falling because their higher-paying advanced users were not using the system as the lag time increased. Since the advanced users were such a large portion of the company's revenue, the additional basic user signups were not covering the financial losses from losing the advanced users. In order to fix this, the company improved their lag times and began catering more to their advanced users.

'''Dan Stephen Castillo Palami''' is the [[manager (association football)|team manager]] of the [[Philippines national football team|Philippine men's national football team]] since 2009. He is credited for his contributions to the revival of [[football in the Philippines]] due to the national team's performance at the [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]].&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/06/24/11/azkals-close-team-manager-dan-palami |title=Azkals up close: Team manager Dan Palami |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cagayan-de-oro/sports/dan-palami-savior-rp-football |title=Dan Palami savior of RP football |publisher=Sun.Star |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dan Palami was born in [[Tacloban]] on June 9, 1970.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sunstar1"/&gt;

==Education==
Dan Palami studied at the University of the Philippines and pursued a degree in accountancy. Palami became a Certified Public Accountant. He also studied law at the same university but stopped his studies during his fourth year to establish a railway company.&lt;ref name="sunstar1"/&gt;

==Managing career==
[[File:Dan Palami July 2016.jpg|thumb|Palami in 2016]]
===Football===
;Philippines U19
In November 2009, Palami was offered to handle the Philippine U19 national football team. Palami accepted the offer to managed the team through the [[2010 AFC U-19 Championship qualification]]. He quit after a poor finish at the tournament only gaining a point against Guam.&lt;ref name=hanson2/&gt;

;Philippines national senior team
The Philippine Football Federation hired Dan Palami to be the manager of the Philippine national football team in December 2009. The Philippine Football Federation allowed Palami autonomy over the national football team.&lt;ref name="sunstar1"/&gt; Palami was hesitant in accepting the job at first but accepted the offer of the PFF after learning that the next major tournament, the [[2010 AFF Championship]] is months away since he had more little time to prepare the U-19 team at the AFC U-19 Championship qualifiers.&lt;ref name=hanson2/&gt; Palami is in charge of recruiting players and hiring the coach of the team. During the earlier phase of his management he had to fund the team from his own personal funds as the team had difficulties gaining financial support from corporate sponsors. The team's kit sponsor at that time was [[Mizuno Corporation|Mizuno]].&lt;ref name="sunstar1"/&gt;

In March 2018, Palami managed to secure qualification for the Philippines in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]] when the national team won 2-1 over Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="anotherrole"&gt;{{cite news|title=Palami mulls over ‘another role’ in PH football after Azkals’ historic win|url=https://sports.inquirer.net/290793/palami-mulls-over-another-role-in-ph-football-after-azkals-historic-win|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Philippines national youth teams
In Late 2017, it was reported that Palami will be involved in managing the Philippine youth teams in 2018. Palami described the setup of the national youth team to the setup of the senior national team in 2010 when there was a lack of developmental plan and transparency on the selection of players. He notes that national youth players are selected from the same schools which their coaches are affliated with which he says is "coincidence at best and justifiable" but concedes that it creates doubts due to a lack of transparency on the selection process. Palami is reportedly planning to choose regularly competing players from three pools in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao for the final line up of the youth teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Limpag|first1=Mike|title=Changes in youth system|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/sports/2017/11/07/limpag-changes-youth-system-573582|accessdate=8 November 2017|work=Sun Star Cebu|date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After helping the senior team qualify for their very first Asian Cup, Palami in March 2018 has stated that he is considering another role in Philippine football. He said he might get involved in the grassroots of football in the country.&lt;ref name="anotherrole"/&gt;

===Basketball===
In 2014, he was appointed as the team manager of the [[UP Fighting Maroons]] men's basketball team that have played in the UAAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/357876/sports/uaap-azkals-boss-dan-palami-becomes-up-fighting-maroons-manager|title=UAAP: Azkals boss Dan Palami becomes UP Fighting Maroons manager|publisher=''[[GMA News]]''|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports administration==
After he graduated and established his own company, Palami and members of his staff began to play at the back of the Quezon City Hall and later at the Sunken Garden at the University of the Philippines. This would lead to the founding of [[Laos F.C.]] which later had some success at local tournaments such as the Ang Liga.&lt;ref name=hanson2&gt;{{Cite episode | first = Hans | last = Smit | first2 = Jing| last2 = Jamlang | first3 = Palami | last3 = Dan | date = 31 October 2013 | title = What Dan Palami Has Done for Philippine Football | trans-title = | medium = Podcast | language = English, Filipino | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4erzNXPDO4E&amp;index=41&amp;list=PL5DScDrnjFIFAq3uVi-zewmp_bPuw996z | access-date = 17 June 2016 | series = Hans On| format =  | time =5:15-11:15 | location = | publisher = New Media Factory TV |season=1 |number=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Datadog''' is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a [[Software as a service|SaaS]]-based data analytics platform.

== Technology ==
Datadog uses a [[Go (programming language)|Go]] based agent, rewritten from scratch since its major version 6.0.0 released on February 28, 2018&lt;ref&gt;GitHub, [https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent "Datadog / datadog-agent."] Retrieved June 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was formerly [[Python (programming language)|Python]] based &lt;ref&gt;GitHub, [https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent "Datadog / dd-agent."] Retrieved February 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;, forked from the original created in 2009 by David Mytton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/commit/9311d425aec52cf165a3476d54fd2d6caeddee56|title=First commit · DataDog/dd-agent@9311d42|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Server Density]] (previously called Boxed Ice). Its backend is built using a number of [[Open source|open]] and [[closed source]] technologies including [[D3.js|D3]], [[Apache Cassandra]], [[Apache Kafka|Kafka]], [[PostgreSQL]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Hakka Labs, Alexis Lê-Quôc, [https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/realtime-data-analytics-at-datadog "Realtime Data Analytics at Datadog."] January 9, 2014. Retrieved February 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2014, Datadog support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers including [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS), [[Microsoft Azure]], [[Google Cloud Platform]] and [[Red Hat]] [[OpenShift]]. Today, the company supports over 150 integrations out-of-the-box.

== History ==
Datadog was founded in 2010&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = http://www.stephpalmeri.com/post/867616712/quick-note-on-seedstart-demo-day | title = Quick Note on SeedStart Demo Day | access-date = 16 November 2018 | last = Palmeri | first = Steph | date = 27 July 2010 | website = StephPalmeri.com | quote = Here, the five SeedStart companies (DataDog, Introspectr, Lexeem, Reducify, and Risktail) debuted to over 100 venture capitalists, angel investors, and strategics from the New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. areas. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100801231724/http://www.stephpalmeri.com/post/867616712/quick-note-on-seedstart-demo-day | archive-date = 1 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Olivier Pomel and Alexis Lê-Quôc, who met while working at Wireless Generation. After Wireless Generation was acquired by NewsCorp, the two set out to create a product that could reduce the friction they experienced between developer and system-admin teams, who were often working at cross-purposes.

They built Datadog to be a cloud infrastructure monitoring service, with a dashboard, alerting, and visualizations of metrics. As cloud adoption increased, Datadog grew rapidly and expanded its product offering to cover service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, and [[OpenStack]].&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url = https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/monitoring-service-datadog-gets-31m-funding/2015/01/ | title = Monitoring Service Datadog Gets $31M in Funding | access-date = 16 November 2016 | last = Moriarty | first = Erin | date = 29 January 2015 | website = Sdxcentral.com | quote = Last year, support was broadened to multiple cloud service providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Red Hat OpenShift, and the company added OpenStack support as well. As of today, Datadog integrates monitoring and web operations data from almost 100 commonly used technologies in modern cloud applications. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150221025805/https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/monitoring-service-datadog-gets-31m-funding/2015/01/ | archive-date = 21 February 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Datadog announced the acquisition of Mortar Data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Ben Kepes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/02/11/datadog-acquires-mortar-data-to-tie-analytics-to-monitoring/#4575e46a476a |title=DataDog Acquires Mortar Data To Tie Analytics To Monitoring |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing on its team and adding its data and analytics capabilities to Datadog’s platform. That year Datadog also opened a research and development office in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris O&amp;#039;Brien |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/10/07/datadogs-french-founders-announce-their-ny-based-company-will-open-paris-rd-office/ |title=Datadog's French founders announce their NY-based company will open Paris R&amp;D office |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2015-10-07 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2016 Datadog moved its New York City headquarters to a full floor of the New York Times Building to support its growing team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161103005060/en/Datadog-Moves-York-Times-Building-Listed-Forbes%E2%80%99 |title=Datadog Moves Into The New York Times Building, Listed In Forbes’ Cloud 100 and Other Awards |publisher=Business Wire |date=2016-11-03 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which doubled over the course of the year.

'''Downtown Boston''' is the central business district of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The city of Boston was founded in 1630. The largest of the city's commercial districts, Downtown is the location of many corporate or regional headquarters; city, county, state and federal government facilities; and many of Boston's tourist attractions. Similar to other central business districts in the U.S., Downtown has recently undergone a transformation that included the construction of new condos and lofts, renovation of historic buildings, and arrival of new residents and businesses. It is represented in the [[Boston City Council]] by [[District 2, Boston|District 2]]'s [[Bill Linehan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/research-maps/maps-and-gis/electoral-maps |publisher=Boston Redevelopment Authority |title=Electoral Maps |accessdate=October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aerial view of Boston skyline 3.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Downtown Boston]]

Downtown is bound by the [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]], [[North End, Boston|North End]], [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]], and the [[South End, Boston|South End]] areas. It includes [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]] and the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]].&lt;ref name=neighborhoods&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/neighborhoods/downtown.asp |title=Neighborhoods: Downtown |publisher=City of Boston |accessdate=October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The area that is now Downtown Boston constituted much of the town/city proper prior to the city's dramatic [[Timeline_of_Boston#1850s.E2.80.931890s|expansion]] in the 1860s and 1870s. The [[Great Boston Fire of 1872]] destroyed much of the neighborhood, especially between Summer, Washington, and Milk Streets. In the 1950s the [[Central Artery]] highway began operating, until the [[Big Dig]] (1982-2007) relocated it underground. In the 1960s and 1970s the enormous new [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]] complex replaced [[Scollay Square]].

Landmarks in Downtown Boston include the [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway|Greenway]], [[Custom House Tower|Custom House Tower]], [[Boston City Hall|City Hall]], [[Faneuil Hall]], [[Quincy Market]], [[Old South Meeting House]], [[Massachusetts State House]], [[Park Street Church]], [[Boston Common]], and [[Boston Public Garden]].&lt;ref name=neighborhoods /&gt; 

Educational institutions located downtown include [[Emerson College]] and [[Suffolk University]].

The four [[MBTA]] subway lines converge in the downtown area at the [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Downtown Crossing]], [[Park Street (MBTA station)|Park Street]], [[Government Center (MBTA station)|Government Center]], and [[State (MBTA station)|State]] stations.  [[South Station]] is a transportation hub with subway, commuter rail, intercity bus, and [[Amtrak]] service.

[[Imagination:Leighton-Duty-1883.jpg|right|thumb|"Duty" by [[Edmund Leighton]]]]
A '''duty''' (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; {{lang-fro|deu, did}}, past participle of ''devoir''; {{lang-la|debere, debitum}}, whence "[[debt]]") is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise.  A duty may arise from a system of [[ethics]] or [[morality]], especially in an [[honor culture]]. Many duties are based created by [[law]], sometimes including a codified punishment or [[Legal liability|liability]] for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require some [[sacrifice]] of [[self-interest]].

[[Cicero]], an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Marcus T. De Officiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# as result of being a human
# as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)
# as a result of one's character
# as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself

The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, [[religion]], and social norms.

==Civic duty==
{{Main|Civic engagement}}
Duty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joakim |last1=Ekman |first2=Erik |last2=Amnå |title=''Political Participation and Civic Engagement: Towards A New Typology'' |journal=Youth &amp; Society (Working Paper) |page=4 |year=2009 |issue=2 |url = http://www.oru.se/PageFiles/14371/Ekman%20and%20Amnå%202009-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also often perceived as something owed to one’s country (patriotism), or to one's homeland or community. Civic duties could include:

* Obey the law
* Pay taxes
* Provide for a common defense, should the need arise
* Enroll to vote, and vote at all elections and referenda (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas, or illness on polling day)
* Serve on a jury, if called upon
* Go to the aid of victims of accidents and street-crime and testifying as a witness later in court
* Report contagious illnesses or pestilence to public-health authorities
* Volunteer for public services (e.g. life-saving drills)
* Donate blood periodically or when needed
* [[Duty of revolution]] against an unjust government

==Duties of employment==
Specific [[obligation]]s arise in the services performed by a [[minister (religion)|minister]] of a [[Local church|church]], by a [[soldier]], or by any [[employment|employee]] or servant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Duty|volume=8|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* [[Dereliction of duty]] is an offense in U.S. military law
* [[Duty to protect]], in medicine
* ''[[In loco parentis]]'', for schools
* [[Professional responsibility]] for lawyers

==Legal duties==
Examples of legal duties include:
* [[Duty of care]]
* [[Duty of candour]]
* [[Duty to defend]] and [[duty to settle]], in insurance
* [[Duty to rescue]]
* [[Duty to retreat]]
* [[Misprision of felony|Duty to report a felony]]
* [[Duty to vote]] (in countries with mandatory voting)
* [[Duty to warn]]
* [[Fiduciary duties]]
* Duty to care for children as [[legal guardian]] (opposite of [[child neglect]])
* Special duties created by a [[contract]]

==Filial duty==
{{see also|Filial piety}}
[[Image:Admonitions Scroll Scene 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Admonitions Scroll#Scene 4:Lady Feng and the bear|Lady Feng and the Bear]]]]
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the family’s honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages that benefit the family’s status, or caring for ailing relatives. This family-oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of Confucius, and is known as xiao, or [[filial piety]]. As such, the duties of filial piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for centuries. For example, the painting ''Lady Feng and the Bear'', from ancient China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an example of admirable filial behavior. Filial piety is considered so important that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a more modern example, "concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one of their primary rationales for working in the skin trade".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from "The Analects of Confucius": "Yu Tzu said, 'It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots, for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man's character'".

==In various cultures==
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] is commonly more heavily weighted than in [[Western culture]]. According to a study done on attitudes toward family [[obligation]]:
: "Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support their families than their peers with European backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Tseng, V. and Lam, M. (1999), Attitudes toward Family Obligations among American Adolescents with Asian, Latin American, and European Backgrounds. Child Development, 70: 1030–1044. doi: 10.1111/1467-8624.00075.&lt;/ref&gt;
The deeply rooted [[tradition]] of duty among both Asian and Latin American cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in his book ''Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia'':
: "Notions of filial duty … are commonly invoked to mobilize the loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety … attuned to them may thus be a source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are  enjoined to honor their parents’ (and grandparents’) wishes and unspoken expectations".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael G. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor: 	Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[arranged marriage]] is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the [[Middle East]]. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife will move in with the husband’s family and household to raise their children. [[Patrilocal residence]] is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the farms and family. Older generations rely heavily on the help from their children's and grandchildren's families. This form of duty is in response to keeping the [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.

== Criticisms of the concept ==

=== Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. "What destroys a man more quickly", he asks, "than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of “duty”?" (''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', § 11)

Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is "to turn men into machines". The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty. (''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an untimely man” § 9.29)

'''Event marketing''' is the [[marketing]] of a brand, service, or product through [[promotional event]]s.{{r|Targosz}}{{r|Jaworowicz1}} It typically involves direct contact with the brand's representatives, allowing for more direct interaction. Events are also a way to develop a relationship with [[Media (communication)|media]] outlets, and work as an alternative for [[direct marketing]]. They may also be classified as an [[internal communication]] tool within a certain company. It should not be confused with [[event management]], which is a process of organizing and conducting events while event marketing is a tool to promote brands or products with events.

Event marketing is also considered to be a part of experiential marketing and content marketing. Experiential marketing follows the process of corporate storytelling,{{r|group=n|Petrucci}} and aims to further engage the audience. Experiential follows a simple formula of combining a brand's message and interactive components.{{r|Smith}} This mode of marketing places the target audience in a live environment that will encourage the desired outcome.{{r|Smith}}

Event marketing mostly relies on emotions and the activity of the human brain. Event marketing uses emotions and is based on the fact that people remember what they are experiencing. Emotional stimulus significantly affects the image of the offered service or product. Psychologists proved that while stimulated by emotions, the brain remembers certain facts and pieces of information better. Experiencing something makes it more memorable.{{r|Psych}} In this condition, it is more likely that the brand will stay in the receiver's mind and create a long-lasting image.{{r|Jaworowicz2}}

In a thesis for the International Business and Economics Programme at the [[Luleå University of Technology]], Jessica Eriksson and Anna Hjälmsson wrote:
{{Quote
|text=Event marketing is marketing through events, where marketing is seen as central and the event is considered the actual marketing tool. Event marketing is focusing on a target group and involves high contact intensity. It turns a message into an event that can be experienced by the audience. Several senses are engaged, which increases the chances to remember the experience and thereby also the message.{{r|Eriksson}}
}}

A completely different kind of event marketing is defined by [[Business-to-business|B2B]]. The emotions involved are no longer a representation of the event, but rather, it is a possibility to make business contacts and networking which can only exist through a face-to-face meeting.

== Misconception of the term ==
Event marketing was often misunderstood in the terms of its definition.{{r|Macmillan}} The Cambridge Dictionary{{r|Cambridge}} has two definitions for it:

# The job of advertising products by selling or providing them at events in order to gain new customers.
# The job of advertising different events so that people will go to them.

The term itself became an important area of study in German, American, British, and Canadian markets. Event marketing had been considered equal to the promotion of an event in order to increase the sales of the tickets and was forgotten as a form of marketing.{{r|Targosz}}

This conception changed with excessive studies in the late-20th and early-21st century. [[Philip Kotler]]'s ''Marketing'', which was published at the beginning of the century, is regarded as the first step to a clear definition of the term.{{r|Kotler}} It was later followed by a Danish publication ''Events as a strategic marketing tool'' written by Dorothe Gerritsen and Ronald van Olderen. Event marketing became recognized as a marketing tool, especially in Poland{{r|Jaworowicz1}} when it was introduced in the early 2000s. (Jaworowicz P., Jaworowicz M., Event marketing w Zintegrowanej Komunikacji Marketingowej, Warszawa 2016.) Polish academics mostly relied on Western studies and managed to build up the whole concept.

== Event marketing worldwide ==
Recently, event marketing has been gaining attention globally as its definition is acknowledged by a larger group of people.

According to The US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the event industry will grow by 44% from 2010 to 2020.{{r|Ferrell}} A [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of marketers (31%) believe event marketing to be the single-most effective marketing channel, with 27% voting on [[Content marketing|Content Marketing]], and 25% on [[Email marketing|Email Marketing]].{{r|Rafalson}}

[[HubSpot]] has listed 11 experiential marketing campaigns from worldwide renowned brands like [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Zappos]], and [[Guinness]], who have hosted or created events as an innovative way of advertising a product.{{r|Becker}} Each of them were successful and attracted thousands of new customers. Marketing Insider Group has also listed 5 event marketing examples that are still being talked about. Among them, The Kia Dream Chute is mentioned as one of the best ideas. All of those events are considered one of the best marketing campaigns in the world.{{r|Brenner}}

A study made by [[Jack Morton Worldwide]] shows that 11 out of 14 consumers prefer to get to know new products or services by experiencing them personally.{{r|Gordon}}

Moreover, 74% of consumers say that connecting with branded event marketing experiences is making them more likely to buy the products which are being promoted.{{r|Report}} That's a statistic from the report by The Event Marketing Institute and Mosaic.

== Event marketing strategy ==
Due to the misunderstanding in regards to event marketing, its [[strategy]] has become recognized as a strategy of promoting a certain event. In the light of the right definition, event marketing strategy should be understood as a tailor-made plan to promote a brand/product with events as an advertising tool. The whole strategy should include an in-depth analysis of the plans of brand's presence on events. One of the only sources in this topic: eventory.cc highlights the importance of identifying the role in the event. This step includes answers whenever someone should actually participate in the event (conferences, fairs or exhibitors, participants), sponsor it or organize it. Such an analysis would take place while taking all other possible factors into the account. Further studies are required in this topic.

In order to measure the success of event marketing, the brand impact has to be verified. Based on [[Advertising Research Foundation]] (ARF) made in March 2006, engagement is "turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context".{{r|Creamer}} There was also a function created to show the impact on a brand: ''Engagement + Trust x Targeted Group = Brand Impact.''

== Types of events ==
According to thebalance.com, events can be sorted out into nine different groups:

# Seminars and conferences - for educational purposes.
# Trade shows - lead generation activity.
# Executive retreats and incentive programs - enjoyable activities mixed with business development.
# Golf events - relationship management.
# Appreciation events - building a rapport in informal environment.
# Company or organization milestones - the opportunity to celebrate company's achievements.
# Team building events - build upon a company's strengths.
# Product launch events - creating a "buzz" around new product.
# Board meetings and shareholder meetings - meeting &amp; reviewing business performances.{{r|Hard}}

'''Gerald Fredrick''' ('''Jerry''') '''Davis''' (born 1961) is an American sociologist, and Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Michigan]], known for his work on corporate networks,&lt;ref&gt;Gulati, Ranjay. "Alliances and networks." ''Strategic management journal'' 19.4 (1998): 293-317.&lt;/ref&gt; social movements&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Min‐Dong Paul. "A review of the theories of corporate social responsibility: Its evolutionary path and the road ahead."

''Academy of management review'' 24.2 (1999): 191-205.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Davis obtained his AB in philosophy and psychology at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1984, his MA in Sociology from [[Stanford University]], and his PhD in Organizational Behavior at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] in 1990.

After graduation Davis started his academic career at [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg Graduate School of Management]] as assistant professor in 1990, and got promoted to associate professor. In 1994 he returned to the Stanford University Graduate School of Business as associate professor, and got promoted to full professor. In the year 1997–98 he was research fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California. Since 2001 he is professor of sociology   at the [[Ross School of Business]] at the [[University of Michigan]], where he was also professor of management and organizations from 2002 to 2004. 

Davis described his research interests as "broadly concerned with the effects of finance on society.  Recent writings examine how ideas about corporate social responsibility have evolved to meet changes in the structures and geographic footprint of multinational corporations; whether "shareholder capitalism" is still a viable model for economic development; how income inequality in an economy is related to corporate size and structure; why theories about organizations do (or do not) progress; how architecture shapes social networks and innovation in organizations; why stock markets spread to some countries and not others; and whether there exist viable organizational alternatives to shareholder-owned corporations in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/gfdavis/ Jerry Davis] at ''bus.umich.edu,'' Accessed 25.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''House of Bolin''' (also known as W.A. Bolin) is one of the oldest firms specialising in jewellery and silverware that remains in the hands of its founding family. The firm exists today as Jewellers and Silversmiths to HM King Carl XVI Gustav.

== History ==
=== Russian Imperial Court ===
The firm's archives once dated as far back as 1796, and its founder, the German-born jeweller [[Andreas Roempler]], was established in [[St. Petersburg]] as early as 1790. In the registers of the German colony of this city he is called Master of Diamonds. He became a manufacturing jeweller of the Court by 1796 and functioned as official Appraiser to the Russian Imperial Court starting in 1823.&lt;ref name="faerber 22"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.faerber-collection.com/index.php?folder=glossary&amp;pageF=list&amp;glosID=22|title=Bolin|website=Faerber-coolection.com|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolin rapidly became the most important jeweller in St. Petersburg. At the peak of his activity, he supplied more to the Imperial Court than all other jewellers put together. Towards the end of the nineteenth century some of the leading Paris houses, in particular [[Boucheron]], established themselves in Russia, and were granted commissions. From the 1890s, Bolin's main competitor was [[Fabergé]], and although the Bolins continued to make most of the large pieces of jewellery for the Court, Fabergé surpassed Bolin in numbers and possibly also in turnover. The total invoiced was 339,400 roubles.

=== The Bolin dynasty ===

His eldest daughter, Sofia, married Gottlieb Ernst Jahn, a goldsmith, who subsequently became Roempler's partner. Jahn is known to have supplied an opal and diamond jewellery suite, comprising a tiara, necklace and bracelet, at the occasion of the christening of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia]] on 17 May 1834. The price of 169,601 roubles was the highest ever paid for a christening gift in the nineteenth century.

In 1833 [[Carl Edvard Bolin]] arrived in St. Petersburg and began to work for Andreas Roempler. In 1834 he married Ernestine Catharina, another daughter of the recently deceased Roempler, becoming a full partner at the occasion of his marriage. The firm was henceforth named Jahn &amp; Bolin. Brother-in-law Jahn died in 1836, leaving Bolin as partner to Jahn's widow. In 1839 the partners submitted a request to become Jewellers to the Imperial Court, which was granted. Many of the parures of the Empresses and grand Duchesses were tailored by Bolin, now the main owner of the company.&lt;ref name="faerber 22"/&gt;

In 1836 Henrik Conrad, then only sixteen years old, joined his elder brother in St. Petersburg,&lt;ref name="faerber 22"/&gt; staying with Carl Edvard until 1852 when he opened a shop of his own in Moscow in partnership with an Englishman, [[James Steuart Shanks]]. Their shop was called ''Shanks &amp; Bolin, Magasin Anglais'', and was situated on the exclusive ''Kuznetski Most''. They sold not only jewellery and silverware (this being Henrik Conrad's department) but also ladies' luxury accessories such as handbags, gloves, plumes, luxurious underwear, etc. This partnership did not last long and Henrik Conrad continued the business alone, though the Shanks an Bolin name continues on silverware until the 1880s. His specialty was fine silverware which he manufactured and sold in Moscow and with which he supplied his St. Petersburg relatives. Originally the silver workshop was run by Maria Linke, and later by her son, Konstantin.

In 1864 Carl Edvard Bolin died in St. Petersburg, leaving his part of the firm in the hands of his sons Gustaf and Edward.

=== Art Nouveau ===

When Henrik Conrad died in 1888 in Moscow, he left everything to his three daughters. His sons, in his opinion, had received an expensive upbringing and training which was to be their sole legacy. To make it possible to continue the business, his eldest son [[Wilhelm James Andreevitch Bolin]] opened a branch for his St. Petersburg cousins called C. E. Bolin. He continued on his own in Moscow, very much in the old tradition and was especially interested in silverware, bringing in young French sculptors as designers and making magnificent pieces in the somewhat overladen style of the 1880s. Eventually, he adopted the Art Nouveau style, often combining glass (Lalique), ceramics and cut crystal with silver mounts. In 1912 he took over the Moscow shop in his own name W.A. Bolin.

In St. Petersburg the two brothers, Gustaf and Edward, who in 1912 had been granted the title of hereditary noblemen with the right to bear a coat-of-arms, continued as one of the foremost jewellery houses. Sadly, Gustaf died in 1916, creating a vacuum, as neither he nor his brother Edward had any heirs wishing to take over the business. Wilhelm Bolin, who had two sons, was interested. However, the [[Russian revolution]] put an end to such plans.

=== Transfer to Sweden ===
Vasily Bolin, like his father, kept his Swedish citizenship. In 1904 he purchased a property in the south of Sweden which he visited each summer together with his family. Showing foresight, he opened a branch office in Bad Homburg in Germany in 1912 - a spa visited by the Tsar and his family. Shortly before WWI, Vasily Bolin had decided to open shop in Germany, but remained stuck there when the war broke out, and while transiting in Stockholm to try to reach St-Petersburg, he made an agreement with a banker to open a shop in the city. The company's stocks in Germany were transferred in Sweden.&lt;ref name="rbth longreads"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/longreads/russian-imperial-jewelers/|title=More than Faberge: The Russian Imperial jewellers that time forgot|website=Rbth.com|date=|author=Irina Osipova|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the archives of the Bolin firm have, as yet, {{when|date=May 2015}} been found. A number of invoices from Bolin to the Imperial Court have been discovered in the Imperial Archives in St. Petersburg. There may be more and research has been initiated to locate both them and Bolin's own records. During the Bolshevik overthrow, account books were confiscated, Bolin jewellery owners were tracked and the gems were stolen as [[war chest]].&lt;ref name="rbth longreads"/&gt; Some Bolin pieces belonging to royal members were put in a safe place in the Swedish embassy in St-Petersburg, and later transferred to Stockholm where it was hidden in the Foreign Ministry’s storage rooms, and forgotten until 2008 when the ministry moved its archives. Maria Pavlovna died in 1920 and never told her family about the jewels in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/278453|title=Romanov tsar’s jewels surface in Sweden|website=Digitaljournal.com|date=29 August 2009|author=Kay Mahtews|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/world/20090828155951310/|title=Romanov jewels worth 2 mln euros surface in Sweden|website=Sputniknews.com|date=28 August 2009|author=RIA Novosti|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm exists today as Jewellers and Silversmiths to HM King Carl XVI Gustav.

Bolin created the engagement ring worn by [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]] prior to her [[Wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|2010 wedding with Prince Daniel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourtjeweller.com/2016/12/the-sunday-ring-crown-princess.html|title=The Sunday ring: Crown Princess Victoria's engagement ring|website=Thecourtjeweller.com|date=4 December 2016|author=Ella Kay|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] auctioned some of her Bolin jewellery, including a collier and bangle in 18k white gold with cultured pearls and diamonds (made in 1995), estimated at around $60K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barnebys.com/blog/jewelry/tiffany-treasures-and-abba-jewelry-up-for-auction-at-wa-boli/1124/|title=Tiffany Treasures and ABBA jewelry up for Auction at W.A.

[[File:Oka Jurō.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of a Japanese man|Jūrō  Oka (27 July 1870&amp;nbsp;– 8&amp;nbsp;January 1923)]]

'''Jūrō  Oka''' ({{lang|ja|岡 十郎}} ''Oka Jūrō'', 27 July 1870&amp;nbsp;– 8 January 1923) was a Japanese businessman considered the "father of Japanese whaling".{{sfnm|1a1=Newton|1y=2012|1p=240|2a1=Ellis|2y=1992|2p=266}}

In the 1890s oka travelled to the West to acquire [[whaling]] techniques and equipment, and in 1899 established [[Nihon En'yō Gyogyō]] [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]], which caught its first whale the following year with Norwegian gunner.  [[Whaling in Japan]] grew rapidly and competition was fierce.  In 1908 Oka became the first president of the Japan Whaling Association.  Oka declared Japan would "become one of the greatest whaling nations in the world&amp;nbsp;... The day will come when we shall hear one morning that whales have been caught in the Arctic and in the evening that whales are being hunted in the Antarctic."

==Life and career==
Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, Japan went through a period of rapid modernization, and many were sent to the West to bring back knowledge and technology.  The nation began to assert its authority in the Far East, which was to lead to the colonization of Korea and Taiwan.  The [[Russian Empire]] dominated whaling in the region, which added political motivations to Japanese whaling.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=135}}

Oka visited the government in Tokyo with a plan to modernize whaling.  The government agreed to it, and he set off for Norway, where he purchased whaling equipment at 10% above the prices asked to ensure early delivery to Japan.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=135}}  He studied the practicalities of whaling in [[Finnmark]] and made trips to the [[Azores]] to observe traditional methods and to the [[Newfoundland Colony]] to observe modern methods which had just begun to be used there.  He concluded that the Norwegians had a superior system, but that Japan could not adopt it as-is given that the Norwegians whaled primarily for oil, the Japanese for meat.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=136}}

Oka returned to Japan and in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] on 20 July 1899 established the whaling company [[Nihon En'yō Gyogyō]] [[Kabushiki gaisha|K.K.]], nicknamed the ''Ichimaru Kaisha'' after its logo: the Chinese character for the number one ({{lang|ja|一}} ''{{transl|ja|ichi}}'') within a circle (''{{transl|ja|maru}}'').  Oka was managing director.  Oka's was not the first modern whaling corporation in Japan: Hogei Gumi had preceded it by a year, but had found little success and closed in 1900.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=136}}

Japan was in financial straits following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–95) so Oka found it difficult to raise the 100,000 yen necessary for the enterprise.  The company applied for a whaling licence from Korea, which was difficult to obtain as the Korean court was under the influence of the Russian Empire.  A three-year licence was granted, restricted to three locations at 600 yen per [[whaler]].  For reasons of prestige, the company had the whaler built in Japan: the ''Daiichi Chōshū Maru'' ({{lang|ja|第一長州丸}}, completed 30 November 1899), named after [[Chōshū Domain]], which was Yamaguchi Prefecture's name before the Meiji Restoration.  The company hired an experienced Norwegian gunner, Morten Pedersen, who shot the company's first whale—a [[blue whale]]—on 4 February 1900.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|pp=136–137}}

The company turned its first profit the following year, by which point it had added a whaler, the ''Olga'', leased from an Anglo-Russian company.  Nihon En'yō Gyogyō faced near ruin when the ''Daiichi Chōshū Maru'' was wrecked on the coast of Korea in a blizzard on 2 December 1901; the ship was uninsured, as no insurance company had been willing to cover it.  The ''Olga''{{`}}s catch the following year nearly covered the losses, though, and the company survived.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=137}}

Oka began to charter the Norwegian whalers ''Rex'' and ''Regina''; Norwegian companies were unable otherwise to obtain whaling licenses in the region.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=137}}  In 1904 the company purchased the ''Olga'' and reorganized as Tōyō Gyogyō ({{lang|ja|東洋漁業}}) with capital of 500,000 yen.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=138}}

Oka obtained a concession from the Korean government on 11 January 1904; as Russian whaling ceased during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–05) Oka had a ''de facto'' monopoly in Korean waters for the war's duration, which he expanded with the lease of three Russian stations on 1 May 1905.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=142}}  Japan's success in the war opened Eastern waters and allowed the company to expand.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=139}}  It began purchasing new whalers in 1906, the first of which was the Norwegian-built ''Togo'', and soon became the most profitable whaling company worldwide.  Its success inspired other Japanese whaling companies, with similar success.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=138}}  Competition was fierce, and whaling companies fought to secure the best whalers, until the government threatened to intervene; to calm this strife, Oka led a series of conferences in mid-1908 that led to the establishment of the Japan Whaling Association on 18 December 1908, based in [[Osaka]] with Oka as its first president.  The Association restricted the number of whalers within Japanese waters and had heavy penalties for breaches of its code.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=139}}

On 2 May 1910 Japan's four largest whaling companies merged with two smaller ones to form the Tōyō Hogei K.K. ({{lang|ja|東洋捕鯨}}, "Oriental Whaling Company").{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=142}}  Oka declared Japan would "become one of the greatest whaling nations in the world&amp;nbsp;... The day will come when we shall hear one morning that whales have been caught in the Arctic and in the evening that whales are being hunted in the Antarctic."{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=144}}  Other companies went bankrupt, and still others partook in mergers, until by the 1930s the large company Taiyō Gyogyō ({{lang|ja|大洋漁業}}) had absorbed them all.{{sfn|Tønnessen|Johnsen|1982|p=138}}

'''LG.Philips Displays''' was a joint venture created in 2001 by [[LG Electronics]] of [[South Korea]] and [[Philips]] Electronics of the [[Netherlands]]. It primarily manufactured [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s used in traditional television sets.

These two companies also operated another joint venture, [[LG.Philips LCD]], which focuses on LCD panels used in flat panel television sets and laptop computers.

As of 2006, the company had run into bankruptcy and restarted under the same name with investments of a third party ([[JP Morgan]]). LG.Philips LCD was not affected by this bankruptcy.


LG.Philips Displays shares were sold in the beginning of March 2007. The company name has been changed to '''LP Displays''' from 1 April 2007. LP is a historic reference to the old parent companies LG and Philips. Since, the fate of the company is unknown.

This is a '''list of companies founded by alumni of [[Harvard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]]''', including people who attended the colleges but did not receive a bachelor's degree. This list is not exhaustive, as it only includes notable,&lt;!-- i.e. having articles on Wikipedia, but we don't reference Wikipedia within Wikipedia--&gt; well-documented companies. This list does not include those who only have graduate degrees from [[Harvard University]]. '''For companies by Harvard alumni in general, see [[List of companies founded by Harvard University alumni]].'''

Harvard alumni have started a large number of companies.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Pazzanese, "Harvard's alumni impact", ''Harvard Gazette'', [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/harvards-alumni-impact/ 8 December 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table, ownership of public companies is shown by their stock symbol; companies which are now owned by other companies are listed with their ultimate owner in parentheses. "ND" ("no degree") means that the person pursued a degree program, but never received the degree. An asterisk at the beginning of the "Founder" column indicates that there were other founders who were not Harvard or Radcliffe College alumni.

It was established by Gavin Weale who is the former Livity UK Associate Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavin Weale - Shuttle Worth Foundation |url=http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/alumni/gavin-weale/ |publisher=Shuttle Worth Foundation |accessdate=7 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326002724/https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/fellows/alumni/gavin-weale/ |archivedate=26 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was started with the aim of helping put young creative [[South African]] a platform and to give young people between the ages of 18 and 25 a chance to gain valuable experience and create influential content that is seen by hundreds of thousands of their peers.

Major funding for Livity Africa came from the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], a [[South Africa]]n based social innovation foundation – in the form of a three-year fellowship awarded to Gavin Weale, managing director of Livity Africa.

In May 2014, Livity Africa launched the ''Digify'' program in partnership with [[Google]], a digital bootcamp to teach youngsters digital and social media skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ventureburn.com/2014/05/livity-africa-launches-digify-to-create-digitally-astute-young-south-africans/|title=Livity Africa launches Digify to create digitally astute young South Africans|website=Ventureburn.com|date=15 May 2014|author=Marguerite Heyns|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Google announced it broadened its partnership with Livity to train 1 million Africans to the digital world over a 12-month period.

'''Sir Mark John Spurgeon Allen''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] (born 3 July 1950) is a British diplomat, intelligence officer, and businessman.

==Early life==
Mark Allen was born on 3 July 1950.&lt;ref name="santbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Mark Allen|url=https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/people/mark-allen|website=St Antony's College, University of Oxford|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Peter Muir Spurgeon Allen, was headmaster of [[Cokethorpe School]] in Oxfordshire. He was educated at the [[Dragon School]], Oxford, and at [[Downside School]], the Roman Catholic public school in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name="santbio"/&gt; He then read Arabic and Turkish at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name="santbio"/&gt;

==Career==
Allen joined the [[British Foreign Service]], where he worked for 30 years. After studying at the [[Middle East Centre for Arab Studies]] – a claimed British ‘spy school’ in a village near [[Beirut]]&lt;ref name=DMail1211483/&gt; – he was posted to [[Abu Dhabi]] in 1974.  There he developed his love of [[falconry]] from his contacts with the [[Bedouin]], to the extent that he wrote a series of books on the subject, including ''Falconry in Arabia'' (1980). He then spent much of the rest of his operational career in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=LSE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lse.ac.uk/IDEAS/people/bios/allenMark.aspx |title=Mark Allen |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303060624/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/IDEAS/people/bios/allenMark.aspx |archivedate=3 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, as head of [[MI6]]’s counter-terrorism unit, Allen and [[Stephen Kappes]] of the [[CIA]] led talks that resulted in an end of support for terrorist activity by Colonel [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and of international sanctions against Libya.&lt;ref name=DMail1211483&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1211483/Ex-spy-BPs-Lawrence-Arabia.html#ixzz1EtrE0VMc|title=Ex-spy is BP's Lawrence of Arabia|author=Glen Owen|publisher=Daily Mail|date=6 September 2009|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confidential documents discovered by [[Human Rights Watch]] in Libyan Government offices, following the fall of the Gaddafi regime, suggested the involvement of the British Government in [[Rendition (law)|rendition]] operations.  These included a fax apparently sent from Sir Mark to the Libyan authorities in March 2004, saying: 
{{cquote|"I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Mr Belhaj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.....Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from [Mr Belhaj] through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence about [Mr Belhaj] was British... I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leighday.co.uk/International-and-group-claims/Libya&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After losing out to [[John Scarlett]] in his bid to become head of MI6, in which he was supported by his friend [[Jack Straw]], Allen resigned in 2004.&lt;ref name=DMail1211483/&gt;

After a six-month sabbatical, Allen became a Senior Advisor to the Monitor Group, a global consulting and private equity firm.&lt;ref name=LSE/&gt; He was also approved by the [[Cabinet Office]] and then [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] to be allowed to work immediately as a special advisor for [[BP]].&lt;ref name=DMail1211483/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSE/&gt; Allen used his contacts in both the United Kingdom and Libya to resolve the issues surrounding the release of [[Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi]] in relation to the [[Lockerbie bombing]]. Allen developed his relationships with the Libyan regime through Gaddafi's son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]], who studied for a Ph.D at the [[London School of Economics]]. BP later signed a £15&amp;nbsp;billion contract with Libya for a joint venture in oil exploration and extraction.&lt;ref name=DMail1211483/&gt; In 2010, he was requested to appear before the [[US Senate]] committee investigating the release of al-Megrahi in relation to BP's oil deal, something which as an advisor to BP he was blocked from doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7905061/BPs-MI6-adviser-called-before-Senate-over-Libya-deal.html|title=BP's MI6 adviser called before Senate over Libya deal|author=Robert Winnett|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he helped broker the release of Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in Libya on charges of having [[HIV trial in Libya|injected HIV virus into children]].&lt;ref name=Times6820996&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6820996.ece|title=Sir Mark Allen has spent years negotiating deals with Libya|author=Tom Baldwin|publisher=The Times|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2011, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper claimed that Allen had been implicated in the arrest of [[Abdelhakim Belhaj]] in March 2004 in Thailand, and the subsequent torture of Belhaj by Gaddafi's regime in [[Abu Salim prison]] in [[Tripoli]], Libya.&lt;ref name=IndependentMI6TorturedBelhaj20110906&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/libyan-rebel-leader-says-mi6-knew-he-was-tortured-2349778.html|title=Libyan rebel leader says MI6 knew he was tortured|author=Kim Sengupta|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=6 September 2011|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 Britain's [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided not to charge Allen for his role, on the grounds they had insufficient evidence, even though the Metropolitan Police had provided them with a 28,000 page dossier.&lt;ref name=MiddleEastEye2017-02-19/&gt;  In October 2016 Belhadj appealed the dismissal. Belhadj's appeal relies on communication from Allen, found in the offices of [[Moussa Koussa]] the head of Muammar Gaddafi's Intelligence service, after those offices were stormed by opposition forces, when Gaddafi was overthrown.

Allen is a Senior Associate and honorary fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name="santbio"/&gt; and is a member of the board of the [[Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth]] in St John's Wood, London.

==Personal life==
Allen married Margaret Mary Watson in 1976 and has two children. He was inducted into the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] in 2002, and knighted in 2005.&lt;ref name=LSE/&gt; A devout [[Roman Catholic]] who has edited a book of prayers for the young,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=0860123928|title=First Holy Communion: With a Foreword by His Excellency Archbishop Giovanni Tonucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; he lives in [[Westminster]].&lt;ref name=DMail1211483/&gt;

== Background ==
Before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] in Washington D.C.,&lt;ref name=case1&gt;{{cite court |litigants=In re Tam |vol=808 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1321 |pinpoint= |court=Fed.

This case was heard on appeal after [[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] applied for a [[trademark]] registration on the mark "[[The Slants]]" for his band from the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (PTO) and was denied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name=harv&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/243-252_Online.pdf ''The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Leading Cases''], 131 Harv. L. Rev. 243 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The PTO interpreted the likely meaning of "The Slants" as a term to refer to people of Asian descent, despite claims from the band that the actual meaning referred to their perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-02|title=The Slants|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Slants&amp;oldid=833843152|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they were repurposing the term from an offensive slur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/opinion/the-power-of-repurposing-a-slur.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Slants on the Power of Repurposing a Slur|date=2017-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTO used anecdotal sources like [[Urban Dictionary]] to support their claims, while ignoring survey data, linguistics experts, and legal declarations from Asian American community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/should-we-be-able-to-reclaim-a-racist-insult-as-a-registered-trademark.html|title=Should We Be Able to Reclaim a Racist Insult — as a Registered Trademark?|last=Jeong|first=Sarah|date=2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/20/236235813/asian-american-band-fights-to-trademark-name-the-slants|title=Asian-American Band Fights To Trademark Name 'The Slants'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/asian-american-group-the-slants-head-to-supreme-court-w460214|title=Asian-American Group The Slants Head to Supreme Court Over Band Name|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion was heard [[en banc]] by the Federal Circuit and the majority, which was written by [[Kimberly Ann Moore|Circuit Judge Moore]], determined that the Disparaging Provision ({{uscsub|15|1052|a}}) of the [[Lanham Act]] is [[unconstitutional]] and found that [[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] was entitled to trademark registration.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2265-2272-Online.pdf ''Recent Case: Federal Circuit Holds the Lanham Act's Antidisparagement Provision Unconstitutional''], 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2265 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Tam was represented by John C. Connell of Archer &amp; Greiner and [[Ron Coleman (legal scholar)|Ron Coleman]] and Joel MacMull, now of Mandelbaum Salsburg.

The United States government petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] for [[writ]] of [[certiorari]], which was granted in September 2016.  In addition to this case, there was another case before the Fourth Circuit, ''[[Washington Redskins|Pro-Football, Inc.]] v. [[Amanda Blackhorse|Blackhorse]]'', 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015) to decide the same issue of whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;DISPARAGING TRADEMARKS: The case of “in re Tam” and its current impact, Potente: A Professional Law Corporation, http://potentelaw.com/disparaging-trademarks-case-re-tam-current-impact/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government Can't Deny Trademarks Over Offensive Names, Appeals Court Rules, NPR, https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/22/460692655/government-cant-deny-trademarks-over-offensive-names-appeals-court-rules&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an attempt by Pro Football to merge the two cases, the Supreme Court refused to grant the motion. 

Section 2(a)'s ban on the federal registration of "immoral" or "scandalous" marks originated in the trademark legislation of the Lanham Act. A disparaging mark is a mark which "dishonors by comparison with what is inferior, slights, deprecates, degrades, or affects or injures by unjust comparison."&lt;ref&gt;''In re Geller'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3330786945440697276&amp;q=808+F.3d+1321&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,41&amp;as_vis=1 751 F.3d 1355], 1358 (2014)(alterations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Tam (musician)|Simon Tam]] is the founder and bassist for the Asian-American dance-rock band [[The Slants]]. Tam named his band The Slants to "reclaim" and "take ownership" of Asian stereotypes. On March 5, 2010, Tam filed his first application to register THE SLANTS. After several appeals, the application was eventually abandoned. On November 14, 2011, Tam filed his second application (App. No. 85/472,044) seeking to register the mark THE SLANTS for "Entertainment in the nature of live performances by a musical band," based on his use of the mark since 2006. The examiner refused to register Tam's mark, finding it likely disparaging to "persons of Asian descent" under § 2(a). The examiner found that the mark likely referred to people of Asian descent in a disparaging way, explaining that the term "slants" had "a long history of being used to deride and mock a physical feature" of people of Asian descent. The examiner found that a substantial composite of persons of Asian descent might find the term offensive&lt;ref name="''id.''"&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; precisely because it was being used by an Asian American band, saying: “Here, the evidence is uncontested that applicant is a founding member of a band that is self described as being composed of members of Asian descent...Thus, the association of the term SLANTS with those of Asian descent is evidenced by how the applicant uses the work - '''as the name of an all Asian-American band.'''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ex-parte-appeal-brief-of-simon-tam-of-th-95764/|title=In re Simon Shiao Tam - Ex Parte Appeal Brief of Simon Tam of the PTO's Refusal to Register THE SLANTS Trademark {{!}} JD Supra|work=JD Supra|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this determination, Tam decided to appeal before the Federal Circuit.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

== Relevant Areas of Law ==

=== Lanham Act's Disparaging Provision ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|15|1052|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Viewpoint Discrimination ===

Viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government is not only banning certain content or topics, but certain ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/502/105/case.html 502 U.S. 105], 116 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The test for viewpoint discrimination is “[o]ther things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.”&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va.'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/819/case.html 515 U.S. 819], 894 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, viewpoint discrimination involves intent to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Kokinda'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/720/case.html 497 U.S. 720], 736 (1990) (citing ''Monterey County Democratic Cent. Comm. v. United States Postal Serv.'', [http://openjurist.org/812/f2d/1194/monterey-county-democratic-central-committee 812 F.2d 1194], 1198-1199 (9th Cir. 1987)).&lt;/ref&gt; The general concern being that the government will try to eradicate, not just content from the marketplace, but certain viewpoints—whether positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Tam'', 808 F.3d at 1334-35.&lt;/ref&gt; If something rises to the level of viewpoint-based discrimination, it is deemed to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Comm'r of the Va. Dept. of Motor Vehicles'', [http://openjurist.org/288/f3d/610/sons-of-confederate-veterans-incorporated-griffin 288 F.3d 610], 623 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content Discrimination ===

In ''[[Reed v. Town of Gilbert]]'', the court said that, “Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed v. Town of Gilbert'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-502_9olb.pdf 135 S. Ct. 2218], 2227 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further determined that, “This commonsense meaning of the phrase ‘content based’ requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.”&lt;ref&gt;''Reed'', 135 S. Ct. at 2227 (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2663, 180 L. Ed. 2d
544-55).&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, content-based discrimination is presumptively invalid&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; and if something is found to be discriminating on the basis of content, it must survive strict scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Pleasant Grove City v. Summum]]'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/460/ 555 U.S. 460], 469 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny ===

According to Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor: “[t]o satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must establish three elements: (1) "the interests the government proffers in support" of the statute must be "properly characterized as 'compelling'"; (2) the statute must "effectively advance [] those interests"; and (3) the statute must be "narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interests asserted."&lt;ref&gt;''Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor'', 582 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing ''Blount v. SEC'', [https://openjurist.org/61/f3d/938 61 F.3d 938], 943, 314 U.S. App. D.C. 52 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Hudson (Intermediate Scrutiny) ===

For ''[[Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission|Central Hudson]]'' to apply, the court would have to determine that the statute at issue deals with commercial speech.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Cent. Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980) (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/557/).&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Central Hudson'', the Supreme Court developed a four-part test to determine whether a statute should pass muster.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt; The test looks to see: (1) Whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment—for it to fall here, it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) whether the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest—there must be a “reasonable fit” between the government's ends and the means of achieving those ends.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

In order for something to be classified as government speech, the court looks at four factors: (1) the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the literal speaker; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14145695784392572141&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr 112 F. Supp. 3d 439], 460, (E.D. Va. 2015) (citing ''Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Vehicles'', 288 F.3d at 618).&lt;/ref&gt;

The central issue before the Federal Circuit was to determine whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and should therefore be voided.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Under the case name ''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015), Circuit Judge Moore decided that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional for various reasons and that Tam should be granted trademark protection on THE SLANTS.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asian-American band “The Slants” overturns USPTO rule on “disparaging” trademarks, ARS Technica, https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/federal-circuit-judges-say-rule-against-disparaging-trademarks-is-unconstitutional/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewpoint v. Content-Based Discrimination ===

The court determined that the Lanham Act was viewpoint-based discriminatory because whenever the government chooses to deny trademark protection to a mark, it is doing so because of the message the mark conveys.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government tried to defend their position before the Federal Circuit by saying that they should be able to deny protection to the most "vile" racial epithets and images; however, the Federal Circuit said that "When the government discriminates against speech because it disapproves of the message conveyed by the speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint."&lt;ref&gt;''In Re Tam'', 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (citing ''Sorrell'', 131 S.Ct. at 2664).&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Circuit bolstered their stance that it is viewpoint discriminatory because the PTO refused to register "The Slants"; however, the PTO has registered marks such as "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency".&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit found the only difference between marks such as "The Slants" versus "Celebrasians" and "Asian Efficiency" is the messages conveyed. The Slants could be seen as being derogatory towards those of Asian descent versus positive. Since the court determined that the disparaging provision is viewpoint discriminatory, then it is immediately unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

In the alternative, the Federal Circuit determined that the disparaging provision is content-based discriminatory, in addition to viewpoint-discriminatory.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Additionally, the Federal Circuit came to the determination that even though trademarks inherently deal more with commercial speech versus expressive speech, that when the government cancels a mark under the disparaging provision, it is affecting more of the expressive aspects of speech and not the commerciality of it.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit found that if the disparaging provision is not found to be viewpoint discriminatory (in light of a higher court potentially overturning parts of this case) that it must be content-based discriminatory and must survive strict scrutiny unless an exception applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Federal appeals court decides ‘The Slants’ case: excluding ‘disparaging marks’ from trademark registration violates the First Amendment, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/22/federal-appeals-court-decides-the-slants-case-excluding-disparaging-marks-from-trademark-registration-violates-the-first-amendment/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strict Scrutiny v. Intermediate Scrutiny (Central Hudson) ===

The government raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny by way of the ''Central Hudson'' test, because the inherent nature of trademarks are commercial.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; However, the Federal Circuit determined that when the PTO chooses to cancel trademarks under the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, it is usually because of their expressive components and not their commercial components.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit went on to say that commercial speech mixed with expressive speech should be treated as expressive under deciding whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that strict scrutiny should be applied.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"&gt;Philip G. Hampton, II, Scott Benfield, &amp; Alexander B. Lutzky (January 5, 2016). "Federal Circuit Rules Disparagement Clause of §2(a) of the Lanham Act Unconstitutional". Haynes Boone, [http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional http://www.haynesboone.com/news-and-events/news/alerts/2016/01/05/federal-circuit-rules-disparagement-clause-of-2a-of-the-lanham-act-unconstitutional].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Circuit's Analysis under ''Central Hudson'' ====

In the Federal Circuit's effort to show the unconstitutionality of the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, they chose to analyze the provision under the ''Central Hudson'' intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The part of the ''Central Hudson'' test that the Federal Circuit failed the Lanham Act on was the "legitimate Interest" element (See above).

For this element, the government raised three arguments for why they had a legitimate interest:
# The Government argued that they have a legitimate interest to dissociate itself from speech it finds odious. 
# The Government argued that it has a legitimate interest in "declining to expend its resources to facilitate the use of racial slurs as source identifiers in interstate commerce".
# The Government also argued that it has a legitimate interest in allowing States to make their own determinations about whether trademarks should be unenforceable on grounds of public policy.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

The Federal Circuit determined that none of the arguments raised by the government created a legitimate enough interest to pass the ''Central Hudson'' test. Since it does not pass the ''Central Hudson'' test, the Federal Circuit determined that it would also not pass strict scrutiny, since strict scrutiny requires a statute to rise to a higher standard.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Government Subsidy ===

The Government raised the argument that the Lanham Act should be classified as a Government Subsidy and therefore exempt from the strict scrutiny requirement.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit ultimately determined that no taxpayer dollars are used in registering trademarks, that it is completely user-funded in their application fees; therefore, the Federal Circuit determined that this does not fall under the government subsidy exception to strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;

=== Government Speech ===

The Government also raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is government speech and should therefore fall outside of the purview of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government argues this because of the ability to place the "®" or "TM" on the registered mark.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The government found this argument to be without merit.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Federal Circuit said that the only message the government conveys when a mark is registered with the PTO is that "a mark is registered."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The court cited many reasons for their determination, but, most prominently, was a policy consideration.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The Court was concerned that if they allowed this argument to win the day, then it would also affect other areas of law, such as Copyright and Patent law.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; The general concern being that the government could then control what they would and would not grant protections to and would therefore affect the types of speech expressed; this would have the effect of abridging free speech, which is a violation of the first amendment.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Concurrence by Judge O'Malley ===

In addition to agreeing with Circuit Judge Moore's opinion, Judge O'Malley added that she believes the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional under the vagueness doctrine too.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Part Concurrence &amp; Part Dissent by Judge Dyk ===

Circuit Judge Dyk generally agrees with the opinion of the majority in that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional; however, in his view, the majority err in going "beyond the facts of this case and holding the statute facially unconstitutional as applied to purely commercial speech."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Dyk also believed that many trademarks lack expressive characteristics that would merit First Amendment protection and therefore the analysis should be under the ''Central Hudson'' test and not strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanynes Boone"/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Lourie ===

Judge Lourie disagreed with the majority in many ways outlined below:
* Judge Lourie argued that the Lanham Act has dated back 70 years, it has been continuously applied during that time and it now being found to be unconstitutional seems bizarre.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Lourie cites to ''stare decisis'' as the first reason why the majority made a mistake.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eriq Gardner (December 22, 2015). "Rock Band Wins First Amendment Appeal Over 'Disparaging' Trademarks". Hollywood Reporter, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689 http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/rock-band-wins-first-amendment-850689].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Additionally, Judge Lourie said that denial of an applicant's trademark does not deny their right to speak freely.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Contending that the mark holder may still generally use the mark as it wishes; without federal registration, "it simply lacks access to certain federal statutory enforcement mechanisms for excusing others from confusingly similar uses of the mark."&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;
* Judge Lourie also said that there are other ways for the mark holder to have protections, including common law rights.&lt;ref name="''id.''"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent Kendall (December 22, 2015). "Government Can’t Reject Trademarks for Being Offensive, Court Says". Wall Street Journal, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668 https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-cant-reject-trademarks-for-being-disparaging-or-offensive-court-says-1450809668].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Finally, Judge Lourie also determined that trademarks are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore not be analyzed under strict scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

=== Dissent by Judge Reyna ===

Judge Reyna disagreed with the majority in the sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the ''Central Hudson'' test and intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a legitimate interest in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt; Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the legitimate interest of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that it makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.&lt;ref name=case1/&gt;

The United States Patent and Trademark Office appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the following question in its petition for [[certiorari]]: "whether the disparagement provision in 15 U.S.C. 1052(a) is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment"?&lt;ref&gt;''Lee v. Tam'', No. 15-1293, [http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Petition-for-writ_Michelle-K.-Lee-Director-United-States-Patent-and-Trademark-Office-Petitioner-v.-Simon-Shiao-Tam.pdf Pet. for Certiorari] at ''I''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court agreed to grant certiorari in September 2016.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"&gt;Docket No. 15-1293, Supreme Court of the United States, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1293.htm https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1293.htm] (last accessed June 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments were heard on January 18, 2017.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS docket"/&gt; 

On June 19, 2017 the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Tam, voting unanimously to affirm the lower court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Justices Strike Down Law Banning Disparaging Trademarks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/us/politics/supreme-court-trademarks-redskins.html|accessdate=5 December 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 2017|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/supreme-court-review/2017/9/2017-supreme-court-review-1.pdf Clay Calvert, ''Beyond Trademarks and Offense:'' Tam ''and the Justices’ Evolution on Free Speech''], 2016–2017 Cato Sup.

'''Nicholas Negroponte''' (born December 1, 1943) is a [[Greek American]] architect.  He is the founder and Chairman Emeritus of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]], and also founded the [[One Laptop per Child]] Association (OLPC).

==Early life==
Negroponte was born to {{Interlanguage link multi|Dimitri John|el|3=Δημήτριος Νεγρεπόντης}} ({{lang-el|Νεγροπόντης}}), a Greek shipping magnate and alpine skier, and grew up in New York City's [[Upper East Side]]. He is the younger brother of [[John Negroponte]], former [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]]. Another brother [[Michel Negroponte]] is an [[Emmy Award]]-winning [[filmmaker]], and his other brother, George Negroponte, is an [[artist]] and was President of [[the Drawing Center]] from 2002-2007.

He attended [[Buckley School (New York City)|Buckley School]] in New York, [[Fay School]] in Massachusetts, [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]] in Switzerland, and [[Choate Rosemary Hall|The Choate School]] (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], from which he graduated in 1961. Subsequently, he studied at [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] as both an undergraduate and graduate student in [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|Architecture]] where his research focused on issues of [[computer-aided design]]. He earned a master's degree in architecture from [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] in 1966. Despite his accomplished academic career, Negroponte has spoken publicly about his [[dyslexia]] and his difficulty reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q &amp; A with Nicholas Negroponte|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?202050-1/qa-nicholas-negroponte|publisher=C-SPAN|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=25 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===MIT===
Negroponte joined the faculty of [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] in 1966. For several years thereafter he divided his teaching time between [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]] and several visiting professorships at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

In 1967, Negroponte founded [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT]]'s Architecture Machine Group, a combination lab and think tank which studied new approaches to [[human-computer interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[MIT Press]]| isbn = 0-262-64010-4| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = The Architecture Machine: Towards a More Human Environment| location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Negroponte created the [[MIT Media Lab]] with [[Jerome B. Wiesner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 13| last = Schrage| first = Michael| title = An MIT Lab Tinkers With the Future of Personal Computers| work = [[The Washington Post]]| date = 1985-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he developed the lab into the pre-eminent computer science laboratory for new media and a high-tech playground for investigating the human-computer interface. Negroponte also became a proponent of [[intelligent agent]]s and personalized [[Online newspaper|electronic newspapers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn =0036-8733| volume = 265| issue = 3| pages = 76–83| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = Products and Services for Computer Networks| journal = [[Scientific American]]| year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he popularized the term the [[Daily Me]].

===''Wired''===
In 1992, Negroponte became involved in the creation of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' as the first investor. From 1993 to 1998, he contributed a monthly column to the magazine in which he reiterated a basic theme: "Move bits, not atoms."

Negroponte expanded many of the ideas from his ''Wired'' columns into a bestselling book ''[[Being Digital]]'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Knopf| isbn = 0-679-76290-6| last = Negroponte| first = Nicholas| title = Being Digital| location = New York| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made famous his forecasts on how the interactive world, the entertainment world and the information world would eventually merge. ''Being Digital'' was a bestseller and was translated into some twenty languages. Negroponte is a digital optimist who believed that computers would make life better for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, Martin and Harrison, John (2007) Communication and New Media, Oxford University Press, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  However, critics such as [[Cass Sunstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, C.R. (2001) Republic.com Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised his [[techno-utopianism|techno-utopian]] ideas for failing to consider the historical, political and cultural realities with which new technologies should be viewed.

In the 1980s Negroponte predicted that wired technologies such as telephones would become unwired by using airwaves instead of wires or fiber optics, and that unwired technologies such as televisions would become wired—a prediction commonly referred to as the [[Negroponte switch]].&lt;ref&gt;Speaking at a Northern Telecom meeting in the mid-80s with [[George Gilder]].  Negroponte called it "trading places" Gilder called it "The Negroponte Switch".  From ''Being Digital'', 1995, Negroponte, N.  {{ISBN|0-340-64930-5}} p 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In 2000, Negroponte stepped down as director of the [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]] as [[Walter Bender]] took over as Executive Director. However, Negroponte retained the role of laboratory Chairman. When [[Frank Moss (technologist)|Frank Moss]] was appointed director of the lab in 2006, Negroponte stepped down as lab chairman to focus more fully on his work with [[The Children's Machine|One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) although he retains his appointment as professor at MIT.

[[Image:Kaye negroponte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Lou Jepsen]], [[Alan Kay]] and Nicholas Negroponte unveil the [[$100 laptop]] in November 2005.]]
In November 2005, at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] held in [[Tunis]], Negroponte unveiled the concept of a $100 laptop computer, [[The Children's Machine]], designed for students in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Kirkpatrick| first= David| date=2005-11-28| accessdate = 2010-12-12 | work=Fortune| url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/11/28/8361971/index.htm | title=I'd Like to Teach the World to Type}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price has increased to US$180, however. The project is part of a broader program by One Laptop Per Child, a non-profit organisation started by Negroponte and other [[MIT Media Lab|Media Lab]] faculty, to extend [[Internet]] access in developing countries.

Negroponte is an active [[angel investor]] and has invested in over 30 startup companies over the last 30 years, including [[Zagats]], [[Wired magazine|Wired]], [[Ambient Devices]], [[Skype]] and [[Velti]]. He has sat on several boards, including [[Motorola]] (listed on the New York Stock Exchange) and [[Velti]] (listed on the NASDAQ and formerly on the London Stock Exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Velti Announces Date of AIM Delisting|url=http://investors.velti.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=558800|accessdate=27 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193039/http://investors.velti.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=558800|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). He is also on the advisory board of [[TTI/Vanguard]]. In August 2007, he was appointed to a five-member special committee with the objective of assuring the continued journalistic and editorial integrity and independence of the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] publications and services.  The committee was formed as part of the merger of Dow Jones with [[News Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wall Street Journal]], August 1, 2007.  "Text of Dow Jones Editorial Agreement". [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118598565803884843 Online edition] retrieved on October 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Negroponte's fellow founding committee members are [[Louis Boccardi]], [[Thomas Bray (writer)|Thomas Bray]], [[Jack Fuller (publisher)|Jack Fuller]], and the late former Congresswoman [[Jennifer Dunn (politician)|Jennifer Dunn]].

Negroponte has influenced modern day futurists, such as [[David Houle (futurist)|David Houle]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

A '''paper machine''' (or '''paper-making machine''') is an industrial machine used in the [[pulp and paper industry]]
to create [[paper]] in large quantities at high speed. Modern paper-making machines are based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a moving woven [[mesh]] to create a continuous paper web by filtering out the fibres held in a paper stock and producing a continuously moving wet mat of fibre. This is dried in the machine to produce a strong paper web. 

The basic process is an industrialised version of the historical process of hand paper-making, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of a printing and writing substrate. The first modern paper machine was invented in Britain by [[Henry Fourdrinier|Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier]], and patented in 1806.

The same process is used to produce [[paperboard]] on a paperboard machine.

==The process sections==

Paper machines usually have at least five distinct operational sections:

* [[#Forming section or wet end|Forming section]], commonly called the wet end, is a continuous rotating wire mesh which removes water from the paper by sucking it out of suspension.
* [[#Press section|Press section]] where the wet fibre web passes between large rolls loaded under high pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible.
* [[#Drying section|Drying section]], where the pressed sheet passes partly around, in a serpentine manner, a series of steam heated drying cylinders.  Drying removes the water content down to a level of about 6%, where it will remain at typical indoor atmospheric conditions. Infra-red driers are also used to supplement cylinder drying where required.
* [[#Calender section|Calender section]] where the dried paper is smoothened under high loading and pressure.  Only one ''nip'' (where the sheet is pressed between two rolls) is necessary in order to hold the sheet, which shrinks through the drying section and is held in tension between the press section (or breaker stack if used) and the calender.  Extra nips give more smoothing but at some expense to paper strength.
* [[#Reel section|Reel section]] where paper coming out of the machine is wound onto individual spools for further processing. 
There can also be a coating section to modify the surface characteristics with coatings such as china clay.

== History ==
Before the invention of [[continuous production|continuous]] paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry.

=== Fourdrinier machine ===
In 1799, [[Louis-Nicolas Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], France, was granted a [[patent]] for a continuous paper making machine.&lt;ref name="Larousse" /&gt; At the time Robert was working for [[Didot family#Saint-Léger Didot|Saint-Léger Didot]], with whom he quarreled over the ownership of the invention. Didot thought that England was a better place to develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the [[French Revolution]], he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers [[Sealy Fourdrinier|Sealy]] and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], [[stationers]] of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801. The Fourdrinier machine used a specially woven fabric [[mesh]] [[conveyor belt]] (known as a ''wire,'' as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. The original Fourdrinier forming section used a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the ''drainage table''.

With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Apsley, Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

Thomas Gilpin is most often credited for creating the first U.S cylinder type [[papermaking]] machine at [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]], [[Delaware]] in 1817. This machine was also developed in England, but it was a cylinder mould machine. The Fourdrinier machine wasn't introduced into the USA until 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Richard, "Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988", Athlone Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Similar designs ===
Records show Charles Kinsey of [[Paterson, NJ]] had already patented a continuous process papermaking machine in 1807.  Kinsey’s machine was built locally by Daniel Sawn and by 1809 the Kinsey machine was successfully making paper at the Essex Mill in Paterson.  Financial stress and potential opportunities created by the [[Embargo of 1807]] eventually persuaded Kinsey and his backers to change the mill’s focus from paper to cotton and Kinsey's early papermaking successes were soon overlooked and forgotten.&lt;ref name="Bidwell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bidwell|first1=John|title=American Paper Mills, 1690–1832: A Directory of the Paper Trade with Notes...|date=2013|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-58465-964-8|pages=154–155|url=http://www.upne.com/1584659648.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HAER NJ-6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historic American Engineering Record Essex Mill NJ-6|journal=National American Engineering Record|page=3|url=http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/nj/nj0100/nj0180/data/nj0180data.pdf|publisher=National Park Service Department of the Interior Washington D.C. 20240|quote=The Essex Mill is historic as the first new mill site leased by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufacturers, and as the scene of some of the earliest experiments with continuous paper manufacture in the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilpin's 1817 patent was similar to Kinsey's, as was the John Ames patent of 1822.  The Ames patent was challenged by his competitors, asserting that Kinsey was the original inventor and Ames had been pilfering other peoples' ideas, their evidence being the employment of Daniel Sawn to work on his machine.&lt;ref name=Bidwell /&gt;

== Pulp types and their preparations ==
{{Main|Pulp (paper)}}
The plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water.  After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded.  It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.

Rags of [[cotton]] and [[linen]] were the major source of pulp for paper before wood pulp.  Today almost all pulp is of wood fibre.  Cotton fibre is used in speciality grades, usually in printing paper for such things as resumes and currency.

Sources of rags often appear as waste from other manufacturing such as denim fragments or glove cuts.  Fibres from clothing come from the cotton boll.  The fibres can range from 3 to 7&amp;nbsp;cm in length as they exist in the cotton field.  Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric in a process of cooking, usually with steam.  The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process.  Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop.  A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a knife bed is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly.  As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length.  The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the knives and bed.

Another source of cotton fibre comes from the [[cotton ginning]] process.  The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as [[linter]]s for their short length and resemblance to lint.  Linters are too short for successful use in fabric.  Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts.  The first cuts are longer.

The two major classifications of pulp are [[chemical pulp|chemical]] and [[mechanical pulp|mechanical]].  Chemical pulps formerly used a [[sulfite process|sulphite process]], but the [[kraft process]] is now predominant.  Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical pulps and kraft process spent pulping chemicals are easier to recover and regenerate. Both chemical pulps and mechanical pulps may be bleached to a high brightness.

Chemical pulping dissolves the [[lignin]] that bonds fibres to one another, and binds the outer [[fibril]]s that compose individual fibres to the fibre core.  Lignin, like most other substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength.  Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains.  The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline [[hemicellulose]], which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.

Kraft pulp makes superior [[linerboard]] and excellent printing and writing papers.

Groundwood, the main ingredient used in [[newsprint]] and a principal component of magazine papers (coated publications), is literally ground wood produced by a grinder.  Therefore, it contains a lot of lignin, which lowers its strength.  The grinding produces very short fibres that drain slowly.

Thermomechanical pulp (TMP) is a variation of groundwood where fibres are separated mechanically while at high enough temperatures to soften the lignin.

Between chemical and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining.  Semi-chemical pulp is often used for corrugating medium.

Bales of [[recycled paper]] (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned.  Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. [[Deinked pulp]] is used in printing and writing papers and in [[tissue paper|tissue]], napkins and [[paper towel]]s. It is often blended with virgin pulp.

At integrated pulp and paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation.  Non integrated mills use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales.  The pulp bales are slushed in a [re]pulper.

== Stock (pulp) preparation ==

Stock preparation is the area where pulp is usually refined, blended to the appropriate proportion of [[hardwood]], [[softwood]] or recycled fibre, and diluted to as uniform and constant as possible consistency. The [[pH]] is controlled and various fillers, such as whitening agents, [[sizing|size]] and [[wet strength]] or dry strength are added if necessary.  Additional [[filler (materials)|fillers]] such as [[clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] and [[titanium dioxide]] increase [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] so printing on reverse side of a sheet will not distract from content on the obverse side of the sheet.  Fillers also improve printing quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called ''chests'', which may be either round or more commonly rectangular.  Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used.  Low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.

In the following process, different types of pulp, if used, are normally treated in separate but similar process lines until combined at a blend chest:

From high density storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped to a low density storage chest (tank).  From there it is typically diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest.  From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner.  Refining is an operation whereby the pulp [[slurry]] passes between a pair of discs, one of which is stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC, respectively.  The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance.  This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the [[fibril]]s of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength.  For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.

Hardwood fibres are typically 1&amp;nbsp;mm long and smaller in diameter than the 4&amp;nbsp;mm length typical of softwood fibres. Refining can cause the softwood fibre tube to collapse resulting in undesirable properties in the sheet.

From the refined stock, or blend chest, stock is again consistency controlled as it is being pumped to a machine chest. It may be refined or additives may be added en route to the machine chest.

The machine chest is basically a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest to be levelled out by the action of the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.)&lt;ref&gt;Results from dynamic material balance sensitivity analysis: The timing for the basis weight control loop is much slower than that of a consistency loop.  Also, varying pressure of the consistency control dilution water will introduce swings in consistency.  This can be and should be verified for any particular system using dynamic material balance software such as CADSIM Plus. Run model by creating a sharp consistency change ~ 1/2% and observe system stability. [http://www.aurelsystems.com/csplus.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
There are four main sections on this paper machine. The forming section makes the pulp into the basis of for sheets along the wire. The press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. In practice calender rolls are normally placed vertically in a ''stack''.

=== Forming section or wet end ===
[[File:Florida Pulp and Paper Company mill, Cantonment, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|300px| A worker inspecting wet, bleached wood pulp on an old-fashioned Hollander pulper or "beater".]]

From the machine chest stock is pumped to a head tank, commonly called a "head tank" or ''stuff box'', whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the fiber slurry or ''stock'' as it feeds the basis weight valve.  The stuff box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The consistency of the pulp slurry at the stuff box is in the 3% range.  Flow from the stuff box is by gravity and is controlled by the basis weight valve on its way to the fan pump suction where it injected into main flow of water to the fan pump.  The main flow of water pumped by the fan pump is from a whitewater chest or tank that collects all the water drained from the forming section of the paper machine. Before the fiber stream from the stuff box is introduced, the whitewater is very low in fiber content.  The whitewater is constantly recirculated by the fan pump through the headbox and recollected from the wire pit and various other tanks and chests that receive drainage from the forming wire and vacuum assisted drainage from suction boxes and wet fiber web handling rolls.  On the way to the head box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris. The fan pump ultimately feeds the headbox, whether or not any centrifugal cleaners or screens are present.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Machine_ops"&gt;{{cite book

The purpose of the headbox is create turbulence to keep the fibers from clumping together and to uniformly distribute the slurry across the width of the wire. Wood fibers have a tendency to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called flocculation.  Flocculation is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency.  Minimizing the degree of flocculation when forming is important to physical [[properties of paper]].&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

The consistency in the headbox is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres.  Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the '''z''' direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the '''x-y''' direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity).&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum because they have been sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).

The stock slurry, often called ''white water'' at this point, exits the head box through a rectangular opening of adjustable height called the ''slice'', the white water stream being called the ''jet'' and it is pressurized on high speed machines so as to land gently on the moving fabric loop or ''wire'' at a speed typically between plus or minus 3% of the wire speed, called ''rush'' and ''drag'' respectively.  Excessive ''rush'' or ''drag'' causes more orientation of fibres in the machine direction and gives differing physical properties in machine and cross directions; however, this phenomenon is not completely avoidable on Fourdrinier machines.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

On lower speed machines at 700 feet per minute, gravity and the height of the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice.  The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name.  The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the ''jet-to-wire ratio''.  When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction.  On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as ''shake''.  This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions.  On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine.  When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;  The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.

Two large rolls typically form the ends of the drainage section, which is called the ''drainage table''.  The ''breast roll'' is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre.  At the other end of the drainage table is the suction (''couch'') roll.  The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter.  The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine.  Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box.  From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Down machine from the suction roll, and at  a lower elevation, is the ''wire turning roll''. This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a considerable angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;

Supporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements.  In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet.  On low speed machines these table elements are primarily ''table rolls''.  As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation.  To prevent this drainage foils are used.  The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action.  Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

Approaching the dry line on the table are located low vacuum boxes that are drained by a barometric leg under gravity pressure. After the dry line are the suction boxes with applied vacuum.  Suction boxes extend up to the couch roll.  At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.&lt;ref name="TAPPI_Wet_End"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TAPPI  Wet End Ops"/&gt;

=== Variations of the Fourdrinier forming section ===
The forming section type is usually based on the grade of paper or paperboard being produced; however, many older machines use a less than optimum design.  Older machines can be upgraded to include more appropriate forming sections.

A '''second headbox''' may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer.  A ''secondary headbox'' is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained.  This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer.  Secondary headboxes are common on [[linerboard]].

A modification to the basic fourdrinier table by adding a second wire on top of the drainage table is known as a '''top wire former'''.  The bottom and top wires converge and some drainage is up through the top wire.  A top wire improves formation and also gives more drainage, which is useful for machines that have been sped up.

The '''Twin Wire Machine''' or '''Gap former''' uses two vertical wires in the forming section, thereby increasing the de-watering rate of the fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.&lt;ref&gt;Technology choice in a global industry : the case of the twin-wire in Canada, Ofori-Amoah, Benjamin, 1989
Thesis (Ph.D.) – Simon Fraser University, 1990, http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/handle/1892/6373&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also machines with entire Fourdrinier sections mounted above a traditional Fourdrinier. This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics.  These are called '''top Fourdriniers''' and they make multi-ply paper or [[paperboard]]. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.

Another type forming section is the '''cylinder mould machine'''&lt;ref&gt;''Paper Machine Clothing: Key to the Paper Making Process'' Sabit Adanur, Asten, CRC Press, 1997, p. 120–136, {{ISBN|978-1-56676-544-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially immersed  in a tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the [[cellulose]] fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD).  High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.

'''Tissue machines''' typically form the paper web between a wire and a special fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll.  The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a ''yankee''.  The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a ''doctor''.  [[Tissue paper|Tissue]] machines operate at speeds of up to 2000&amp;nbsp;m/min.

=== Press section ===
[[File:Paper machine.ogv|thumb|Paper machine]]
[[File:Granite Press Roll.JPG|thumb|Granite press roll at a granite quarry site]]

The second section of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press [[felt]]s that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.  The paper web consistency leaving the press section can be above 40%.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry"&gt;{{cite book

Pressing is the most efficient method of de-watering the sheet as only mechanical action is required. Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They are made up of a [[polyamide]] woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.

Presses can be single or double felted. A single felted press has a felt on one side and a smooth roll on the other. A double felted press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press felt. Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear smoother than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet.  Double felted presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.

Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or [[Blind hole|blind drilled]] surface. More advanced press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated shell and cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze stainless steel is covered with rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted in the core of the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. [[End face mechanical seal]]s are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Papermaking: Papermachine – Pressing|pages=2, 3, 12, 13|url=http://www.fibrelab.ubc.ca/files/2013/01/Topic-14-Papermaking-Pressing-text.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=UBC Fibre Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt; The granite rolls can be up to {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} long and {{Convert|6|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richter|first1=Dorothy A.|title=Barre granite quarries, Barre, Vermont|journal=Geological Society of America Centennial Field Guide—Northeastern Section|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional roll presses are configured with one of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.

Some grades of paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to transfer the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections.  Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have a large number of drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed [[centrifugal force]] flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.

Crown Controlled Rolls (also known as CC Rolls) are usually the mating roll in a press arrangement. They have [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the crown on the roll flat, to counteract the natural "bend" in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.

Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a relatively modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll is usually a standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved to the shape of the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to  a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases.  ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.

=== Dryer section ===

[[File:Papermaking machine at a paper mill near Pensacola.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Dryer section of an older Fourdrinier-style paper-making machine. These narrow, small diameter dryers are not enclosed by a hood, dating the photo to before the 1970s.]]
The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally [[steam]]-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe.  From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head.  Wide machines require multiple siphons.  In faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.&lt;ref name="Technical Association for the Pulp and Paper Industry" /&gt;

The sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer section.  The felts greatly improve heat transfer.  Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a very open weave that is almost see through,  It is common to have the first bottom dryer section unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.

Paper dryers are typically arranged in groups called ''sections''  so that they can be run at a progressively slightly slower speed to compensate for sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. Some grades of paper may also stretch as they run through the machine, requiring increasing speed between sections.  The gaps between sections are called ''draws''.

The drying sections are usually enclosed to conserve heat.  Heated air is usually supplied to the pockets where the sheet breaks contact with the driers.  This increases the rate of drying. The pocket ventilating tubes have slots along their entire length that face into the pocket.  The dryer hoods are usually exhausted with a series of roof mounted hood exhausts fans down the dryer section.

=== Sizer ===
Additional [[sizing]] agents, including [[resin]]s, [[glue]], or [[starch]], can be added to the web to alter its characteristics. [[Sizing]] improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength.  These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a ''size press''. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator .   It is usually placed before the last dryer section.  Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a [[coated paper|coating]] of [[fillers]] such as [[calcium carbonate]] or [[china clay]] usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and [[styrene-butadiene]] latex.  Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W1015-015, Technitz, Schreibpapier AROS aus Altrohstoffen.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Paper leaving the machine is rolled onto a ''reel'' for further processing.]]

=== Calender section ===
{{Main|Calender}}
&lt;!-- Note: This is the correct spelling of 'calender' as used in this sense. --&gt;
A [[calender]] consists of two or more rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. It also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper.

=== Reel section ===

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). The paper is wound onto metal spools using a large cylinder called a ''reel drum''. Constant nip pressure is maintained between the reel drum and the spool, allowing the resulting friction to spin the spool. Paper runs over the top of the reel drum and is wound onto the spool to create a ''master roll''.

To be able to keep the paper machine running continuously, the reel must be able to quickly switch from winding a finished roll to an empty spool without stopping the flow of paper. To accomplish this, each reel section will have two or more spools rotating through the process. Using an overhead crane, empty spools will be loaded onto two ''primary arms'' above the reel drum. When the master roll reaches its maximum diameter, the arms will lower the new spool into contact with the reel drum and a machine behind the drum will run a tape along the moving sheet of paper, swiftly tearing it and attaching incoming paper onto the new spool. The spool is then lowered onto the ''secondary arms'', which steadily guide the spool away from the reel drum as the diameter of paper on the spool increases.
 
The [[Roll hardness tester|roll hardness]] should be checked, obtained and adjusted accordingly to insure that the roll hardness is within the acceptable range for the product.


===Winder section===
Reels of paper wound up at the end of the drying process are the full trimmed width, minus shrinkage from drying, of the web leaving the wire.  In the winder section reels of paper are slit into smaller rolls of a width and roll diameter range specified by a customer order. To accomplish this the reel is placed on an unwind stand and the distances between the slitters (sharp cutting wheels), are adjusted to the specified widths for the orders.  The wider is run until the desired roll diameter is reached and the rolls are labeled according to size and order before being sent to shipping or the warehouse.  A reel usually has sufficient diameter to make two or more sets of rolls.

== Glossary ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

'''broke''': waste paper, either made during a sheet break or trimmings.  It is gathered up and put in a repulper for recycling back into the process.

'''consistency''': the percent dry fibre in a pulp slurry.

'''couch''': French meaning ''to lie down''.  Following the couch roll the sheet is lifted off the wire and transferred into the press section.

'''dandy roll''': a mesh covered hollow roll that rides on top of the Fourdrinier. It breaks up fibre clumps to improve the sheet formation and can also be used to make an imprint, as with [[laid paper]]. See also [[watermark]].

'''fan pump''': the large pump that circulates white water from the white water chest to the headbox.  The pump is a special low pulse design that minimizes the effect of vane pulses which would cause uneven basis weight of paper in the machine direction known as ''barring''. The flow from the fan pump may go through screens and cleaners, if used.  On large paper machines fan pumps may be rated in tens of thousands of gallons per minute.

'''felt''': a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water.  Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.

'''[[filler (materials)|filler]]''': a finely divided substance added to paper in the forming process.  Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity.  The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity.  Use of calcium carbonate filler is the process called ''alkaline sizing'' and uses different chemistry than acid sizing.  Alkaline sized paper has superior ageing properties.

'''formation''': the degree of uniformity of fiber distribution in finished paper, which is easily seen by holding paper up to the light.

'''[[headbox]]''': the pressure chamber where turbulence is applied to break up fibre clumps in the slurry.  The main job of the headbox is to distribute the fiber slurry uniformly across the wire.

'''nip''': the contact area where two opposing rolls meet, such as in a press or calender.

'''[[pH]]''': the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Alkaline paper has a very long life.  Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.

'''[[sizing|size]]''': a chemical (formerly rosin derived but now a different chemical) or starch, applied to paper to retard the rate of water penetration.  Sizing prevents ''bleeding'' of ink during printing, improving the sharpness of printing.

'''slice''': the adjustable rectangular orifice, usually at the bottom of the headbox, through which the whitewater jet discharges onto the wire.  The slice opening and water pressure together determine the amount and velocity of whitewater flow through the slice.  The slice usually has some form of adjustment mechanism to even out the paper weight profile across the machine (CD profile), although a newer methods is to inject water into the whitewater across the headbox slice area, thereby using localized consistency to control CD weight profile.

'''stock''': a pulp slurry that has been processed in the stock preparation area with necessary additives, refining and pH adjustment and ready for making paper

'''web''': the continuous flow of un-dried fibre from the couch roll down the paper machine

'''white water''': filtrate from the drainage table.  The white water from the table is usually stored in a white water chest from which it is pumped by the fan pump to the headbox.

'''wire''': the woven mesh fabric loop that is used for draining the pulp slurry from the headbox. Until the 1970s bronze wires were used but now they are woven from coarse mono-filament synthetics similar to fishing line but very stiff.

==Materials ==

Stainless steels are used extensively in the [[Pulp and paper industry|Pulp and Paper]] industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/TechnicalLibrary/Reference%20Book%20Series/11025_StainlessSteelsandSpecialtyAlloysforModernPulpandPaperMills.aspx|title=Stainless Steels and Specialty Alloys for Modern Pulp and Paper Mills|last=A. H. Tuthill|first=|date=2002|website=Nickel Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two primary reasons, to avoid iron contamination of the product and their corrosion resistance to the various chemicals used in the paper making process. Type 316 stainless steel is a common material used in paper machines.

== Early Life &amp; Career ==

Davidsson grew up in [[Sandviken]], a small, one-employer steel town in Sweden. He received his BA in Business Administration in 1984, his MSc. in 1987 and his PhD in Economic Psychology in 1989 at [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. In 1990 he moved to [[Umeå University]], where he got involved in an international-collaborative project with the entrepreneurship academics David Storey and Paul Reynolds, which ignited his international career. In 1994, he moved to take part in the start-up of [[Jönköping International Business School]] (JIBS) to start a high-class business school with an entrepreneurship focus. During this time, Davidsson helped in the creation of a research environment within JIBS; it was recently identified as second in the world in entrepreneurship and first in Scandinavia in business research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparing research at Nordic higher education institutions using bibliometric indicators: Covering the years 1999-2014 — NordForsk|url=https://www.nordforsk.org/en/publications/publications_container/comparing-research-at-nordic-higher-education-institutions-using-bibliometric-indicators-covering-the-years-1999-2014|website=www.nordforsk.org|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Nianhang|last2=Chen|first2=Yining|last3=Fung|first3=Anna|last4=Chan|first4=Kam|title=Contributing Forces in Entrepreneurship Research: A Global Citation Analysis: JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320043482_Contributing_Forces_in_Entrepreneurship_Research_A_Global_Citation_Analysis_JOURNAL_OF_SMALL_BUSINESS_MANAGEMENT|website=Journal of Small Business Management|doi=10.1111/jsbm.12367|date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Davidsson has served as professor in many universities in Sweden and Australia and held membership as editor and reviewer in high-profile scientific journals. In 1992 he became Director of the Transportation Research Unit at Umeå University and at JIBS he served as Head of the Entrepreneurship, Marketing and Management Department and led the PEG (Program on Entrepreneurship and SMEs) research program. 
Through his publications and research, Davidsson is known for his interest on start-up and growth of small firms. He has published over 70 peer reviewed articles, such as [[Strategic Management Journal]], [[Regional Studies]], [[Journal of Management Studies]], [[Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|Entrepreneurship Theory &amp; Practice]], Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, and Journal of Business Venturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davidsson|first1=Per|title=Author details|url=https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7006888337|website=Scopus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pocket Planes''''' is a business [[simulation video game]] developed by [[NimbleBit]] for [[iOS]]. It was initially released on June 14, 2012. In October 2012, the game became available on the [[Mac App Store]]. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version, [[porting|ported]] and published by [[Mobage]], was released on September 22, 2012. The game was removed on September 24, 2015 from the [[Google Play|Google Play Store]] but is still available on [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]]. The app has also been removed from the U.K. [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] but is still available on the U.S App Store.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pocket Planes Gameplay Screenshot.jpg|thumb|A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|alt=A screenshot depicting a plane that has landed at an airport.|275x275px]]
In ''Pocket Planes'', players assume the role of an [[airline]] CEO. Starting with a few airports and small planes, players transport small amounts of [[cargo]] and [[passenger]]s short distances. As they slowly gain profit from their flights, they then build more airports, buy better planes, and expand their airline internationally.&lt;ref name=wiredrigneynofly&gt;{{cite web|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Review: Pocket Planes‘ Airy Gameplay Doesn’t Fly|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/06/review-pocket-planes-airy-gameplay-doesnt-fly/|work=Wired: Game{{!}}Life|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula determines how much profit will be earned from a flight, depending on the distance, speed and the weight of the plane used on the route. Filling a plane with items or people going to the same destination will net a 25% bonus on each item. Players can also complete events that involve flying special items and people to a designated destination. After completing these events, players are awarded Bux, which are used to buy planes and purchase other perks such as upgrades and the ability to speed up flights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Shutdown for Android==
On September 24, 2015, the company that ported the game to Android, [[Mobage]], shut down their game servers for Pocket Planes and other NimbleBit games including [[Pocket Frogs]] and [[Tiny Tower]], and subsequently removed these downloads from the [[Google Play Store]]. There are no plans to bring it back, and the data from the Android game cannot be transferred to the iOS version. NimbleBit has announced that future sequels or a major update may see a re-release for the game to Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|title=Android Version Shutdown|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center|date=4 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505103256/http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2103500-android-version-shutdown|archive-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.nimblebit.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2215443-where-did-pocket-planes-for-android-go-|title=Where Did Pocket Planes for Android Go?|publisher=NimbleBit Support Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was viewed favourably by reviewers. It holds a 78/100 score on the aggregate [[Metacritic]], categorising it as "Generally favorable reviews" based on 17 reviewers.&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Gamezebo.com rated it 4.5 stars out of 5, stating "Nimblebit has once again dropped you in the middle of a universe that feels like it was built just for you, and filled it with a deeper, more compelling mission".&lt;ref name="GameZebo"/&gt;

However, Ryan Rigney of [[Wired (website)|''Wired'']] wrote that the player's success did not correlate with skill, and criticises it for a lack of compelling gameplay.&lt;ref name=wiredrigneynofly/&gt;

[[Image:The Artist's Son.jpg|thumb|180px|RA Bevan painted by his father Robert Polhill Bevan in about 1918]]
'''Robert Alexander Polhill "R. A." Bevan''' (“Bobby”) [[CBE]] (15 March 1901 – 20 December 1974) was a significant figure in British [[communications]] and [[advertising]] during the mid-20th century. He was the second child of the artists [[Robert Polhill Bevan]] and [[Stanisława de Karłowska]] and was born at the Bevan house, Horsgate, in [[Cuckfield]], [[Sussex]].

==Education==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bobby 1920.jpg|thumb|180px|RA Bevan photographed at Oxford in 1920]] --&gt;
Bevan was educated at [[Hall School (Hampstead)|The Hall School]] before entering [[Westminster School]] as a [[King's Scholarship|King’s Scholar]] in 1913 at the early age of 12.&lt;ref&gt;Typescript obituary written by his fellow [[King's Scholarship|King’s Scholar]] and brother-in-law C.W. Baty.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and read [[Greats]] obtaining seconds in Mods and in Finals.

==Advertising==
In 1923 he entered the advertising company of [[S.H. Benson]] and became, what former colleague R.D. Bloomfield described as, "the personification of the greatest days of English advertising".&lt;ref&gt;Times obituary 7 January 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in his time at Bensons that some of the best known advertising campaigns of the 1920s and 1930s were produced. The products advertised included [[Guinness]], [[Bovril]], [[Johnnie Walker]] and Colman’s [[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] (The Mustard Club). Bevan was behind most of them,&lt;ref&gt;(ibid.)&lt;/ref&gt; and he was still handling the Guinness account in the 1950s when he commissioned [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]] to provide colour illustrations to ''Happy New Lear'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stenlake. [[Robert Bevan]]: from [[Gauguin]] to [[Camden Town]]. Unicorn Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was behind slogans such as "Guinness is Good for You" and was the inspiration for Mr Ingleby in [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' 1933 thriller [[Murder Must Advertise]].&lt;ref&gt;Obituary on Natalie Bevan. The Independent. 29 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobby Bevan was a member of London’s 1930s literary set. A particular friend was the novelist [[Anthony Powell]]; who presented Bobby with copies of his first four novels, each fully dedicated with “arch and somewhat randy inscriptions”. Powell's gift of his first novel, ''Afternoon Men'', bore the inscription "For Bobby, who covers the waterfront, though his eyes are not always watching the sea. Tony."  &lt;ref&gt;John Yeates. NW1. The Camden Town Artists. 2007: 182. For example inscribed on the front endpaper of [[Venusberg (novel)|''Venusberg'' (novel)]] was: "For Bobbie with the author's warm regard, and in the hope that the new year will prove a good one, from Tony Powell, 31 Dec. 1932. 'I love little pussy, her coat is so warm.'"&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Sailing and Wartime==
He was a passionate sailor and member of the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]]. In 1937 he and a friend, Harold Paton, commissioned a yacht ''[[Phryne|Phryna]]'', which was built by J.Samuel White in [[Cowes]] and designed by B. Heckstall-Smith and Wm.McMeek. They had a very successful couple of years racing before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].

For a short period Bevan was director of General Production at the Ministry of Information. However, having joined the [[RNVR]] in 1937 he was soon on active service. After a spell on HMS ''Ellington'' he was posted as a liaison officer to the [[French Navy]]. 

Following the fall of [[France]] Bevan prevented the scuttling of the ''Commandant Dominé'' and forced the captain to join the [[Free French]] at gunpoint. He was appointed [[OBE]] for this act in March 1941.&lt;ref name="Yeates 2007, 183"&gt;(Yeates 2007, 183).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, as a [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[RNVR]], Bevan was working as the Deputy Chief of Naval Information, in [[Washington, D.C.]] This was a post that not only exercised all his skills at communication, but gave him access to many of the top players in American advertising, which was to prove useful in his later career.&lt;ref&gt;(ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Bobby Bevan had a difficult relationship with his father,&lt;ref&gt;(Stenlake 2008, 135 quoting letter in Tate Gallery Archive 9210/1/1).&lt;/ref&gt; which might explain why there is only one known portrait of the son by [[Robert Bevan]],&lt;ref&gt;(ibid. 154). See above.&lt;/ref&gt; yet numerous portraits of his daughter, Halszka, survive. He also appears to have had problems in his relationship with women.&lt;ref name="Yeates 2007, 183"/&gt; He did marry on his return from the war, his bride being a vivacious divorcee – [[Natalie Bevan|Natalie Sieveking (née Ackenhausen)]]. However, within a year he found himself in a well publicised ''ménage à trois'' involving his wife and [[Randolph Churchill]]. This was to continue until the latter's death in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Leslie. Cousin Randolph–Life of [[Randolph Churchill]]. 1985. See also [[Jonathan Aitken]]. Heroes and Contemporaries. 2006. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bevans lived at [[Boxted, Essex|Boxted]] House on the [[Essex]]/[[Suffolk]] border and had a flat in [[Knightsbridge]], [[London]]. They entertained greatly and Boxted soon became a gathering place for artists, writers and gardeners. Weekend parties might consist of [[Maggi Hambling]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[A.P. Herbert]], [[Ronald Blythe]], [[Beth Chatto]] and [[Earl of Cranbrook|John Gathorne-Hardy]]. Other friends included the artists John Armstrong and [[Frederick Gore]], and others more closely associated with [[East Anglia]], such as [[Cedric Morris]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]] and the architect [[Raymond Erith]] The composer [[Benjamin Britten]] and the tenor [[Peter Pears]] might be there as would the art dealer [[Anthony d'Offay]], who once brought down the artists [[Gilbert and George]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Strang. “Bobby and Natalie Bevan and the Art at Boxted House” in From Sickert to Gertler: Modern British Art from Boxted House. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career and Public Works==
The Bevans had very close links with the Minories art gallery, in [[Colchester]], which opened in 1958 and Bobby served as chairman of its management committee, The Victor Batte-Lay Trust from 1963 until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;(ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s Bobby held a number of official appointments. He was:
* 1958: nominated as the UK representative on UN Committee on Public Information;
* 1958: member of the Advisory Council on Middle East Trade;
* 1958-1963; Export Publicity Council;
* 1959-1963; National Advisory Council on Art Education;
* 1960-1964; [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]];
* 1962-1966. [[Institute of Practitioners in Advertising]] (President in 1961)

He was also a founder member of the [[Board of Governors]] of the [[Cutty Sark]]&lt;ref&gt;(Stenlake 2008, 203).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unithistories.com/officers/RNVR_officersB.html RNVR Officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1954-64 he was Chairman of SH Benson Ltd, being appointed [[CBE]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1963.

Bobby Bevan was something of a mentor to the [[New York City|New York]]-based advertising executive [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] who frequently stayed at [[Boxted, Essex|Boxted]] during his trips to England. In 1948 Bevan had established Ogilvy as head of a new advertising agency in New York. This was to become Ogilvy, Benson and Mather. In 1964 it merged with David’s brother Francis’s agency to become [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather|Ogilvy and Mather]] International Inc.&lt;ref&gt;(Strang 2008, 22).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogilvy once said of Bevan "I was in awe of him but Bevan never took notice of me!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/business/1999/jul/26ogilvy.htm - Former Ogilvy and Mather (India) CEO Mani Ayer in a salute to [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]].]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mani Ayer, former CEO of Ogilvy &amp; Mather (India) said of him:

“Bevan was not a man who would share his experience or knowledge with you. He was an intellectual and came from a well-known family of painters and he preferred to live like an aristocrat.”&lt;ref&gt;(ibid.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this should be read in conjunction with that of the artist, [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], who had known him since 1913: 'Robert Bevan was a significant figure to us both and was, therefore, a bond between us. This was Bobby’s “cosy side” – he could be moody and at times rather formidable but beneath this one sensed always his intense loyalty to his real friends mixed with an affection that his undemonstrative nature hardly allowed him to disclose. I like to think I partook of these latter qualities. He was a very private person, talking little about his personal deeds even less about his personal thoughts and worries. His sympathy to those in distress, was almost feminine in its understanding.'&lt;ref&gt;Yeates 2007, 186. Quoting [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]]’s thoughts from the catalogue to the 1975 exhibition at The Minories, [[Colchester]]. The R.A Bevan Collection from [[Boxted, Essex|Boxted]] House.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bevan Collection==
When Bevan’s mother died in 1952 she left Bobby and his sister Halszka (Mrs Charles Baty) an equal share in a large collection of family paintings and many works by their parents, as well as their [[Camden Town Group]] friends and other associates, including [[Walter Sickert]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Henri Gaudier-Brzeska]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanisława Bevan: Will dated 3 October 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobby and his sister made a substantial gift of their father's work to the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in 1957 and for the remainder of his life he applied all his business experience to the promotion of [[Robert Bevan|Robert]] and [[Stanisława de Karłowska|Stanisława]] Bevan. A series of exhibitions were held throughout the 1960s. In 1965 Bobby produced a short book on his father, which until recently was the only work available.&lt;ref&gt;In recent years two works have been published on [[Robert Bevan]]: 1) John Yeates. NW1. The [[Camden Town]] Artists. 2007 ; and 2) Frances Stenlake. [[Robert Bevan]]: from [[Gauguin]] to [[Camden Town]]. Unicorn Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of stomach [[cancer]] on 20 December 1974. Although he had no children of his own his widow retained the complete collection of artworks.&lt;ref&gt;To mark this the [[Patrick Baty|Baty]] family petitioned the [[College of Arms]] for the grant of an [[heraldic badge]] consisting of a [[griffin]] and [[millstone]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rye Barcott''' (born 1979) is a social entrepreneur and the author of the memoir ''It Happened on the Way to War''.  He previously co-founded [[Carolina for Kibera]] and Double Time Capital.  He was a human intelligence officer in the [[United States Marine Corps]], achieving the rank of captain.  Currently, he is the CEO of [[With Honor]], a new movement led by veterans focused on building a cross-partisan coalition of next-generation veterans in the [[United States Congress]] in order to help fix our America's broken, hyper-polarized politics.

==Background and early life==
Barcott was born in Rhode Island. His father attended [[Miami University]] on an [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] scholarship and went on to serve in the Marines' [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. His father left the Marines as a captain after receiving a [[Bronze Star Medal]] and a [[Purple Heart]] in combat. His parents met as graduate students at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Barcott's mother is a nurse and anthropologist who teaches at the [[University of Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uri.edu/nursing/meet/donna-schwartz-barcott-ph-d-r-n/ |title=Professor Donna Schwartz-Barcott URI profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcott initially applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]] but was turned down. As a result, he instead applied for an NROTC scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

==Education==
Barcott attended [[East Greenwich High School]]. He graduated in 2001 from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he studied economics and anthropology.  He attended [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] on a four-year [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[NROTC]] Scholarship.  In 2009, Barcott graduated with an MPA and MBA from [[Harvard University]] as a Center for Public Leadership Social Entrepreneurship Fellow and George Leadership Fellow.  [[Harvard University]] President [[Drew Faust]] appointed him to a two-year term on the [[Harvard]] Endowment's Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, and he served as a founding member of the movement to create an [[MBA Oath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mbaoath.org/about/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are - The MBA Oath|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a member of the [[Harvard University]] Alumni Association Board of Directors in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAA Board of Directors|url=https://alumni.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/page/HAA%20Board%20for%20web_121417.pdf|website=alumni.harvard.edu|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;_

==Military service==
Barcott served five years on active duty in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], where he attained the rank of captain and deployed to [[Bosnia]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/rye-barcott-it-happened-way-war/ Barcott on ''It Happened on the Way to War'' at the Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he provided written testimony to the [[Iraq Study Group]] and authored an article about the Iraqi Military Intelligence Academy in [[Proceedings (magazine)|Proceedings]], the professional journal of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barcott|first1=Rye|title="No Torture"-It's a Start|url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2007-07/no-torture—-its-start|website=usni.org|publisher=Proceedings Magazine|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ABC World News with Charles Gibson]] covered his work in Kibera and his military service in Iraq and named him a Person of the Week and a 2006 Person of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/PersonOfWeek/story?id=2611995&amp;page=1|title=American in Iraq Fights Two Wars at Once|date=4 May 2007|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ABC World News story quoted him encouraging young Americans to expose themselves "to how the majority of the world lives … and I think it'll make you a lot more appreciative of what you've got … make you a better American and a better global citizen."

The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] awarded Barcott with the [[Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal]]. The President of the United States appointed him to the [[J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board]] as a representative of the veteran community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/02/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts|website=ObamaWhiteHouseArchives.gov|publisher=The White House, Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social enterprise and career==
===Carolina for Kibera===
While an undergraduate at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] in 2001, Barcott founded [[Carolina for Kibera]] (CFK) in Kenya with Salim Mohamed and Tabitha Atieno Festo. CFK started as a small inter-ethnic soccer program and medical clinic run out of Festo's ten-by-ten foot shack. Today it is a major affiliated entity of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. More than 5,000 youth participate in its holistic youth programs, and the Tabitha Clinic treats more than 20,000 patients a year in collaboration with the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/blog/entry/cdc-carolina-for-kibera-tabitha-health-clinic/ Center For Strategic and International Studies, The Commission on Smart Global Health Policy, August 10, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double Time Capital===
Barcott co-founded Double Time Capital in 2013 as an impact investment firm focused on clean energy and sustainability. As of February 2017, "Double Time has financed 36 solar energy projects, which collectively produce roughly 10% of North Carolina's solar power and power around 30,000 homes in the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quittner|first1=Jeremy|title=These Marines Beat the Odds to Build a Solar Energy Fund|url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/22/marines-solar-energy-fund/|website=Fortune.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, North Carolina was the second ranked state in the United States based on the cumulative amount of solar electric capacity installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Carolina Solar|url=https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/north-carolina-solar|website=SEIA.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With Honor===
Barcott co-founded With Honor in 2017 with [[David Gergen]] and other veterans. [[With Honor]] is a cross-partisan movement led by veterans focused on increasing the number of next-generation veterans in Congress in order to advocate for changes in America's politics. With Honor's advisory board includes post-9/11 veterans, Gold Star family members, and other prominent American public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With Honor Advisors|url=https://www.withhonor.org/about-us/our-advisors|website=WithHonor.org|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This is an article about a 19th century British report. It should not be confused with the [[Sadler Commission]], an investigation into Indian University education at the end of the First World War.''

The '''Sadler Report''' – more correctly the '''Report of the Select Committee on Factory Children's Labour''' (Parliamentary Papers 1831-32, volume XV): usually referred to at the time as ''”the report of Mr Sadler’s Committee,”''{{efn| the standard phrase used by the ''Evening Standard'' in editorials from the start of January 1833&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Standard -Wednesday evening Jan. 9|work=Evening Standard|date=9 January 1833|location=London|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; onward; a search in the British Newspaper Archive shows instances can be found in other papers eg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Ten Hours' Bill: Public Meeting in Bolton in Support of the Bill|work=The Guardian and Public Ledger|date=12 April 1833|location=London|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Henry Parnell|work=Caledonian Mercury|date=15 April 1833|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English Slavery|work=Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle|date=23 June 1833|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are no hits for the phrase 'Sadler report'&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|reason=A primary source using these names are needed|date=October 2017}} --&gt;}} - was a [[report]] written in 1832 by [[Michael Thomas Sadler|Michael Sadler]]., the chairman of a UK Parliamentary committee considering a Bill introduced by Sadler seeking to limit the hours of work of children in textile mills and factories. In committee hearings carried between the passage of the 1832 Reform Act through the Commons and Parliament’s subsequent dissolution Sadler had elicited testimony from factory workers (current and former), concerned medical men and other bystanders on bad working conditions and excessive working hours to which children were subjected, highlighting the risks to tired children and the brutality to which they might be subjected. Time (and Sadler) prevented balancing or contrary evidence being called before Parliament was dissolved. 

The committee report was published early in 1833: a mid-20th century historian describes it as "a mass of evidence, constituting a most formidable indictment of factory conditions ...It is impossible not to be staggered by the revelations of human misery and degradation - impossible not to be moved by the dreadful stories of children and young persons (and adults, too, for that matter) who were bullied and cursed and tormented, pushed around and knocked about by those placed in authority over them."&lt;ref name="Royston Pike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Royston Pike|first1=E|title=Human Documents of the Industrial Revolution in Britain|date=1966|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}  There was a widespread public outcry at the conditions depicted by the testimony heard. Parliament, however, declined to legislate on the basis of the report: even Sadler’s parliamentary friends, such as Lord Morpeth, conceded that the proceedings of the Committee were irregular and its choice of witnesses unbalanced. Instead, it voted for a fresh inquiry by means of a Factory Commission, visiting the principal manufacturing districts and taking evidence on oath (unlike the Select Committee).

The report of the Commission did not set out to directly refute testimony presented by Sadler, but reached conclusions at variance with Sadler's report on many points. It concluded however that children were working excessively long hours and Government intervention to regulate child labour in textile trades was therefore called for - this required both new restrictions on hours of work and a new and effective organisation for enforcing them. The consequent Factory Act of 1833 and its establishment of the UK Factory Inspectorate is often taken to mark the start of modern/effective factory legislation in the UK. The report of Sadler’s Committee therefore led to an important advance in factory legislation, but did so indirectly.

==History==

On March 16, 1832, Sadler proposed the Second Reading of a Bill to limit to ten hours the workday for persons under the age of 18 working in the textile industry. The bill also involved a ban on labour for children 9 years old and younger, an eight-hour day on Saturday and a ban on night working for children under the age of 21.{{sfnp|Hutchins|Harrison|1911|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;full text is given by {{cite news|title=Mr Sadlers Bill - to regulate the Labour of Children and Young Persons in the Factories and Mills of the United Kingdom|work=Leeds Intelligencer|date=26 January 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sadler had asserted at earlier stages that the need for such legislation was so urgent and so obvious that there was no need for a Select Committee to gather evidence relating to the Bill, at Second Reading he accepted that the Bill should be considered by such a committee. One was duly formed, with Sadler as the chairman; the committee also included [[John Cam Hobhouse]], [[Thomas Fowell Buxton]], [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|Lord Morpeth]], [[Sir Robert Peel]], [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], and [[Charles Poulett Thomson]].&lt;ref name="Sadler DNB"&gt;entry for ''Michael Thomas Sadler (1780-1835'') in {{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=Sir Lesley|last2=Lee|first2=Sir Sidney|title=Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to 1900|date=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/people/sadlerbg.htm|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A full list of members is given on page 381 of {{cite book|last1=Seeley|first1=R.B.|title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Michael Thomas Sadler, Esq.

Burnside|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirslifeandw00seelgoog|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It held its first sitting on 12 April 1832, and took evidence from eighty-nine witnesses in the course of forty-three meetings.&lt;ref name="Sadler DNB"/&gt; About half the witnesses were workers (some of whom, Sadler told the House of Commons, had lost their jobs because they had given evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Minutes|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=30 July 1832|volume=14|issue=c 928|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1832/jul/30/minutes|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sadler attempted (31 July 1832) to progress his Bill without waiting for the committee's report; when this was objected to, he withdrew the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Factories Bill|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=31 July 1832|volume=14|issue=cc965-6|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1832/jul/31/factories-bill|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee reported the minutes of evidence on 8 August 1832, when they were ordered to be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friday's Express|work=Stamford Mercury|date=10 August 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament was dissolved little over a week later, and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|election that followed]], Sadler stood at [[Leeds]] but failed to be elected. Early in 1833 the contents of the committee's report began to appear in local and national papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=London Standard|date=4 January 1833}} gives priority to the ''Morning Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Report==
One early history of factory legislation described the testimony presented in Sadler's report as "one of the most valuable collections of evidence on industrial conditions that we possess."{{sfnp|Hutchins|Harrison|1911|p=}} and excerpts from the testimony are given in many source books on the Industrial Revolution and factory reform and on multiple websites, together with commentary drawing the intended conclusions.

However, critics such as [[William Harold Hutt]]&lt;ref&gt;http://mises.org/daily/2443#_ftnref13&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed to - and revived - contemporary criticism of the report. Even Sadler’s parliamentary friends, such as Lord Morpeth, conceded that the proceedings of the Committee were irregular and its choice of witnesses unbalanced. Evidence given to the committee was not given on oath, and it remains unclear (and controversial) to what extent the evidence heard from former mill-children and the parents of mill children was true, and if true to what extent typical. Whilst these caveats cannot be ignored "Critics have alleged that some of the evidence was biased, incomplete, sometimes inaccurate or even deliberately misleading, and it is true that a good deal of it referred to conditions that had long been ameliorated...When every allowance has been made for exaggerations and omissions and the rest, the 'report' stands as one of the classic documents of British social history".&lt;ref name="Royston Pike" /&gt;

It painted a picture of over-work, physical severity, misery and fear as the lot of a mill-child in an unregulated mill. To give one example of the evidence to that effect, and the questioning that elicited it: Matthew Crabtree, now twenty-two and a blanket manufacturer, had been a factory child between the ages of eight and twelve.  He had worked from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. with an hour for a meal at noon (there was no breakfast break); when trade was brisk work had started an hour earlier and finished an hour later. He had lived about 2 miles from the mill:

! Question !! Answer
|-
| During those long hours of labour could you be punctual; how did you awake? || ''I seldom did awake spontaneously; I was most generally awoke or lifted out of bed, sometimes asleep, by my parents''
|-
| Were you always in time? || ''No''
|-
| What was the consequence if you had been too late? || ''I was most commonly beaten''
|-
| Severely?  || ''Very severely, I thought''
|-
| In those mills is chastisement towards the latter part of the day going on perpetually?  || ''Perpetually''
|-
| So that you can hardly be in a mill without hearing constant crying? || ''Never an hour, I believe''
|-
| Do you think that if the overlooker were naturally a humane person it would still be found necessary for him to beat the children, in order to keep up their attention and vigilance at the termination of those extraordinary days of labour? || ''Yes; the machine turns off a regular quantity of cardings, and of course, they must keep as regularly to their work the whole of the day; they must keep with the machine, and therefore however humane the slubber may be, as he must keep up with the machine or be found fault with, he spurs the children to keep up also by various means but that which he commonly resorts to is to strap them when they become drowsy''
|-
| At the time when you were beaten for not keeping up with your work, were you anxious to have done it if you possibly could? || ''Yes; the dread of being beaten if we could not keep up with our work was a sufficient impulse to keep us to it if we could''
|-
| When you got home at night after this labour, did you feel much fatigued?  || ''Very much so''
|-
| Had you any time to be with your parents, and to receive instruction from them?  || ''No.''
|-
| What did you do?  || ''All that we did when we got home was to get the little bit of supper that was provided for us and go to bed immediately. If the supper had not been ready directly, we should have gone to sleep while it was preparing; which took its toll the morning after.''
|-
| Did you not, as a child, feel it a very grievous hardship to be roused so soon in the morning?  || ''I did.''
|-
| Were the rest of the children similarly circumstanced?  || ''Yes, all of them; but they were not all of them so far from their work as I was.''
|-
| And if you had been too late you were under the apprehension of being cruelly beaten?  || ''I generally was beaten when I happened to be too late; and when I got up in the morning the apprehension of that was so great, that I used to run, and cry all the way as I went to the mill.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111sad.html Sadler Report Interviews: Excerpt of the Original Text: Five of The 89 Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua Drake, a Leeds woollen-weaver gave evidence of bad conditions encountered by his children at various mills, but his evidence gives a glimpse of a less objectionable mill. He had sent his first child, a girl, to work as a piecener{{efn| Not a misprint; the standard term in Yorkshire for what elsewhere was called a 'piecer': 'a young person employed in a spinning-mill to keep the frame filled with rovings, and to join together the ends of threads which break; formerly also to join the cardings of slivers for the slubber, a work now done by machinery' ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (3rd edn)}} in a factory owned by [[Benjamin Gott]] when she was nearly eight. Once trained to the job, she was paid 3s a week {{efn| It isn't entirely clear in what year Mr Drake's eldest daughter was eight but a Joshua Drake clothier married Mercy Atkinson spinster in Leeds parish church 1813, the first registered baptism to a Joshua-Mercy Drake couple in Leeds is Mary Drake 1814. ''If'' this Mary was the eldest daughter of the Joshua Drake who gave evidence, conditions and wages are those of the early 1820s. In 1830 a Manchester mill owner MP reported wages in Manchester cotton mills: "In spinning, the wages were paid according to the weight of the yarn, and one statement he had received said that the average wages of spinners was from 26s. to 30s., while another represented it as from 20s. to 32s. The women engaged in the mills made from 16s. to 18s.; little piecers, boys and girls received from 6s. to 9s., while children under ten years of age earned 2s. 6d. per week. The over-lookers got from 20s. to 40s., but the fine spinners got more—from 35s. to 40s."&lt;ref name = "Philips"&gt;{{cite journal|title=DISTRESS OF THE COUNTRY—ADJOURNED DEBATE.|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=18 March 1830|volume=23|issue=cc548-613|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1830/mar/18/distress-of-the-country-adjourned-debate#S2V0023P0_18300318_HOC_45|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male hand loom weavers in Manchester were earning 6s. to 7s. a week;&lt;ref name = "Philips" /&gt; this was recognised to be desperately low and it was a standard comment by observers how destructive it was of family life when the family finances depended upon the children's earnings, rather than the father's. Mr Drake's evidence to the committee that three shillings a week did not fully cover the costs of his daughter is somewhat at variance with that analysis. In 1832 there were 3,000 families in Leeds for which the income per head was under ''two'' shillings per week&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Leeds Mercury|date=14 January 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} and worked from 6 am to 7 pm.&lt;ref name=MP18330110 /&gt;

One other point about Gott's emerged during questioning about other mills: "[I]n some mills it is very unbecoming with reference to morals; in others there is a moderate attention paid in that respect. In Mr. Gotts and Mr Sheepshanks’s, and any of those established concerns, there are regular rules that no bad language is to be used; but in other mills they go on as they think proper, and as they are uncontrolled with regard to those things, their state varies according to the disposition of the occupier of the mills to look after them."&lt;ref name=MP18330110&gt;{{cite news|title=Factories Labour Regulation Bill|work=Morning Post|date=10 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The report of the committee was greeted with acclaim by the ten-hour movement, "At last the London Press is fairly aroused to the atrocities of this infernal system, which is at once the curse and scandal of the land. This desirable event has been brought about by the publication of the horrible evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons. GOD be thanked then we have not laboured and suffered in vain. THE MONSTER MUST NOW BE DESTROYED"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Factory Bill,|work=Leeds Patriot and Yorkshire Advertiser|date=12 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the public, the mill owners, and MPs all viewed it with alarm for different reasons.

===Public===
The committee report - said one paper – contained "voluminous evidence ... of a nature to make a man almost loathe his species. We can hardly believe that such systematic cruelty is practised in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Morning Chronicle|date=4 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; A party political point soon emerged; why were the Whigs obsessed with ending slavery in the West Indies but blind to the worse slavery of British children in British mills?&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Morning Chronicle|date=5 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper spoke of “evidence, the perusal of the greater part of which is almost enough to make the blood run cold in our veins”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kentish Gazette|date=8 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more sceptical, noting very leading questioning, and suspecting the picture of misery to be too highly coloured, but they still concluded the factory system was little better than slavery, and legislation was urgently needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Factory System|work=Chelmsford Chronicle|issue=18 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millowners===
The ''Preston Chronicle'', published in a town with cotton mills for which legislation on the employment of children already specified a minimum age of nine and a twelve-hour day, criticised the use made of the Report by other publications &lt;blockquote&gt;The extracts made appear to apply exclusively to extreme cases of hardship or oppression, exercised by overlookers to the children employed, and these chiefly in Scotland and Leeds. From these exclusive and ''exparte'' data, however, with more zeal than candour, our contemporaries take upon themselves to denounce the whole body of manufacturers or millowners, as alike obnoxious to the charge of the most flagrant cruelty, in order to gratify their inordinate cupidity. We are far from assuming, that there are not evils connected with our manufacturing system, which it is imperative to remedy; or denying, that in many mills there are practices, particularly as affecting the most helpless of those there employed – the children – which ought to be prevented by the arm of the law:{{efn|Savage beating of children was illegal (unless done by their father, or with his explicit permission). Both Sadler's report and that of the Factory Commission showed that in practice where children were savagely beaten by mill overseers there was usually no effective legal redress, but this aspect went largely unaddressed. It was not directly relevant to minimum age and maximum working hours except that 'chastisement' was felt to be more likely, more frequent and more 'necessary' for younger children working longer hours (and perhaps pre-Victorian England had no expectation that the poor could invoke the law to protect themselves?)}} but we consider it unjust to adduce isolated cases, and on those alone to condemn the whole of the trade. In our own town, we are gratified to testify, no such cruelties and privations are, to our knowledge, practised in any one establishment; and the neat, clean, and wholesome appearance of the numerous young females in particular, (whose constitutions would most likely be readily affected by inordinate labour) warrant the assumption that they are not subjected to the hardships complained of in the cases alluded to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Factory System|work=Preston Chronicle|date=19 January 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In doing so it rehearsed most of the objections that the millowners - particularly those from 'established concerns' who felt themselves to be good employers - were to make to the Report and to any idea of taking it as a basis for further legislation.

===Parliament===
When Parliament reassembled in 1833, a Lancashire MP moved to set up a Special Commission to inquire into the use of child labour in the textile industry, the report of Sadler’s Committee being defective both for content and for due process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;…  the present Parliament was as ill provided with proper information on the subject as before the appointment of a Select Committee. In fact they were much worse off as to information than they were before; because the Committee inquired merely into one branch of the subject, and that branch too, on which there was the least diversity of opinion. The inquiry was so limited also, that the result tended rather to mislead the House than to enlighten it. When the Committee was appointed, it was suggested that all the points connected with the factory system should be taken into consideration; but an influential member of the Committee said, "You had better let me make out my case before other evidence is gone into," and, notwithstanding the opposition of several members of the Committee, in this partial manner were their proceedings conducted. In consequence, witnesses were summoned from the country to appear before the Committee, but the persons to whom the selection of witnesses was intrusted were strictly cautioned not to send up any person on whom they could not rely; that is, as he had good reason to believe, not to send up any persons who would let out anything unfavourable to the views of the Chairman of the Committee. He spoke in the hearing of several Gentlemen who were members of the Committee and who could, consequently, contradict his statement if he were not correct. The witnesses thus called by the Chairman were not less than eighty, and the time occupied in establishing his case satisfactorily was the remainder of the Session. It might be supposed that the examination of these eighty witnesses would have given full evidence with respect to the state of every district of the country—every branch of trade—all the evils, and all the most eligible remedies but no such thing had resulted. Among these witnesses there were twenty-one medical men, but out of them fifteen resided in London, and had had little or no practical experience upon the subject, of which they gave an abstract opinion. There was no information regarding the manufacturers of the West of England—the centre of England, and very little indeed with regard to Scotland. To make up for this, however, there were fifty-one witnesses from Leeds and its neighbourhood. He could produce evidence of the incorrectness and even falsehood of great part of the evidence which had been given&lt;ref&gt;Speech of Mr Wilson Patten - {{cite journal|title=Factories' Commission|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=3 April 1833|volume=17|issue=cc79-115|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1833/apr/03/factories-commission|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nobody disputed his account,{{efn|of which prior warning had been given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Wilson Patten And the Factory Commission|work=Lancaster Gazette|date=27 April 1833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Driver's biography of Richard Oastler&lt;ref name=ToryRad &gt;{{cite book |last=Driver |first=Cecil Herbert |title=Tory Radical: The Life of Richard Oastler |url=https://archive.org/details/toryradicaltheli009087mbp |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=25–35 |year=1946 |oclc=183797}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, apparently of debates on the presentation of petitions in late March 1833, rather than the debate on Wilson Patten's motion for a Commission &lt;blockquote&gt;G. R. Robinson of Worcester, for example, told the House that 'no Committee ever took more pains to arrive at fair and just conclusions and to obtain every requisite information' and Strickland corroborated. The facts brought before the Committee were so strong and unanswerable,' he said, 'that although they might go into a long and extensive investigation on the other side and might prove that some of the master manufacturers were disposed to acts of kindness and humanity, that could never overturn the mass of fearful evidence which had been submitted'&lt;/blockquote&gt; but only the words attributed to Strickland can be verified from the on-line Hansard (they are in a brief exchange on 'Factory Regulations' on 28 February 1833). Both Robinson &amp; Strickland voted against Wilson Patten's motion for a Factory Commission; Robinson also spoke against it, but both his speech as recorded by Hansard and Strickland's speech on 28 February are calls to act without further delay, whatever the imperfections of the recent committee}} and a Commission was set up to examine the issue afresh, the report of Sadler's Committee being agreed to be an unsound basis upon which to draw up legislation.

== Comparison with report of the 1833 Factory Commission ==
The investigations of the 1833 Factory Commission were more extensive and more thorough but its report and associated testimony are less alarming than Sadler's report, and although less open to objection are also less frequently quoted from. As critics have pointed out, few of Sadler’s witnesses were prepared to give evidence to the Commission upon oath, but more than one interpretation of this is possible. The Ten Hour Movement (supporters of Sadler’s bill, through whom most of the worker witnesses had been procured) and Sadler saw no need for further investigation, agitating instead for immediate legislation. During the course of the Factory Commission’s inquiries, relationships between it and the Ten Hour Movement became thoroughly adversarial, the Ten Hour Movement attempting to organise a boycott of the Commission's investigations. Nonetheless the Commission’s report&lt;ref name="Report1833"&gt;(Report of the Commissioners on Conditions in Factories, Parliamentary Papers, 1833, volume XX ), subsequent extracts (and their page numbers - with which Royston Pike does not always agree) are as given in extracts from {{cite book|editor1-last=Young|editor1-first=G M|editor2-last=Hancock|editor2-first=W D|title=English Historical Documents, XII(1), 1833-1874|date=1956|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=934–49|url=http://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/workingconditions/|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on some points supported the thrust if not the detail of testimony given to Sadler’s committee but on other points they diverged.

===Long Hours===
They reported&lt;ref name=Report1833 /&gt;{{rp|35–36}}that mill children did work unduly long hours, leading to 
* Permanent deterioration of the physical constitution: 
* The production of disease often wholly irremediable: and 
* The partial or entire exclusion (by reason of excessive fatigue) from the means of obtaining adequate education and acquiring useful habits, or of profiting by those means when afforded 
and that these ill-effects were so marked and significant that Government intervention was justified. Where Sadler's Bill was for a ten-hour day for all workers under eighteen, the Commission recommended an eight-hour day for those under thirteen, hoping for a two-shift system for them which would allow mills to run 16 hours a day.

===Immorality===
Sadler had alleged that textile mills were hotbeds of sexual immorality and taken evidence supporting this assertion; the Commission however concluded that &lt;blockquote&gt;though the statements and depositions of the different witnesses that have been examined are to a considerable degree conflicting, yet there is no evidence to show that vice and immorality are more prevalent amongst these people, considered as a class, than amongst any other portion of the community in the same station, and with the same limited means of information.&lt;ref name=Report1833 /&gt;{{rp|35–36}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Beating===
Sadler had suggested (in his subsequently much-anthologised examination of Matthew Crabtree - see above) that you could hardly be in a mill without hearing constant weeping and that towards the end of a working day 'chastisement' was going on perpetually. The Commission confirmed that anecdotal evidence abounded of mill-children being beaten,&lt;ref name=Report1833 /&gt;{{rp|22–29}} but went on to put this in a significantly different context from Sadler. It claimed that beating was less widespread than formerly ("By all classes of witnesses it is stated, that "''strapping was more customary in former times than it is now'';" "that ''the usage of the children is very different; they are not now beat'';"  " ''that he has seen boys severely beat when he was a young man, but not for a number of years'';" "that ''he does not use a strap now, though he did formerly''."  . . .") and was nowhere adopted as a deliberate policy by mill-owners. 

A Scottish commissioner reported that "We had, I believe, during our progress no one intimation, even anonymously, to direct our inquiries to any quarter where any habitual ill-usage of children was insinuated to exist at present." whilst "from the statements and depositions obtained under the present inquiry in the several districts in England, and from all classes of witnesses, it appears that in the great majority of cases, corporal punishment is prohibited by the proprietors, while it is proved on oath by several witnesses that operatives and overlookers have been suspended and even dismissed from their employment for disobeying this command. It is impossible to read the evidence from Leeds, Manchester, and the western district without being satisfied that a great improvement has taken place within the last few years in the treatment of children. What ill-treatment still exists is found chiefly in the small and obscure factories, while both in the large and small factories in England it is inflicted by workmen over children whom they themselves hire and pay, and who are completely under their control."

===Context===
The Commission's report went on to counter any unfavourable opinion of millowners readers of Sadler's report might have formed by drawing attention to various instances of the benevolence towards their employees of major millowners such as [[Joseph Strutt (philanthropist)|the Strutts]], to compare working conditions for children with those in other industries (after a visit to the coal mine at [[Worsley]] one of the Commission staff had written "as this was said to be the best mine in the place, I cannot much err in coming to the conclusion, that the hardest labour in the worst-conducted factory is less hard, less cruel,and less demoralizing than the labour in the best of coal-mines"&lt;ref name="Royston Pike" /&gt;{{rp|152}}&lt;ref name=Report1833 /&gt;{{rp|D2, 79–82}}) and to comment adversely on the methods and true motives of the Ten-Hour Movement.

A Manchester physician writing in 1836 thought neither report had got it right: the Commission's report had taken too sanguine a view, and had been driven to do so by the 'extravagances' of the Report of Sadler's Committee: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Factory Commissioners visited the factory districts at a time when the public mind had been filled with the most fearful details of the cruelty and profligacy existing in them; and on finding that many of these details were gross exaggerations and that in some mills an admirable system of physical and moral discipline had been established, they have gone to the opposite side of the question, and consequently are as much in error, on points of opinion, as many of the theoretical witnesses examined before Mr Sadler's Committee.&lt;ref name="Gaskell1836"&gt;{{cite book|author=P Gaskell|title=Artisans and Machinery: The Moral and Physical Condition of the Manufacturing Population Considered with Reference to Mechanical Substitutes for Human Labour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZlDAAAAcAAJ|year=1836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Ten Hour argument moves on ==
Once the 1833 Act was passed, the evidence taken by Sadler of practices in unregulated mills was strictly speaking irrelevant to any further factory legislation.  In 1836, another Ten Hours' Bill was mooted. The ''Blackburn Standard'' - a Conservative paper published in a Lancashire milltown - declared its support (and hence implicitly a view that the Factory Commission recommendations had not gone far enough). However, the Standard did not base its support on Sadler's report and was scathing on about those whose arguments for the new Bill relied heavily on the more lurid evidence in Sadler's report: &lt;blockquote&gt;…However true it may be that the barbarities which it so pathetically and powerfully deplores were practised some years ago in the woollen mills of Yorkshire, they are altogether unknown in the present day in the cotton mills of Lancashire, and the operative classes of society are of course not so degraded and oppressed as insinuated.  We are advocates for the Ten Hours' Bill; but we are no advocates for misrepresentation, however well intentioned. We cannot admit the use of improper means for the attainment of ultimate good. We do not approve of any attempt to insure the objects of the "emancipators" by exciting the prejudices and stimulating the passions of the multitude...  We have visited many of the mills in this vicinity, and have been surprised and delighted with the cleanliness and order which they exhibit, and the comparative ease and cheerfulness with which the children perform their certainly by no means laborious occupation.  Still we are advocates for the Ten Hours' Bill, because we conceive that the atmosphere of a heated factory is not the best calculated for the preservation of health - that the children, mostly females, ought to have some opportunity for breathing the pure air of liberty, for acquiring habits of domestic usefulness, and for receiving religious and moral instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Factory System|work=Blackburn Standard|date=27 April 1836}} - particularly scathing because "An article of which we very much disapprove and which cannot be justified by any person at all acquainted with the internal government of the factories and the moral and social state of the workpeople in this neighbourhood, was inserted in an inner page of our last publication" - in the previous week's issue the national news insert pages supplied from London had contained comment in favour of the Bill along Sadlerian lines - beatings with billy-rollers etc.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4786">The '''Softwarepark Hagenberg''' is the Austrian [[technology park]] for [[software]], located in [[Hagenberg im Mühlkreis]], [[Austria]], founded in 1989 by Professor [[Bruno Buchberger]]. The Softwarepark Hagenberg is a unique collaboration where research, business and education are intensively cooperating.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oesterreich.orf.at/ooe/stories/90872/|title=Der Softwarepark Hagenberg|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF.at]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; Because of its success, the park has been called the "Wunder von Hagenberg" (miracle from Hagenberg).&lt;ref name="wb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/unternehmen/wirtschaftsraum/318535/index.do|title=Weitere 50 Millionen € für das Wunder von Hagenberg|last=Gansrigler|first=Franz|date=19 March 2008|publisher=[[WirtschaftsBlatt]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Buchberger devised the concept for the park in 1989. It was created to balance both economic needs and desire for research and as such, the concept focused one third on economic production, one third on research and one third on academic education in the field of IT and related sciences.&lt;ref name="orf1" /&gt; These three components drive a synergetic "spirale of innovation". Softwarepark has four main partners: The Province of Upper Austria, the [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]], the [http://www.hagenberg.at Community of Hagenberg], and Raiffeisen Landesbank Oberösterreich, a major local bank.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nachrichten1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/reportage/art57,104515|title=Softwarepark will Anzahl der Mitarbeiter verdoppeln|last=Rubasch|first=Ulrike|date=4 February 2009|publisher=nachrichten.at|language=German|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first institute to be established in the park was Buchberger's [[Research Institute for Symbolic Computation]] (RISC) with then 25 students and employees.&lt;ref name="wb1" /&gt;

Today Softwarepark is increasing its international activities, e.g. with [http://www.isi-hagenberg.at/ ISI - International Studies in Informatics Hagenberg] or the recently launched [https://web.archive.org/web/20100620053308/http://www.international-incubator.com/ International Incubator Hagenberg].

Within the twenty years of its existence, 100 million € were invested into developing the park.&lt;ref name="wb2" /&gt;

In '''staggered elections''', not all places in an elected body are up for election at the same time. For example, United States [[Senate of the United States|Senators]] have a six-year term, but they are not all elected at the same time. Rather, elections are held every two years for [[Classes of United States Senators|one-third of Senate seats]].

Staggered elections have the effect of limiting control of a representative body by the body being represented, but can also minimize the impact of [[cumulative voting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[companies]] use staggered elections as a tool to prevent [[takeover]] attempts. Some legislative bodies (most commonly [[upper house]]s) use staggered elections, as do some public bodies, such as the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

==Application in business==
A '''staggered board of directors''' or '''classified board''' is a prominent practice in [[US corporate law]] governing the [[board of directors]] of a [[company]], [[corporation]], or other organization, in which only a fraction (often one third) of the members of the board of directors is elected each time instead of en masse (where all directors have one-year terms).  Each group of directors falls within a specified "class"—e.g., Class I, Class II, etc.—hence the use of the term "classified" board.&lt;ref&gt;See Faleye,O., 2007, Classified Boards, Firm value, and [[Management entrenchment|Managerial Entrenchment]], Journal of Financial Economics83, 501-529.&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly held companies, staggered boards have the effect of making hostile [[takeover]] attempts more difficult.  When a board is staggered, hostile bidders must win more than one [[proxy fight]] at successive shareholder meetings in order to exercise control of the target [[corporation|firm]].  Particularly in combination with a [[poison pill]], a staggered board that cannot be dismantled or evaded is one of the most potent takeover defenses available to U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucian Bebchuk]], John C. Coates IV, and Guhan Subramanian, The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards:  Theory, Evidence, and Policy, 54 Stan. L. Rev. 887 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In corporate [[cumulative voting]] systems, staggering has two basic effects: it makes it more difficult for minorities to elect directors, as the fewer directorships up for election requires a larger per cent of the equity to win; and it makes takeover attempts less likely to succeed as it is harder to vote in a majority of new directors.&lt;ref name="corpfinance"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hillier|first1=David|last2=Ross|first2=Stephen|last3=Westerfield|first3=Randolph|last4=Jaffe|first4=Jeffrey|last5=Jordan|first5=Bradford|title=Corporate Finance|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=Berkshire|isbn=9780077139148|pages=34–35|edition=2nd European}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staggering may also however serve a more beneficial purpose, that is provide "institutional memory" — continuity in the board of directors — which may be significant for corporations with long-range projects and plans.&lt;ref name="corpfinance"/&gt;

Institutional shareholders are increasingly calling for an end to staggered boards of directors—also called "declassifying" the boards.  ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in January 2007 that 2006 marked a key switch in the trend toward declassification or annual votes on all directors: more than half (55%) of the S&amp;P 500 companies have declassified boards, compared with 47% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Jared A. Favole, "Big Firms Increasingly Declassify Boards", The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}'''''The Design of Business: Why Design Thinking is the Next Competitive Advantage''''' is a 2009 book by [[Roger Martin (professor)|Roger Martin]], Dean of the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[Rotman School of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Business-Thinking-Competitive-Advantage/dp/1422177807|publisher=Harvard Business Press|title=The Design of Business|date=November 2009|isbn=978-1422177808|author=Roger L. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Martin describes the concept of design thinking, and how companies can incorporate it into their organizational structure for long term innovation and results.

== Book summary ==

Martin introduces the knowledge funnel as the process followed by leading businesses to innovate more consistently and successfully.  The knowledge funnel has three different phases: 
:mystery → heuristic → algorithm
The mystery stage comprises the exploration of the problem, this transitions to the rule of thumb ([[heuristic]]) stage, where a rule of thumb is generated to narrow work to a manageable size.  In the [[algorithm]] stage the general heuristic is converted to a fixed formula, taking the problem from complexity to simplicity.

Martin poses that there are currently two forms of business thinking. Analytical thinking is driven by a [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] process, standardizing to eliminate judgment, [[bias]], and variation. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuitive]] thinking focuses more on an [[instinct]] to drive [[creativity]] and [[innovation]]. Analytical thinking has become much more prevalent in organizations, because it is more consistent, easier to measure, and can scale in size. Martin labels the difference between a bias for the two schools of thought as the distinction between 'reliability' versus 'validity'.  Organizations are much more likely to favor what is reliable, because their structures motivate analytical thinking.  This means that organizations are often poor at achieving valid solutions because they do not fully take advantage of all three areas of the knowledge tunnel, just the two latter stages (heuristics and algorithms).

[[Design thinking]] balances analytical and intuitive thinking. It combines an openness to explorative thoughts with an exploitative mentality, striking the balance between innovation and a [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] scalable process. It pulls resources back into the knowledge funnel and allows to progress through all three stages.

Martin argues that business is currently missing [[abductive reasoning]], the third form of logic ([[deductive logic]] and [[inductive logic]] being other two). [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] formed the idea of abductive logic, arguing that no new idea could come from inductive or deductive logic.  Peirce described the process of discovery as new ideas that arose when thinkers observed data that did not fit with the existing models.  The first step of reasoning was not observation but wondering.  Designers live in the world of abductive logic, actively looking for new data points and changing the way that things are done.  Incorporating this into organizational structures allows firms to become better at the mystery stage of the knowledge funnel.

The way organizations implement these findings depends on the structure and makeup of the organization. CEOs like [[Mike Lazaridis]] at [[Research in Motion]], lead the design thinking by example. An alternative is a new corporate structure that incorporates design thinking into the firm, like the one [[A.G. Lafley]] put in place at [[Procter and Gamble]]. Similarly, a hybrid model, with a CEO who [[leadership|leads]] by example but also has a creative structure in place to encourage design thinking, can work well; the best example is [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] under [[Steve Jobs]].

From a personal development standpoint, Martin advocates using and combining some of the tools discussed in his earlier book, ''[[The Opposable Mind]]'', to develop the design thinking mindset.
*Stance: positioning oneself with a mindset to acquire the skills to become a successful design thinker.
*Tools: taking the opportunity to develop skills that will improve thought processes and [[creativity]].
*Experiences: exposing oneself to challenging situations, different variations, and reinforcing ones design thinking.

Martin acknowledges that design thinking may be meet criticism, so he suggests the following steps to get along with others while practicing it:
#Rephrase extreme views as a creative challenge
#[[empathy|Empathize]] with colleagues on the extremes.
#Argue in terms of reliability and validity.
#Put unfamiliar concepts in familiar terms.
#When it comes to proof, test small first to illustrate successful outcomes, then scale up {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Reaction ==

Reviews have generally been positive, citing the book as "easy reading, because he is an excellent storyteller, and illustrates his thesis with memorable examples".&lt;ref&gt;"Schachter, Harvey. "A new way of thinking to propel businesses forward."

"Martin's gift of analysis." National Post 09 Dec 2009: &lt;http://www.financialpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=30629010-208b-41c5-bab8-570ef85546c6&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Turkish Confederation of Businessmen and Industrialists''' ({{lang-tr|'''Türkiye İşadamları ve Sanayiciler Konfederasyonu'''}}), best known by the abbreviation '''TUSKON''', was a [[employers' organization]] in [[Turkey]], with about 40,000 members. It was founded in 2005 by seven business federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Holton|author2=Clare Lopez|title=The Gulen Movement|url=https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Gulen_Final.pdf|work=Center for Security Policy|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninety percent of the TUSKON members were small or medium establishments with fewer than 50 employees. TUSKON engaged in [[lobbying]] all decision-makers at the local, regional, national and global levels.&lt;ref name=Kurumsal&gt;[http://www.tuskon.org/?p=content&amp;cl=kurumsal&amp;l=kurumsal Tuskon Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Rızanur Meral, the managing director of SANKO Automotive Group, was the last president of TUSKON.&lt;ref name="sab"&gt;{{cite news|title=TUSKON tarih oldu|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/ekonomi/2016/07/24/tuskon-tarih-oldu|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Sabah|date=24 July 2016|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Richard Cumpiano''' (born April 30, 1945) is a builder of stringed [[musical instruments]] and is known for his writing and teaching of the art of [[luthiery]].  He has been involved in the preservation and understanding of the fading musical and musical craft traditions of his native [[Puerto Rico]].  Cumpiano was instrumental in the development of the first feature-length documentary about the cuatro and its music, ''Our Cuatro: The [[Puerto Ricans]] and Stringed Instruments'', Volumes 1 and 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highmountaintonewood.com/id19.htm Stringed Links]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Cumpiano was born into a middle-class family in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. His father was a native of the town of [[Rincón, Puerto Rico]], and his mother from [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  He was raised in the capital of Puerto Rico where he received his primary and secondary education. On one occasion, Cumpiano wandered into an eatery next to his grade school which had a [[jukebox]].  He listened to [[Odilio González]] sing a décima with a [[guitar]] and a [[cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]] in the background. In Puerto Rico the type of music that Odilio González sang is known as "música jíbara", which is Puerto Rico's cultural equivalent of what in the [[United States]] is called [[country music]].  This early experience would eventually grow into his passion for Puerto Rican traditional instruments and singing.&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;[http://www.cumpiano.com/Home/Scrapbook/museum.htm Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumpiano attended the [[University of Puerto Rico]] High School in [[Río Piedras]] from 1959 to 1961 and St. John's Preparatory School in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] from 1961 until his graduation in 1962.

He wanted to study engineering, and in 1962 he moved to [[Medford, Massachusetts]].  There he enrolled at [[Tufts University]] where he discovered that he was more interested in studying art. In 1964, he moved to [[New York City]] and studied industrial design at [[Pratt Institute]].  He earned his B.Ind.D. (Bachelor of Industrial Design) in 1968, and went to work as a professional furniture designer.&lt;ref name="Cumpiano"&gt;[http://www.cumpiano.com/Home/Guitars/Bio/bio.html Bio.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Master guitarmaker==
Cumpiano met master guitarmaker [[Michael Gurian (luthier)|Michael Gurian]] in 1969, and under Gurian's mentoring he began his training in the craft of guitarmaking. Cumpiano left his job and went to work in Gurian's guitarmaking shop in [[New Hampshire]]. In Gurian's guitarmaking shop he met and befriended Gurian's shop foreman, Michael Millard. Eventually Cumpiano and Millard established a shop together named "Froggy Bottom Guitars", where Cumpiano completed his training in guitarmaking.

Cumpiano's career spans almost forty years of hand-crafting all sorts of fretted stringed instruments from the [[North American]], European and [[Latin America]]n traditions. In 1985, his interests turned to the stringed instrument traditions of his native Puerto Rico and over the years Cumpiano became an authority on the craft and traditions that surround the "national instrument" of Puerto Rico, the ten string ''cuatro''.  He has built numerous cuatros for musicians in the United States and also has crafted cuatro variants of his own design: he developed a "seis", or six course (twelve string) cuatro that can be tuned in the same string intervals as a guitar. He also developed the "thinline" cuatro with a body depth of only two inches instead of the traditional three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatro-pr.org/Home/Eng/Instrmus/Artisanry/Making/Cumpiano/cumpianothin1.htm William Cumpiano makes a "thinline" cuatro]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his customers are [[Arlo Guthrie]], Michael Lorimer, [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]], Country Joe MacDonald, the [[Todd Rundgren]] band, [[June Millington]], and Joel Zoss.&lt;ref name="Cumpiano"/&gt;

Cumpiano has taught his craft for over twenty years out of his studio, in schools, during workshops and lectures and through numerous publications. He has taught cuatro making to young Puerto Rican artisans under grants originating from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) through various regional arts organizations.

Cumpiano met Juan Sotomayor, a prize-winning photographer who worked on the [[New York Times]] staff. They discovered that there was no serious effort being expended at the University of Puerto Rico to study or research the origins and history, the corpus, of the jíbaro musical and musical craft traditions. They decided to set out to discover the story of Puerto Rico's traditional stringed instruments and later the story of Puerto Rico's traditional music.

In 1992, he co-founded ''"The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project"'' with Juan Sotomayor and Wilfredo Echevarría, an expert in media communications.

The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the traditions that surround the national instrument of Puerto Rico, by means of gathering, promoting and preserving its cultural memories of Puerto Rican musical traditions, folkloric stringed instruments and musicians. The Cuatro Project is also dedicated to promoting and preserving the Puerto Rican [[décima]] verse form and the traditional song as created by its greatest troubadours, living and past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatro-pr.org/Home/Eng/4p/cuatro.htm The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumpiano, who is also a founding board member and president of the Association of Stringed Instrument Artisans (ASIA), has lectured about his skills at conventions of the Guild of American Luthiers (GAL).  He has received the recognition of various institutes, among them the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. He is also the co-recipient of a 1993 U.S. Patent for the compression-molded carbon fibre composite guitar soundboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cumpiano.com/Home/Guitars/Special/special_projects.html Special projects and innovative designs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written work and Documentaries==
[[File:Guitarmaking Tradition and Technology.jpg|right|100px|thumb|GUITARMAKING]]
Cumpiano co-authored, with Jonathon Natelson, the world's leading guitarmaking textbook,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitarmaking.com/ Guitarmaking]&lt;/ref&gt; "GUITARMAKING: Tradition and Technology", a complete reference for the design and construction of the steel string folk guitar and the classical guitar, which has been acclaimed as the principal textbook in his field and considered by many as the [[Bible]] of guitarmaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highmountaintonewood.com/id19.htm High Mountain Tonewood Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Cumpiano and his colleagues wrote, directed and produced "Un Canto en Otra Montaña: Música Puertorriqueña en [[Hawaii]]"'' (A Song [Heard] on Another Mountain: Puerto Rican Music in Hawaii), a short-feature video documentary on the [[music]] and social history of the century-old Puerto Rican Diaspora in Hawaii.

Cumpiano, together with Sotomayor and Echevarría, wrote, directed and produced two[[DVD]] documentaries for The Cuatro Project. They are:''OUR CUATRO Vol.1'', the first feature-length documentary about the cuatro and its music and ''OUR CUATRO Vol. 2: A Historic Concert''. Cumpiano and cultural researcher David Morales produced another DVD documentary ''THE DÉCIMA BORINQUEÑA: An Ancient Poetic Singing Tradition'', directed by Myriam Fuentes. The proceeds of these recordings were to be used for the research and documentation activities of the Puerto Rican Cuatro Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatro-pr.org/Home/Eng/Products/OurCuatrovol_1.htm NUESTRO CUATRO]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Nuestro Cuatro.jpg|right|thumb|OUR CUATRO Vol. 2]]
*''"Nuestro Cuatro: Volumen 1, The Puerto Ricans and their stringed instruments"''. An unprecedented documentary that reveals the emotional story of the development and the history of the music and stringed instruments traditions of Puerto Rico.

In them, one can trace the medieval Spanish and [[Moorish]] roots of the ''trovador''.

Cumpiano also co-produced and co-directed in 2001, the documentary ''"Construyendo Cuatros"'' (''"Making Cuatros"''), which comprises visits with two of Puerto Rico's most respected cuatro makers, showing them at work, the sequence of constructing a cuatro, and their impressions of their craft and the future prospects for the instrument.
