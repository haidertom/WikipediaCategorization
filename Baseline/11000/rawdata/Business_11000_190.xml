The '''Auditor General of Sri Lanka''' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]: ශ්‍රී ලංකා විගණකාධිපති ''Śrī Laṃkā viganakādhipathi''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: இலங்கை கணக்காய்வாளர் தலைமை) is appointed by the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] to aid [[accountability]] by conducting independent [[financial audit|audit]]s of government operations. These audits provide members of [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] with objective information to help them examine the government's activities and hold it to account. According to the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]], the Auditor General is empowered to audit the accounts of all departments of Government, the Offices of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Judicial Service Commission, the Public Service Commission, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the Secretary-General of Parliament and the Commissioner of Elections, local authorities, public corporations and business or other undertakings vested in the Government under any written law.{{citaiton needed|date=November 2017}}

The Auditor General of Sri Lanka is the head of the [[Auditor General's Department (Sri Lanka)|Auditor General's Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Auditor General’s Role and Responsibilities|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=54&amp;lang=en|publisher=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Auditor Generals|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en|publisher=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history_doc"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Auditor General's Department|url=http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/aboutus/HistoryoftheAuditorGeneralsDepartment.pdf|website=auditorgeneral.gov.lk|publisher=Auditor General's Department|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Auditors General==
While the title of ''Auditor General of Sri Lanka'' was formally adopted on the country's enactment of its [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|1978 republican constitution]], the position or an equivalent to it has existed since 1799 under various titles.&lt;ref name="history_doc"/&gt; The Department in its current form considers itself a continuation of the office established in 1799, and the table below thus lists all officeholders that have held positions equivalent to the position of the current Auditor General.&lt;ref name="history_doc"/&gt;

'''Bojan Križaj''' ({{audio|Sl-Bojan Križaj.oga|listen}}) (born 3 January 1957) is a Slovenian, back then Yugoslavian, former [[alpine skier]].  During his international career he competed for the then-existing [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. He competed at three Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name="SportsRef"&gt;{{cite Sports-Reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/kr/bojan-krizaj-1.html |title=Bojan Križaj Olympic Results |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Križaj, born in [[Kranj]], was a member of a well known [[Tržič]] ski family so he started skiing at the age of 3. In the season 1976/77 he received the first World Cup point, qualified among the 15 best [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] runners and later during that season in [[Madonna di Campiglio]] he hit his first top 3 podium. On 20 January 1980 he achieved the first [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] World Cup victory in [[Wengen, Switzerland|Wengen]], [[Switzerland]] and later he won seven more times, thus still being Yugoslavia's and Slovenia's most successful male alpine skier to date.

At [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]], [[United States|U.S.]], he reached the fourth place in [[giant slalom]], missing the bronze medal by only two hundredths of second. Four years later he took the [[Olympic Oath|athlete's oath]] at the opening ceremony for [[Sarajevo]]'s [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He caused a stir when he spoke the oath not in [[Croatian or Serbian]] but in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Despite great expectations of the Yugoslav audience he finished ninth in [[giant slalom]], much less than expected. Križaj should also have competed at [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], [[Canada]], but he got injured a few days before the event.

His most successful World Championship was in 1982 in [[Schladming]], [[Austria]] where he received the silver medal in [[Slalom skiing|slalom]].

His most successful World Cup season was 1986/87 when he received the small crystal globe for the season's best slalom runner (that was the only men's crystal globe of that season not won by [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]]). Beside that he was the second in World Cup slalom standings in the  1979/80 and 1985/86 seasons and third in the 1980/81 season. His best position in overall World Cup standings was the 4th place in 1979/80.

He concluded his career in 1988 at the race in [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]], [[Austria]] where he stepped off the skis right at the end of the track and walked into the finish area.

Since his skiing retirement he worked in many fields, including as importer of Austrian brand beer and adviser for ski products in [[Elan Line|Elan]] company.

In March 2006 he became Head of Slovenian Ski Pool.

==History==
[[Image:Butterball plant, Longmont, CO IMG 5214.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Butterball plant in downtown [[Longmont, Colorado|Longmont]], [[Colorado]]]]

The name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of [[Wyoming, Ohio|Wyoming]], [[Ohio]]. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to [[JBS USA|Swift and Co.]] for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name "Butterball" to Swift, which was acquired by [[ConAgra]] in 1990.

Leo Peters retained rights to use the name '''Butterball Farms''' for his butter products&lt;ref name="retained"&gt;{{cite web

In October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to [[North Carolina]]-based '''Carolina Turkeys,''' making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States.&lt;ref name="largest"&gt;{{cite news

| date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The company, located southeast of Raleigh, NC in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina]] on the Wayne and Duplin county line, subsequently renamed itself Butterball LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2006-11-21-butterball_x.htm USA Today: Sale of Butterball turkey business not expected to change Thanksgiving icon]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in [[Garner, North Carolina]]. The headquarters has a "customer experience center" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations.&lt;ref name="major deal"&gt;{{cite news

Smithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp.&lt;ref name=Smithfield&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/09/10/673672/smithfield-to-sell-its-stake-in.html|title=Smithfield to sell its stake in Butterball|last=Felberbaum|first=Michael|work=[[News &amp; Observer]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2010-09-10|accessdate=2010-09-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate==
Walter “Gator” Pelletier, past chairman of the [[National Turkey Federation]], is Butterball LLC's corporate secretary &amp;mdash; managing all operating activities from turkey production and directing Maxwell Farms, the managing partner of Butterball. Pelletier is also president of Maxwell Farms, Inc., vice president of Goldsboro Milling Company, and secretary-treasurer of Maxwell Foods, Inc. Pelletier had joined Goldsboro Milling Company in 1981.&lt;ref name="major deal-2"&gt;{{cite web

==Turkey Talk-Line==
Beginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk-Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/butterballs-turkey-hotline-has-been-preventing-thanksgiving-disasters-35-years-174358/ |publisher=Ad Week |title=Butterball’s Turkey Hotline Has Been Preventing Thanksgiving Disasters for 35 Years |date=November 1, 2016 |author=Robert Klara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost.

In ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode "[[The Indians in the Lobby]]", President [[Josiah Bartlet]] calls the number (referred to as the "Butterball Hotline" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey.

==Criticism==
Animal welfare activists such as [[Mercy for Animals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Free Animal Video|title=Butterball Turkey Animal Cruelty Undercover Video MFA|date=2014-04-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhi-Gg2b46A|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and [[PETA]] have accused Butterball of animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="butterballabuse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://butterballabuse.com/ |title=Butterball Abuse |date=December 28, 2011 |publisher=Mercy for Animals |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/features/butterball-peta-investigation.aspx|title=Butterball's House of Horrors: A PETA Undercover Investigation |date=2010-10-21|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2009/12/shareholder_resolution_urges.html |title=Shareholder Resolution Urges Smithfield to Help Decrease Suffering of Butterball Turkeys |date=December 22, 2009 |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention.

In October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse: Undercover Investigation Exposes Shocking Cruelty...Again!|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal [[cruelty to animals]]. Mercy for Animals’ 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Butterball Abuse|url=http://www.butterballabuse.com/|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galli|first=Cindy|title=Butterball Turkey Raided Amid Animal Abuse Allegations|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/butterball-turkey-raided-amid-animal-abuse-allegations/story?id=15249456#.Tvyp6lb4WSo|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals—marking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Making History: Butterball Case Marks First-Ever Felony Conviction for Cruelty to Factory-Farmed Birds|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/making-history-butterball-conviction-marks-first-ever-felony-conviction-for-cruelty-to-factory-farme.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Michael|title=Ex-N.C. turkey farm worker pleads guilty to animal cruelty|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/08/nc-turkey-farm-worker-pleads-guilty-to-animal-cruelty/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking News: Another Butterball Worker Pleads Guilty to Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2012/08/breaking-news-another-butterball-worker-pleads-guilty-to-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Runkle|first=Nathan|title=Breaking News: Two More Butterball Workers Convicted of Cruelty to Animals|url=http://www.mfablog.org/2013/02/breaking-news-two-more-butterball-workers-convicted-of-cruelty-to-animals.html|publisher=Mercy For Animals|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA’s investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More animal cruelty arrests at Butterball facility in Hoke County|url=http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127152549/http://www2.journalnow.com/news/2012/feb/17/more-animal-cruelty-arrests-at-butterball-facility-ar-1941598/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 January 2013|publisher=Winston-Salem Journal|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kapitan Chung Thye Phin''' MSC, JP ({{zh|c=鄭大平|p=Zhèng Dàpíng|s=|t=|pfs=Chhang Thai Phìn}}; 1879 - 1935) was a wealthy [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayan]] tin miner and rubber planter&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Business in Southeast Asia: Contesting Cultural Explanations by Edmund Terence Gomez, Hsin-Huang Michael Hsiao, Page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 10 September 1925, Page 8 -- Capitan Chung Thye Phin has sold his large rubber estate, situated in Sungei Siput, for an amount exceeding $700,000, the purchasers being Messrs. Barlow and Co., Kuala Lumpur. The Times of Malaya understands that the sale was put through by a well known Chinese business man of Penang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He was appointed a member of the Federation Malay States Rubber Restriction Committee in 1922 - The Straits Times, 28 October 1922, Page 8 National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL499&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The rise of ersatz capitalism in South-East Asia - Page 203&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] ancestry who was raised on the island of [[Penang]] in the state of the same name in [[Malaysia]], known at that time as [[British Malaya]]. He pioneered the cultivation of Roselle for the production of Roselle fibre rope and twine, his initial effort including the Sweet Kamiri Estate in Sungei Siput.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 2 September 1922, Page 11 -- NEW MALAYAN INDUSTRY. -- That success is attending the efforts of planters who several months ago went in for Roselle fibre is evident from a notice appearing in the advertisement columns of our Ipoh contemporary, announcing that at the present time rope made of this fibre can be obtained at 24 cents per lb, F.O.R. Sungei Siput! The advertisement states that not only are "all sizes of rope up to 3 1/2 inch circumference in stock," but that the Manager of Sweet Kamiri Estate, Sungei Siput, is prepared to supply "any larger size" to order. Credit in this connection for most praise-worthy enterprise, for thus setting an excellent example to the general public, is, if we mistake not, due to Mr. Chung Thye Phin, the Captain China, who was among the first, if not the very first, to invest in this kind of product, making his initial effort at Sweet Kamiri Estate, Perak, many months ago. Since then, as was mentioned in our columns recently scores of planters in all parts of the Peninsula have gone in for Roselle fibre, the prospects of this useful commodity figuring regularly among our exports before very long being excellent. For twine and rope-making it is admirably adapted and as the plant flourishes in Malaya and native labour is cheap there is no reason why the manufacture of rope in Malaya should not become just as important an industry in the near future as that of the enterprising China Clay and Pottery Company, of Gopeng, for which Messrs McAlister * Co., Ltd., are, the local agents. (S. Echo.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Perak Advisory Board and the last ''[[Kapitan China]]'' of [[Perak]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 5 October 1903, Page 5, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DEATH OF CAPITAN CHUNG THYE PIN. One Of Malaya's Pioneer Motorists, The Straits Times, 1 April 1935, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death he was said to have been the wealthiest man in Penang.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 31 March 1935, Page 1, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL2360&lt;/ref&gt; There was a big turnout at his funeral in Penang (7 April 1935) including many prominent personalities from the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements and the funeral procession was a quarter of a mile long.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 8 April 1935, Page 3 -- FUNERAL OF CHUNG THYE PHIN -- Penang, 5 Apr.. -- THE funeral of Capitan Chung Thye Phin, which took place from his residence, 58, Northam yesterday morning, was attended by nearly 500 friends and relatives, some of whom had come from Ipoh, Taiping and Kuala Lumpur. There were approximately 200 mourners, including the deceased's wives, children, and grandchildren. The procession was a quarter of a mile long. Innumerable Chinese banners, Chinese priests, the Municipal Band, and Boys Scouts from the Second Penang (A.C.S.) Troop, under S.M. Yeoh Seng Chan, former the almost unending train, which was brought up in the rear by the coffin and finally the mourners and followers. Many prominent local and outstation men were present including Hon. Mr. Palgrave Simpson, Mr. [[Leong Sin Nam]], Mr. [[Cheah Cheang Lim]], [[Dato Panglima Kinta]] and Mr. [[Heah Joo Seang]]. The procession started shortly after 11 a.m., proceeding down [[Northam Road]] into Transfer Road and Sri Bahari Road, to come out into [[Penang Road]]. The train broke up at the junction of Burma and Penang Roads, from where the coffin was borne up to Bagan Jermal for burial in a private piece of land in the estate of the late Cheang Keng Kwee. After the burial ceremony was over at the grave side, the procession proceeded home.&lt;/ref&gt;

== A Famous Pedigree ==
Kapitan [[Chung Keng Quee]], Mandarin 2nd Class of the Imperial Chinese Court and leader of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] secret society in British Malaya had nine male issue, the 4th and best known of whom was Chung, Thye-phin. Chung Thye Phin's Ch'i Yeh or godfather was Chin Seng Yam (Chin Ah Yam), the leader of the Ghee Hin, once the enemy of his father who was leader of the opposing Hai San, both factions (Ghee Hin and Hai San) fighting for domination of the tin fields of Larut.

== A Child of Taiping and Georgetown ==
Kapitan Chung Thye Phin was born 28 Sep 1879 in Kota,&lt;ref&gt;The principal village in Taiping at the time of the [[Larut war]]s was Kota which was about four kilometers from Klian Pauh: Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 64 By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Malaysian Branch, 1991, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; Taiping, Perak, Malaya. He received his education at the St. Xavier's, Penang. Upon leaving school, he was initiated into his father's business.&lt;ref name="arnold"&gt;Twentieth Century Impressions of British Malaya: Its History, People, Commerce, Industries, and Resources By Arnold Wright, H. A. Cartwright Published by Lloyd's Greater Britain publishing company, limited, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Born in the Federated Malay States, in 1902 he was granted a certificate of naturalisation by the Straits Government, making him a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 24 May 1902, Page 4, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL288&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tin Man ==
An enterprising youth with a flair for progress, he later started a number of tin mines of his own, including a deep-shaft mine at [[Tronoh]] or [[Teronoh]], adjoining the famous mine of the same name, and the hydraulic mine at Batu Tugoh. [[Tronoh]] was the centre of the mining field containing the mine of Chung Thye Phin's Tronoh Mines Company Ltd.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

His open-cast mines were operated on the most modern system in his time. He had the distinction of being the first Chinese miner to have introduced the latest appliances on the mines, under the supervision of a European engineer.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

In 1914 he was elected to the council of the F.M.S. Chamber of Mines.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 3 March 1914, Page 3 -- F.M.S. Chamber of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Ho Man and Foo Choong Nyit, Chung Thye Phin co-founded the [[Toh Allang Chinese Tin Ltd.|Toh Allang Chinese Tin Company]] in Perak, the first Chinese limited liability company, in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Straits Tin; a Brief Account of the First Seventy-five Years of the Straits Trading Company, Limited. 1887-1962.

The success of the smelting industry in Singapore has led to the formation of a syndicate to enter into competition with the Straits Trading Company. With a capital of $1,250,000, divided into 125,000 shares of $10 each, the Eastern Smelting Company has been registered recently at Penang, and application is now being made to the Federated Malay States Government for permission to export ore. We understand that the concern is composed chiefly of Straits-born Chinese. The export restrictions were aimed, it is stated, at the formation, some time since, of an American tin trust. It is believed that another syndicate, with a similar object in view, is in course of formation.&lt;/ref&gt; and in November that year, its prospectus was advertised in various newspapers offering shares to the public.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 26 November 1907, Page 1 -- The eastern Smelting Company Limited.

REGISTERED OFFICEl No. 73, Dato Kramat Road ... ... ... Penang. PROSPECTUS. It is proposed to form this Company to purchase and take over as a going concern the well-known business of Tin Smelting carried on during the past 10 years by Mr. Lee Chin Ho of No 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, together with the Smelting works and premises belonging thereto and situate at No. 73, Dato Kramat Road, Penang, and all the plant machinery, furnaces, chimney stacks, fixtures, engines, motors, office furniture, implements and permanent appliances whatsoever used in connection therewith and the goodwill of the business and generally to carry on the business of Tin Merchants, Tin Smelters and Tin Refiners. The total purchase price payable to the Vendor Mr. Lee Chin Ho is $300,000 of which $150,000 represents the value of the works and premises and the plant machinery &amp;c., used in connection therewith and $150,000 is the amount payable for the Goodwill. The purchase price will be paid as to $250,000 in fully paid up shares in the Company and as to the balance of $50,000 only in Cash. Arrangements have also been made for taking over the stock and the benefit of all contracts which have been entered into by the Vendor in connection with the business and which shall be in existence at the date of the completion of the purchase at the price to be agreed upon between the Vendor and the Company or in default of agreement at a price to be settled by arbitration. There are at present four furnaces on the premises and the works are capable of turning out 25 tons of refined tin per day. There is  ample space upon the premises in Dato Kramat Road for the erection of more than double the present number of furnaces. It is intended to establish Agencies in the Federated Malay States and elsewhere to buy ore and it is estimated that the present output of refined tin which now averages from 250 to 300 tons per month will be increased to between 800 and 1,000 tons per month. Mr. Herman Jessen, who during the last 6 years has been with the firm of Messrs. Behn Meyer &amp; Co., has had considerable experience in the tin business and will act as the first Managing Director of the Company upon terms to be arranged between himself and the Company. Mr. Lee Chin Ho has also promised the Company the full benefit of his services, skill and experience for the next 3 years at least. The business will be carried on and conducted upon the most modern and up to date lines. All preliminary expenses down to and including the day on which the Company is entitled to commence business will be paid by the Company but no promotion money will be paid. One Hundred Thousand Shares in the Company have already been privately applied for; 25,000 shares go to the Vendor in part payment of the purchase money and the remaining 25,000 Shares are now offered to the Public for subscription at par. As a large number of the leading Tin Miners in the Straits and F. M. S. have applied for the bulk of the Shares in the Company the Directors have every confidence in the future success of the Company. A Contract dated the 27th day of July 1907, has been entered into between Lee Chin ho of the one part and Herrmann Jessen of Penang for and on behalf of the Company of the other part for the sale and purchase of the business of the Company and copies of such Contract can be inspected at the premises of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China in Penang, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping and Medan during the usual business hours until the Subscription list is closed. Application for Shares should be made on the accompanying forms and forwarded to the Company's Bankers at Penang with a remittance for the amount payable on application not later than 30 November 1907. Where no allotment is made the deposit will be returned in full. For the purpose of facilitating the transfer of Shares the Company will have power to issue Share Warrants to Bearer in respect of any fully paid-up Shares of the Company upon such terms and subject to such conditions as may be resolved upon by the Directors. Prospectuses and forms of application can be obtained at the offices of the Company or from the Company's Bankers or Solicitors.

OPENING OF EASTERN SMELTING WORKS. Governor's Speech. COMPETITION WITH STRAITS TRADING COMPANY. Opening Ceremony Performed by Miss Anderson. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Penang, 18, 10 January.20a.m. His Excellency the Governor, Sir John Anderson, K.C.M.G., participated in the opening of the Eastern Smelting Company here to-day. In a speech delivered by His Excellency, he alluded to the present depression in the tin industry, which had been produced by the grave shock sustained by the credit of the markets of the world, and especially by the United States. This depression in the markets, the mining industry in the Federated Malay States had been unable to withstand, and he feared, looking to the history of similar depressions in the past, that the end had not yet been reached. His Excellency also referred to the competition of the Eastern Smelting Company with one of the greatest institutions in the Colony -- the Straits Trading Company. He expressed himself as confident that there would be no cut-throat competition between the two concerns, as there were level-headed men at the head of both. We did not want monopolists in the Colony and Federated Malay States, bu healthy competition resulting in a reasonable margin of profit. His Excellency then dealt with the prospects of the Eastern Smelting Company, with Penang as the gate of Perak and the Siamese Malayan States. The Governor was presented by the management of the new Company with an address in a silver casket. Thereafter, the gubernatorial party went over the works and viewed the smelting process. Miss Anderson opening the works with a gold key, which was thereupon presented by the management for her acceptance.&lt;/ref&gt; The company appeared to be doing well and at its first ordinary general meeting in October that year a 5 per cent dividend was declared based on the good performance of the prior six months work.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 22 October 1908, Page 8 -- Promising Future for the Eastern Smelting Company. The first ordinary general meeting of the Eastern Smelting company, Limited, was held on Thursday afternoon at the company's registered offices at Penang. The Managing Director, Mr. Herrmann Jessen, occupied the chair and gave a resume of the company's work for the last six months, which was regarded by the large number of shareholders present as very satisfactory. The Chairman said that the Directors were in the happy position of being able to declare an interim dividend of 5 per cent. This would absorb half of the net profit earned during the half-year. The Chairman was very glad to be able to assure the meeting that the outlook for the future was very promising. Mr. J. D. Ke,p. of the Rahman Tin Company, was then elected unanimously to the vacant seat on the Board of Directors, and, with a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the proceedings terminated.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arose the following year and by the end of it its works manager had resigned, accusing the managing director and other directors of financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 2 November 1909, Page 7 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. AFFAIRS. [Articles] -- EASTERN SMELTING CO. AFFAIRS. (From On Own Correspondent.) Penang. 1 November. The resignation of Mr. J. H. Robertson from the directorate of the Eastern Smelting Co. is alleged to be due to differences with the other directors regarding loans and advances to certain directors from the company's funds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 2 November 1909, Page 6 -- In connection with the resignation of Mr. J.

Khaw Joo Tok, Lee Chin Ho, Ng Boo Bee, Chung Thye Phin, Chu Shu Ming, Quah Beng Kee, Ong Hong Beng and Loke Chow Kit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 11 November 1909, Page 7 -- Eastern Smelting Co. [Articles] -- Eastern Smelting Co. ACRIMONIOUS AND PERSONAL RECRIMINATIONS. Protracted Meeting. (From Our Own Cobrbspondbnt.) Penang, 11 November. A crowded meeting of the Eastern Smelting Company was held here yesterday and a protracted sitting took place. Messrs. Jessen and Robertson occupied a considerable time in acrimonious and personal recriminations. Mr. Robertson declared under Jessen the Company lost $76,000 in tin dealings with London in 1908, and $1,100 in 1909.  He also stated Jessen had overdrawn his private accounts by $21,000 and had taken shares for the Company in mining ventures which proved unsuccessful. Jessen rejoined that everything had been done with the knowledge and approval of the board. They had repaid the overdraft. He asserted the unsatisfactory state of the Company's affairs was due to Robertson's failure to keep proper accounts at the Works, incorrect estimates and to refusal to co-operate with the head office. The disclosures revealed an extraordinary state of affairs in  the Company. The directors were empowered to inquire into their own alleged short-comings and to report on the whole of the affairs of the Company to shareholders early in 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1911 it had been decided to sell off the business to a London company.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 22 March 1911, Page 6 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO.

C., Sir Ernest Woodford Birch, K.M.C.G. (the Chairman), presiding. The secretary (Mr F C Bell) having read the notice convening the meeting and the certificate of the auditors. The Chairman said: the company was incorporated on 20 July this year, and the prospectus offering 50,000 Preferred Ordinary shares of £1 each was issued on 21 July, The issue was very successful, 35,736 shares being applied for in this country and 37,125 in Malaya, making 72,861 in all. Of this number 27,000 shares were allotted as to 13,870 to Malayan applicants and 13,130 to London applicants. Before the formal transfer of the business to the new company could take place, it was necessary for our auditors to prepare a balance sheet showing the vendor company's financial position at 26 July at which date the nominal transfer took place. The preparation of this balance sheet took somewhat longer than was anticipated and it was not until 2 October that the directors were enabled to complete the formal transfer of the business. The transfer has now been duly registered in the Straits Settlements and in the Federated Malay States so the new company is in full possession.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 4 January 1913, Page 3-- EASTERN SMELTING CO. Final Meeting of the Penang Company. The final meeting of The Eastern Smelting Company, Limited (in liquidation) was held at Penang, on Monday, the Hon. A. R. Adams in the chair. After the notice convening the meeting had been read. Mr. P. E. Laws, the liquidator, presented his accounts, which were regarded as very satisfactory. The accounts showed that every shareholder had been transferred to the London company, and had received shares in that company equivalent to his holding in the Penang company, and that after paying for the cost of the liquidation, there was a balance in hand of $1,287.39. The Hon A R Adams said he was sure that the shareholders in the Penang company had no cause to regret the transfer to the London company and proposed that the cash balance in hand be given to the Penang Maternity Hospital. After some discussion this was agreed to. Mr. A. F. G. Anderson moved that the provisional payment of $2,669.15 for the directors' legal costs in the action brought by Mr Robertson against the directors be confirmed. Mr Hoefeld seconded and the motion was carried.&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership by the London-company of the Penang-company became complete with the liquidation of the Penang public company.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 20 January 1912, Page 9 -- EASTERN SMELTING CO.

In 1907 he convened a public meeting held at his offices attended by leading miners and other prominent residents to discuss problems that could arise as a result of the construction of the proposed Tronoh Railway and calling for a memorandum to be sent to the government to postpone the letting of contracts until a full public enquiry could be taken.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 8 February 1907, Page 10 -- IPOH-TRONOH RAILWAY.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue Farmer ==
He also had vast interests in some of the Government revenue farm monopolies. On 2, July 1903, the public tenders were declared open for the running of the Kedah and Penang Opium Farms. There were eight tenders. The highest tender was made by Chung Thye Phin for the Penang farm at $260,000 a month.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"&gt;Chinese Business in the Making of a Malay State, 1882-1941: Kedah and Penang By Wu Xiao An, Xiao An Wu Published by Routledge, 2003; {{ISBN|0-415-30176-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-30176-3}}, Pg 111&lt;/ref&gt;

An understanding was reached that:  (i) the government cut the Penang opium farm from the $260,000 a month tendered by Chung Thye Phin to $220,000 (later reduced to $217,000), and agreed that the syndicate could have both the Penang and Kedah farms at an overall price of $260,000 per month; (ii) Gan Ngoh Bee could have half the farm, but the other half should go to Chung Thye Phin, whose tender was the highest; and (iii) the government would undertake to secure the Kedah farm on behalf of the Penang syndicate at $40,000 a month with one-to-three months' deposits.&lt;ref name="wuxiaoan"/&gt;

According to a deed dating back to 1906, he was one of the trustees of the Penang Chinese Recreation Club. 

During the financial depression in Perak in 1908 he was one of the four members of a deputation (the other three being Eu Tong Sen, Foo Choo Choon and Yau Tet Shin) appointed by the whole of the Chinese community in Perak to plead their plight and bring to the attention of the acting resident of Perak, Mr E L Brockman their requests for government aid.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 18 July 1908, Page 11 -- FINANCIAL DEPRESSION IN PERAK.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as a member of the Commission to enquire into and report on the Mining Industry, for which all the members were thanked by Mr. E. L. Brockman, Chief Secretary, F. M. S., for "the thoroughness with which you have gone into the various and important points raised and the clearness with which the conclusion arrived at regarding them have been recorded". (K. L., F. M. S. Correspondence Ref: No. 508-1919 dated 29 January 1920)

In October 1920 he was appointed President of the Chinese Widow's and Orphan's Institution, Perak at its seventeenth annual general meeting in Ipoh.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 6 October 1920, Page 8, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 6 October 1920, Page 8 -- The following gentlemen were appointed office-bearers of the Chinese Widows' and Orphans' Institution, Perak, at the seventeenth annual general meeting held in Ipoh on Sunday President, Chung Thye Phin, M.C., J.P., vice president, Ng Hoi hon. secretary, Loo Seong Lan hon. treasurer, Law Joo Poh committee Cheah Kee Ec, J.P.,...&lt;/ref&gt;

His appointment was so popular with the community that he was escorted to Kuala Kangsar by the delegates of more than 70 Chinese organisations from Perak.&lt;ref&gt;"Miscellaneous Chronicles of Penang", Kuang, Kuo-hsiang op. cit., pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year he was invited to Kuala Lumpur to give his views to the Trade Depression Commission during its two day's sitting in camera.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 3 September 1921, Page 9 -- THE TRADE COMMISSION&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed trustee of the resuscitated Perak Miners' and Planters' association in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 16 May 1922, Page 10 -- MINERS AND PLANTERS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1923 he was elected the first president of the newly inaugurated British Chinese Association.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 26 July 1923, Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1923, at the annual general meeting of the Perak Chinese Dramatic Club, he was elected Patron.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 12 November 1923, Page 15, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL512&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926,  together with [[Leong Sin Nam]] he was elected an honorary member of the [[Ipoh Club]], whose members till then were restricted to the European community. The [[Times of Malaya]] said this was a compliment which should further cement the good feeling existing between the European and Chinese communities in Kinta.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 15 May 1926, Page 10, National Library of Singapore microfilm reel NL542&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 15 May 1926, Page 10 -- Kapitan China Chung Thye Phin, J.P., M.S.C.. and Towkay Leong Sin Nam, J.P., M.S.C., have been elected honorary members of the Ipoh Club —a compliment, says the Times of Malaya, which should further cement the good feeling existing between the European and Chinese communities in Kinta.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the name of His Majesty the King, His Excellency the High Commissioner awarded him a Certificate of Honour in recognition of his loyal and valuable services to the government of the F. M. S. in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 4 June 1927, Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; He was presented the Malayan Certificate of Honour and its accompanying insignia by the Chief Secretary, F. M.

M. the King-Emperor's birthday the year before.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 28 August 1928, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

According to berita.perak.gov.my, Foo Yet Kai, another Perak philanthropist, bought Chung Thye Phin's villa in Ipoh from the family of the late Kapitan and later gave permission for it to be converted into a private hospital, then known as Our Lady's Hospital and run by the Franciscan Sisters from Salzkotten, Germany. The hospital subsequently was renamed Kinta Medical Centre in the  1980s when the Foo Yet Kai Foundation took over the administration.

In 1905 together with a few others, he maintained 'Seng Kee' a [[Mess]] patronized by wealthy miners and merchants including [[Foo Choo Choon]] with whom he had familial and business relations.&lt;ref&gt;Kinta Valley: pioneering Malaysia's modern development (384 pages) by	Salma Nasution Khoo and Abdur-Razzaq Lubis, Published 2005 by Perak Academy, {{ISBN|983-42113-0-9}}, {{ISBN|978-983-42113-0-1}}, Page 235&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Sportsman ==
It is known that he owned expensive cars, prize-winning horses, and even issued his own [[currency]] for use in his mines.

Motoring was one of his passions.

Chung Thye Phin was an enthusiastic sportsman and on more than one occasion won the Blue Ribbon of the Straits Turf apart from many lesser events. Among his racing trophies are one for the 1905 Singapore Derby won by one of his horses, Devilment. He was also a good billiards player.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

He was also said to be a first class billiard player and played an exhibition match with world billiard champion John Roberts at the E&amp;O Hotel in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 25 October 1953, Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minting His Own Money ==
At one time, during the latter part of the first World War, he was among the few who were permitted by the Government to print and issue 10-cent notes for circulation. Chung Thye Phin first issued private [[banknotes]] in 10 cent denominations on 11 February 1918. These notes were only circulated within his mining concessions and the [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitan]]'s trading outlets at [[Phin Kee Chan]] in [[Ipoh]] and were used by large numbers of labourers in the mining areas in exchange for goods (Source: Museum Numismatik Maybank). No other denominations have been discovered. Circa 1918 the notes bear the legends Ten Cents "Phin Kee Chan Ten Cents" at top and bottom border and "Phin Kee Chan" at left and right border. The legend Chung Thye Phin was printed in a black panel diagonally. On the top left corner is a value of "10cents" and written in Chinese on the right is "bearer of this bill may exchange 10c from Phin Kee Chan". Embossed on it was an oval seal bearing the legend of Chung Thye Phin.&lt;ref&gt;Paper Currency of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei (1849-1970) By William Shaw, Mohd. Kassim Haji Ali Published by Muzium Negara Malaysia, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 25 November 1974, Page 24 -- When oldtime miners ran out of coins.. IPOH Sun. -- Old-time miners and businessmen in Perak had a solution when there was an acute shortage of coins during the latter part of the World War I period. They issued their own 10 cents notes bearing their name or that of their companies, and these were accepted as legal tender. Mr. E.E. Sim, Chief Registrar of the High Court in Kuala Lumpur, and president of the Numismatic Society, Malaysia, said here today that four such 10 cents currency notes issued during 1917 and 1918 in Perak are in the National Museum. One, signed by the late Towkay Leong Sin Nam and issues in 1918, bears the name of the Perak Chamber of Commerce, two others are signed by the late Kapitan Chung Thye Phin, and the fourth is signed "Kwong Loy" on behalf of "Choy Kwong Loy" for circulation in Gopeng, Perak, only. FACE VALUE. "These notes could have been issued to overcome the shortage of subsidiary silver coins in Perak," said Mr. Sim. "It should be remembered that due to the rising price of silver in the world from early 1915, the coins in circulation in the then Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements became intrinsically worth more than the face value. A lot of silver coins in those days, issued by the Government, went to the melting pot to be sold eventually as bullion. Subsequently, the Governments here started printing notes for 10 cents and later of five cents and 25 cents as well. Many of these notes were in circulation until about 25 years ago and have since been completely withdrawn."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Held Up By Pirates On The Canton River ==
In 1897, during a trip to China, he found himself and his entourage held up by pirates. What's perhaps even more surprising is that more than a few United States newspapers carried the following story about this son of Malaya:&lt;ref&gt;''The Evening Telegram''. St. John's Newfoundland, 13 September 1897; ''Boston Evening Transcript'' - 30 August 1897; ''New York Tribune'' 31 August 1897; ''The Islander''. (Friday Harbor, San Juan County, Wash.) 1891-1899, 9 September 1897; ''The Record-Union'', Sacramento, Monday Morning, 30 August, ''The San Francisco Call'', 30 August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tacoma, Wash., August 30. -- The steamer Columbia, from Yokohama, brings Oriental advices up to July 27. News has just reached Hong Kong of the prevalence of pirates on the Canton River and one of the most daring outrages perpetrated. One of the sons of Capt. Chung Kewi, a Straits millionaire, Chung Ah Phin, was the victim. With a few of his relatives he hired a boat and they were proceeding to their native place. On the second day the boat stuck in the mud and could not proceed. During the night a gang of men with painted faces and fully armed boarded the boat. With revolvers leveled at the passengers they commanded silence, while four men began at once to look for plunder. Ah Phin brought from the Straits jewelry amounting in value to $50,000 and $20,000 in cash. These the pirates took, besides clothing, etc. They left, after threatening the victims with instant death if they made a noise till twelve hours afterwards. In the morning information was sent down to Canton, but before the authorities had time to get a gunboat up the river the pirates had made their escape."

== Architectural Memorials ==
Chung Thye Phin Building, 14 Station Road in Ipoh, Perak is a three-storey corner building from 1907. It originally housed the Medical Hall established by Dr. R.M. Connolly, the Oilfileds Dispensaries Ltd. and more recently the George Town Dispensary. Mr W. Cecil Payne, managing director of the Times of Malaya and a member of the Institute of Incorporated Accountants, had offices in Chung Thye Phin's buildings.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ipoh: The Town That Tin Built, a Review of the History, Progress and Development of Perak's Capital Published for the Ipoh Municipal Council by Phoenisc Communications, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from [[Phin Kee Chan]] (referred to by many other names, among them the Chung Thye Phin Building), he is also associated with his father's townhouse cum office in [[Penang]], [[Hye Kee Chan]], and with some other structures, like his country house on Dummond Hill in Taiping, Perak.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society By Malaysian Branch, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch, Singapore Published 1991, Vol. 3, pt. 2 comprises a monograph entitled: British Malaya, 1864-1867, by L.A.

His villa in the heart of Ipoh, was bought by Foo Yet Kai who later allowed its conversion, free of rent, to a private hospital, then known as Our Lady’s Hospital. It was administered by the Sisters of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood from April 1964 to Jan 1983 but has now been taken over by The Kinta Medical Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Patriarch well known for his generosity published in The Star, 7 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chung Thye Phin Mansion at Gurney Drive on Penang island (the address at the time was No 2 Kelawai Road) with its subterranean passageways and chambers was, after his death, sold and turned into a hotel (The Shanghai Hotel) in the late 1930s but was later demolished in 1964 and on its footprint now stands an imposing condominium (1 Gurney Drive). Author Queeny Chang gives an extensive description of the place and her experience of it in her autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Page 50, Memories of a Nonya By Queeny Chang Published by Eastern Universities Press, 1981 {{ISBN|9971-71-145-1}}, {{ISBN|978-9971-71-145-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malaya: 500 Early Postcards (288 pages) by Cheah Jin Seng, Published by Editions Didier Millet, 2008, {{ISBN|981-4155-98-5}}, {{ISBN|978-981-4155-98-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time it served to house a club for German U-boatmen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=66M7_MbsTlAC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=%22shanghai%20hotel%22%20penang&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=%22shanghai%20hotel%22%20penang&amp;f=false Shooting the War By Otto Giese, James E.

He designed [[Relau]] Villa (also on Penang island), his holiday resort with a swimming pool ringed by private and other types of rooms. Its derelict structure can still be seen and explored at Taman Metropolitan, Relau in Penang, today. According to family history Kapitan Chung Thye Phin was inspired by the artistic canals of Venice and the enchanting ponds and lakes of China when he designed the swimming-pool, which was constructed by Mr. B. H. Ung (Ung Ban Hoe was attached to the architectural firm of Stark &amp; McNeil), the first Chinese architect who introduced reinforced concrete buildings to the community, notably the Ban Hin Lee Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.razcollection.com/urbex/photo_relau.htm Urban exploration - Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CS Wong - Gallery  of Chinese Kapitans&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spi.com.sg/forum/viewtopic.php?t%3D12574 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420161450/http://spi.com.sg/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12574 |archivedate=20 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commentary by his grand daughter, Oola goes, "Chung Thye Phin had many residences, some of them mansions, in Penang, Ipoh and Taiping. His residence in what is now Persiaran Gurney was the most famous, with its grand entertaining rooms and undersea wing. It was built before there was a Persiaran Gurney or a Gurney Drive, and was therefore right on the shore. His largest residence in Ipoh was in a street that carried his name (and still does). This mansion now serves as a hospital. He built a summer house on a large estate near Relau and surrounded it with gardens, orchards and fish ponds. However its most striking feature was the fact that it was built around a swimming pool (the first in Penang) in the Roman tradition. This house still exists in its ruined state, now surrounded by high rise 21st century flats. There are indeed many stories to be told about Chung Thye Phin."

He also had property on Penang Hill, as was the way with the rich in those days. His was a bungalow named, simply, "Highlands".

Several articles have been published, mentioning these properties and erroneously attributing them to Thye Phin's father, Chung Keng Quee who died in 1901, well before any of these were built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/10/13/nation/19164667&amp;sec=nation Mysteries of dilapidated mansion By K.

== The Traveller ==
A widely travelled Malayan, Kapitan Chung Thye Phin had gone round the world on many a business-cum-pleasure trip. On one occasion, he undertook a perilous trip up the scenic gorges of the Yangtze River at Chungking, China, thus earning for himself the distinction of being the first non-China-born Chinese to have made the venture. It was here that he was enraptured by Nature's inimitable splendour.

== A Road In His Honour ==
In Perak he was honoured with roads named after him. Jalan Chung Thye Phin in Ipoh borders the Kinta Medical Centre. This location is appropriate - the Centre, a private hospital under the administration of the Foo Yet Kai foundation, was formerly the family mansion of Chung Thye Phin. There is another road of the same name also named in his honour in his birthplace of Taiping.

== Well Connected ==
Chung Thye Phin rubbed shoulders with the rich and powerful including Sultan Iskandar Shah of Perak, a polo lover. A photograph in the National Archives shows him sitting next to the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;Group photograph, Ipoh, Perak; 1927, Seated, seventh from left to right : Raja Chulan ; Raja Muda Abdul Aziz; Capitan China Chung Thye Phin; His Highness Sultan Iskandar Shah.

He was among the group of Chinese [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]]s who presented the address to King George V when he visited Singapore in 1901 as Duke of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;F.M.S.

In February 1907 When the Duke and the Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia paid an official visit to Penang in Feb. 1907, they were driven by Kapitan Chung Thye Phin in his own private car.&lt;ref&gt;Kajian Malaysia: Journal of Malaysian studies - Page 53, A gallery of Chinese kapitans - Page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 5 February 1907, Page 6 -- THE ROYAL TOUR. DUKE OF CONNAUGHT IN PENANG. His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught visited Penang for the second time on Wednesday last. On the occasion of his first visit -- on 23 March 1890 -- his steamer was delayed and did not arrive till after sunset. The Duke was then, therefore, unable to see much of the town in the dark. However, yesterday he was more fortunate. He P. and O. Royal mail steamer Delhi, flying the Duke's flag, with Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patricia on board, anchored near Swettenham Wharf at halfpast three o'clock in the afternoon. The Hon. [[Robert Norman Bland|R. N. Bland]], Acting Resident Councillor, accompanied by Lieut-Colonel R.F.S. Walker, Commandant Malay States Guides, and Captain H. W. D. Adams, Officer Commanding the Penang Detachment of the Malay States Guides, went on board the s.s.s Delhi to receive His Royal Highness's orders. At a quarter to four o'clock the Colonial launch Rosebud came alongside Victoria Pier. T.R.H. the Duke and Duchess of Connaught landed informally, accompanied by Princess Patricia, Miss Pelly (Lady-in-waiting), Brigadier-General Sir John Maxwell, Staff Officer, and Lieut. the Hon. M. Ponsonby, Grenadier Guards (aide-de-ca,p). Commander D.C. Macintyre, R.N.R., Harbour Master, was then introduced by Mr. Bland to the Duke and Duchess. Messrs. Chung Thye Phin, C. E. Paterson, W. H. Rose, and A. Bowers Smith kindly placed their motor cars at the disposal of the Resident Councillor and themselves acted as chauffeurs. The Suke and Duchess, with Mr. Bland and Lieut, Ponsonby, took their seats in the car of Mr. Chung Thye Phin. In the second car were Princess Patricia, Miss Pelly, Colonel Walker, and Mr. Paterson, Brigadier-General Sir john Maxwell accompanied Mr. W. H. Rose in the third car; and Captain Adam and Mr. A. Bowers Smith followed in the fourth motor-car. The route taken was along Downing Street into Beach Street, Light Street, Farquhar Street, Northam Road, Larut Road, Anson Road, Macalister Road, Barrack Road, Residency Road, and Western Road, into Waterfall Road to the Chetty Temple. The Tai-Pusum Festival now celebrated, the Temple was seen at its best. The Chetties met the Royal Party on their arrival at the Temple, where the unusual visit of His Majesty the King's brother was heralded with the sounds of many trumpets and drums. The distinguished visitors were conducted through the temple, decked with gralands, and presented with limes, etc., in accordance with the Chetties' usual method of showing their hospitality. Princess Patricia and Miss Pelly, who carried hand cameras, took numerous snapshots, the Princess photographing a group of Chetties drawn up outside the temple. On coming out of the Temple, the Duke addressed a few words to one of thee Sikh policemen in the latter's own language. The Royal party then resumed their drive and proceeded to the Waterfall Gardens, subsequently being driven to the Residency, which was reached at five o'clock, for tea. Shortly after six o'clock the Royal party returned by the same route to Victoria Pier, where the four gentlemen who had given the use of their motor cars -- Messrs. W. H. Rose, A. Bowers Smith, C.E. Paterson, and Chung Thye Phin -- were introduced to the Royal Visitors. Their Royal Highnesses thereafter went on board the Delhi at 6.30p.m., the vessel sailing for Singapore half-an-hour later. Notwithstanding the crowds of people at Victoria Pier and the Chetty Temple, excellent order was maintained by the Police, under the direction of Mr. H. O. Newland, the Chief Police Officer, who travelled to and from the Temple in another motor car. -- (Pinang Gazette).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 he feted Sir [[Ernest Woodford Birch]] at his Ipoh residence having invited all the old residents of Perak, European and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;

Sir Ernest Birch was entertained Tuesday afternoon by the Chinese of Perak at the residence of Mr. Chung Thye Phin in Ipoh. Invitations had been issued to all old residents of Perak, European and Chinese, to meet Sir Ernest and the response demonstrated the...&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chung, Thye Phin and Eu, Tong Sen ==
[[Eu Tong Sen]] and Chung Thye Phin were "blood" brothers. They went through Chinese ceremony to become "Keet Bye Heng Tai". When Chung Thye Phin travelled to Hong Kong, he stayed in Eu Tong Sen's villa there and they kept an account of his expenses in the company's account books. Eu Tong Sen's villa in HK was called "Eucliff". It has been torn down. It was built at Repulse Bay, HK, overlooking the sea. The property was huge. It was built with stone like a castle. It included within its walled area a tennis court and also a swimming pool.

Eu Tong Sen and Chung Thye Phin had common interests – motorcars, racehorses, country houses, etc. 1903 when the Ipoh Gymkhana Club was founded, both of them decided to enter their thoroughbreds regularly in the Ipoh races. They jointly built a weekend retreat, "Forest Lodge", at Gopeng Road with a large stable. In April 1912 Eu Tong Sen was appointed the permanent Chinese Member of the Federal Council, the seat having fallen vacant on the demise of [[Leong Fee]]. Chung Thye Phin sold his half-share to Eu Tong Sen who desired grander accommodations following the latter's elevation in status. Chung Thye Phin in turn bought Drummond’s Hill in Taiping, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate and the former Residency of Sir [[Hugh Low]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipohecho.com.my/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=59 Ipoh Echo]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, together with Chung Thye Phin he built a large Chinese theatre in the important mining town of Kampar near Ipoh.&lt;ref name="arnold"/&gt;

Chung, Thye Phin's Penang firms served as the agent for Eu, Tong Sen in Penang before he (Eu) opened a branch on the island. Eu Tong Sen's Penang branch, at least according to business directories, was the latest in his branch office network. It seemed to have opened only in  1920.

==Education and Official Appointments==

== Quotations ==
Mr. Chung Thye Phin, M.C. (owner of mines in Gopeng, Taiping, and Tronoh districts): "I do not look for any general expansion of the industry. We are now greatly troubled with our coolies, who are independent and desert freely. In view of these labour troubles, I have installed tramming services where possible, and lengthened the working day."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/malaytinfieldsmi00stokrich/malaytinfieldsmi00stokrich.pdf Malay tin-fields; mining position broadly reviewed (1906) by Stokes, Ralph S.

'''Collins Aerospace''', a [[United Technologies]] subsidiary, is one of the world’s largest suppliers of aerospace and defense products, headquartered in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

== History ==

UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS) was formed in August 2012 when parent [[United Technologies Corporation]] merged their existing subsidiary [[Hamilton Sundstrand]] with the newly acquired [[Goodrich Corporation]].

On 26 November 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its [[Rockwell Collins]] acquisition, after which it merged its newly acquired business with UTC Aerospace Systems to form Collins Aerospace. The new company reported $23 billion of combined sales in 2017 and is composed of 70,000 employees.&lt;ref name=UTC26nov2018&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.utc.com/News/News-Center/Pages/United-Technologies-Announces-Intention-to-Separate-Into-Three-Independent-Compan.aspx |title= United Technologies [...] Completes Acquisition of Rockwell Collins |date= November 26, 2018 |publisher= United Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Collins Aerospace is engaged in designing, manufacturing and servicing systems and components for commercial, regional, business and military aircraft, helicopters and other platforms. Collins Aerospace is also a major supplier to international space programs.

Collins Aerospace has two main segments: Aircraft Systems and Power, Control &amp; Sensing Systems. These segments are then broken down into several business units.

The Aircraft Systems consists of Actuation &amp; Propeller Systems, Aerostructures, Air Management Systems, Interiors, and Landing Systems (formerly Landing Gear and Wheels and Brakes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://utcaerospacesystems.com/about/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128131649/http://utcaerospacesystems.com/about/ |date=January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power, Control &amp; Sensing Systems consists of Electric Systems, Engine Systems, ISR &amp; Space Systems, and Sensors &amp; Integrated Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utcaerospacesystems.com/Company/Pages/company.aspx |title=Our Company |publisher=UTC Aerospace Systems |date= |accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collins Aerospace is the owner of Ithaco Space Systems, Inc., formerly owned by [[Goodrich Company]]. Ithaco produced items for the field of satellite control since 1962, such as Earth sensors, [[Reaction wheel|reaction/momentum wheels]], magnetometers and magnetic torquers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attitude Control|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1997/t2.html|publisher=NASA Spinoff|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to over 100 U.S. satellites, equipment made by Ithaco flew on Japanese, Canadian, French, German, Spanish, Swedish, and Argentinean spacecraft. Ithaco became notable for having manufactured the reaction wheels of the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler spacecraft]], the [[Hayabusa|Hayabusa spacecraft]], the Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite and the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]], which developed problems or even failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title=The wheels come off Kepler|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-wheels-come-off-kepler-1.13032|publisher=Nature.com|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ROSAT]] reaction wheels lasted over 8 years. Collins Aerospace announced in August 2012 layoffs at Ithaco Space Systems due to Ithaco having been "focused on space programs that have recently seen slower growth", and further layoffs at former Hamilton Sundstrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Layoffs At UTC Aerospace Systems — Former Hamilton Sunstrand|url=http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2012/08/23/layoffs-at-utc-aerospace-systems-former-hamilton-sunstrand/|publisher=CBS Connecticut|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1165">The '''Committee on Accounting Procedure''' (CAP) was the first private sector organization that had the task of setting accounting standards in the United States. It was a committee run by the American Institute of Accountants (now known as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]).&lt;ref&gt;Spiceland, David; Sepe, James; Nelson, Mark; &amp; Tomassini, Lawrence (2009). ''Intermediate Accounting'' (5th Edition). [[McGraw Hill|McGraw-Hill/Irwin]]. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-07-352687-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; CAP is the predecessor of the [[Accounting Principles Board]], itself a predecessor to the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]]. Its formation and activities were early efforts to rationalize and legitimize the reporting of business performance. However, it is widely regarded as having failed.

[[George O. May]] was vice chairman of the committee from 1937 to 1945.[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/george-oliver-may/]

The committee published [[Accounting Research Bulletins]].

The '''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe''' was an international aeronautical speed competition instituted on 25 August 1909 by the French oil magnate [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]]. The race was reinstated three times through the years at the initiative of the [[Aéro-Club de France]], and later by  Deutsch de la Meurthe's widow Suzanne.

==First Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
Announced in 1906, the first Deutsch de la Meurthe competition was a speed trial intended for all powered aircraft over a distance of 200 kilometres, to be flown as an outward leg of 100 km followed by a return to the starting point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551284g/f7.image.r=Deutsch%20de%20la%20Meurthe Bulletin Officiel de l'Aėro-Club de France] [[l'Aėrophile]], March 1906, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; The flight had to be made between  1 March and  31 October, and the performance was recognized only if the previous best performance was surpassed by at least 10%. A bonus of 20,000 [[French franc|francs]] was awarded each year for the best performance that had remained unsurpassed for eight months. The Coupe (cup), an objet d'art valued at 10,000 francs, was to be given to the first aircraft builder who won three consecutive competitions.&lt;ref name=flight1919&gt;{{cite |journal=Flight |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201366.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de l a Meurthe |volume=XI |number=564|date=16 October 1919 |page= 1368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===1912 competition===
Despite the substantial prize being offered, it took six years to attract participants. On 12 April 1912, [[Maurice Tabuteau]] piloting a 50&amp;nbsp;hp [[Gnome et Rhône|Gnome]]-powered [[Morane-Saulnier]] monoplane flew the circuit in 1 h 47 min 48 s, despite persistent navigation problems caused by fog. On 1 May 1912 Parisian Emmanuel Hélen completed the course at {{convert|119.532|kph|mph|abbr=on}} flying a 70&amp;nbsp;hp Gnome-powered [[Nieuport]] monoplane. Since no other pilot bettered this performance by more than 10% before 31 October 1912, Hélen became the first holder of the Coupe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200317.html Flight, 5 May 1921, p. 317]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1913 competition===
On 27 October 1913 [[Eugène Gilbert]] gained first place in the second competition for the Coupe, covering the course at an average speed of {{convert|154.38|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in a 160 h.p. Gnome-powered [[Deperdussin Monocoque]].

===1919/1920 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage 29V racer.jpg|thumb|Nieuport-Delage NiD.29V racer]]
The competition was interrupted by the [[World War I|First World War]], but on 13 October 1919 it resumed using the same course, but the competition was now open for the entire year, and the trophy would be definitely kept by the first participant whose time remained unbeaten for eight consecutive months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201390.html Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'' 23 October 1919&lt;/ref&gt; Four aeroplanes participated in this trial: a 180&amp;nbsp;hp [[Hispano-Suiza]]-powered [[Gourdou-Leseurre]] monoplane piloted by Rost, a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]]-Herbemont piloted by [[Joseph Sadi-Lecointe]], a 300&amp;nbsp;hp Hispano-Suiza-powered Nieuport biplane piloted by [[Bernard Barny de Romanet]], and a 180&amp;nbsp;hp Le Rhöne-powered Nieuport monoplane designed by engineer Mary, and flown by the Danish pilot [[Leth Jensen]]. Taking off on 13 October 1919, Jensen flew the circuit at an average speed of 200.001&amp;nbsp;km/h (57 minutes). The next day, Rost reached an average speed of 210&amp;nbsp;km/h while de Romanet had an aircraft failure. On 15 October, Sadi-Lecointe flew a first circuit at 223&amp;nbsp;km/h, and then a second lap at 246.9&amp;nbsp;km/h and thus became the title holder. On 21 October 1919, de Romanet reached an average speed of 268.631&amp;nbsp;km/h which was insufficient to be homologated, because this performance was less than 110% of Sadi-Lecointe's performance. He followed it the next day with an average speed of 285.600 km/h which did count. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1919/1919%20-%201420.html "The Coupe Deutsch"] ''Flight'' 30 October 1919 p1422&lt;/ref&gt; Bad weather then stopped the competition, which was resumed just three months later. On 3 January 1920, Sadi-Lecointe, who had in the meanwhile had left [[Blériot-SPAD]] for Nieuport, reached {{convert|266.314|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;"The Deutsch Cup Contest" ''Flight'' 8 January 1920 p56&lt;/ref&gt;  with a Hispano-engined [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]]V. On 3 August 1920, he became the holder of the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe, his performance having remained unbeaten.

==Second Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1920, following the ending of the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] competition due to a third consecutive French victory, the Aéro-Club de France decided to organize a new competition to replace it. This was named ''Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe'' to honour [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]], who had died on 24 November 1919; the competition was funded by his family.

It remained a speed competition, but was now to be held on a given date. The competition was to be held as 3 laps of a 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) circuit, with its start at [[Étampes]] and a turn made at la Marmogne farm at [[Gidy]]. The competition was open for three years and was international, with each country allowed three entrants. A sum of 60,000 francs was to be awarded each year for the best performance, and a cup valued at 20,000 francs given to the winner. In the case of the cup being won outright before the end of the competition, the winner would also received the remaining prize money&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200327.html |title=Coupe Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal=Flight |date=12 May 1921 |page=327 |format=pdf |number=645 |volume=XIII)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1921 competition===
[[File:Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan.jpg|thumb|Nieuport NiD.41 Sesquiplan]]
There were seven participants in this race, which was held on 1 October. No eliminating heats were needed to select from the five French pilot entrants, since Count [[Bernard Barny de Romanet|Bernard de Romanet]] died when the wing fabric of his Lumière-De Monge monoplane&lt;ref group=note&gt;The aircraft could be configured as either a biplane or a monoplane.&lt;/ref&gt; detached at high speed during the elimination trials on 23 September, and at the last moment [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] withdrew their entrant, the Hanriot HD.22. This was a metal monoplane with retractable landing gear expressly built for the race, and which had been intended to be piloted by Rost. Nieuport entered two [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29|Nieuport NiD.29V]]s  piloted by Sadi-Lecointe and Ferdinand Lasne, and a [[Nieuport-Delage Sesquiplan|NiD.41 Sesquiplan]] was entrusted to Georges Kirsch. A 700&amp;nbsp;hp Fiat-powered [[Fiat Aviazione|Fiat]] biplane piloted by [[Francesco Brack Papa]] represented Italy, and British pilot Herbert James flew a 450&amp;nbsp;hp [[Napier Lion]]-powered [[Nieuport Nighthawk|Gloster Mars I]] (G-EAXZ).&lt;ref name=flight1921&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1921/1921%20-%200650.html The Coupe de Deutsch de la Meurthe] ''Flight'', 29 September 1921, pp. 650-651]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;
A broken propeller forced Sadi-Lecointe to make a forced landing in a beet field at Cernonville, injuring an eye and both legs in the process. The wing fabric of James' aeroplane was torn away, and he had to make a forced landing. Brach Papa established a new Italian speed record, but the engine exploded before the finish. Thus, only two Nieuport pilots were left to finish the race, Georges Kirsch winning with a speed of 282.75&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new world speed record for a distance of 300&amp;nbsp;km); Fernand Lasne's speed was 259.03&amp;nbsp;km/h.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

===1922 competition===
The 1921 circuit remained unchanged for the 1922 competition, which was held on 30 September. Nieuport-Astra&lt;ref group=note&gt;Nieuport having taken over the [[Société Astra]] by this point&lt;/ref&gt; entered a Nieuport NiD.29V piloted by Lasne and the sesquiplane piloted by Sadi-Lecointe, [[Jean Casale]] was piloting a Blériot-SPAD S.58, a design based on the [[Blériot-SPAD S.41|S.41 fighter]]. Fiat and Gloster were presenting the same machines and pilots as the preceding year. Assigned to their factory pilot Berthelin, who was new to this competition, the NiD.41 was retired at the last moment. The [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] Simplex aircraft which was supposed to be piloted by [[Georges Madon]] had an accident during its tests, and [[Charles Nungesser]] was absent.&lt;ref name=flight1922&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200573.html |title=The race for the Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe |journal= Flight |date=5 October 1922 |pages=573-576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;
In his Nieuport sesquiplane named ''Eugène Gilbert'' (race number 5), Sadi-Lecointe covered the first 100&amp;nbsp;km at an average speed of 325&amp;nbsp;km/h (a new closed circuit speed record), but a spark plug popped out of its cylinder and passed through the engine cowling as he was turning around the airport pylon. The pilot was therefore forced to land, and the airplane hit a gutter which turned the aircraft on its back without injuring the pilot. James lost his maps during his flight and unable to find the turning point returned to the start. Jean Casale's SPAD S.58 ''Louis Blériot'' (race no.3) was victim of a radiator leak, and made a forced landing at Étampes and was unable to finish the race, as was also the case for Brack-Papa's [[Fiat B.R.|Fiat R.700]] which had a fuel pump failure.{{cn|date=September 2015}} The first lap made by the Italian pilot at 288&amp;nbsp;km/h (179&amp;nbsp;mph) was not homologated since the aircraft had flown behind the time-keepers at the starting point, but he was offered a second attempt. Brack-Papa started a second time but retired when he realized he would not be able to beat Lasne, ) who won the competition with an average speed of 289.90&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name=flight1922/&gt;

==Third Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
In 1931 Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe initiated a new competition for the Coupe, which was contested for the first time on 29 May 1933. The trial was to be run in two 1,000&amp;nbsp;km stages separated by a 90 minutes refuelling stop, and was limited to aircraft with an engine capacity of less than eight litres. The starting point of the race was still at Étampes. Suzanne Deutsch de la Meurthe was offering one million Francs, and the Ministère de l'Air (Air Ministry) offered another three million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1932/1932%20-%200422.html Flight, 6 May 1932, p. 390]&lt;/ref&gt;
===1933 competition===
[[File:Potez 53 Musee du Bourget P1010709.JPG|thumb|A Potez 53]]
On 24 May 1933 Captain [[Ludovic Arrachart]] was killed when his [[Caudron C.362|Caudron C.360]] (race no.11) crashed due to engine failure at Maisons near [[Chartres]] while he was training for the competition.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[l'Aérophile]]|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65535525/f6.image.r=caudron|date=June 1933|page=166|title=La Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was won by Georges Détré flying a [[Potez 53]] powered by a Potez 9B radial engine developing barely 310&amp;nbsp;hp at full power at a speed of {{convert|322.81|kph|mph}},  beating Raymond Delmotte's Caudron C.362 (race no.6) with a speed of {{convert|291.12|kph|mph}}, and also beating the only foreign competitor, [[Nick Comper]] flying [[Comper Swift]] ''G-ABWW'' {{convert|239.58|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; A third French competitor, test pilot Lemoine also flying a Potez 53, was forced to abandon the race.&lt;ref name=flight1934-510&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200510.html Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 competition===
[[File:Caudron 460 Le Bourget 2009.jpg|thumb|A Caudron C.460 replica]]
[[File:GMars.jpg|thumb|Gloster Mars I (G-EAXZ)]]
On 27 May 1934, the race was a duel between the Caudron pilots, the [[Caudron]] firm presenting two racing aircraft designed by [[Marcel Riffard]]. [[Maurice Arnoux]] won with a C.450 at a speed of 388.97&amp;nbsp;km/h overtaking Louis Massotte's [[Régnier Motor Company|Regnier]]-engined (and sponsored) C.366 (360.72&amp;nbsp;km/h) and Albert Monville's Renault-engined [[Caudron C.460]] (341.04&amp;nbsp;km/h). Nick Comper flew the [[Comper Streak]] (G-ACNC), but retired on the 6th lap of the afternoon session as problem with the undercarriage limited his speed. Georges Detre flying a [[Potez 53]]-2 retired after problems with his engine oil supply. The [[Potez 53]]-3 had problems with its variable pitch propeller and was unable to start for the second section,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1971, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=flight1934-510/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/flightpdfarchive/view/1933/1933%20-%200976.html Flight, 9 Nov 1933, p. 976]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200480.html Flight, 17 May 1934, pp. 476, 480-481]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1934/1934%20-%200531.html Flight, 31 May 1934, pp. 531-532]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 competition===
The 1935 race was arguably the most exciting{{cn|date=September 2015}} competition of them all, and was the consecration of the Caudron-Renault racers. Eight pilots were registered for this event, but the [[Nennig C-3]] (race no.4) of [[Guy Bart]] was not ready, and the Régnier Martinet, a modified Caudron C.366, (race no.2) was damaged during its tests. Two Caudron C.560s were supposed to participate (race no.1 and 3), but were not ready. They were thus replaced by a [[Caudron C.430]] and a C.450 with the same race numbers.&lt;ref name=flight1935&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1935/1935%20-%201324.html "A Family Affair"] ''Flight'', 30 May 1935, p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;

The course was over 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;miles), from [[Etampes]] aerodrome to [[Chartres]] [[Boncé|Bonce]] and back. The race itself was in two stages, each of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km (625&amp;nbsp;miles).

Charles Franco was the first to take off in Caudron C.430 (race no.1), but abandoned the race on the fourth lap as he was clearly out-classed by the other aircraft. It was followed by the Caudron C.460s of [[Yves Lacombe]] (race no.5), [[Raymond Delmotte]] (Caudron's chief pilot) (race no.8 ), and [[Maurice Arnoux]] (race no.6) respectively, this last entrant having to quit the race after seven laps, having run out of oil after a high-speed lap at {{convert|469|km/h|abbr=on}}. [[Albert Monville]]'s Caudron C.450 (race no.3) was the last to take off. Only three aircraft qualified for the second part of the race, which was held during rain showers. Raymond Delmotte won, ahead of Yves Lacombe and Maurice Arnoux, flying the aircraft previously flown by Albert Monville .&lt;ref name=flight1935/&gt;

==Fourth Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe==
On 13 September 1936, a last competition was organized, in which two [[Caudron C.461]]s, one Caudron C.450 and two [[Caudron C.560]]s took part. Yves Lacombe won this race with a speed of only {{convert|389.462|km/h|abbr=on}}, overtaking Maurice Arnoux timed at {{convert|369.59|km/h|abbr=on}}, a performance barely superior to what had been established in 1934, probably because of bad engine tuning in a competition presenting no real challenge for the engine and aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%202782.html ''Flight'', 15 October 1936, p. 387]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source does not mention anything save Lacombe won|date=September 2015}}

'''''Disclosure''''' is a 1994 American [[erotic thriller]] film directed by [[Barry Levinson]], starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]]. It is based on [[Michael Crichton]]'s [[Disclosure (novel)|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Douglas, Moore Star in Adaptation of Crichton's Novel on Harassment Reversal|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-09/entertainment/ca-14310_1_michael-crichton|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast also includes [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Rosemary Forsyth]] and [[Dennis Miller]]. The film is a combination thriller and slight mystery in an office setting within the computer industry in the mid-1990s. The main focus of the story, from which the film and book take their titles, is the issue of [[sexual harassment]] and its power structure.

==Plot==
Bob Garvin, a technology company founder, plans to retire when his company [[mergers and acquisitions|merges]] with a larger company. Production line manager Tom Sanders expects to be promoted to run the [[CD-ROM]] division. Instead, Meredith Johnson, a former girlfriend of Tom's, is promoted to the post. Meredith calls Tom into her office to discuss some operations, then sexually forces herself onto him. He initially reciprocates, then rebuffs her. Meredith, angry, screams a threat for spurning her.

The next day, Meredith has filed a [[sexual harassment]] complaint against Tom with legal counsel Philip Blackburn. To save the merger from a scandal, DigiCom officials demand that Tom accept reassignment to another location. Otherwise, he will lose his stock options in the new company. His career will be ruined, however, as the other location is scheduled for sale after the merger, leaving Tom jobless.

Tom receives an anonymous e-mail from, "A Friend", that directs him to Seattle attorney Catherine Alvarez, who specializes in sexual harassment cases. Tom decides to sue DigiCom, alleging that it was Meredith who harassed him. The initial mediation goes badly for Tom as a tearful Meredith blames him.

Garvin proposes that if Tom drops the matter, he will not have to transfer, causing Tom to suspect that Meredith's accusations are vulnerable. Tom remembers mis-dialing a number on his cell phone during the encounter with Meredith but not hanging up. This inadvertently left a recording of the incident on a colleague's voicemail. Tom plays the recording at the next meeting and discredits Meredith. DigiCom agrees to a settlement calling for Meredith to quietly be eased out following the merger.

As Tom celebrates his apparent victory, he receives another e-mail from "A Friend" warning that all is not what it seems. Tom overhears Meredith telling Philip that even though the harassment accusation attempt failed, they will make Tom look incompetent at the next morning's merger conference. If the problems with the CD-ROMs are shown as coming from the production line, which is under Tom's responsibility, he can be fired for cause.

Tom attempts to look for clues in the company database, but his access privileges have been revoked. He remembers that the merging company's executives have a [[virtual reality]] demonstration machine that has access to company databases. As he gets into DigiCom's files, he sees Meredith is deleting them. Tom receives a call from a Malaysian colleague who gets Tom copies of incriminating memos and videos. They show that Meredith and the head of operations in Malyasia were conspiring to change the plans and specifications that Tom implemented to sabotage the CD-ROMs in order to harm Tom's career.

When Tom makes his presentation at the conference and Meredith brings up the production problems, he shows the memos and a video exposing her involvement in causing defects with the hardware. Meredith says that Tom is mounting a last-ditch effort of revenge on her.

Meredith is fired by Garvin who passes over Tom and names Stephanie Kaplan to the post. Tom is disappointed but pleased that his colleague. Tom asks Stephanie's son, Spencer, if he knows "A Friend". Spencer says he is Arthur Friend's research assistant at the University of Washington. Tom realizes that Spencer accessed Friend's office computer, meaning Stephanie (via her son) is likely the "friend" who helped him. Satisfied, Tom returns to his position at the production division.

==Production==
[[Michael Crichton]] sold the movie rights for $1 million before the novel was published. [[Miloš Forman]] was originally attached to direct but left due to creative differences with Crichton. [[Barry Levinson]] and [[Alan J. Pakula]] were in contention to take the helm and Levinson was hired.

[[Annette Bening]] was originally set to play Meredith until she became pregnant and soon dropped out. [[Geena Davis]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] were then considered before Levinson decided to cast [[Demi Moore]]. Crichton wrote the character Mark Lewyn for the film specifically with [[Dennis Miller]] in mind. The character from the book was somewhat modified for the screenplay to fit Miller's personality.

The virtual reality corridor sequence was designed by [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;''Disclosure'' DVD (2000). Production notes. [[Warner Home Video]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filming locations==
The movie was filmed in and around [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The fictional corporation DigiCom is located in [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]], on a set which was constructed for the film. Production designer Neil Spisak said, "DigiCom needed to have a hard edge to it, with lots of glass and a modern look juxtaposed against the old red brick which is indigenous to the Pioneer Square area of Seattle. Barry liked the idea of using glass so that wherever you looked you'd see workers in their offices or stopping to chat. This seemed to fit the ominous sense that Barry was looking for, a sort of ''[[Rear Window]]'' effect, where you're looking across at people in their private spaces."&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt;

Also shown are the [[Washington State Ferries]] because Douglas' character lives on [[Bainbridge Island]]. Other locations include [[Washington Park Arboretum]], [[Volunteer Park (Seattle)|Volunteer Park]], the [[Four Seasons Hotel]] on University St., [[Pike Place Market]] and [[Smith Tower]] (Alvarez's law office).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattle.gov/filmoffice/filmmap.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The director of photography was British cinematographer [[Tony Pierce-Roberts]].

==Soundtrack==
The score of ''Disclosure'' was composed, orchestrated and conducted by [[Ennio Morricone]]. ''Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from the Film Disclosure'' was released by [[Virgin Records]] on January 24, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Disclosure-1994-Film-Ennio-Morricone/dp/B000000W7D|title=Amazon.com: Disclosure (1994 Film): Music|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critic [[Roger Ebert]] called the film "basically a launch pad for sex scenes" and gave it only two stars out of a possible four. On the other hand, Ian Nathan of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine called it "genuinely gripping", further stating that "[[Demi Moore]] makes an awesome [[femme fatale]]." It currently has a rating of 58% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 59 reviews.

''Disclosure'' was a soaring financial success, grossing $214 million worldwide ($83 million in U.S. and Canadian ticket sales and $131 million in other territories), against a budget of about $55 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office Disclosure' Is Hot on a Slow Weekend |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-13/entertainment/ca-8547_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Disclosure' Edges Out 'Santa' at the Box Office Movies: Much-hyped sexual-harassment drama pushes aside the Tim Allen heavyweight. |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-12/entertainment/ca-8096_1_tim-allen|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of director [[Barry Levinson]]'s most successful films after his initial successes with ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' and ''[[Rain Man]]''.

In a review, [[Nathan Rabin]] described the film as superior to its source novel: "If there were an Academy Award for Best Screen Adaptation Of A Screamingly Awful, Viciously Sexist Novel, ''Disclosure'' would triumph. The film takes a preachy, disingenuous, and poorly written [[wikt:jeremiad|jeremiad]] against sexually aggressive women and turns it into a sleek, sexy, and only moderately sexist piece of Hollywood entertainment."&lt;ref name="nr"&gt;[http://thedissolve.com/features/forgotbusters/92-forgotbusters-disclosure/ Disclosure] Nathan Rabin, ''The Dissolve'', August 16, 2013. Retrieved February 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabin also argued, however, that ultimately the film's cast and crew could only "elevate the film to the level of sleek mediocrity."&lt;ref name="nr"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">{{short description|International minimum standard for a person professionally leading a group of certified recreational divers}}
'''Dive leader''' describes the minimum requirements for dive leader training and certification for [[Recreational diving|recreational scuba divers]] in international standard ISO 24801-3 &lt;ref name=" ISO24801-3" /&gt; and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-3. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the dive leader standard.

Scuba dive leaders are considered competent to plan, organise and conduct dives and to lead other recreational divers on open water dives, and for specialised recreational scuba diving activities for which they have been trained. They are also considered competent to conduct emergency procedures associated with these activities and the relevant diving environment. They may require orientation for unfamiliar local environmental conditions. Additional specialised training and experience is required to lead divers on more demanding dives.&lt;ref name="EUF certification" /&gt;

The term is also used by BSAC for a specific certification.&lt;ref name="BSAC dive leader"/&gt;

==Scope of the standard==
International standard ISO 24801-3 includes:&lt;ref name=" ISO24801-3" /&gt;
*Prerequisites for training, including age and health requirements,
*Required theoretical knowledge regarding scuba and basic diving equipment, the basic physics of diving, decompression management and dive planning, medical and psychological problems related to diving, the diving environment and the use of nitrox breathing gases,
*Required scuba skills in confined and open water,
*Practical training parameters,
*Evaluation of knowledge and practical skills.

==Training according to ISO 24801-3==
Diver qualifications which comply with ISO 24801-3

==Medical fitness to dive==
{{main|Fitness to dive}}
Before initial diver training and thereafter at regular intervals, a diver should undergo a [[fitness to dive]] examination by a diving doctor. This may be considered more important for a dive leader who has a duty of care to their clients. In some countries, such an examination is required by law and it is a prerequisite for any training in many diving schools.

[[File:Downtownhaywardcitycenter.jpg|thumb|Downtown Hayward, looking south on Foothill Boulevard, with the [[City Center Building]] (left)]]
'''Downtown Hayward''' is the original and current [[central business district]] of [[Hayward, California]], [[United States]], and is home to the current [[Hayward City Hall]], along with the two previous city halls, [[Alex Giualini Plaza]] and the [[City Center Building]]. The [[Hayward Fault]] runs through the area, and is the cause of the two previous city halls being taken out of use.

The boundaries are Third Street to the east, Grand Street and [[Hayward (BART station)|Hayward BART]] to the west, [[California State Route 92|Jackson Street]] and E Street to the south, and City Center Drive/Hazel Avenue to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/SPECIAL-PROJECTS-&amp;-STUDIES/dpu/img/plan_area.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907122147/http://www.hayward-ca.gov/CITY-GOVERNMENT/SPECIAL-PROJECTS-%26-STUDIES/dpu/img/plan_area.JPG |archivedate=2013-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foothill Boulevard was known as "The Golden Strip", a retail business corridor that was built in the 1950s, and housed [[The Emporium, San Francisco|Capwell's]] and [[I. Magnin]] department stores. The street lost businesses after the opening of [[Southland Mall (Hayward, California)|Southland Mall]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="insidebayarea1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_19616418 |title=Foothill Boulevard gateway getting face-lift in Hayward |publisher=Inside Bay Area |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parks include Newman Park and The Julio Bras Portuguese Park. [[San Lorenzo Creek]] runs through downtown. The Hayward Public Library is located there. "Hayward City Center" a mall and building complex located at the northern end of downtown, contains the [[City Center Building]], which served as the city's second city hall from 1969 to 1991, and is now an abandoned 11 story building, Hayward's tallest building, formerly the second tallest prior to [[California State University, East Bay]]'s [[Warren Hall]] demolition in 2013.

==Downtown districts==
Tulsa includes many structures built during the Oil Boom in the 1920s and 1930s, including [[Art Deco]] buildings such as the [[Mid-Continent Tower]], [[Boston Avenue Methodist Church]], and the Exchange Bank Building (today known as the [[320 South Boston Building]]). Oilman [[Waite Phillips]], left a significant architectural impact on downtown Tulsa through the [[Philtower Building|Philtower]] and Philcade buildings. Other notable Tulsa buildings include the [[Atlas Life Building]], [[Holy Family Cathedral in Tulsa|Holy Family Cathedral]], Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, and the [[Mayo Hotel]], the former of which once served as home to [[J. Paul Getty]]. Known for a time as "[[Terracotta|Terra Cotta]] City",&lt;ref&gt;Tulsa City-County Library, "Art Deco in Tulsa." Accessed August 22, 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114162424/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/research/artdeco/artdecointulsa.php |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tulsa hosted the International Sixth Congress on Art Deco in 2001.

Downtown Tulsa is in the northwest quadrant of the city and is ringed by an expressway system called the inner dispersal loop. Downtown's buildings include many large office towers. At {{convert|667|ft|m|abbr=on}}, the [[BOK Tower]] (formerly One Williams Center) was the tallest building in any of the 5 "plains states" ([[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]) until the [[Devon Tower]] in [[Oklahoma City]] was completed in 2012. The BOK Tower was designed in 1975 by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] &amp; Associates, the same architect who designed the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

The [[Tulsa Performing Arts Center]] occupies a half city block in Tulsa's historical downtown. The PAC is also the design of [[Minoru Yamasaki]]. It houses five theatres and a reception hall. More than a quarter of a million people visit the Center each year to attend a performance from one of Tulsa's seven acclaimed musical and dramatic companies including the [[Tulsa Ballet]], [[Tulsa Symphony Orchestra]], [[Tulsa Opera]], and a variety of symphonic groups. The PAC hosts a multitude of cultural events through the fall, winter and spring.

In 2005 the City of Tulsa broke ground on a 19,199 seat regional events center designed by [[architect]] [[César Pelli]]. The arena was named the [[BOK Center]] (or [[Bank of Oklahoma Center]]) and opened on August 30, 2008.

===Blue Dome District===
[[Image:BlueDome.jpg|thumb|left|The Blue Dome, a former Gulf Oil Service Station, built in 1924.]]

Another popular downtown entertainment district is the Blue Dome, named for a distinctive, domed building at Second Street and Elgin Avenue, in the area in the eastern section of downtown. The building was originally constructed in 1924 as a [[Gulf Oil]] service station. It has been converted to an information desk/office for the district, and is about two blocks south of the OneOK field.

The Blue Dome District is known for its local dining options, large art festival, and scenic Downtown Tulsa views. Every May, the Blue Dome Arts Festival allows families to enjoy local music and street vendors surrounding the historic dome. Further, there is no bad angle for pictures of Tulsa's infamous skyline in this district. With so many delicious restaurants and walkable views, it is no wonder that the Blue Dome District continues to bring its unique art scene to Tulsa. 

=== Deco District ===
Tulsa boasts one of the nation’s most extensive collections of Art Deco architecture, which is most visible in the downtown Deco District. This region spans the area from 1st to 8th street, with borders at Boston and Cheyenne. This area is located in the heart of the skyscrapers of Downtown Tulsa and thus has many food, beverage, and fitness options readily available. The Bartlett Square at 5th and Main provides a unique European feel to this region, but the entire area is overflowing with Tulsa charm. 

The Philtower and Philcade buildings, the Atlas Life building, Tulsa Club, and Public Service Company of Oklahoma building are some of the most prominent displays of the Art Deco architecture style in Tulsa. Many tours of this region are readily available. Perhaps one of the more interesting facts about the Art Deco region are the underground tunnels which connect many of the classic buildings. They are now open for public tours, providing interested guests with a one of a kind Tulsa experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/tulsaworldmagazine/are-hidden-tunnels-under-downtown-tulsa/article_5b5b8e68-e53c-5b8f-bb22-e751c5bf81f1.html|title=Are ‘hidden tunnels’ under downtown Tulsa?|last=World|first=Michael Overall Tulsa|work=Tulsa World|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the extensive variety of local shops and restaurants, this district annually hosts one of the largest festivals in Tulsa: Mayfest. Every May, the Deco District comes alive during Mayfest, where artists, vendors, and live musicians combine to create one of the largest street festivals in Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tulsamayfest.org/|title=Tulsa International Mayfest presented by Midfirst Bank|website=Tulsa International Mayfest presented by Midfirst Bank|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Village===
East Village comprises 115 acres bordered by East 2nd and East 7th Streets, Detroit Avenue and Lansing Avenue, just inside the inner-dispersal loop.&lt;ref&gt;Easterling, Mike. "East Village: Dead or Alive?." March 25, 2009. Accessed September 7, 2011.[http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A26686] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806034615/http://www.urbantulsa.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A26686 |date=2012-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area boasts an upscale martini bar, a hair salon, a pet day care, photography studios, lofts, a knitting room and living arts district, among others. The cornerstone of this neighborhood is the fifth largest [[LGBT]] community center in the United States, the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center, owned and operated by Oklahomans for Equality/OkEq (formerly Tulsa Oklahomans for Human Rights/TOHR), with further development being planned for more restaurants, residential lofts and retail.

The development in the East Village has provided Tulsans and visitors with many food and entertainment opportunities. With areas like the Bond Center for large events intertwined with luxurious apartment complexes, the feeling of community is particularly strong within this area. The Boxyard- a shopping complex made from repurposed shipping containers- has quickly become a popular destination for local shopping and eating within the East Village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulsaboxyard.com/|title=home|website=The Boxyard|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual MOJO music fest occurs in this region, mixing live music with local craft beers and food trucks. Regardless of interest, the East Village District has something for everyone in Downtown Tulsa.

===Greenwood Historical District===

{{Main|Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma}}

The [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood Historical District]] is just north of downtown and east of the Brady District. It was once one of the most affluent African-American communities in the United States and referred to as Black Wall Street.  In 1921, thirty-five blocks of businesses and residences were burned in this district during the infamous [[Tulsa Race Riot]], the bloodiest racial riot in the history of the United States. The [[Oklahoma Legislature]] passed laws in 2001 aimed at revitalizing Greenwood, setting up a [[scholarship]] fund for college-bound descendants of riot victims and appropriating $2 million for a riot memorial. As of 2004, two blocks of the old neighborhood have been restored and are part of the Greenwood Historical District. It is now home to the Greenwood Cultural Center, the Tulsa Race Riot Memorial, and the Oklahoma Jazz Hall of Fame, as well as [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa]] and [[Langston University]]-Tulsa.

Because of its rich history, the Greenwood Historical District provides visitors with one of the most unique cultural experiences in Tulsa. The John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park details the relationship between African-Americans and the state of Oklahoma throughout history with an emphasis on the Tulsa Race Riot. The Mabel B Little Heritage House takes visitors back to the 1920s with its classic furnishings and information about the Riots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.4718|title=TravelOK.com - Oklahoma's Official Travel &amp; Tourism Site|website=www.travelok.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Greenwood Cultural Center strives to educate on the unique history of the Greenwood District, with a focus on jazz and the blues as well. Alongside these important landmarks in the Greenwood District lies a growing retail district bordering OneOK Field on the east. With an ever-increasing number of food and dessert options in the region, Greenwood Historical District is a great stop to learn about Tulsa's history and refuel. 

===Tulsa Arts District===
Formerly known as the Brady Arts District, the Tulsa Art District is located north across the Sante Fe Railroad tracks from the central business district and centered at Main Street &amp; Brady Avenue. The Brady District is one of Tulsa's oldest areas, characterized by two-story brick warehouses.

[[Image:Cains Ballroom Tulsa Night.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's Ballroom]]

The [[Brady Theater]], built between 1912 and 1914, was originally designed to serve as the city's municipal auditorium and was simply called "Convention Hall" for the first forty years of its life and was one of three internment camps where African Americans were detained after the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot.  In 1952, major additions were added and the building was renamed Tulsa Municipal Theater.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Supplanted as the city auditorium in 1979 by construction of the Performing Arts Center in downtown, "the Old Lady on Brady" continues to be used today for a wide variety of concerts and theatrical productions.

North of the Brady on Main Street is the [[Cain's Ballroom]], formerly the garage of the Brady family&lt;ref&gt;''This Land'', "The Nightmare of Dreamland." Accessed September 12, 2011.[http://thislandpress.com/09/01/2011/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the home of [[Bob Wills]] and his band, the Texas Playboys. The district is also the location of many local artists' galleries, restaurants with late night hours, bars and dance clubs. It is also an emerging gay neighborhood, with several gay or gay-friendly bars and numerous supportive shops and restaurants.

A few blocks southeast of Cain's Ballroom lies one of the gems of the Downtown Tulsa area- the Guthrie Green. This urban park is a cross between a garden and an amphitheater with events ranging from movie nights to workout classes hosted there. With family friendly concerts, food truck Wednesday's, and fountains to play in, the Guthrie Green has become a central point for the Tulsa Arts District. In fact, on the first Friday of every month, local businesses in this area center their First Friday Art Crawl around the Green, with exhibits at Philbrook Downtown, 108 Contemporary, and the Hardesty Arts Center (AHHA) which border the park. This monthly event brings the community together to enjoy the best food, drinks, and entertainment that the Tulsa Arts District can provide. 

Today, the Tulsa Arts District is one of the most diverse areas in all of Tulsa. It hosts restaurants, clubs, museums, and businesses and is a prime example of urban living. There is presently construction which will more than double the number of permanent residents in this artistic conclave. On its present path, the area will continue to develop as a hub of the community welcoming all people as it acknowledges its past while looking to a vibrant and inclusive future.

==Economy==
Major employers in Downtown Tulsa include the corporate headquarters of [[Williams Companies]] and [[ONEOK]].&lt;ref&gt;http://co.williams.com/contact-us/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneok.com/en/About.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; BOK Financial is headquartered there as well.

Despite the increasing literature related to the topics of [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment(FDI)]] in manufacturing sector of European transitional economies, the ones related to FDI in the banking sector have received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;Voinea, L., and Mihaescu, M., (2006), “The Determinants of Foreign Banking Activity in South East Europe: Do FDI, Bilateral Trade and EU Policies Matter?”, Global Development Network Southeast Europe&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, over the past years numerous studies and theories have emerged in an attempt to explain the motives behind foreign bank entry in CEE countries. Although there is not a universally accepted theory explaining the motives behind a Banks decision to start it operations abroad several reasons are addressed in the existing literature.&lt;ref&gt;Buch, C.M., (2000), “Why do Banks go Abroad? - Evidence from German Data, "Financial Markets Institutions and Instruments" Vol. 9 (1).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Research has revealed factors like the degree of economic integration between the home and host country, market opportunities available and entry restrictions like the factors that affect a banks decision to start its operations on a foreign market.&lt;ref&gt;Bol, H. and R.Lensink, J.de Haan (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” CCSO Working Paper No. 05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow the customer / level of integration between home and host country ==

One of the most important reason that affects a banks decision to entry a foreign market is to “follow the customer” also called the defensive hypothesis.  Foreign banks building upon the expertise in their home country they can differentiate themselves from their competitors in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to their home country corporate customers.  Years of long-lasting relationship have provided the banks with crucial information about the unique financial needs that their clients have, the knowledge of which is unavailable to host country institutions. In addition, through this relationship banks are able to develop a competitive advantage stemming through the lower marginal costs that those banks experience when dealing with loan renewals over their local competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, T. (2003): “Determinants of German Foreign Direct Investment in Latin American and Asian Emerging Markets in the 1990s”, Economic Research Centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Discussion Paper No. 11/03.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike manufacturing where knowledge can be protected through [[patterns]] and other means, commercial intelligence can be easily gained by any bank with an interest in starting its operations in specific market or industries. In addition, letting other [[financial institution]]s to develop a relationship with its existing corporate clients can result in the loss of market share in the banks home county.  In order to prevent this from happening banks are obliged to follow the client by opening an office (branch, subsidiary) abroad themselves in order to defend their unique bank client relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Wezel, T. (2003): “Determinants of German Foreign Direct Investment in Latin American and Asian Emerging Markets in the 1990s”, Economic Research Centre of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Discussion Paper No. 11/03.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractiveness of the host country ==
The attractiveness of the host country is another motive that according to scholars drives foreign bank entry into a foreign market. According to this argument a number of factors like [[GDP]], size, distance, financial development, and profit opportunities are identified as the ones that shape the overall attractiveness of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Host country regulation ==
Foreign banks will to engage themselves in banking FDI may have long existed, however the ability to do so was restricted by barriers to entry that existed in many [[Emerging markets|Emerging Markets Economies]] until recently. Only after the authorities of those countries in the mid-1990s begun to actively pursue a policy aiming to the privatisation of their domestic banking institutions through the participation of foreign investors’ foreign bank entry was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa. F., (2004), “A Note on Banking FDI in Emerging Markets: Literature Review and Evidence from M&amp;A Data” International Finance Division, Bank of England&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of host country regulations on foreign bank entry are straightforward since restrictions on foreign bank present generally limits competition and protect inefficient domestic banks. Since the majority of those countries are now in a transition process towards a democratic market economy the degree to which the reform process has taken place (level of economic reforms, and political freedom) is an important consideration that foreign banks are taken into account before entering the country. Countries that have successfully introduced reforms aiming at establishing transparent and enforceable rules regarding their financial markets are the ones that considered more attractive for foreign banks.&lt;ref&gt;Lensink,. R and de Haan, J., (2002), “Do Reforms in Transition Economies Affect Foreign Bank Entry?” International Review of Finance, Vol. 3:3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, G., R. Cull, M. S. Martinez-Peria and S. M. SaÂnchez (2001), `Foreign Bank Entry: Experience, Implications for Developing Countries, and Agenda for Further Research' , World Bank paper, October.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerrit Jan Heijn''' (14 February 1931, [[Zaandam]] &amp;ndash; 9 September 1987) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] businessman, who was a top manager of [[Ahold]] until his death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9898659a-2590-11e0-8258-00144feab49a.html Obituary: Grocer who felt empathy for the shopper], Phil Davison, Financial Times, 21 January 2011(registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was [[Albert Heijn (born 1865)|Albert Heijn]], who founded the family business, and his older brother was also named [[Albert Heijn (born 1927)|Albert Heijn]], who was the founder of Ahold. His son, Ronald Jan Heijn, played for the Dutch national [[field hockey]] team.

On 9 September 1987, he was kidnapped near his [[villa]] in [[Bloemendaal]], [[Netherlands]] by [[Ferdi Elsas]]. Although Elsas murdered him only a few hours after the kidnapping, he pretended that Heijn was still alive for a long time and asked for ransom. He sent the Heijn family Gerrit Jan's [[glasses]] and severed [[little finger]]. Elsas was caught when he started spending banknotes of the ransom he received, of which the numbers had been recorded. He served a prison sentence and was freed in 2001. Elsas gave directions to Heijn's body, which was buried in the woods near [[Renkum]]. Gerrit Jan Heijn was [[cremation|cremated]] on 9 April 1988 in [[Driehuis]]. Elsas was killed on 3 August 2009 in an accident when he was struck by an [[excavator]] while riding his bicycle near the town of [[Vorden]], Gelderland.

In 2016, Farley announced that he would not seek re-election in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2016/05/8598220/after-40-years-hugh-farley-announces-decision-leave-senate |title=After 40 years, Hugh Farley announces decision to leave Senate |work=POLITICO New York |date=2016-05-03 |accessdate=2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Independent Family Brewers of Britain''' ('''''IFBB''''') was formed in the 1993 by an informal group of family-owned/controlled brewery CEOs known as the [[Pimlico Group]] - all of whom were part of the UK's [[Brewers Society]], now the [[British Beer and Pub Association]].

The group, between them, own over 700 brands and over 4,200 pubs. Current chairman is James Staughton, Managing Director of St Austell Brewery. 

== Background ==
The IFBB was launched on 14 April 1993 at the [[Brewers' Hall, London|Brewers' Hall]] in London. It had 36 members.&lt;ref name=indy93&gt;{{cite news|author=John Shepherd |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/family-brewers-prepare-for-a-fight-ale-producers-band-together-to-do-battle-with-westminster-and-1455568.html |title=Family brewers prepare for a fight: Ale producers band together to do battle with Westminster and Brussels |work=The Independent |date=15 April 1993 |accessdate=21 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence of 'The Tie' - tying the tenant within his tenancy agreement to buying the brewery's own beers - was a key aim of the IFBB.&lt;ref name=indy93 /&gt; The organisation also focuses on recruitment of licensees, beer quality training and attracting new cask ale drinkers.

It was intended to act against [[European Commission]] proposals that were thought might stop even the smallest brewery owning its own [[public house|pubs]], a move which would have had adverse consequences for Britain's traditional family brewing industry.

Two codes of conduct, one for lessees and one for tenants, has been co-produced with [[British Beer and Pub Association]]. Compulsory for members of IFBB it aims to simplify self-regulation and maintain low cost arbitration of disputes. The codes will apply to over 4,000 pubs in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familybrewers.co.uk/search/news-case-studies/item/132-family-brewers-champion-ttransparency-with-new-code-of-practice |title=Family Brewers Champion Ttransparency with New Code of Practice |publisher=Family Brewers |date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Intellectual Reserve, Inc''' ('''IRI''') is a non-profit corporation based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States. Founded in 1997, it is wholly owned and operated by the [[Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It holds the church's [[intellectual property]], including [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rights and Use Information | work=lds.org | publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | url=http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,120-1-46-1,00.html | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRI owns over 60 trademarks associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Intellectual Reserve, Inc. | work=Trademarkia | url=http://www.trademarkia.com/company-intellectual-reserve-inc-613675-page-1-2 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormon as a trademark==
In some countries, "Mormon" and some phrases including the term are [[registered trademarks]] owned by IRI.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Mormon Tabernacle Choir" is registered as United States [http://tarr.uspto.gov/tarr?regser=registration&amp;entry=2766231&amp;action=Request+Status Federal TM Reg. No. 2766231], and "Mormon" is registered in the European Community serial number EC004306701, registered July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the LDS Church applied for a trademark in the United States on "Mormon" as applied to religious services; however, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] rejected the application, stating that the term "Mormon" was too generic and is popularly understood as referring to a particular kind of church, similar to "[[Presbyterian]]" or "[[Methodist]]", rather than a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Offc Action Outgoing | work=Trademark Document Retrieval (TDR) | publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date=November 1, 2005 | format=Application number 78161091 | url=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was abandoned as of August 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest Status Info | format=Federal TM Ser. No. 78161091 | date=August 22, 2007 | work=Trademark Applications and Registrations Retrieval (TARR) | publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78161091 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{nihongo|'''''kabushiki gaisha'''''|{{wt|ja|株式会社}}||{{IPA-ja|kabɯɕi̥ki ɡaꜜiɕa|pron}}; lit. "share company"|lead=yes}} or '''''kabushiki kaisha''''', commonly abbreviated '''KK''', is a type of {{nihongo4|company|会社|kaisha}} defined under the [[Law of Japan|Companies Act of Japan]].  The term is often translated as "stock company", "[[joint-stock company]]" or "stock corporation".

==Usage in language==
In English, ''kabushiki kaisha'' is usually used, but the original Japanese pronunciation is ''kabushiki gaisha'' because of [[rendaku]].

A kabushiki kaisha must include "株式会社" in its name (Article 6, paragraph 2 of the Companies Act). In a company name, "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" can be used as a prefix (e.g. {{lang|ja|株式会社電通}} ''[[Dentsu|Kabushiki gaisha Dentsū]]'', which is called "''mae-kabu''") or as a suffix (e.g. {{lang|ja|トヨタ自動車株式会社}} ''[[Toyota|Toyota Jidōsha Kabushiki gaisha]]'', which is called "''ato-kabu''").

Many Japanese companies translate the phrase "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" in their name as "Co., Ltd." but others use the more Americanized translations "Corporation" or "Incorporated." Texts in England often refer to ''kabushiki gaisha'' as "[[joint-stock company|joint stock companies]]." While that is close to a literal translation of the term, the two are not the same. The Japanese government once endorsed "business corporation" as an official translation&lt;ref name=Asahi1&gt;"{{lang|ja|法令用語「日英対訳辞書」まとまる　政府検討委}}", ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', March 18, 2006. ([http://kiyotani.at.webry.info/200603/article_26.html summary])&lt;/ref&gt; but now uses more literal translation "stock company."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legal-astray.jp/sbdic_lt/en/?q=%B3%F4%BC%B0%B2%F1%BC%D2 Standard Bilingual Dictionary of Legal Terminology]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese often abbreviate "{{lang|ja|株式会社}}" in a company name on signage (including the sides of their vehicles) to {{lang|ja|株}} in parentheses, as, for example, "{{lang|ja|ABC(株)}}." The full, formal name would then be "{{lang|ja|ABC株式会社}}". {{lang|ja|株式会社}} is also combined into one Unicode character at code point U+337F (㍿).

==History==
The first ''kabushiki gaisha'' was the [[Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank|First National Bank of Japan]], incorporated in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=230dSQYIhocC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=The+first+kabushiki+gaisha+was+the+First+National+Bank+of+Japan,+incorporated+in+1873&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eb88aumTDd&amp;sig=BABeH3X0STix_MoTKqgtRBFLqIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20first%20kabushiki%20gaisha%20was%20the%20First%20National%20Bank%20of%20Japan,%20incorporated%20in%201873&amp;f=false|title=Japan Company Laws and Regulations Handbook|last=Usa|first=Usa Ibp|date=2010|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9781433070051|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules regarding ''kabushiki gaisha'' were set out in the [[Six Codes|Commercial Code of Japan]]. During the [[Occupied Japan|Allied Occupation of Japan]] following [[World War II]], the occupation authorities introduced revisions to the Commercial Code based on the Illinois Business Corporation Act of 1933, giving ''kabushiki gaisha'' many traits of American corporations.&lt;ref name=ramseyer1&gt;Ramseyer, Mark, and Minoru Nakazato, ''Japanese Law: An Economic Approach'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Japanese and U.S. corporate law diverged, and K.K. assumed many characteristics not found in U.S. corporations. For instance, a K.K. could not buy back its own [[stock]] (a restriction which still stands), issue stock for a price of less than ¥50,000 per share (effective 1982), or operate with paid-in capital of less than ¥10 million (effective 1991-2005).&lt;ref name=ramseyer2&gt;Ramseyer, ''op. cit.'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2005, the [[Diet of Japan]] passed a new {{nihongo|Companies Act|会社法|kaisha-hō}}, which took effect on May 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.waseda.jp/hiken/en/jalaw_inf/topics/005masai.html | title=Review of 2005 Companies Act: Recent discussions | author=Professor Shosaku Masai | publisher=Waseda University Institute of Comparative Law | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new law greatly affected the formation and function of K.K.'s and other Japanese business organizations, bringing them closer to their contemporary counterparts in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Formation==
A ''kabushiki gaisha'' may be started with capital as low as ¥1, making the total cost of a K.K. incorporation approximately ¥240,000 (about US$2,500) in taxes and [[Notary public|notarization]] fees. Under the old Commercial Code, a K.K. required starting capital of ¥10 million (about US$105,000); a lower capital requirement was later instituted, but corporations with under ¥3 million in assets were barred from issuing [[dividend]]s, and companies were required to increase their capital to ¥10 million within five years of formation.&lt;ref name=Terrie&gt;Terrie Lloyd, "[http://www.daijob.com/dj4/en/column/terrie/column.jsp?id=321 One Yen Companies – Part Two]," Work in Japan.com.   {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510034652/http://www.daijob.com/dj4/en/column/terrie/column.jsp?id=321 |date=May 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main steps in incorporation are the following:
# Preparation and notarization of [[articles of incorporation]]
# Receipt of [[Financial capital|capital]], either directly or through an offering

The incorporation of a K.K. is carried out by one or more {{nihongo|[[incorporator]]s|発起人|hokkinin|sometimes referred to as "promoters"}}. Although seven incorporators were required as recently as the 1980s, a K.K. now only needs one incorporator, which may be an individual or a corporation. If there are multiple incorporators, they must sign a [[partnership]] agreement before incorporating the company.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

# The value or minimum amount of assets received in exchange for the initial issuance of shares
# The name and address of the incorporator(s)

The purpose statement requires some specialized knowledge, as Japan follows an [[ultra vires]] doctrine and does not allow a K.K. to act beyond its purposes. [[Judicial scrivener|Judicial]] or [[administrative scrivener]]s are often hired to draft the purposes of a new company.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Additionally, the articles of incorporation must contain the following if applicable:
# Any non-cash assets contributed as capital to the company, the name of the contributor and the number of shares issued for such assets
# Any assets promised to be purchased after the incorporation of the company and the name of the provider
# Any compensation to be paid to the incorporator(s)
# Non-routine incorporation expenses that will be borne by the company

Other matters may also be included, such as limits on the number of directors and auditors. The Corporation Code allows a K.K. to be formed as a {{nihongo|"stock company that is not a public company"|公開会社でない株式会社|kōkai gaisha denai kabushiki gaisha}}, or a (so-called) {{nihongo|"close company"|非公開会社|hi-kōkai gaisha}}, in which case the company (e.g. its board of directors or a shareholders' meeting, as defined in the articles of incorporation) must approve any transfer of shares between shareholders; this designation must be made in the articles of incorporation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The articles must be sealed by the incorporator(s) and notarized by a [[notary public]], then filed with the Legal Affairs Bureau in the jurisdiction where the company will have its head office.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Receipt of capital===
In a direct incorporation, each incorporator receives a specified amount of stock as designated in the articles of incorporation. Each incorporator must then promptly pay its share of the starting capital of the company, and if no directors have been designated in the articles of incorporation, meet to determine the initial directors and other officers.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The other method is an "incorporation by offering," in which each incorporator becomes the [[underwriter]] of a specified number of shares (at least one each), and the other shares are offered to other investors. As in a direct incorporation, the incorporators must then hold an organizational meeting to appoint the initial directors and other officers. Any person wishing to receive shares must submit an application to the incorporator, and then make payment for his or her shares by a date specified by the incorporator(s).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Capital must be received in a [[commercial bank]] account designated by the incorporator(s), and the bank must provide certification that payment has been made. Once the capital has been received and certified, the incorporation may be registered at the Legal Affairs Bureau.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Structure==
{{further|Corporate title#Japan and South Korea}}

===Board of directors===
Under present law, a K.K. must have a {{nihongo|board of directors|取締役会|torishimariyaku kai}} consisting of at least three individuals. Directors have a statutory term of office of two years, and auditors have a term of four years.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Small companies can exist with only one or two directors, with no statutory term of office, and {{nihongo|without a board of directors|取締役会非設置会社|torishimariyaku kai hisetchigaisha}}. In such companies, decisions are made via shareholder meeting and the decision-making power of the directors is relatively limited. As soon as a third director is designated such companies must form a board.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

At least one director is designated as a {{nihongo|[[Representative Director (Japan)|Representative Director]]|代表取締役|daihyō torishimariyaku}}, holds the corporate seal and is empowered to represent the company in transactions. The Representative Director must "report" to the board of directors every three months; the exact meaning of this statutory provision is unclear, but some legal scholars interpret it to mean that the board must meet every three months. In 2015, the requirement that at least one director and one Representative Director must be a resident of Japan was changed. It is not required to have a resident Representative Director although it can be convenient to do so..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=How to Set Up Business in Japan | url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section1/page2.html | publisher=[[Japan External Trade Organization]] | accessdate=2011-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors are mandatories ([[agency (law)|agents]]) of the shareholders, and the Representative Director is a mandatory of the board. Any action outside of these mandates is considered a breach of mandatory duty.&lt;ref name=Yamazaki&gt;''Yamazaki Bakery K.K. v. Iijima'', 1015 Hanrei Jiho 27 (Tokyo Dist. Ct., March 26, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auditing and reporting===
Every K.K. with multiple directors must have at least one {{nihongo|statutory auditor|監査役|kansayaku}}. Statutory auditors report to the shareholders, and are empowered to demand financial and operational reports from the directors.

K.K.s with capital of over ¥500m, liabilities of over ¥2bn and/or publicly traded securities are required to have three statutory auditors, and must also have an annual audit performed by an outside [[certified public accountant|CPA]]. Public K.K.s must also file securities law reports with the Ministry of Finance.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Under the new Company Law, public and other non-close K.K.s may either have a statutory auditor, or a {{nihongo|[[nominating committee]]|指名委員会|shimei iinkai}}, {{nihongo|[[auditing committee]]|監査委員会|kansa iinkai}} and {{nihongo|[[compensation committee]]|報酬委員会|hōshū iinkai}} structure similar to that of American public corporations.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Close K.K.s may also have a single person serving as director and statutory auditor, regardless of capital or liabilities.

A statutory auditor may be any person who is not an employee or director of the company. In practice, the position is often filled by a very senior employee close to retirement, or by an outside attorney or accountant.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Officers===
Japanese law does not designate any corporate officer positions. Most Japanese-owned kabushiki gaisha do not have "officers" ''per se'', but are directly managed by the directors, one of whom generally has the title of {{nihongo|president|社長|shachō}}. The Japanese equivalent of a corporate [[vice president]] is a {{nihongo|department chief|部長|buchō}}. Traditionally, under the [[lifetime employment]] system, directors and department chiefs begin their careers as line employees of the company and work their way up the management hierarchy over time. This is not the case in most foreign-owned companies in Japan, and some native companies{{Which|date=January 2015}} have also abandoned this system in recent years in favor of encouraging more lateral movement in management.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Corporate officers often have the legal title of [[shihainin]], which makes them authorized representatives of the corporation at a particular place of business, in addition to a common-use title.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Other legal issues==

===Taxation===
Kabushiki gaisha are subject to [[double taxation]] of profits and dividends, as are corporations in most countries. In contrast to many other countries, however, Japan also levies double taxes on close corporations ([[yugen gaisha]] and [[gōdō gaisha]]). This makes taxation a minor issue when deciding how to structure a business in Japan. As all publicly traded companies follow the K.K. structure, smaller businesses often choose to incorporate as a K.K. simply to appear more prestigious.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In addition to income taxes, K.K.s must also pay registration taxes to the national government, and may be subject to local taxes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Derivative litigation===
Generally, the power to bring actions against the directors on the corporation's behalf is granted to the statutory auditor.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Historically, [[derivative suit]]s by shareholders were rare in Japan. Shareholders have been permitted to sue on the corporation's behalf since the postwar Americanization of the Commercial Code; however, this power was severely limited by the nature of court costs in Japan. Because the cost to file a civil action is proportional to the amount of damages being claimed, shareholders rarely had motivation to sue on the company's behalf.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1993, the Commercial Code was amended to reduce the filing fee for all shareholder derivative suits to ¥8,200 per claim. This led to a rise in the number of derivative suits heard by Japanese courts, from 31 pending cases in 1992 to 286 in 1999, and to a number of very high-profile shareholder actions, such as those against [[Daiwa Bank]] and [[Nomura Securities]]&lt;ref name=West&gt;West, Mark D. "Why Shareholders Sue: The Evidence from Japan," ''Journal of Legal Studies'' 30:351 (2001). {{doi|10.1086/322056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''limited liability company''' ('''LLC''') is the [[United States of America|US]]-specific form of a [[private limited company]]. It is a [[business]] structure that can combine the [[Flow-through entity|pass-through taxation]] of a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] with the [[limited liability]] of a [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwindt|first1=Kari|title=Limited Liability Companies: Issues in Member Liability|journal=UCLE Law Review|date=1996|volume=44|page=1541|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uclalr44&amp;div=43|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited liability company (LLC)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/limited_liability_company_llc|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An LLC is not a corporation in and of itself; it is a legal form of a [[company]] that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs are well-known for the flexibility that they provide to business owners; depending on the situation, an LLC may elect to use corporate tax rules instead of being treated as a partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc | title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) | publisher=Internal Revenue Service| access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, under certain circumstances, LLCs may be organized as not-for-profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard A. |last1=McCray |first2=Ward L. |last2=Thomas |title=Limited Liability Companies as Exempt Organizations |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopich00.pdf | publisher=Internal Revenue Service | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or [[medical services]], may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a '''professional limited liability company''' ('''PLLC''').&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Neil|title=Should You Structure Your Accounting Firm as an LLC, PLLC or PC?|url=https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/should-you-structure-your-accounting-firm-as-an-llc-pllc-or-pc|website=Accounting Today | publisher=SourceMedia | date=10 August 2016 | access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid [[legal person|legal entity]] having certain characteristics of both a [[corporation]] and a [[partnership]] or [[sole proprietorship]] (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC is a type of [[voluntary association|unincorporated association]] distinct from a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is [[limited liability]], and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of [[flow-through entity|pass-through]] [[taxation in the United States|income taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/limited_liability_company.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bischoff|first1=Bill|title=The advantages of owning real estate in a single-member LLC|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advantages-of-owning-real-estate-in-a-single-member-llc-2017-05-01|website=MarketWatch, Inc.|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although LLCs and corporations both possess some analogous features, the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity, at least within the United States, is sometimes different. When an LLC is formed, it is said to be "organized,” not "incorporated" or "chartered,” and its founding document is likewise known as its "[[articles of organization]]," instead of its "[[articles of incorporation]]" or its "corporate charter.” Internal operations of an LLC are further governed by its "[[operating agreement]]," rather than its "[[by-law|bylaws]]." The owner of beneficial rights in an LLC is known as a "member," rather than a "[[shareholder]].” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Kevin|title=What Is the Difference Between a Shareholder Vs. a LLC Member?|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/difference-between-shareholder-vs-llc-member-61708.html|accessdate=7 September 2017|agency=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[ownership]] in an LLC is represented by a "membership interest" or an "LLC interest" (sometimes measured in "membership units" or just "units" and at other times simply stated only as [[percentage]]s), rather than represented by "[[share (finance)|shares of stock]]" or just "shares" (with ownership measured by the number of shares held by each shareholder). Similarly, when issued in physical rather than electronic form, a document evidencing ownership rights in an LLC is called a "membership certificate" rather than a "[[stock certificate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Scott E.|title=Forming Your Own Limilted Liability Company|date=1996|publisher=Dearborn Trade Publishing|isbn=9780936894935|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAP5gXGGFFEC|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego [[Piercing the corporate veil|piercing theories]] as corporate shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jonathan R.|title=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/03/27/the-three-justifications-for-piercing-the-corporate-veil/|website=The Three Justifications for Piercing the Corporate Veil|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. As long as the LLC and the members do not [[commingling|commingle]] funds, it is difficult to pierce the LLC veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Shaun M.|title=Piercing the Veil of the Limited Liability Company, from Sure Bet to Long Shot: Gallinger v. North Star Hospital Mutual Assurance, Ltd.|journal=Journal of Corporate Law|date=1996|volume=22|page=131|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jcorl22&amp;div=14|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vandervoort|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Piercing the Veil of Limited Liability Companies: The Need for a Better Standard|journal=DePaul Business and Commercial Law Journal|date=2004|volume=3|page=51|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/depbcl3&amp;div=10|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the [[charging order]] mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adkisson|first1=Jay|title=The Misunderstood Charging Order|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2013/04/30/the-misunderstood-charging-order/|website=Forbes|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Delaware Code, Title 6, Chapter 18, Limited Liability Company Act|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title6/c018/sc06/index.shtml|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first state to enact a law authorizing limited liability companies was [[Wyoming]] in 1977. The form did not become immediately popular, in part because of uncertainties in tax treatment by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. After an IRS ruling in 1988 that Wyoming LLCs could be taxed as partnerships, other states began enacting LLC statutes. By 1996, all 50 states had LLC statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/law_trends_news_practice_area_e_newsletter_home/llc.html|title=LLCs: Is the Future Here? A History and Prognosis|last=|first=|date=October 2004|website=www.americanbar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flexibility and default rules==
LLCs are subject to fewer regulations than traditional corporations, and thus may allow members to create a more flexible management structure than is possible with other corporate forms. As long as it remains within the confines of state law, the operating agreement is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pros and Cons of a Limited Liability Company (LLC)|url=https://www.allbusiness.com/pros-and-cons-of-a-limited-liability-company-llc-2517-1.html|website=AllBusiness.com|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.

The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. Even the use of a single member LLC affords greater protection for the assets of the member, as compared to operating as an unincorporated entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Shari P.|title=Single Member LLC Vs. Sole Proprietorship Liability|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/single-member-llc-vs-sole-proprietorship-liability-81147.html|website=Houston Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in ''Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp., 59 A. 3d 1206 (2012)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13162396720159555258|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falby|first1=Bruce E.|title=Delaware amends its LLC Act: managers and controllers owe fiduciary duties unless LLC agreement provides otherwise|url=https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2013/08/delaware-amends-its-llc-act--managers-and-contro__/|website=DLA Piper|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. The written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Stephen|title=Didn't sign your LLC operating agreement? Think that'll get you off? Think again.|url=http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2014/09/didnt-sign-your-llc-operating-agreement-think-thatll-get-you-off-think-again.html|website=ProfessorBainbridge.com|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income tax==
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iss4.pdf |title=Instruction SS-4 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a "disregarded entity" for tax purposes (unless another tax status is elected), and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on [[Form 1040#1040|Schedule C]] of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLC Filing as a Corporation or Partnership|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/llc-filing-as-a-corporation-or-partnership|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice: once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders.  Thus, more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akalp|first1=Nellie|title=How to Structure Your Startup to Avoid Double Taxation|url=http://mashable.com/2012/02/09/business-incorporation-taxes/|website=Mashable|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8832.pdf |title=IRS Form 8832 (Rev. January 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular [[C corporation]] (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the [[dividend]]s or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an [[S corporation]] (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible [[small business]] structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Small-Business-Taxes/Limited-Liability-Company-Taxes/INF12029.html |title=Tax Advantages of Corporations - Updated for Tax Year 2016 |publisher=TurboTax |accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
* Choice of [[entity classification election|tax regime]]. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a [[sole proprietor]], partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
* A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title26-vol8/pdf/CFR-2010-title26-vol8-sec1-704-1.pdf Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1] are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
* The owners of the LLC, called members, are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
* In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. tax residents; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
* Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
* [[Flow-through entity|Pass-through taxation]] (i.e., no [[double taxation]]), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
* Using default tax classification, [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
* LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC) (see, for example, the case of ''Sturm v. Harb Development''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sturm v. Harb Development, 298 Conn. 124, 2 A.3d 859 (2010)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4103942001146152039|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* LLCs in some states can be set up with just one [[natural person]] involved.
* Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" [[investor]]s).
* For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six Benefits of Limited Liability Companies|url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/6-benefits-limited-liability-companies/|website=Cornerstone Law Firm|publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm, LLC|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Although there is no statutory requirement for an [[operating agreement]] in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.
* It may be more difficult to raise [[financial capital]] for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual [[initial public offering|IPO]]. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
* Many jurisdictions—including [[Alabama]], [[California]], [[Kentucky]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]—levy a [[franchise tax]] or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.
** Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
** In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profit—unless the entity is tax exempt—must at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.
* Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
* The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
* Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposes—for example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[HMRC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], see [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/dtmanual/DT19853A.htm HMRC Tax Manuals, DT19853A]&lt;/ref&gt; This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
* The principals of LLCs use many different titles—e.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

==Variations==
* A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a [[Physician|doctor]], [[chiropractor]], [[lawyer]], [[accountant]], [[architect]], [[landscape architect]], or [[engineer]], require the formation of a PLLC.&lt;ref name="accountingtoday"/&gt; However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
* A [[Series LLC]] is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
* An [[L3C]] is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
* An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC for which ownership information is not made publicly available by the state. This is typically accomplished by using a third-party to act as the organizer and [[registered agent]] of the LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donahue|first1=Larry|title=Just How "Anonymous" are Anonymous LLC's?|url=https://www.l4sb.com/blog/just-anonymous-anonymous-llcs/|website=Law 4 Small Business, P.C.|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16705">In [[relational database]]s, the '''Log trigger''' or '''History trigger''' is a mechanism for automatic recording of information about changes inserting or/and updating or/and deleting [[Row (database)|rows]] in a [[Table (database)|database table]].

It is a particular technique for [[Change data capture|change data capturing]], and in [[data warehousing]] for dealing with [[slowly changing dimension]]s.

== Definition ==

Suppose there is a [[Table (database)|table]] which we want to audit. This [[Table (database)|table]] contains the following [[Column (database)|columns]]:

&lt;code&gt;Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn&lt;/code&gt;

The [[Column (database)|column]] &lt;code&gt;Column1&lt;/code&gt; is assumed to be the [[primary key]].

These [[Column (database)|columns]] are defined to have the following types:

&lt;code&gt;Type1, Type2, ..., Typen&lt;/code&gt;

The '''Log Trigger''' works writing the changes ([[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] and [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] operations) on the [[Table (database)|table]] in another, '''history table''', defined as following:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
CREATE TABLE HistoryTable (
   Column1   Type1,
   Column2   Type2,
      :        :
   Columnn   Typen,

   StartDate DATETIME,
   EndDate   DATETIME
)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As shown above, this new [[Table (database)|table]] contains the same [[Column (database)|columns]] as the original [[Table (database)|table]], and additionally two new [[Column (database)|columns]] of type &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;StartDate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EndDate&lt;/code&gt;. This is known as [[Tuple-versioning|tuple versioning]]. These two additional [[Column (database)|columns]] define a period of time of "validity" of the data associated with a specified entity (the entity of the [[primary key]]), or in other words, it stores how the data were in the period of time between the &lt;code&gt;StartDate&lt;/code&gt; (included) and &lt;code&gt;EndDate&lt;/code&gt; (not included).

For each entity (distinct [[primary key]]) on the original [[Table (database)|table]], the following structure is created in the history [[Table (database)|table]]. Data is shown as example.

[[File:example log trigger.png|center|example]]

Notice that if they are shown chronologically the &lt;code&gt;EndDate&lt;/code&gt; [[Column (database)|column]] of any [[Row (database)|row]] is exactly the &lt;code&gt;StartDate&lt;/code&gt; of its successor (if any). It does not mean that both [[Row (database)|rows]] are common to that point in time, since -by definition- the value of &lt;code&gt;EndDate&lt;/code&gt; is not included.

There are two variants of the '''Log trigger''', depending how the old values (DELETE, UPDATE) and new values (INSERT, UPDATE) are exposed to the trigger (it is RDBMS dependent):

'''Old and new values as fields of a record data structure'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
CREATE TRIGGER HistoryTable ON OriginalTable FOR INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE AS
DECLARE @Now DATETIME
SET @Now = GETDATE()

/* deleting section */

UPDATE HistoryTable
   SET EndDate = @Now
 WHERE EndDate IS NULL
   AND Column1 = OLD.Column1

/* inserting section */

INSERT INTO HistoryTable (Column1, Column2, ...,Columnn, StartDate, EndDate) 
VALUES (NEW.Column1, NEW.Column2, ..., NEW.Columnn, @Now, NULL)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Old and new values as rows of virtual tables'''

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
CREATE TRIGGER HistoryTable ON OriginalTable FOR INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE AS
DECLARE @Now DATETIME
SET @Now = GETDATE()

/* deleting section */

UPDATE HistoryTable
   SET EndDate = @Now
  FROM HistoryTable, DELETED
 WHERE HistoryTable.Column1 = DELETED.Column1
   AND HistoryTable.EndDate IS NULL

/* inserting section */

INSERT INTO HistoryTable
       (Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn, StartDate, EndDate)
SELECT (Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn, @Now, NULL)
  FROM INSERTED
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Compatibility notes ===

* The function &lt;code&gt;GetDate()&lt;/code&gt; is used to get the system date and time, a specific [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] could either use another function name, or get this information by another way.
* Several [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] (DB2, MySQL) do not support that the same trigger can be attached to more than one operation ([[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]], [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]]). In such a case a trigger must be created for each operation; For an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] operation only the ''inserting section'' must be specified, for a [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] operation only the ''deleting section'' must be specified, and for an [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] operation both sections must be present, just as it is shown above (the ''deleting section'' first, then the ''inserting section''), because an [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] operation is logically represented as a [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] operation followed by an [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]] operation.
* In the code shown, the record data structure containing the old and new values are called &lt;code&gt;OLD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NEW&lt;/code&gt;. On a specific [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] they could have different names.
* In the code shown, the virtual tables are called &lt;code&gt;DELETED&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;INSERTED&lt;/code&gt;. On a specific [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] they could have different names. Another [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] (DB2) even let the name of these logical tables be specified.
* In the code shown, comments are in C/C++ style, they could not be supported by a specific [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]], or a different syntax should be used.
* Several [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] require that the body of the trigger is enclosed between &lt;code&gt;BEGIN&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;END&lt;/code&gt; keywords.

=== [[Data warehousing]] ===

According with the [[slowly changing dimension]] management methodologies, The '''log trigger''' falls into the following:

* [[Slowly changing dimension#Type 2|Type 2]] ([[Tuple-versioning|tuple versioning]] variant)
* [[Slowly changing dimension#Type 4|Type 4]] (use of history tables)

== Implementation in common [[RDBMS]] ==

=== [[IBM DB2]]&lt;ref&gt;"Database Fundamentals" by Nareej Sharma et al. (First Edition, Copyright IBM Corp. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; ===

* A trigger cannot be attached to more than one operation ([[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]], [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]]), so a trigger must be created for each operation.
* The old and new values are exposed as fields of a record data structures. The names of these records can be defined, in this example they are named as &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; for old values and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; for new values.

== Historic information ==

Typically, [[Database dump|database backups]] are used to store and retrieve historic information. A [[Database dump|database backup]] is a security mechanism, more than an effective way to retrieve ready-to-use historic information.

A (full) [[Database dump|database backup]] is only a snapshot of the data in specific points of time, so we could know the information of each snapshot, but we can know nothing between them. Information in [[Database dump|database backups]] is discrete in time.

Using the '''log trigger''' the information we can know is not discrete but continuous, we can know the exact state of the information in any point of time, only limited to the granularity of time provided with the &lt;code&gt;DATETIME&lt;/code&gt; data type of the [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] used.

== Advantages ==

* It is simple.
* It is not a commercial product, it works with available features in common [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]].
* It is automatic, once it is created, it works with no further human intervention.
* It is not required to have good knowledge about the tables of the database, or the data model.
* Changes in current programming are not required.
* Changes in the current [[Table (database)|tables]] are not required, because log data of any [[Table (database)|table]] is stored in a different one.
* It works for both programmed and ad hoc statements.
* Only changes ([[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] and [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] operations) are registered, so the growing rate of the history tables are proportional to the changes.
* It is not necessary to apply the trigger to all the tables on database, it can be applied to certain [[Table (database)|tables]], or certain [[Column (database)|columns]] of a [[Table (database)|table]].

== Disadvantages ==

* It does not automatically store information about the user producing the changes (information system user, not database user). This information might be provided explicitly. It could be enforced in information systems, but not in ad hoc queries.

== Examples of use ==

=== Getting the current version of a table ===

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn
  FROM HistoryTable
 WHERE EndDate IS NULL
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It should return the same resultset of the whole original [[Table (database)|table]].

=== Getting the version of a table in a certain point of time ===

Suppose the &lt;code&gt;@DATE&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the point or time of interest.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT  Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn
  FROM  HistoryTable
 WHERE  @Date &gt;= StartDate
   AND (@Date &lt; EndDate OR EndDate IS NULL)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Getting the information of an entity in a certain point of time ===

Suppose the &lt;code&gt;@DATE&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the point or time of interest, and the &lt;code&gt;@KEY&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the [[primary key]] of the entity of interest.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT  Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn
  FROM  HistoryTable
 WHERE  Column1 = @Key
   AND  @Date &gt;= StartDate
   AND (@Date &lt;  EndDate OR EndDate IS NULL)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Getting the history of an entity ===

Suppose the &lt;code&gt;@KEY&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the [[primary key]] of the entity of interest.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT Column1, Column2, ..., Columnn, StartDate, EndDate
  FROM HistoryTable
 WHERE Column1 = @Key
 ORDER BY StartDate
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Getting when and how an entity was created ===

Suppose the &lt;code&gt;@KEY&lt;/code&gt; variable contains the [[primary key]] of the entity of interest.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT H2.Column1, H2.Column2, ..., H2.Columnn, H2.StartDate
  FROM HistoryTable AS H2 LEFT OUTER JOIN HistoryTable AS H1
    ON H2.Column1 = H1.Column1
   AND H2.Column1 = @Key
   AND H2.StartDate = H1.EndDate
 WHERE H2.EndDate IS NULL
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Immutability of [[primary key]]s ==

Since the trigger requires that [[primary key]] being the same throughout time, it is desirable to either ensure or maximize its immutability, if a [[primary key]] changed its value, the entity it represents would break its own history.

There are several options to achieve or maximize the [[primary key]] immutability:

* Use of a [[Surrogate Key|surrogate key]] as a [[primary key]]. Since there is no reason to change a value with no meaning other than identity and uniqueness, it would never change.
* Use of an immutable [[natural key]] as a [[primary key]]. In a good database design, a [[natural key]] which can change should not be considered as a "real" [[primary key]].
* Use of a mutable [[natural key]] as a [[primary key]] (it is widely discouraged) where changes are propagated in every place where it is a [[foreign key]]. In such a case, the history table should be also affected.

=== Alternatives ===

Sometimes the [[Slowly changing dimension]] is used as a method, this diagram is an example:
[[File:Scd model.png|frame|right|Scd model]]

== See also ==

* [[RDBMS|Relational database]]
* [[Primary key]]
* [[Natural key]]
* [[Surrogate key]]
* [[Change data capture]]
* [[Slowly changing dimension]]
* [[Tuple-versioning|Tuple versioning]]

== Notes ==

The Log trigger was written by [[Laurence Ruiz Ugalde|Laurence R. Ugalde]] to automatically generate history of transactional databases.

'''Louis James Barletta''' (born January 28, 1956) is an American politician and businessman serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|PA|11}} since 2011. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as [[Mayoralty in the United States|Mayor]] of [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania]] from 1999 to 2010. As Mayor, he came to prominence due to a high-profile anti-immigration ordinance that spurred legal challenges and was later found unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The legal fees related to defending the ordinance contributed to making the city financially distressed, and it no longer enforces the ordinance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Barletta was the Republican nominee in the [[United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2018|2018 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania]].

==Early life, education, and business career==
Barletta was born January 28, 1956, in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, the son of Angeline (née Agosti) and Rocco Barletta, both of Italian ancestry.&lt;ref name=CQ&gt;{{cite news |title=112th Congress: Lou Barletta, R-Pa.

After an unsuccessful tryout for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] baseball team,&lt;ref name=Enough&gt;{{cite news |author=Vanessa Gezari |title=Hazelton mayor says enough, already! |url= http://www.sptimes.com/2006/07/02/Worldandnation/Hazelton_mayor_says_e.shtml |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=2006-07-02 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barletta went to work for his family's construction and heating oil business.

In 1984, Barletta founded a pavement marking company, Interstate Road Marking Corporation, which he sold in 2000. At the time of the sale, his firm had grown to become the largest of its kind in Pennsylvania.

==Mayor of Hazleton==
He was defeated for a seat on the Hazleton City Council in 1996, but won two years later. In 1999, he defeated Jack Mundie for mayor, taking 66% of the vote&lt;ref name=Elected&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Tutino |title=Barletta Elected Hazelton Mayor |work=Wilkes Barre Times Leader |date=1999-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overcoming a Democratic registration edge in the city.&lt;ref name=Beyond&gt;{{cite news |author=Bill O'Boyle |title=Beyond the city limits |work=Wilkes Barre Times Leader |date=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He took office on January 3, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Councilmen Skeptical of Candidates |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WB&amp;s_site=timesleader&amp;p_multi=WB&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB71A947A7174C6&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |date=2000-01-02 |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barletta was reelected as mayor in 2003 and 2007. In 2007, Barletta was nominated in both the Republican and Democratic primary elections. Barletta defeated the Democratic candidate, former Mayor Michael Marsicano, on the Democratic ballot as a write-in.&lt;ref name=Foe&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Rubincam |title=Mayor Who Targeted Illegals Wins _ Twice |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/05/15/national/a232225D09.DTL&amp;type=politics |work=Associated Press, Printed in the San Francisco Chronicle |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration ordinance, lawsuit and financial distress===
In 2006, Barletta made headlines for his efforts opposing illegal immigration in Hazleton vowing to make the city "one of the toughest places in the United States" for illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="Void"&gt;{{cite news |author=Julia Preston |title=Judge Voids Ordinance on Illegal Immigrants |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/us/27hazelton.html |work=New York Times |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barletta introduced and the city council approved the Illegal Immigration Relief Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/new-member-of-the-week/167251-barletta-makes-pitch-on-immigration|title=Barletta makes pitch on immigration|last=Mali|first=Meghashyam|date=2011-06-20|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance allowed the city to deny a business permit to employers who hired illegal immigrants and gave the city authority to fine landlords up to $1,000 for leasing to illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="Void" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dwayne Parker |title=Hazleton Immigration Laws Head to Court |url=http://wfmz.com/view/?id=567942 |work=69 News |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also made English the official language of Hazleton, prohibiting city employees from translating documents into any language without official authorization.&lt;ref name="Notice"&gt;{{cite news |author=Michael Powell and Michelle García |title=Pa.

In July 2007, District Court Judge James M. Munley ruled that the act was unconstitutional for interfering with Federal immigration laws and violating the due process of individuals, employers and landlords.&lt;ref name="Void" /&gt; The ruling was upheld on appeal to the [[United States courts of appeals|United States Court of Appeals]] on September 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/us/10immig.html Court Rejects a City’s Efforts to Restrict Immigrants], Julia Preston, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a public statement shortly after the decision, Barletta vowed to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesleader.com/news/Federal-appeals-court-affirmsreverses-parts-of-Hazleton-immigration-ordinance.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719172037/http://www.timesleader.com/news/Federal-appeals-court-affirmsreverses-parts-of-Hazleton-immigration-ordinance.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court declined to hear the case.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/kris-kobachs-lucrative-trail-of-courtroom-defeats|title=Kris Kobach’s Lucrative Trail of Courtroom Defeats — ProPublica|date=2018-08-01|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|others=Jessica Huseman,Blake Paterson,Bryan Lowry,Hunter Woodall|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the town of Hazleton was ordered to reimburse the ACLU $1.4 million in legal fees (which was more than one tenth of the annual revenue of the town for 2017), and the town, which was already in debt to the tune of $6 million, had to take additional loans to pay the fees.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development declared that the town of Hazleton was financially distressed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Elections===

====2002====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2002#District 11|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 11|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 11|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 11}}

In 2002, Barletta ran as the Republican candidate in the 11th District against nine-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Paul E. Kanjorski|Paul Kanjorski]]. The 11th had long been considered the most Democratic district in Pennsylvania outside of [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]]. However, Barletta was viewed as a very strong candidate—the first credible Republican challenger Kanjorski had faced since his 1986 reelection bid—since he was a very popular Republican mayor from a heavily Democratic city. Barletta lost, taking 42.4% of the vote. The race might have been much closer had the state legislature not decided to move heavily Democratic [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], previously the heart of the 10th District, to the 11th. Barletta lost the district's share of [[Lakawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], home to Scranton, by 32 points; he only trailed in the old 11th by 9,000 votes.&lt;ref name=2002Election&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Pennsylvania General Election Results |url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=7&amp;OfficeID=11 |publisher=Pennsylvania Secretary of State, Bureau of Elections, Commissions and Licensure |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That race was one of very few nationwide where a Republican challenger had a credible chance at unseating a Democratic incumbent. Barletta lost to Kanjorski 48%-52%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=28&amp;OfficeID=11#11 |title=Commonwealth of PA - Elections Information |publisher=Electionreturns.state.pa.us |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208193742/http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=13&amp;ElectionID=28&amp;OfficeID=11 |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to losing Lackawanna County by 12,800 votes. Barletta won the territory that had been in the district prior to the 2000s round of redistricting by almost 4,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=15&amp;ElectionID=28&amp;OfficeID=11&amp;DistrictID=11 |title=Commonwealth of PA - Elections Information |publisher=Electionreturns.state.pa.us |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203015641/http://www.electionreturns.state.pa.us/ElectionsInformation.aspx?FunctionID=15&amp;ElectionID=28&amp;OfficeID=11&amp;DistrictID=11 |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010====
Barletta announced on December 9, 2009, that he would once again run for Congress in 2010. He won his party's nomination on Tuesday, May 18, 2010. Barletta won the General Election on November 2, 2010 against Kanjorski by a 55%-45% margin. City Council President Joe Yannuzzi succeeded Barletta as Mayor of Hazleton on December 15, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zito |first=Salena |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/s_673592.html |title=Rust Belt battlegrounds - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |publisher=Pittsburghlive.com |date=2010-03-28 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}
Before the 2012 election, it was widely expected that the state legislature would [[gerrymander]] Barletta's district to make it safer for him. In the 2008 presidential election, [[Barack Obama]] carried Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district with 57% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swingstateproject.com/diary/4161/presidential-results-by-congressional-district-20002008|title=Presidential Results by Congressional District, 2000-2008 – Swing State Project|website=swingstateproject.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new map, as expected, significantly altered the 11th. Heavily Democratic Scranton and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] were shifted to the 17th District. To make up for the loss of population, the 11th absorbed some heavily Republican territory to the north and south that had previously been in the neighbouring 5th, 10th, 17th and 19th districts, pushing it as far south as the suburbs of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]. The new district is approximately ten points more Republican than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2008, President Obama would have only won 47 percent of the vote here to [[John McCain]]'s 51 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/11/19/1163009/-Daily-Kos-Elections-presidential-results-by-congressional-district-for-the-2012-2008-elections Presidential results by congressional district] at [[Daily Kos]]&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared that the legislature wanted to protect Barletta by packing as many of northeast Pennsylvania's Democratic voters into the 17th as possible.

Barletta won reelection with 58 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/PA/house/11 |title=U.S. House: Pennsylvania District 11 (Barletta vs Stilp)|work=CNN|accessdate=August 1, 2016|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 Senate race===
{{Main|United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2018}}
On July 31, 2017, the Associated Press reported that Barletta was preparing to seek the GOP nomination to challenge incumbent Democrat [[Bob Casey Jr.|Bob Casey]] for Casey's Senate seat in the [[United States elections, 2018|2018 midterm elections]]. He officially announced on August 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/a42c2703411641f9984940ae41d23d70/AP-source:-Barletta-to-seek-US-Senate-seat-held-by-Bob-Casey|title=AP source: Barletta to seek US Senate seat held by Bob Casey|website=AP News|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/barletta-announces-his-candidacy-for-senate|title= Barletta Announces His Candidacy for Senate|work=August 29, 2017|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later secured the Republican nomination, but ultimately lost to Casey in the general election on November 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Pennsylvania Election Results|accessdate=May 16, 2018|url=https://www.politico.com/election-results/2018/pennsylvania/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
According to ''Vox'', Barletta is "considered to be generally more moderate than other House Republicans, though he almost always toes the party line on major votes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/15/17355460/lou-barletta-2018-pennsylvania-senate-election|title=Lou Barletta wins Republican nomination in the 2018 Pennsylvania Senate race|work=Vox|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
Barletta voted for [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act|Micah's law]],&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; which prohibits abortion of fetuses starting with the twentieth week of pregnancy, when anti-abortion advocates contend that fetuses can be born prematurely with medical assistance and feel pain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/354958-pass-abortion-bill-science-and-basic-human-decency-say-these-babies-are Pass abortion bill — science and basic human decency say these babies are worth saving] (The Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; with exceptions for victims of rape and incest who have undergone counseling and for cases of danger to the life of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/36 H.R.36 - Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act] (United States Congress)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donald Trump===
Barletta is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/primaries-set-november-races-pennsylvania-nebraska-oregon-n874536?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma|title=Trump backer wins GOP nod to take on Sen.

Lou Barletta endorses Trump, hopes others will too|last1=Collins|first1=Eliza|date=March 22, 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''NBC News'', "Barletta is a favorite of Trump... Trump asked Barletta to run for Senate."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Barletta was reportedly considered for a position in the Trump administration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 2018 Senate campaign, Barletta pledged to "give President Trump the help he needs".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Economy and budget===
On April 15, 2011, Barletta voted with the Republican majority for [[Paul Ryan]]'s budget. Barletta has characterized a [[balanced budget amendment]] as a gimmick and said he will not vote to raise the debt ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standardspeaker.com/news/barletta-discusses-stance-on-budget-matters-1.1135926?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Barletta discusses stance on budget matters|author=Tom Ragan|date=22 April 2011|publisher=The Standard Speaker|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Barletta voted for the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]], the Republican Party's tax reform legislation.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In supporting the legislation, Barletta tweeted, "Our #TaxReform package doubles standard deduction, brings $$$ back home, and reduces rates for ALL taxpayers. We will #MAGA."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/pennsylvania/statements/2017/dec/06/lou-barletta/pa-rep-lou-barletta-overstates-benefits-house-tax-/|title=PA Rep. Lou Barletta overstates benefits of the House tax bi|work=@politifact|accessdate=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[PolitiFact]], Barletta's claim is "mostly false", as the tax plan in 2018 cuts taxes for approximately 75% of Americans, while increasing them on 7%; by 2027, the tax plan will raise taxes for more than 25% of Americans.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Healthcare===
Barletta opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare) and voted to repeal it.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/pennsylvania/articles/2018-10-14/pre-existing-conditions-ad-inflames-casey-barletta-race|title=Pre-Existing Conditions Ad Inflames Casey, Barletta Race|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barletta had threatened not to support Obamacare repeal because he wanted the repeal legislation to prohibit undocumented immigrants from applying for health insurance tax credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-lou-barletta-opposes-gop-obamacare-repeal-bill-20170321-story.html|title=Lou Barletta opposes GOP Obamacare repeal bill|last=Olson|first=Laura|work=themorningcall.com|accessdate=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting with President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, Barletta said that they had promised to bring up separate legislation to prohibit undocumented immigrants from accessing health insurance tax credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/capitol-ideas/mc-lou-barletta-switches-to-a-yes-on-obamacare-repeal-bill-20170322-story.html|title=Lou Barletta switches to a 'yes' on Obamacare repeal bill|last=Olson|first=Laura|work=themorningcall.com|accessdate=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Barletta said that the repeal of the Affordable Care Act would not have weakened protections for individuals with preexisting conditions; experts said that the repeal would have given states the option to seek waivers whereby insurers would be allowed to raise prices for individuals with preexisting conditions who did not have continuous coverage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In 2014, Barletta introduced a bill to repeal a provision in the Affordable Care Act which required that volunteer emergency responders be offered health care by the organization they volunteer with.&lt;ref name="PeteGOPeyes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/200316-gop-hoping-dems-help-expand-obamacare-exemptions|title=GOP eyes Dem help on ObamaCare|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|date=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barletta argued that the bill was necessary because it would be prohibitively expensive for some of organizations to provide insurance.&lt;ref name="PeteGOPeyes" /&gt;

===Immigration===
Barletta supports President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] imposing a ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying: "I commend President Trump for suspending the refugee program, and in particular for Syria and the six other countries, because they are unquestionably terrorist havens and hotspots."&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/heres-where-republicans-stand-on-president-trumps-controversial-travel-ban/|title=Whip Count: Here's where Republicans stand on Trump's controversial travel ban|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|date=January 31, 2017|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Barletta opposed [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007|comprehensive immigration reform]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/25/politics/kfile-lou-barletta-american-free-press/index.html|title=GOP Senate candidate Lou Barletta did interview in 2006 with Holocaust-denying publication|last=CNN|first=Andrew Kaczynski and Chris Massie,|work=CNN|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, CNN reported that Barletta had been associated with a number of fringe anti-immigration groups and organizations.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; In 2006, he gave an interview to American Free Press, an outlet that said that 9/11 was a "Jewish plot" and denies the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; In 2007, Barletta appeared with American Free Press' "roving editor" Mark Anderson, a Bilderberg conspiracy theorist and Holocaust denier, at a Hazleton rally in support of Anderson.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; At the rally, Barletta said that the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that the Bush administration was pursuing, would reward some immigrants who are "murders, rapists, thieves, and terrorists" with legal status.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; In 2007, Barletta gave an interview to Americans for Immigration Control, which believes the "annual tidal wave of over a million immigrants (legal and illegal) is endangering our American way of life."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; In 2011, Barletta spoke at an event hosted by the anti-Muslim journal The Social Contract, whose editor is a white nationalist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2011, he appeared at an event hosted by the ultra-conservative student group Youth for Western Civilization, which opposes "radical multiculturalism, political correctness, racial preferences, mass immigration, and socialism."&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When asked whether Barletta had known of the views of the people and groups mentioned in the CNN story at the time he associated with them, Barletta spokesperson Jon Anzur responded that Barletta had "always condemned 'hate, bigotry, and racial supremacy in all its forms.'" Anzur added, "'Of course Lou was not aware of these individuals’ background[s]….As the mayor of a small city, Lou didn't have the resources or staff to screen everyone who asked him questions… Lou did 27 interviews [one day], from World News Tonight to Tucker Carlson. Lou had one assistant, not a team of consultants…'"&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Anzur also noted that Barletta stated that a New Jersey Ku Klux Klan organization that wanted to demonstrate in Hazleton in 2007 was not welcome, and that Barletta had renounced a 2008 endorsement he had received from former Ku Klux Klan leader [[David Duke]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Luciano Gaucci''' (born December 28, 1938 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] entrepreneur and sportsman. He was the owner of various clubs:
* [[Perugia Calcio]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Perugia]], [[Umbria]].
* [[Viterbese Calcio]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Viterbo]], [[Lazio]].
* [[S.S. Sambenedettese Calcio]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in  [[San Benedetto del Tronto]], [[Marche]]
* [[Calcio Catania]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]].

He was also vice-president of [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] football club during the presidential period of [[Dino Viola]] in the 1980s.

==Ahn controversy==

During the [[2002 World Cup]], South Korean player [[Ahn Jung-Hwan]] - then on loan to Gaucci's [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] football club - scored a [[golden goal]] that eliminated Italy from the World Cup. Furious, Gaucci immediately made public comments about cancelling Ahn's contract and was quoted as saying, "I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football." While he soon took back his words, and offered to outright buy Ahn's contract, Ahn rejected his penitence, with his agent stating, "He will never play again for Perugia... We will never consider his transfer to Perugia, which mounted a character assassination against Ahn just because he scored against Italy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/south_korea/newsid_2064000/2064069.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; WORLD CUP &amp;#124; South Korea &amp;#124; Ahn 'rejects Perugia return' |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-06-26 |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Luciano Gaucci also owned Allevamento White Star, a [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse breeding]] and [[horse racing|racing]] operation who gained international fame in the late 1980s with the European Champion thoroughbred [[Tony Bin]], winner of six [[Group One]] races including France's most prestigious event, the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]]. Gaucci also owned multiple stakes race winner [[Sikeston (horse)|Sikeston]] as well as [[Dr Devious]], a colt he sold to [[United States|American]] [[weight loss]] guru [[Jenny Craig|Sidney H. Craig]] and who won England's [[1992 Epsom Derby]].

==Bankrupt and escape==
After [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] fell bankrupt in 2005, the Italian magistrature started an inquiry on him and his sons Alessandro and Riccardo; after such events, Luciano Gaucci escaped to [[Santo Domingo]], [[Dominican Republic]] where he stayed four years on hiding. He was subsequently condemned to a three-year suspended jail sentence. Gaucci returned to Italy on March 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9490">The '''Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration''' ('''MFT-MBA''') is a national [[standardized exam]] administered in the United States at the end of [[MBA]] programs. It is a [[comprehensive exam|comprehensive exit exam]]. The MFT-MBA aims to assess skills, knowledge, and reasoning ability within the domain of standard MBA curriculum.&lt;ref name="Test Description"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/mft_mba_flyer.pdf |title=MFT MBA Flyer |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS) and has been used in the MBA programs of over 300 U.S. universities.&lt;ref name="2013 4FMF Data Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |title=2013 Major Field Test Comparative Data Guide: Major Field Test for Master of Business Administration (MBA) |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122194137/http://www.ets.org/s/mft/pdf/acdg_mba.pdf |archivedate=January 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Most MBA programs require an exit exam to gauge students' comprehensive competency in the field of business management.&lt;ref name="Study Guide"&gt;{{cite book| last =Phelan| first =James| title =The Major Field Test (MFT) for MBA Study Guide| publisher =Practical Application Publications| date =2014| location =Charleston, SC| isbn =0-9779773-5-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MFT-MBA began being offered in 2002.

==Content==

The MFT-MBA is based on MBA core curriculum.  Unlike tests that are not aligned to anything but their own curriculum, the MFT-MBA emphasizes content validity.   In order to display [[normative|normativity]] and ensure a consensus of what best reflects core curriculum, the content is constructed using results of a national curriculum survey.  According to ETS, content experts from a diverse representation of higher education institutions (including Major Field Test users and nonusers) participate in this survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/ |title=Test Content Overview |publisher=Educational Testing Service |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basing the exam on core curriculum makes it a level playing field exam, giving it meaningful results and enabling it to measure reasoning ability.&lt;ref name="Honors Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.t10mba.com/admission |title=Membership Admission Requirements |publisher=T10 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Test Description" /&gt;

The test contains 124 [[multiple-choice]] questions.

'''Marc Christopher Gwynne Ellis''' (born 8 October 1971) is a New Zealand businessman, television presenter, and former [[rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] footballer of the 1990s and 2000s. A graduate of the [[University of Otago]], his primary business interests are in [[Charlie's]], a juice company. During the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] he scored six tries in the game against [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]], which is the record for the most tries by an individual in a Rugby World Cup match.&lt;ref name=RWCPlayerRecords&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/statistics/season=0/type=Points/team=0/player=0/records/index.html|title=Player Records (RWC Overall)|publisher=rugbyworldcup.com|accessdate=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NPC==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2017}}
Ellis started out for [[Otago Rugby Union|Otago]] in the [[National Provincial Championship|NPC]] in 1991 when he was playing for the club side University, and he was selected for the NZ Colts. He made a name for himself while playing for Otago, which earned him [[All Black]] selection in 1992. Ellis stayed with Otago until 1995 when he switched code to rugby league. In 1998, after two seasons of league, Ellis played for North Harbour in the NPC, where he remained for another two seasons. Ellis played his last season of NPC in 2000 for North Harbour.

==All Blacks==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}
Ellis first played for the All Blacks in 1992, against a South Australian Invitation XV, then against Australian club and invitation sides. He scored two tries in his first test, in 1993, at [[Rugby union positions#New Zealand terms|first five-eighth]] against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], won 51–15 by the All Blacks. A week later he was selected for the test against England where he also played first five. Ellis played his last match of 1993 against the [[Barbarians F.C.|Barbarians]]. For the 1994 season, Ellis was not selected for the All Blacks and did not attend the NZ trial due to injury, but he did play for the New Zealand XV and New Zealand Universities sides. In 1995 Ellis was re-called to the All Blacks for the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|World Cup]], playing five games on the wing. He scored seven tries in the tournament, six of them in the 145–17 win over Japan.

==Rugby league==
At the end of the 1995 season Ellis switched to league to play for the [[Auckland Warriors]] where he joined his All Blacks teammate [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]]. Ellis was [[List of New Zealand Warriors players|Warrior number 29]] when he played his first match in [[Auckland Warriors 1996|1996]]. He played for the Warriors between 1996 and 1998, playing in 36 matches and scoring 103 points through 11 tries, 29 goals and 1 field goal. 
Ellis also represented the [[New Zealand national rugby league team]], the Kiwis, in 5 matches.

==Super 12==
Ellis missed out on the first few seasons of the [[Super 12]] due to his [[rugby league]] career, but when he returned to [[rugby union]] in 1998 it was only a short time before he was into the Super 12. After playing a solid season for [[North Harbour Rugby Union|North Harbour]] in the NPC Ellis was picked for [[Blues (Super rugby franchise)|the Blues]], where he played one season. In 1999, after strong seasons with [[North Harbour Rugby Union|North Harbour]] and the Blues, Ellis was named in one of the early training squads for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]], but he was not selected in the final team and played for NZ A instead. In 2000 Ellis played his final Super 12 season for [[Highlanders (rugby)|the Highlanders]] before retiring from rugby.

==Post playing career==
In the early 2000s, Ellis was a popular figure on New Zealand television, often appearing alongside fellow former rugby union and league player [[Matthew Ridge]], notably on light-hearted documentaries. In 2004, as part of a one such programme, Ellis took part in and won the famous and eccentric British annual event, the [[Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=3570057 Falling down hills: Ellis takes the big cheese]", ''New Zealand Herald'', 2 June 2004. Retrieved 10 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he released his autobiography, ''Crossing the Line'', which details all aspects of his life.&lt;ref name="NZH_NextChapter"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Linda Herrick|title=Marc Ellis writes next chapter|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=18&amp;objectid=10404805|publisher=NZ Herald|date=7 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis has since co-authored ''Good Fullas: A Guide to Kiwi Blokes'', released in 2010 with friend and New Zealand Consul General to Italy, Charlie Haddrell.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_4022866"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/4022866/Marcs-bloke-spotting|title=Marc's bloke spotting|author=Dudding, Adam|date=15 August 2010|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2005, Ellis purchased [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] tablets from a drug dealer who was under surveillance by the [[New Zealand Police]]. Ellis was among many high-profile figures caught in the operation, code-named Aqua. His court appearance put an end to a poorly-kept secret, as despite the fact he had originally obtained name suppression, his identity was widely known by the New Zealand public. Ellis was fined $300.&lt;ref name="NZH_EllisResigns"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Louisa Cleave|title=Marc Ellis resigns from Charlie's, holds on to TV job|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10342698|publisher=NZ Herald|date=27 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2007, as part of an elaborate marketing ploy for his latest business venture, Ellis detonated 600&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives on top of [[Rangitoto Island]], a nature reserve in [[Auckland]]'s [[Waitematā Harbour]]. This was an attempt to create an illusion that the volcanic island was erupting. The [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Conservation]] described the stunt as "demoralising and very disappointing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puffing Rangitoto distresses residents|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1448304/4202557.xhtml|work=Te Karere|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a total fire ban on the island because of ecological significance.

'''Multi-channel analytics''' refers to the business process whereby multiple sets of data from different sources (i.e. channels) are linked and/or housed together and then analysed to provide business and in particular customer and marketing intelligence - thereby guiding effective and successful decision-making.

Businesses interact with their users and potential clients across multiple channels including [[television]], [[telephone]]s, the [[Internet]], [[mobile phone]]s, and [[retail store]]s. Multi-channel analytics allows businesses to take data from all these sources and where possible make sense of it. This allows them to better understand, segment and therefore target their customers and potential users.

== Providers ==
Multi-channel analytics services are provided by a number of businesses including:

*[[Omniture]]
*[[Webtrends]]
*[The Porter Consultancy]

'''Pery Igel''' (November 27, 1921 – September 24, 1998) was a Brazilian businessman. Igel was [[Ultrapar|Ultra]]'s second president, succeeding his father and company's founder, [[Ernesto Igel]].

==Biography==
Igel was the administrator and second president of Ultra. He took over the company created by his father, [[Ernesto Igel]], in 1959. After two years as president, Igel moved the headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;ref name=DiskBrasilGas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diskbrasilgas.com.br/historia/index.htm|title=História|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Pery’s administration, [[Oxiteno]] and Ultracargo were founded, two of the five divisions of Ultra, along with [[Ultragaz]] (first division of Ultra), as well as [[Petróleo Ipiranga|Ipiranga]] and [[Extrafarma]], which were incorporated to the group respectively in 2007 and 2014.

Under his administration, the company created and also dissociated a number of other activities that have stopped being related to Ultra's long-term strategy, such as a domestic appliances retailer (Ultralar), an engineering company (Ultratec), a frozen food organization (Supergel,) and the fertilizer industry (Ultrafértil.)&lt;ref name=EconomiaiG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economia.ig.com.br/com-acordo-de-acionista-prorrogado-ultra-planejara-seu-futuro-nos-proximos-dois-anos/n1237575355745.html |title=Com acordo de acionista prorrogado,Ultra planejará seu futuro dos próximos dois anos|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igel stepped down as CEO in 1981 and appointed Vice President [[Paulo Cunha (businessman)|Paulo Cunha]] to the position. Igel became president of the Ultra's Board of Directors and remained its main [[shareholder]].&lt;ref name=Valor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valor.com.br/sites/default/files/upload_element/22-02_ultrapar_balanco_ok_todos.pdf|title=Ultrapar em 2012 |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Após deixar a presidência executiva, Pery seguiu como presidente do Conselho Administrativo do Ultra e seu principal acionista.&lt;ref name=GoogleNews&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1246&amp;dat=19980926&amp;id=imYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-rcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6513,1677535&amp;hl=pt-BR|title=País perde um de seus maiores empresários |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death in September 1998, Igel transferred the controlling shares of Ultra to his family and to a small group of Ultra executives through the creation of a holding company.&lt;ref name="PacíficoGestãodeRecursos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pagr.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Pacifico-Acoes-1T14.pdf|title=Pacífico Ações |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Administradores&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.administradores.com.br/artigos/economia-e-financas/sucessao-empresarial-como-manter-o-negocio-nas-proximas-geracoes/36933/|title=Sucessão empresarial: como manter o negócios nas próximas gerações. |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geein.fclar.unesp.br/jornais_det.php?codigo=7781|title=Igel faz madeira plástica com reciclados |accessdate=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''René Willums Leegte''' (born 8 July 1968 in [[The Hague]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician and former businessman. As a member of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] he was a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives of the Netherlands]] between 26 October 2010 and 24 March 2015. He focused on matters of [[natural environment]], [[sustainable development]] and [[energy]].

In January 2015 Leegte laid down his party spokesmanship for [[Groningen gas field|gas winning in Groningen]] and earthquakes in the region. He did so after having a conversation on the topic and party strategy on it being overheard during a trainride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2014049-leegte-vvd-staat-dossier-gaswinning-af.html |title=Leegte (VVD) staat dossier gaswinning af |publisher=Nederlandse Omroep Stichting |date=18 January 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leegte resigned as member of the House of Representatives on 24 March 2015 after having had an additional paid job for over a year at an organisation which was subjected to his parliamentary portfolio. Leegte did not enter the job in the register, nor reported the earnings, he also used his parliamentary emailadress for the additional job. Leegte felt this conflicted with the integrity rules of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and thus resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2026581-vvd-tweede-kamerlid-rene-leegte-stapt-op |title=VVD-Tweede Kamerlid René Leegte stapt op |language=Dutch |publisher=Nederlandse Omroep Stichting |date=24 March 2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8301">'''Retail concentration''' refers to the [[Market share|market-share]] generally belonging to the top 4 or 5 mass distribution firms present in a regional market, as a percentage of the total.

Retail concentration is not simply a [[concentration ratio]] as is emerging in the food sector. This is due to two factors: the particular relevance retail is gaining on a global scale, and the particular shape of the food supply chain.

In recent years, Retail Concentration moved ahead with fusions and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capgemini.com/resources/news/consumers_drive_food_industry_transformation__global_brands_retail_formats_consolidation__says_new_report/{{broken citation|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the entire food supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/070/2004/00000106/00000008/art00004 |title=Increasing retail concentration: Evidence from the UK food retail |publisher=British Food Journal vol. 106 |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; We can assume with Grievink (2003) that in a few years there will be only 5 dominant actors in the globalised food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi%2Dspecial/1249/state%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dart%2Din%2Dfood%2Ehtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204235802/http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi-special/1249/state-of-the-art-in-food.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |accessdate=December 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same researcher states that in the 90's the top-5 food manufacturers could count on twice the [[cash flow]] of the top-5 retailers. Nowadays the relation is inverted: the top 5 retailers can count on twice that of the top-5 manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Thus, the food chain has become increasingly [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]], with global corporations able to coordinate inputs from the seed to the field, from the stable to the table. Retail concentration by one hand is the answer that retail is giving to compete with the giants of agrofood industry. By the other hand, is the agrofood industry in itself searching to arrive directly to the consumers, through a refined relations system. In this process, private labels are increasingly attracting consumers, and are expected to grow more and more on their fidelisation strategy, beating on quality, safety and also ethical values.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foodinternational.net/articles/efi-special/583/private-labels-why-europe-is-leading-the-pack.html  {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/thematic_articles/article13524_en.htm {{broken citation|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed solutions to face with overall price increase about foodstuff. Among the measures proposed, several relate to the retail power recently acquired.

In particular, the payments delay to the producers; the additional fees asked to the producers to place on the shelves branded products; price transparency; [[better regulation]] on promotional activities and openings/closing time are all issues on the agenda.

For supporters, retail concentration means more chances for consumers, lower prices, better quality. For opponents, by the contrary, the disappearing of traditional shops, of food culture, of neighborhood life in general.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and [[Physical exercise|Physical Activity]], 2006 3: 33 “Understanding environmental influences on nutrition and physical activity behaviors: where should we look and what should we count?”, Kylie Ball, Anna F Timperio and David A Crawford&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, too much concentration means squeezing the price of industry and of agriculture, which can lead to outsourcing food from anywhere it can cost less, without a truly long term impact assessment.

Tim Lang (Food Wars, Earthscan London 2004) described the retail concentration phenomenon such as a "food war", in which winners and losers take place. Tim Lang talks about "food clusters" ([p.&amp;nbsp;84]) to better handle the idea of concentration along the entire food chain.
There are a lot of legal instruments which allow to get more and more concentrated.
Acquisition being the first one, follow mergers, [[joint venture]]s, partnerships and more not formalised contracts/ agreements.
Note that the "hypermarketization" is not limited to the [[Western world|Western World]], but supermarkets rise fast also in the [[Developing country|less developed countries]] and in the East and in the South of the World.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=Shyamal|author2=Ashok Gulati |author3=E. Gumbira Sa'id |title=The Rise of Supermarkets and Vertical Relationships in the Indonesian Food Value Chain|journal=Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development|date=June–December 2005|volume=2|issue=1 &amp; 2|url=http://www.searca.org/ajad/archives/v-02/01-02/ajad_v2_n1_n2_chowdhury_etal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Regarding that, there are a lot of concerns, pretending that the overwhelming power of retailing is making poorer and poorer farmers, in particular in the LDC (Less Developed Countries).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agobservatory.org/library.cfm?RefID=46604 {{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "crowding out" effect on local agricultures it is basically due to the global sourcing of the produces, wherever they cost less and offer more. To say it with the words of the Italian food-thinker Corrado Finardi to fairly function, the agricultural system has a different, slower timeline than the market (in agriculture counts the long term investment, while on the [[Globalization|global market]] it is more important the precise moment in which [[supply and demand]] match).

'''Market concentration (considering the upper and lower tails)'''
A more refined form, which calculates the percentage of last 4/ competitors on the first 4/5. 
Eve in its static version, it measures the level of competition in the sector. 
A diachronic comparison allows for even more insights.
 
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
'''Herfindahl Hirschman Index'''
This index is used in Europe and in the USA for antitrust regulatory purposes, in order to assess the feasibility of mergers and acquisitions.
The HHI is calculated as the relative frequencies squared and summed, comprehensive of all actors in the playfield. So far, it gives more importance to biggest player in proportion. 
Even if interesting, a HHI, often wrongly assess the real behaviours on the field.
Consider, for the comparison sake, the retail concentration in Europe. Top 5 retail distributors account for the 70% of the market share. Even if apparently it gives the idea of a highly concentrated market, the HHI does not allow for that conclusion in most of the cases. 
Following 3 different scenarios, we explored the relative market shares of the single actors.
1 scenario: 1= 19%, 2=15%, 3=14%, 4= 12%, 5=10% (total=70% for the top 5), remaining= 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 9%.
In this first case, where there is a linear distribution of market share among players, the HHI scores at 0,121 (considered a moderate concentration indicator)

2 scenario: 14% *5 (top 5 players =70%, having equal market share), the remaining, each equalling 3% (3%*10). In this second case, the HHI scores an 0,098, which stands for an unconcentrated market at all. We can deliberately make some reflections on that, since the HHI seems not taking into account opportunistic behaviours in the direction of oligopoly. It is assumed that, because of the equal market power of the top 5 actors, they are going to compete (even if history shows that more probably they find some form of implicit agreement…). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,033571429 (very low…).

3 scenario. First player= 20%, followers 12%, then 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 4% and the last 10 each 3%.
In this case the HHI is 0,0944 (not concentrated market, even if not highly competitive environment). Standardised from 0 to 1, the value is 0,0378 (very low…).

Even in a case where there is one leading competitor which “makes the market” as in the 3rd scenario, the HHI stays relatively low.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13505">{{About|secretaries as leaders in organizations|the common meaning of secretary as an office support worker, which can also be a title|secretary}}
'''Secretary''' is a title often used in organizations to indicate a person having a certain amount of [[authority]], [[Power (social and political)|power]], or importance in the organization. Secretaries announce important events and communicate to the organization. The term is derived from the Latin word {{lang|la|secernere}}, "to distinguish" or "to set apart", the passive participle ({{lang|la|secretum}}) meaning "having been set apart", with the eventual connotation of something private or confidential, as with the English word ''secret.'' A {{lang|la|secretarius}} was a person, therefore, overseeing business confidentially, usually for a powerful individual (a king, pope, etc.).

The official title of the leader of most [[communist party|communist]] and [[socialist party|socialist]] political parties is the "'''General Secretary of the Central Committee'''" or "'''First Secretary of the Central Committee'''". When a communist party is in power, the General Secretary is usually the country's ''[[de facto]]'' leader (though sometimes this leader also holds state-level positions to monopolize power, such as a [[President#Presidents_as_head_of_state|presidency]] or [[premier]]ship in order to constitute ''[[de jure]]'' leadership of the state), such as [[China]] and [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Xi's here to stay: China leader tipped to outstay term|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3730755/Xis-stay-China-leader-tipped-outstay-term.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=9 August 2016|quote="A lot of analysts now see it as a given" that Xi will seek to stay [[Communist Party of China|Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], the [[China|country]]'s most powerful [[Paramount leader|post]], said Christopher K. Johnson, a former CIA analyst and now China specialist at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the term ''secretarius'' was used "from the beginning of the thirteenth century in the varying meanings of a confidential clerk, an ambassador, or a member of the king's council".&lt;ref name="Ruthven"&gt;J. Otway-Ruthven, ''The King's Secretary and the Signet Office in the XV Century'' (1939), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourteenth century, the title became strongly associated with the keeper of the king's [[signet ring|signet]].&lt;ref name="Ruthven"/&gt; From the [[Renaissance]] to the late 19th century, men involved in the daily correspondence and the activities of the powerful assumed the title of secretary. With time, like many titles, the term was applied to more and varied functions, leading to compound titles to specify the authority associated with its use, like general secretary or [[financial secretary]].

In some countries, such as the United States, the term ''secretary'' is used to indicate the holder of a [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level post. This usage derives in part from the desire of the founders of the United States to differentiate the country from the United Kingdom,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which denoted such offices as [[minister (government)|ministers]]. There are a number of popular variations of the title used to indicate that the secretary in question has a high degree of authority, such as '''general secretary''' (or, following usage in the [[Norman language]], '''secretary-general'''), '''first secretary''', and '''executive secretary'''.

In a [[club (organization)|club]] or [[society]], the secretary is also considered to be, in most cases, the third person in charge of the organization, after the president/chairman and vice president/vice chairman.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;''Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised'', 4th edition, Scott, Foresman and Company, Chicago, 1915, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–247.&lt;/ref&gt;  In smaller organizations, the secretary typically takes [[meeting minutes]], notifies members of meetings, contacts various persons in relation to the society, administers the day-to-day activities of the organization, and creates the order of business. The secretary of a [[non-governmental organization]] or [[international non-governmental organization]] can be vice president/vice chairman.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

The '''Services in the Internal Market Directive''' [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32006L0123 2006/123/EC] (also called the "'''Bolkestein Directive'''") is an [[European Union law|EU law]] aiming at establishing a [[single market]] for [[Service (economics)|services]] within the [[European Union]] (EU). Drafted under the leadership of the former [[European Commissioner|European Commissioner for the Internal Market]] [[Frits Bolkestein]], it has been popularly referred to by his name. It was seen as an important kick-start to the [[Lisbon Agenda]] which, launched in 2000, was an agreed strategy to make the EU "the world's most dynamic and competitive economy" by 2010.

The Bolkestein Directive was harshly criticised by left-wing European politicians, who stated that it would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe — hence the expression "[[Polish plumber]]" — resulting in [[social dumping]]. After the 2004 original draft had been substantially amended, the proposal was approved on 12 December 2006 by the European Parliament and Council, and adopted as the Directive 2006/123/EC.

==History==
===2004 original proposal: the three pillars===
Devised by the [[European Commission]] in March 2004, the first draft of the Services Directive propounded several important changes in the EU services market. Assuming every piece of regulation to be burdensome by default, the Directive required member states to justify all existing legislation on the grounds that it was non-discriminatory, necessary and proportional.

However, the changes proposed in the Directive would have not affected the professions, to which the rules of the country where the services are provided would continue to apply under the Directive on the Recognition of Diplomas. Nor, contrary to the popular belief that, for example, a [[Polish plumber]] could work in France under Polish [[labour law]]), would the changes have affected social legislation or health and safety at work (HSW). In these social fields the [[Posted Workers Directive|Posting-of-Workers Directive]] requires that short-term social protection, such as minimum wages and HSW, is governed by the rules of the country where the services are provided (the host country), while long-term benefits, such as pension and unemployment benefit contributions, remain with the country of origin (to which the posted workers returns after the service is over).

===Pros and cons===
====Arguments in favour of the original version====
Legally the Directive did not bring anything into EU law that was not already in the [[EC Treaty]] as interpreted by the Court of Justice. The "country of origin" principle had been gradually introduced into EU law on the freedom of movement of goods in the Cassis de Dijon case (1979) and into other areas, notably services and establishment, soon after. Secondary legislation cannot introduce rights and obligations that do not already have a basis in the Treaty. In this respect, the original draft of the Services Directive was not a novelty, but a clarification of the case law of the European Court of Justice, and a continuation of the "country of origin" principle, which had already been applied in the TV Without Frontiers Directive, the Second Banking Directive, the Third Insurance Directive, the E-Commerce Directive and others.

====Criticisms of the early draft====
[[File:Frits Bolkestein, 78.jpg|thumb|[[Frits Bolkestein]]]]
[[File:Bolkestein.gif|thumb|Protest against [[Frits Bolkestein]] in Brussels on March 19, 2005]]
[[File:CgtSyndicatBrussels.jpg|thumb|French and Belgian trade unions protesting against the directive in Brussels on 19 March 2005]]

The first version of the Bolkestein Directive provoked intense debate and mass protests in various EU countries, including [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. On 21 March 2005 nearly 100,000 people marched in [[Brussels]] to protest against the Directive. Critics argued that the Directive would erode many of the Member States' regulations governing industry and the environment, and would lead to competition between workers in different parts of Europe, resulting in a decline in income levels. The expression "[[Polish plumber]]" became famous during the French debate about the Directive, referring to the fear that under the Directive a Polish plumber would be able to work in France under Polish [[labour law]]s. Critics also charged that the Directive was a sign that "Anglo-Saxon" economic policy was running rampant over the EU and claimed that the Directive would inevitably lead to "[[social dumping]]" as companies and jobs were relocated to the lower-cost and less regulated economies of eastern Europe. They also claimed, falsely, that the Directive would have an adverse effect on social legislation and HSW (when, as mentioned above, it would have no effect on either).

===Developments during 2005===
On 22 March 2005 EU leaders agreed on a "far reaching" revision of the Directive to preserve the [[European social model]]. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] told an EU summit in Brussels that the changes planned by the Directive were "unacceptable". Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg declared: "If France wishes to eliminate the risk of social dumping, this will be addressed in the framework of the legislative procedure and of co-decision, which has been initiated." Modifications to the Directive were introduced at a later stage, in the normal course of the EU legislative process.

On 1 July 2005 the UK, which was in favour of the Directive, took the chair of the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Presidency]]. In [[Tony Blair]]'s speech to the European Parliament on 23 June he committed the UK Presidency to try to "resolve some of the hard dossiers," of which the Services Directive was one. However, agreement was not achieved during its Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4698524.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Services Directive | date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 14 to 16 February 2006 a plenary session of the [[European Parliament]] carried out its [[first reading]] of the Directive in [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopbolkestein.org/index.cfm?Content_ID=1484657 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nantes.indymedia.org/article.php3?id_article=7473 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2006 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament) voted 391-213 in favour of a proposed revision to the Directive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hix | first1 = Simon | last2 = Nourby | first2 = Abdul | title = After enlargement: voting patterns in the sixth European Parliament | journal = [[Legislative Studies Quarterly]] | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–174 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi= 10.3162/036298009788314282 | jstor = 20680234 | date = May 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3162/036298009788314282 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/HixandNoury-LSQ-May09.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; although it had already been "watered down" from the original version read to the European Parliament on 14 February, so much so that [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist]] MEP [[Evelyne Gebhardt]] said that the Directive had been "turned upside down," a claim contested by labour organisations. The majority of members of the two largest groupings in the Parliament, the conservative [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the centre-left [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) voted in favour of the revised draft. The [[Party of the European Left]], the [[European Green Party]] and the [[French Socialist Party]] voted against the new revision. Meanwhile, about 50,000 people demonstrated against the "country of origin principle" in Strasbourg.

====Suggested inclusions====
The proposed Directive would have covered:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/innovation/services-internal-market/article-132241 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Services of "[[general public interest]]" ([[public services]]), including, but not limited to, [[water]], [[sewage]] and [[waste]] management.
*Services provided to businesses, such as management consultancy, certification and testing, facilities management and advertising,
*Services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as real estate agencies, construction services, architects, distribution services, car rental and travel agencies.
*Consumer leisure services such as tourism, sports centres and amusement parks.

====Suggested exclusions====
The following, however, would have been excluded:
*[[Broadcasting]],
*[[Gambling]]
*[[Employment agency|Temporary employment agencies]],
*[[Legal]] and [[social]] services,
*[[Mail|Postal]] and [[Audiovisual services]],
*[[Publicly-funded health care|Public health care]] (but not [[Private Healthcare|private health care]]),
*[[Public transport]]

The controversial "[[country of origin]]" principle was explicitly left out, but there was no "country of destination" principle to replace it. The [[European Court of Justice]] would therefore be charged with deciding, through its [[jurisprudence]], which country's [[labour law]]s would apply in each case.

===Comments on the amended draft===
====Proponents of liberalisation====
Business groups stated that the new Directive would limit the benefits that the early version of the Directive would have provided.

The European Commission estimated that this proposed version of the Directive would have created an additional 600,000 jobs in the EU, would have boosted economic growth, and would have increased product quality and choice for consumers.

The ''Wall Street Journal'' estimated that the revised Directive would have failed in its objective: the liberalisation of services at the heart of the EU.

D. Godefridi of the Hayek Institute wrote in ''[[le Figaro]]'': "Services represent 70% of the European economy. In not liberalising these the EU remains below the objective of the founding treaties of 1957: there is no common European market. For ten years European economic project has moved backwards. On 30 May 2006 the European political elite buried the very essence of the European project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|title=?|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125094039/http://www.lefigaro.fr/debats/20060531.FIG000000250_directive_services_liberalisation_zero.html|archivedate=25 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opponents of liberalisation====
Left-wing and labour organisations maintained that the new version of the Directive was not as favourable to workers as it was made out to be. There was also concern that the "country of origin" principle would most likely still be applied by the European Court of Justice, as previous jurisprudence seemed to suggest. In particular, it was pointed out that member states would be prohibited from applying any kind of restricted authorisation to businesses in the fields covered by the Directive, which would, they claimed, make administration of labour laws close to impossible.

===Final revision===
On 5 April 2006 the [[European Commission]] presented a new version of the Directive to the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]], including most of the modifications voted by the MEPs, in accordance with the [[codecision procedure]]. On 29 May 2006 the Council approved the revised text, which subsequently was resubmitted to the Parliament for its second and final reading.

==Approval and implementation==
The Directive, after being substantially amended from the original proposal, was adopted on 12 December 2006 by the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the [[European Parliament]], and published on the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] on 27 December 2006 as the Directive 2006/123/EC. Therefore, the Directive on services in the internal market should have been completely implemented by the Member States by 28 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/news/2007/01/lavoro/servizi-nella-ue-pubblicata-la-direttiva_9145_33.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edilportale.com/normativa/direttiva-cee/2006/2006-123-ce/direttiva-del-parlamento-europeo-e-del-consiglio-relativa-ai-servizi-nel-mercato-interno-%28ex-bolkestein%29_9956.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/cedag-confusion-rgne-directive-services/article-184963&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the final version did not include the "country of origin" principle, the Directive instead reminded Member States of the principle of free movement, while accepting inroads when free movement collides with other public interests. However, before making such inroads, authorities have to verify and recognize any protection already provided in the country of origin - under the mutual recognition principle, they need to take into account what takes place in other countries before proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=2bc515ee-b254-42ef-94e9-143a4931249a&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The Services Directive, which came into force on 28 December 2009, requires all EU Member States to establish web portals so that anyone who provides a service will have a "point of single contact" where they can find out what legal requirements they need to meet to operate in the country in question. Service providers can also use the web portals to apply for any licence or permit they need.

The Directive should make it easier for EU service providers to operate in any other EU Member State. The UK's [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (Services Directive implementation team), working with marketing consultants, created the EUGO brand for use on point-of-single-contact portals across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/eu-go/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Normal''''' is a business book authored by Peter Hinssen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinssen|first=Peter|title=About Peter Hinssen|url=http://www.peterhinssen.com/about-peter-hinssen|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author describes a concept that we are now halfway through the digital revolution. And although we have already gone through a lot of changes, what lies ahead of us will be even more challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinssen|first=Peter|title=The New Normal|year=2010|publisher=.MachMedia|location=Belgium|isbn=9789081324250|pages=202|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Normal.html?id=-8EmTwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
In ''The New Normal'', Peter Hinssen presents how companies may address a society without digital limits. Hinssen points out that organizations are increasingly faced with customers and consumers who no longer tolerate limitations in terms of pricing, timing, patience, depth, privacy, convenience, intelligence.

A number of new rules will apply in the New Normal. Consumers will have zero tolerance for digital failure. They will expect to get internet access anytime, anyplace. Internet and connectivity will be just as ubiquitous as electricity. Consumers will demand fulfillment of their information needs instantaneously. The effect on companies will be tremendous. They were just getting used to coping with a 24-hour economy, and now they will have to cope with the ‘experience economy’: customers will demand interaction with providers of services and products on their conditions. They will expect the digital user experience to be easy and interesting. Every interaction with a customer must be viewed as a ‘make or break’ moment for the relationship with the customer.

IT departments too will have to adopt a new way of working. They will have to react more flexibly to the demands of the business side of the company. IT departments used to build big systems; now they will have to create small, flexible structures that can be adapted quickly. They no longer have to build pyramids; they must put up tents instead. In The New Normal, Hinssen looks at the way companies have to adapt their information strategy, their technology strategy, their innovation strategy and the way they are organized internally.

A '''trade office''', sometimes known as a '''trade representation''', '''commercial office''', or '''trade mission''', is an official establishment that promotes the [[commerce|commercial]] interests of a [[government]] (such as a city, state, or country) in a foreign [[Capital city|capital]]. The head of such an establishment is typically called a [[trade representative]] or commercial representative.

==Taiwan==
{{main|Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office}}

Due to the [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|limited recognition]] of the Republic of China ([[Taiwan]]) as a result of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]'s [[One-China policy]], many countries do not have formal diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese government. Taiwan's interests in these countries and these countries' interests in Taiwan are usually represented by one or more trade missions which function as [[de facto embassy|de facto embassies]] or [[consulate]]s.

'''Transformational Government''' is the use of computer-based information and communications technologies (ICT) to change the way governments work.  The term is commonly used to describe a government reform strategy which attempts to radically change the way people understand government, especially those working within government.  For example, it is often associated with a 'whole-of-government' viewpoint, which tries to foster cross-department collaboration and provide 'one-stop-shop' convenience in the delivery of services to citizens.

The term ''Transformational Government'' is usually used aspirationally, as denoting the 'highest' level of what [[e-government]] can achieve:  
# presence, where ICT, and usually websites, are used to provide information; 
# interaction, where government interacts with citizens, and departments interact with each other, online especially by email;
# transaction, where such things as paying taxes or licenses are carried out online;
# transformation, which involves a reinvention of government functions and how they operate.&lt;ref name=Gartner&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gartner Group|title=  Gartner's Four Phases of E-Government Model.  Research Note Tutorials|year=  2000|url=http://www.gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to developing countries, it is often associated with hopes of reducing corruption, and in relation to developed countries, with attempts to increase the involvement of the private and voluntary sectors in government activity.

==History==
During the last two decades, governments around the world have invested in ICT with the aim of increasing the quality and decreasing the cost of public services.  But over that time, as even the least developed countries have moved to websites, e-services and e-Government strategies, it has become increasingly clear that e-Government has not delivered all the benefits that were hoped for it.&lt;ref&gt;‘The failure of e-government in developing countries: a literature review’. The Electronic Journal on Information System in Developing Countries. Dada, D. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  One study found that 35% of e-government projects in developing countries resulted in total failures; and that 50% were partial failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eGovernment as a Carrier of Context - IGovernment Working Paper No.15, Institute for Development Policy and Management, University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K. Higher Education Admission Center (HEAC)  Heeks, R. (2004)|url=http://www.heac.gov.om/heac_en/index.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to these poor outcomes, there has been a shift of perspective to 'Transformational Government', aiming beyond purely technical aspects of better enabling e-government processes towards addressing the cultural and organisational barriers which have hindered public service benefits realisation. Researchers have defined the rationale for Transformational Government as “the exploitation of e-government such that benefits can be realized”.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic transformation of government in the UK: A
research agenda. European Journal of Information Systems 16, 327-335 Irani, Z., Elliman, T. and Jackson, P. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[OASIS (organization)|Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards]] (OASIS) published a report&lt;ref name="oasis-egov.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oasis-egov.org/library|title=Library of all approved outputs from the eGov Member Section - OASIS eGov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified a wide range of common pitfalls which have hampered many governments in achieving significant impacts through their technology investments.  However, OASIS also noted that:
:“…  an increasing number [of governments] are now getting to grips with the much broader and complex set of cultural and organizational changes which are needed for ICT to deliver significant benefits to the public sector. This new approach is generally referred to as Transformational Government.”

OASIS cites &lt;ref name="oasis-egov.org"/&gt; the UK and Australia as two of the leaders in this area:
: “Transformational Government…. encompasses a new "virtual" business layer within government which allows an integrated, government-wide, citizen-focused service to be presented to citizens across all channels, but at no extra cost and without having to restructure government to do so. Two very good examples of this new approach are South Australia’s “Ask Just Once” portal and the UK Government’s DirectGov portal, and the approach is explained in very good detail in the CS Transform’s white paper entitled "Citizen Service Transformation – a manifesto for change in the delivery of public services”.

== Countries with Transformational Government Initiatives ==
Within the last decade, this new emphasis on a Transformational Government approach can be seen from a number of countries:

==International initiatives==
The early pioneering work by some governments is now being picked up and championed by a range of global organizations which offer support to governments in moving to a Transformational Government approach. For example:
*The [[World Bank]] has set up an eTransform Initiative (ETI) with support from global IT partners such as Gemalto, IBM, L-1 Identity Solutions, Microsoft and Pfizer.  "The eTransform Initiative is about tapping information technology, expertise and experiences”, said Mohsen Khalil, Director of the World Bank Group’s Global Information and Communication Technologies Department.  “Government transformation is about change management facilitated by technology.  This initiative will facilitate the exchange of lessons and experiences among various governments and industry players, to maximize impact and lower risks of ICT-enabled government transformation.”
*A number of private sector organizations working in this area have published white papers which pull together global best practices on Government Transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/industry/publicsector/government/csp/solutions_directory.aspx|title=Microsoft in Government: technology solutions for government agencies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstransform.com/|title=Citizen Service Transformation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstransform.com/|title=Citizen Service Transformation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/Global/Research_and_Insights/Institute_For_Public_Service_Value/Research/Front-Office-Shared-Services.htm Sharing Front Office Services: The Journey to Citizen-Centric Delivery, Accenture 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
*OASIS launched (September 2010) a new Technical Committee tasked with producing a new global best practice standard for a Transformational Government Framework.  The Framework is expressed as a number of "Pattern Languages", each providing a detailed set of guidance notes and conformance clauses on how to deliver the required changes in practice.

'''Volunteering''' is generally considered an [[altruistic]] activity where an individual or group provides services for no financial or social gain "to benefit another person, group or organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=John|title=Volunteering|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2000|issue=26|page=215|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.215|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteering is also renowned for skill development and is often intended to promote goodness or to improve human [[quality of life]]. Volunteering may have positive benefits for the volunteer as well as for the person or community served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Volunteering|url=http://nationalservice.gov|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=[[Corporation for National and Community Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also intended to make contacts for possible employment. Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as [[medicine]], [[education]], or [[emergency rescue]]. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a [[natural disaster]].

==Etymology and history==

The verb was first recorded in 1755. It was derived from the noun ''volunteer'', in [[Circa|C]].1600, "one who offers himself for military service," from the [[Middle French]] ''voluntaire''.&lt;ref name="Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=volunteer|title=Etymology:VOLUNTEER|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-military sense, the word was first recorded during the 1630s. The word ''volunteering'' has more recent usage—still predominantly military—coinciding with the phrase ''community service''.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jocote.org/2010/12/volunteer-whats-in-a-word/|publisher=Jocote.org|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=The origin of the word "Volunteering"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a military context, a [[volunteer military|volunteer army]] is a military body whose soldiers chose to enter service, as opposed to having been conscripted. Such volunteers do not work "for free" and are given regular pay.

===19th century===
During this time, America experienced the [[Great Awakening]]. People became aware of the disadvantaged and realized the cause for movement against slavery. Younger people started helping the needy in their communities {{citation needed|reason=no citation|date=September 2015}}. In 1851, the first [[YMCA]] in the United States was started, followed seven years later by the first [[YWCA]]. During the [[American Civil War]], women volunteered their time to sew supplies for the soldiers and the "Angel of the Battlefield" [[Clara Barton]] and a team of volunteers began providing aid to servicemen.  Barton founded the [[American Red Cross]] in 1881 and began mobilizing volunteers for disaster relief operations, including relief for victims of the [[Johnstown Flood]] in 1889.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Kennedy greeting Peace Corps volunteers, 1961.jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] greets volunteers on 28 August 1961]]

The [[Salvation Army]] is one of the oldest and largest organizations working for disadvantaged people. Though it is a [[charity organization]], it has organized a number of volunteering programs since its inception.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;
Prior to the 19th century, few formal charitable organizations existed to assist people in need.

In the first few decades of the 20th century, several volunteer organizations were founded, including the [[Rotary International]], [[Kiwanis International]], [[Association of Junior Leagues International]], and [[Lions Clubs International]].

[[The Great Depression]] saw one of the first large-scale, nationwide efforts to coordinate volunteering for a specific need. During World War II, thousands of volunteer offices supervised the volunteers who helped with the many needs of the military and the [[home front]], including collecting supplies, entertaining soldiers on leave, and caring for the injured.&lt;ref name="ISBN" /&gt;

After [[World War II]], people shifted the focus of their altruistic passions to other areas, including helping the poor and volunteering overseas. A major development was the [[Peace Corps]] in the United States in 1960. When President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] declared a ''War on Poverty'' in 1964, volunteer opportunities started to expand and continued into the next few decades. The process for finding volunteer work became more formalized, with more volunteer centers forming and new ways to find work appearing on the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref name="ISBN"&gt;{{ISBN|1-86287-376-3}}, Volunteers and Volunteering, The Federation Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (in 2012), about 64.5 million Americans, or 26.5 percent of the adult population, gave 7.9 billion hours of volunteer service worth $175 billion.  This calculates at about 125–150 hours per year or 3 hours per week at a rate of $22 per hour. Volunteer hours in the UK are similar; the data for other countries is unavailable.

In 1960, after the so called revolutionary war in Cuba ended, Ernesto Che Guevara created the concept of volunteering work. It was created with the intention that workers across the country volunteer a few hours of work on their work centers.

==Types==

=== Volunteering as utilized by service learning programs ===
Many schools on all education levels offer [[service-learning]] programs, which allow students to serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit.&lt;ref name="MedEdH"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to ''Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, Jr.,"...we promote more wide-spread adoption of service-learning in higher education because we see it as a powerful means of preparing students to become more caring and responsible parents and citizens and of helping colleges and universities to make good on their pledge to 'serve society.'"&lt;ref name="Eyler"&gt;{{Citation

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs."&lt;ref name="MedEdH" /&gt; Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds by the fact that it "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2,8}} While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown.&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xv-xvii}} Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs,&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|xvi}} They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that [the students]believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction."&lt;ref name=Eyler /&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

===Skills-based volunteering===
''Skills-based volunteering'' is leveraging the specialized skills and the talents of individuals to strengthen the infrastructure of nonprofits, helping them build and sustain their capacity to successfully achieve their missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalserviceresources.org/sbv|publisher=National Service Resources|title=Need of skills based volunteering for Non-Profit activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to traditional volunteering, where specific training is not required.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}  The average hour of traditional volunteering is valued by the Independent Sector at between $18–20 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-to-i.com/personal-development-through-volunteering&lt;/ref&gt; Skills-based volunteering is valued at $40–500 an hour, depending on the market value of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentsector.org|title=Skills based volunteering|publisher=Independent Sector|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2014&lt;!-- the link is to a site's home page, please link to the specific page that backs up the claim --&gt;}}

===Volunteering in developing countries===
{{Further information|International volunteering}}
[[File:Laura Bush with Ghana Peace Corps volunteers.jpg|thumb|[[Laura Bush]] poses with [[Peace Corps]] volunteers]]
An increasingly popular form of volunteering among young people, particularly [[gap year]] students and graduates, is to travel to communities in the [[developing world]] to work on projects with local organisations. Activities include teaching English, working in orphanages, conservation, assisting non-governmental organizations and medical work. International volunteering often aims to give participants valuable skills and knowledge in addition to benefits to the host community and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteering abroad|url=http://bma.org.uk/developing-your-career/career-progression/volunteering-abroad|website=BMA|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual volunteering===
{{Further information|Virtual volunteering}}
Also called ''e-volunteering'' or ''online volunteering'', virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, in whole or in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, [[telecenter]] or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a [[PDA]] or [[smartphone]]. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to [[telecommuting]], except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|publisher=UN Volunteers|accessdate=2012-04-30|title=Online Volunteering|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502044205/http://onlinevolunteering.org/en/index.html|archive-date=2 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serviceleader.org/virtual|title=Virtual Volunteering|accessdate=2012-04-30|publisher=Service Leader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro-volunteering===
{{Further information|Micro-volunteering}}
Micro-volunteering is a task performed via an internet-connected device. An individual typically does this task in small, un-paid increments of time. Micro-volunteering is distinct from "virtual volunteering" in that it typically does not require the individual volunteer to go through an application process, screening process, or training period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/volunteers/a/microvol.htm| title=Micro-Volunteering via Mobile Phones - Using Spare Time to Micro-Volunteer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-volunteer.org.uk/helpfromhome/micro-volunteering-changing-the-world-in-just-your-pyjamas/ |title=Micro Volunteering - Changing The World In Just Your Pyjamas! |publisher=I-volunteer.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental volunteering===
{{Further information|Environmental volunteering}}

Environmental volunteering refers to the volunteers who contribute towards environmental management or conservation. Volunteers conduct a range of activities including environmental monitoring, ecological restoration such as re-vegetation and weed removal, protecting endangered animals, and educating others about the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatvol|title=Environmental Volunteer Work|publisher=PeaceCorps|accessdate=2012-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering in an emergency===
[[File:FEMA - 15322 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-05-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist survivors at the Houston Astrodome following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005.]]
Volunteering often plays a pivotal role in the recovery effort following natural disasters, such as tsunamis, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and earthquakes. For example, the 1995 [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake]] in Japan was a watershed moment, bringing in many first-time [[wikipedia:Great_Hanshin_earthquake#Volunteerism|volunteers for earthquake response]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] attracted a large number of volunteers worldwide, deployed by [[non-governmental organization]]s, government agencies, and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=USGS Tsunami 2004 Summary|access-date=11 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119233314/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2004/usslav/#summary/|archive-date=19 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0504/excerpt2.html|publisher=National Geographic|title=Emergency Volunteering Coverage in NatGeo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2012 hurricane Sandy emergency, [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers, formed a ''laterally organized rapid-response team'' that provided much needed help during and after the storm, from food to shelter to reconstruction.  It is an example of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] at work, pooling resources and assistance and leveraging social media.

===Volunteering in schools===

Resource poor schools around the world rely on government support or on efforts from volunteers and private donations, in order to run effectively. In some countries, whenever the economy is down, the need for volunteers and resources increases greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatschools.net/news/back-to-school-poll-results.page|title=The Economy's Impact on Back to School|publisher=Great Schools|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many opportunities available in school systems for volunteers. Yet, there are not many requirements in order to volunteer in a school system. Whether one is a high school or TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) graduate or college student, most schools require just voluntary and selfless effort.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/volunteer/volunt.pdf|publisher=School Mental Health Project|title=Volunteer teaching effort can help students to learn better in schools|accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the benefits of any type of volunteering there are great rewards for the volunteer, student, and school. In addition to intangible rewards, volunteers can add relevant experience to their resumes. Volunteers who travel to assist may learn foreign culture and language.

Volunteering in schools can be an additional teaching guide for the students and help to fill the gap of local teachers. Cultural and language exchange during teaching and other school activities can be the most essential learning experience for both students and volunteers.&lt;ref name="School Mental Health Project"/&gt;

===Corporate volunteering===
{{Further information|Volunteer grant}}
Benefacto, a volunteering brokerage, describe corporate volunteering as "Companies giving their employees an allowance of paid time off annually, which they use to volunteer at a charity of their choice."&lt;ref&gt;http://benefacto.org/what-is-corporate-volunteering/&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of the companies at the [[Fortune 500]] allow their employees to volunteer during work hours. These formalized Employee Volunteering Programs (EVPs), also called Employer Supported Volunteering (ESV), are regarded as a part of the companies' sustainability efforts and their social responsibility activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcccc.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=document.showDocumentByID&amp;DocumentID=1308|title=Mapping Success in Employee Volunteering - The Drivers of Effectiveness for Employee Volunteering and Giving Programs and Fortune 500 Performance (2009)|publisher=Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship 2009|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40% of Fortune 500 companies provide monetary [[donations]], also known as [[volunteer grant]]s, to nonprofits as a way to recognize employees who dedicate significant amounts of time to volunteering in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/dos-and-donts-for-volunteers/|title=Fortune 500's monetary donation programs for voluntary service|publisher=Qgiv.com|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the information from [[VolunteerMatch]], a service that provides Employee Volunteering Program solutions, the key drivers for companies that produce and manage EVPs are building [[brand awareness]] and affinity, strengthening trust and loyalty among consumers, enhancing [[corporate image]] and reputation, improving [[employee retention]], increasing [[workforce productivity|employee productivity]] and loyalty, and providing an effective vehicle to reach strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volunteermatch.org/corporations/resources/businesscase.jsp|publisher=VolunteerMatch.org|title= How companies benefit from EVP|accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, David Cameron pledged to give all UK workers employed by companies with more 250 staff mandatory three days’ paid volunteering leave, which if implemented will generate an extra 360 million volunteering hours a year&lt;ref&gt;https://benefacto.org/three-days-paid-volunteering-leave-an-update-from-rob-wilsons-office/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Community volunteer work===
[[File:Volunteers installing windows at the Sumac Centre.jpg|thumb|Volunteers fit new windows at the [[Sumac Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].]]
Community volunteering refers globally to those who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses ad-hoc or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winfield|first1=Mark|title=The Essential Volunteer Handbook|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-4602-1583-8|url=http://www.markwinfield.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of community volunteer work ===
There are many proven personal benefits of community volunteerism. Working together with a group of people who have different ethnicity, backgrounds, and views reduces stereotypes. Community volunteerism has also been proven to improve student's academic success.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

According to ''Where's the Learning in Service Learning?'' by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, immersing oneself into service learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and learning how to work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young people to find others that they relate to.

Eyler and Giles noted that at the beginning and end of a college semester that included three hours of community service a week, students reported a much higher regard for cultural differences. At the end of the semester those who had participated in service-learning were noted as saying that the most important things that they had learned were not to judge others, and to appreciate every type of person because everyone shares some similar key characteristics.

Community volunteer work has proven to be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown that students who participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Matters in College: Four Critical Years Revisited|last=Astin|first=A.W.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1992|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How College Affects Students: Findings and Insights from Twenty Years of Research|last=Pascarella and Terenzini|first=E.T. and P.T.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1991|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning|last=Eyler and Giles, Jr.|first=Janet and Dwight|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1999|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to University Health Services, studies have found that volunteering can positively impact a student’s overall mental and emotional health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/wellness/student-volunteering-could-have-health-benefits/|title=Student volunteering could have health benefits|website=www.uhs.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social volunteering or welfare volunteering===
In some European countries government organisations and non-government organisations provide auxiliary positions for a certain period in institutions like hospitals, schools, memorial sites and welfare institutions. The difference to other types of volunteering is that there are strict legal regulations, what organisation is allowed to engage volunteers and about the period a volunteer is allowed to work in a voluntary position. Due to that fact, the volunteer is getting a limited amount as a pocket money from the government. An organization having one of the biggest manpower in [[Europe]] is the German [[Federal volunteers service]] (Bundesfreiwilligendienst), that was founded in 2011, by having more than 35.000 federal volunteers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundesfreiwilligendienst.de/fileadmin/de.bundesfreiwilligendienst/content.de/Service/Downloads/BFD_Flyer_engl_web_RZ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A much older institution is the [[Voluntary social year]] (Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsj.at/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pro-fsj.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volunteering at Major Sporting Events ===
Sochi Olympics 25,000 volunteers worked at the [[2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi Winter Olympics]]. They supported the organisers in more than 20 functional areas: meeting guests, assisting navigation, organising the opening and closing ceremonies, organising food outlets, etc. Volunteer applications were open to any nationals of Russia and other countries. The Sochi 2014 Organising Committee received about 200,000 applications, 8 applicants per place. Volunteers received training over the course of more than a year at 26 volunteer centres in 17 cities across Russia. The majority of participants were between 17 and 22 years old. At the same time, 3000 applications were submitted from people over 55 years old. Some of them worked as volunteers during the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympics]] in Moscow. It was the first experience with such a large-scale volunteer program in the contemporary Russia.

==== 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia ====
For the first time in its history, Russia will host the FIFA World Cup from June 14 till July 15, 2018. Moreover, it will be the first time the World Cup games will be played both in Europe and Asia. The games will be hosted by 12 stadiums in 11 Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/organisation/volunteers/|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Волонтерская программа Чемпионата мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer program of the 2018 FIFA World Cup has engaged thousands of people from Russia and other countries around the world.

The program included several stages: recruitment, selection and training of volunteers, organisation of their work during the championship. The recruitment of volunteers for the FIFA Confederations Cup and the FIFA World Cup via FIFA.com started on June 1, 2016 and closed on December 30, 2016. Some of the volunteers worked at the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]]: 1733 people assisted the organisers in Saint Petersburg, 1590 worked in Moscow, 1261 in Sochi, 1260 in Kazan, a total of 5844 participants.

The FIFA World Cup will be supported by 17,040 volunteers of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee.

Candidates living in Russia were selected by 15 volunteer centres in the host cities based in some of Russia's leading higher educational institutions: Synergy University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, Russian State Social University, Moscow Automobile and Road Construction University, Saint Petersburg State University of Economics, Samara State University, Volga Region State Academy of Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism, Don State Technical University, Ogarev Mordovia State University, Volgograd State University, State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Samara State Aerospace University, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, and Ural Federal University.

Candidates from other countries were selected remotely.

Candidates had to be at least 18 years old, have a good knowledge of English, have a higher or vocational secondary education, and possess teamwork skills.

Volunteers were trained remotely, in volunteer centres and at World Cup venues.

Volunteers will be providing assistance in a variety of areas:

# Distributing accreditations;
# Selling and checking tickets;
# Assisting radio communications professionals;
# Organising leisure and entertainment activities for guests of the event;
# Organising food outlets;
# Providing interpretation services;
# Working with sponsors;
# Providing medical services and organising doping control procedures;
# Supporting mass media operations;
# Organising arrivals and departures of players and guests;
# Working with VIP guests;
# Assisting players and referees;
# Assisting players and guests with accommodation;
# Providing navigation assistance to guests;
# Assisting TV and radio broadcasting;
# Organising transportation;
# Managing volunteers;
# Organising operations of the stadium;
# Monitoring compliance with FIFA social and environmental requirements;
# Organising the opening and closing ceremonies of the championship.

Their work started ahead of the events: on May 10, 2017 for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, and on May 10, 2018 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

==== Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program: Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects ====
On October 20, 2017, the Russian National Competition of Important Social Projects “Legacy of 2018 FIFA World Cup Volunteer Program” was launched. The competition has engaged about 1500 people: applicants to the 2018 FIFA World Cup volunteer program and future city volunteers.

The idea of the competition was that anyone could submit a project that would draw the attention of Russian cities residents to the FIFA World Cup in Russia and leave a legacy after the championship was over.

The project was expected to produce tangible (work of art, place of attraction for guests and residents in the city, open playground, graffiti, developed areas in city parks, films, etc.) or intangible (events, conferences, festivals, exhibitions) legacy.

26 projects qualified to the final and were supported by the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee and the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The jury included the General Director of the Russia 2018 Local Organising Committee Alexey Sorokin, Ambassador of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia Alexey Smertin and Advisor to the Head of the Federal Tourism Agency Svetlana Sergeeva.

Some of the projects were combined or further developed by the Local Organising Committee.

Among the projects were: Football Championship for Moms, Ramp Production out of Recycled Plastic, Your Championship Sticker Packs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ru.fifa.com/worldcup/news/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D1%8B-%D1%87%D0%BC-2018-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B-2922854|title=Чемпионат мира по футболу FIFA 2018 в России™ - Новости - Победители конкурса «Наследие волонтерской программы ЧМ-2018» награждены в «Сколково» - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|work=www.fifa.com|access-date=2018-06-14|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political view==
{{Further information|Gift economy}}
Modern societies share a common value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picketnews.com/archiveDetail.asp?cID=3&amp;id=8327|publisher=Picket News&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities are seen as a challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policyalmanac.org/government/charity_and_volunteering.shtml Bush Announces Faith-Based Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteering that benefits the state but challenges paid counterparts angers labor unions that represent those who are paid for their volunteer work; this is particularly seen in combination departments, such as [[volunteer fire department]]s.

===Difficulties in cross-national aid===
{{see also|International volunteering}}
Difficulties in the cross-national aid model of volunteering can arise when it is applied across national borders. The presence of volunteers who are sent from one state to another can be viewed as a breach of [[sovereignty]] and showing a lack of respect towards the national government of the proposed recipients. Thus, motivations are important when states negotiate offers to send aid and when these proposals are accepted, particularly if donors may postpone assistance or stop it altogether. Three types of conditionality have evolved:
#'''Financial accountability''': Transparency in funding management to ensure that what is done by the volunteers is properly targeted
#'''Policy reform''': Governmental request that developing countries adopt certain social, economic, or environmental policies; often, the most controversial relate to the privatization of services traditionally offered by the state
#'''Development objectives''': Asking developing countries to adjust specific time-bound economic objectives

Some international volunteer organizations define their primary mission as being altruistic: to fight poverty and improve the living standards of people in the developing world, (e.g. [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] has almost 2,000 skilled professionals working as volunteers to pass on their expertise to local people so that the volunteers' skills remain long after they return home). When these organizations work in partnership with governments, the results can be impressive. However, when other organizations or individual First World governments support the work of volunteer groups, there can be questions as to whether the organizations' or governments' real motives are poverty alleviation. Instead, a focus on creating wealth for some of the poor or developing policies intended to benefit the donor states is sometimes reported.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN reference for Volunteering Visions, Publisher: The Federation Press, Edited by: [[Joy Noble]] and [[Fiona Johnston]], {{ISBN|1-86287-404-2}} {{ISBN|978-1862874046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many low-income countries’ economies suffer from industrialization without prosperity and investment without growth. One reason for this is that development assistance guides many Third World governments to pursue development policies that have been wasteful, ill-conceived, or unproductive; some of these policies have been so destructive that the economies could not have been sustained without outside support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDS_IBank_Servlet?pcont=details&amp;eid=000009265_3980429111119|title=Aid, taxation, and development: analytical perspectives on aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=World Bank|date=1998-02-28|accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, some offers of aid have distorted the general spirit of volunteering, treating local voluntary action as contributions in kind, i.e., existing conditions requiring the modification of local people’s behavior in order for them to earn the right to donors’ charity. This can be seen as patronizing and offensive to the recipients because the aid expressly serves the policy aims of the donors rather than the needs of the recipients.

==Moral resources, political capital and civil society==
[[File:Some help files iin a volunteers station in Shenzhen,China .jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some files for helping people in a volunteers station in [[Shenzhen]], [[People's Republic of China]]]]
Based on a case study in China, Xu and Ngai (2011) revealed that the developing grassroots volunteerism can be an enclave among various organizations and may be able to work toward the development of civil society in the developing countries. The researchers developed a "Moral Resources and Political Capital" approach to examine the contributions of volunteerism in promoting the civil society. Moral resource means the available morals could be chosen by NGOs. Political capital means the capital that will improve or enhance the NGOs’ status, possession or access in the existing political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269.|accessdate=17 April 2011 |url= http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, Xu and Ngai (2011) distinguished two types of Moral Resources: Moral Resource-I and Moral Resource-II (ibid).
#Moral Resource I: Inspired by [[Immanuel Kant]]’s (1998 [1787]) argument of "What ought I to do," Moral Resource-I will encourage the NGOs’ confidence and then have the courage to act and conquer difficulties by way of answering and confirming the question of "What ought I to do."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1998). Critique of pure reason ([[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], Trans.). Raleigh, NC: Alex Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Moral Resource II: given that Adorno (2000) recognizes that moral or immoral tropes are socially determined, Moral Resource-II refers to the morals that are well accepted by the given society.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T. (2000). Problems of moral philosophy (T. Schroder, Ed. &amp; R. Livingstone, Trans.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the intellectual heritage of Blau and Duncan (1967), two types of political capital were identified:
#Political Capital-I refers to the political capital mainly ascribed to the status that the NGO inherited throughout history (e.g., the CYL).
#Political Capital-II refers to the Political Capital that the NGOs earned through their hard efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Blau, P. M., &amp; Duncan, O. D. (1967). The American occupational structure. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Obviously, "Moral resource-I itself contains the self-determination that gives participants confidence in the ethical beliefs they have chosen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y |last2=Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |page=260 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost any organizations may have Moral Resource-I, while not all of them have the societal recognized Moral Resource-II. However, the voluntary service organizations predominantly occupy Moral Resource-II because a sense of moral superiority makes it possible that for parties with different values, goals and cultures to work together in promoting the promotion of volunteering. Thus the voluntary service organizations are likely to win the trust and support of the masses as well as the government more easily than will the organizations whose morals are not accepted by mainstream society. In other words, Moral Resource II helps the grassroots organizations with little Political Capital I to win Political Capital-II, which is a crucial factor for their survival and growth in developing countries such as China. Therefore, the voluntary service realm could be an enclave of the development of civil society in the developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Xu |first1=Y. |last2= Ngai |first2=N. P. |year=2011 |title= Moral Resources and Political Capital: Theorizing the Relationship Between Voluntary Service Organizations and the Development of Civil Society in China |work=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=247–269 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/40/2/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
Volunteering has the ability to improve the quality of life and health including longevity of those who donate their time &lt;ref&gt;https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/uploads/Post-AltruismHappinessHealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and research has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the good deed from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.

==Mental health benefits==
Volunteering is known not only to be related to happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt; but also to increase happiness &lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228189802_Prosocial_Spending_and_Well-Being_Cross-Cultural_Evidence_for_a_Psychological_Universal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5494996_Spending_Money_on_Others_Promotes_Happiness
&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, giving help was a more important benefit of better reported mental health than receiving help &lt;ref&gt;http://img2.timg.co.il/forums/1_89494618.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have also shown that volunteering can cause a decrease in  loneliness for those volunteering as well as those for whom people volunteer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drbarbaraedwards.com/why-helping-others-makes-us-happy/|title=Why Helping Others Makes Us Happy {{!}} Dr. Barbara Edwards|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In the United States, statistics on volunteering have historically been limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energizeinc.com/hot-topics/2006/june|title=Wouldn't It Be Nice to Really Know {{!}} Energize: Volunteer Management Resources for Directors of Volunteers|website=www.energizeinc.com|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the U.S. [[Current Population Survey (US)]] included a volunteering supplement which produced statistics on volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volunteeringinamerica.gov/about/research_faqs.cfm|title=National Veteran Corps|website=www.volunteeringinamerica.gov|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the 1960s, [[Ivan Illich]] offered an analysis of the role of American volunteers in Mexico in his speech entitled "To Hell With Good Intentions". His concerns, along with those of critics such as [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Edward Said]], revolve around the notion of [[altruism]] as an extension of Christian [[missionary]] [[ideology]]. In addition, he mentions the sense of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]/[[obligation]] as a factor, which drives the concept of [[noblesse oblige]]—first developed by the French [[aristocracy]] as a [[morality|moral]] [[duty]] derived from their wealth. Simply stated, these apprehensions propose the extension of power and authority over indigenous cultures around the world. Recent critiques of volunteering come from Westmier and Kahn (1996) and [[bell hooks]] (née Gloria Watkins) (2004). Also, [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415809153/ Georgeou (2012)] has critiqued the impact of [[neoliberalism]] on international aid volunteering.

The field of the [[medical tourism]] (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures.  A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bezruchka, S. (2000). Medical Tourism as Medical Harm to the Third World: Why? For Whom? ''[[Wilderness and Environmental Medicine]]'', 11, 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, M. (2006). Duffle Bag Medicine. ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 295, 1491-1492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinto, A.D., &amp; Upshur, R.E.G. (2009). Global Health Ethics for Students. ''[[Developing World Bioethics]]'', 9, 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/think-looking-after-turtles-in-costa-rica-for-three-weeks-is-good-for-your-cv-think-again-66148#comment_1125331|title=Think looking after turtles in Costa Rica for three weeks is good for your CV?
