The '''Australian Netherlands Committee on Old Dutch Shipwrecks''' ('''ANCODS''') is an organization tasked with maintaining and allocating artefacts from 17th and 18th century Dutch shipwrecks off the coast of [[Western Australia]]. It was founded in 1972 by the ''Agreement between Australia and the Netherlands Concerning Old Dutch Shipwrecks''.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

== History ==

=== The Ships ===
Development of ANCODS began with the discovery of four [[Dutch East India Company]] ships off the coast of Western Australia in the 1950s–1960s.

==== ''Zuytdorp'' (1712) ====

{{Main article|Zuytdorp}}

In 1712, ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' struck the cliffs {{cvt|60|km}} north of the mouth of the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]]. It was the only wreck of the four from which no survivors returned to [[Jakarta|Batavia (modern day Jakarta)]]. Some evidence exists of survivors reaching the top of the cliffs, but it is unclear what exactly transpired. ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' remained where it sank until the location of the wreck was publicized by the local press in the 1930s, although rumours of its existence had been previously circulated in 1927. It was not until 1958 that the wreckage was confirmed as that of the ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' by Philip Playford.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; The [[Western Australian Museum]] (WAM) carried out archaeological investigations of both the underwater site and the associated survivor camp from 1974 until the late 1990s. The [[Zuytdorp Nature Reserve]] was formed in 1992 to protect the wreck. As a result, diving is prohibited in the waters surrounding the wreck. WAM currently has 1,300 artefacts in the ANCODS Collection for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ANCODS|title=ANCODS – The Zuytdorp|url=http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-zd.html|accessdate=31 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182747/http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-zd.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Vergulde Draeck'' (1656) ====

{{Main article|Vergulde Draeck}}

Wrecked in 1656 south of [[Ledge Point]], Western Australia, the ''[[Vergulde Draeck]]'' (or ''Gilt Dragon'', as it is more commonly known) was the first to be relocated during the 1950–1960s. However, Alan Robinson, who claimed to have discovered the vessel, could not remember where the wreck was originally located.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; Artefacts were then collected on 14 April 1963 when a spear fishing group stumbled across them. James, Alan, [[Graeme Henderson]], and John Cowan, members of the spear fishing group that discovered site, offered their rights to the site to the WAM.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; However the last member of the group, Alan Robinson, did not. WAM accepted the rights.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; However, looters used explosives to breach the vessel and search for valuable artefacts, mainly coins.&lt;ref name=VD&gt;{{cite web|last=ANCODS|title=ANCODS – Vergulde Draeck|url=http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-vg.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182823/http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-vg.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to looting, the nature of the seabed and occasional severe storms, the site is spread over a {{cvt|40|x|50|m}} area on a reef and is very difficult to locate.&lt;ref name=VD/&gt; Jeremy Green and staff from WAM recovered artefacts from the wreck in archaeological seasons between 1972 and 1983. The ANCODS collection currently includes large numbers of ballast bricks, clay pipes, stoneware, wooden and metal fragments as well as elephant tusks, leather shoes and coin-, eight hundred of which are in the custody of the [[Utrecht|Money Museum in Utrecht]].&lt;ref name=VD/&gt;

==== ''Batavia'' (1629) ====

{{Main article|Batavia (ship)}}
[[File:Batavia 01 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|Batavia's hull remains and a replica of the [[portico]] on display in the [[Western Australian Museum#Maritime and Shipwreck Galleries|Fremantle Shipwreck Gallery, WA]]]]

''[[Batavia (ship)|Batavia]]'' struck the reef surrounding the Wallaby Group of the [[Houtman Abrolhos]] in 1629. Survivors set up camp nearby and a small party was sent off in search of fresh water. When no water was found, the party was sent to  [[Jakarta|Batavia (modern day Jakarta)]] to get help and to notify the government of a mutiny aboard the ship.&lt;ref name=Batavia&gt;{{cite web|last=ANCODS|title=ANCODS – The Batavia|url=http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-bt.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182843/http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-bt.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors left on the island suffered losses due to murder, starvation and exposure.&lt;ref name=Batavia/&gt; Discovered in 1963, this site is one of the more famous due to events that led up to the wreck and the ensuing strife among the surviving crew.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"&gt;Kennedy, G.A. 1998 Discovery, Legislation, and Litigation, in Green, J., Stanbury, M., and Gaastra, F.(eds) 'The ANCODS Colloquium: Papers presented at the Australia-Netherlands Colloquium on Maritime Archaeology and Maritime History'. Western Australian Maritime Museum, Fremantle. pp30-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1970 and 1974, WAM recovered many artefacts from the wreck and raised the remains of the hull for display in the museum.&lt;ref name=Batavia/&gt; Also retrieved was a dismantled [[portico]] destined for Batavia’s port and human remains.&lt;ref name=Batavia/&gt; The ANCODS collection holds 6,823 artefacts related to the ''Batavia'' and the remains of its hull. The assembled portico is on display in WAM's Fremantle Ship Wreck Galleries.&lt;ref name=Batavia/&gt;

==== ''Zeewijk'' (1727) ====

{{Main article|Zeewijk}}

The ''[[Zeewijk]]'' was wrecked in 1727 on the [[Pelsaert Group]] in the [[Houtman Abrolhos]], Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; Much of the cargo that was carried aboard was transferred to the survivor camp on [[Gun Island]] and perhaps later returned to [[Jakarta|Batavia]], via the ''[[Sloepie]]''. This ship was built by the survivors on Gun Island and carried 82 people back to [[Jakarta|Batavia]].&lt;ref name=Zeewijk&gt;{{cite web|last=ANCODS|title=ANCODS – The Zeewijk|url=http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-zw.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182907/http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/voc-zw.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; No substantial hull remains, although many fragments have been recovered.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; Artefacts were collected in the 1840s by the island's [[guano]] diggers.&lt;ref name=Zeewijk/&gt; Most of these artefacts were later given to WAM. The main wreck site was identified in 1968, containing remains such as rigging, cannons, kegs of nails, wine glasses, and ceramics.&lt;ref name=Zeewijk/&gt; Much of the remains of the survivors' camps have been destroyed by the guano diggers and wildlife, however. WAM holds 4,196 artefacts in the ANCODS collection related to the ''Zeewijk''.&lt;ref name=Zeewijk/&gt;

=== Before ANCODS ===
The discovery of these vessels sparked interest in protecting the [[shipwrecks of Western Australia|shipwrecks in Western Australia]]. In 1964, amendments to the ''Museum Act 1959'' (WA) were made to include the preservation of material from wrecks for the benefit of the public, and the WAM was vested with the sole right to control vessels abandoned, wrecked or stranded before 1900.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolton1977&gt;{{cite conference |last=Bolton |first=G. |title=Legislation- What is ANCODS? (Australian Netherlands Committee on Old Dutch Shipwrecks) |journal=Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology |year=1977 |editor=Green, J.N. |pages=28–30 |url=http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au/reserve/vr/20110800710.pdf |subscription=yes |publisher=Oceans Society of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 a new Museum Act was enacted and the former Board of the Museum became a trustee. Much of the historic shipwreck amendments made to the previous act were kept. However, one of the biggest changes was to remove the finder's reward and compensation for artefacts.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; The ''Museum Act 1969'' was then incorporated into the ''Maritime Archaeology Act 1973'' of WA to include changes based on the museum's experience since 1964.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Staniforthnash2006&gt;Staniforth, S. and Nash, M. (eds) 2006 ''Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches''. The Plenum Series in Underwater Archaeology. Springer, New York p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this time Alan Robinson, one of the finders of the ''[[Vergulde Draeck]]'', sued WAM, claimed that the legislation implemented was not valid.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolton1977/&gt; This was proved correct over many years and from many angles the debate was held. The [[Commonwealth]] was looking into protection itself and used the end of the legal battle to release its own legislation concerning shipwrecks.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; Under the ''[[Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976]]'' the WAM was given the power it needed to continue as it had been.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt;

=== ANCODS agreement ===
Due to the decline of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in the 18th century, it was nationalised by the Dutch government. The modern government, therefore, later became the owners of the company and its ships, including wrecked vessels.&lt;ref name=Bolton1977/&gt; The Dutch, through agreements between the [[Australian Government]] and the WAM, proposed the ANCODS Agreement in 1964. The Australian government and the WAM took no action with it until the early 1970s, however.&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt; With the beginning of the legal battle between Robinson and the WAM, the ''Agreement between Australia and the Netherlands Concerning Old Dutch Shipwrecks'' was signed on 6 November 1972.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|last=ANCODS|title=About ANCODS|url=http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/about.html|accessdate=1 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722182809/http://www.heritage-activities.nl/ancods/about.html|archive-date=22 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy. G.A. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolton1977/&gt; With the signing of the ANCODS agreement,

{{bq|text=The Netherlands, as successor to the property and assets of the Dutch "Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie", transferred to Australia all its right, title and interest in and to wrecked vessels of the Dutch "Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie" lying on or off the coast of the State of Western Australia and in and to any articles thereof and Australia accepted that right, title and interest.|sign=Historic Shipwrecks Act&lt;ref&gt;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976, Preamble. URL:http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C04468.&lt;/ref&gt;}}See ANCODS legislation below for the full agreement.

== Activities ==

Controlling the interests of the ANCODS Agreement is the ANCODS Committee. This committee consists of four members, two from the Netherlands and two from Australia, chosen for their expertise. The current Australian members are Dr John PS Bach OAM and [[Geoffrey Bolton|Professor Geoffrey C Bolton AO]]. The Netherlands are represented by Ms Andrea Otte, a representative of the Dutch Ministry of Culture, and Mr Eric Stating, a Councillor of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web |author=((Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities))|title=Australia and the Netherlands Concerning Old Dutch Shipwrecks|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/shipwrecks/international/ancods.html|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undertaking the Secretariat duties of the committee is the Maritime Heritage Section of the [[Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities]].&lt;ref name=gov/&gt; Linked to the Committee are two groups of stakeholders composed of four museum and government representatives, who also take part in decisions regarding the ANCODS agreement.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

In 1997 the ANCODS colloquium, a three-day conference to discuss the position of ANCODS at the time and to provide new recommendations, was held. Two resolutions were formed and proposed:

{{bq|text=Resolution 1:  In the practice of [[modern archaeology]], it is generally accepted that the collections should remain within their original context. It is suggested that the ANCODS should promote the concept that the whole ANCODS collection should remain under the administration of the Western Australian Maritime Museum, which should administer the location, movements and loan of the collection.
Resolution 2: That the research role of ANCODS, as originally outlined in the Agreement, be expanded to encompass the concept of a joint Australian and Netherlands scientific research (JANSR), which would include education, dissemination of information, scientific research projects and community access. The ANCODS Committee should also examine the future role and aims of ANCODS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jeremy|title=The ANCODS Colloquium: Papers presented at the Australia – Netherlands Colloquium on Maritime Archaeology and Maritime History|year=1998|publisher=Western Australian Maritime Museum|location=Fremantle|editor1=Stanbury, M. |editor2=Gaastra, F. |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Collection ==

As part of the ANCODS Agreement, Australia took on the responsibility to look after all the artefacts recovered from the wrecks, including their recovery, conservation, storage and display. Formally, artefacts were housed in four museums: the Western Australian Maritime Museum, the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], the [[Netherlands Maritime Museum]] and the Geldmuseum (Money Museum) in Utrecht. However, as part of the 1997 Colloquium, it was advised that all artefacts be returned to the WAM in accordance with modern archaeological standards. On 15 September 2010, the plans to hand over artefacts in the care of the Netherlands to WAM were finalised; the agreement was signed by the Australian ambassador to the Netherlands, Lydia Morton, and the Netherlands Secretary for Culture, Judith van Kranendonk, aboard the Batavia replica in Lelystad, The Netherlands.&lt;ref name=govmr&gt;{{cite news|last=Picton|first=Tom|title=Australia Receives Important Dutch Maritime Collection|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/minister/farrell/2010/pubs/mr20101109.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=Senator the Hon Don Farrell Media Release|date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An official handover took place on 9 November 2010, conducted by his Excellency Mr Willem Andreae, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to Senator Don Farrell, the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water.&lt;ref name=govmr/&gt; The ceremony was held at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. To symbolise the final transfer of artefacts, another ceremony was held at the Western Australian Maritime Museum on 21 February 2011. His Excellency Mr Willem Andreae handed a pewter plate recovered from the ''Batavia'' wreck to Premier Colin Barnett.&lt;ref name=wamr&gt;{{cite web|author=Western Australian Museum|title=Priceless Dutch shipwreck collection handed to the WA Museum|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/about/latest-news/priceless-dutch-shipwreck-collection-handed-wa-museum|accessdate=1 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112414/http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/about/latest-news/priceless-dutch-shipwreck-collection-handed-wa-museum| archivedate= 12 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the unpacking of the last crate of artefacts can be viewed on the WAM website.
As part of the repatriation of artefacts, the Western Australian Maritime Museum created a database which includes photos and descriptions of all artefacts recovered from the four VOC shipwrecks. This permits scholars to access the collections. Exhibits are currently being displayed in the Western Australian Maritime Museum and the Australian National Maritime Museum with talk of an ANCODS exhibition in 2012 or later.&lt;ref name=govmr/&gt;&lt;ref name=wamr/&gt;{{update inline|reason=It is now six years later.

Animism is the world's oldest religion, "Animism predates any form of organized religion and is said to contain the oldest spiritual and supernatural perspective in the world.

Animism is used in the [[anthropology of religion]] as a term for the belief system of many [[indigenous people]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ritual and Belief: Readings in the Anthropology of Religion|first=David|last=Hicks|publisher=[[Rowman Altamira]]|edition=3|year=2010|page=359|quote=Tylor's notion of animism—for him the first religion—included the assumption that early ''Homo sapiens'' had invested animals and plants with souls&amp;nbsp; ... }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of [[organised religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animism|publisher=ELMAR Project (University of Cumbria)|date=1998–99|others=Contributed by Helen James; coordinated by Dr. Elliott Shaw with assistance from Ian Favell|url=http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/seasia/animism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, "animism" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native American Religious and Cultural Freedom: An Introductory Essay|work=The Pluralism Project|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College and Diana Eck|year=2005|url=http://www.pluralism.org/reports/view/176}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is an [[Emic and etic|anthropological construct]].

Largely due to such [[ethnolinguistic]] and cultural discrepancies, opinion has differed on whether ''animism'' refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world, or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century (1871) by Sir [[Edward Tylor]], who created it as "one of [[anthropology]]'s earliest concepts, if not the first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S67|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1195|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and physical (or material) world and that [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows. Animism thus rejects [[Cartesian dualism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, [[true name]]s or metaphors in [[mythology]]. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author [[Daniel Quinn]], sculptor [[Lawson Oyekan]] and many contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Pagans]]).&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animism: Respecting the Living World|last=Harvey|first=Graham|page=9|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2np2LCDmIMC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-231-13700-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
=== Old animism ===
Earlier anthropological perspectives, which have since been termed the "old animism", were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} The "old animism" assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between [[persons]] and [[object (philosophy)|things]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xiv}}
Critics of the "old animism" have accused it of preserving "colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}}

==== Edward Tylor's definition ====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Tylor]] developed animism as an anthropological theory.]]

The idea of animism was developed by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] in his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} in which he defined it as "the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general". According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Sir Edward Burnett Tylor| title = Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom| url = https://books.google.com/?id=AucLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA260| year = 1871| publisher = J. Murray| isbn = | page = 260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. That formulation was little different from that proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] as "[[fetishism]]",&lt;ref name="Kuper 2005 85"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a Myth (2nd Edition)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY, USA|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the terms now have distinct meanings.

For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}}
Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}} He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but he suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions and thus was a rational system. However, it was based on erroneous, unscientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to "primitive" populations than many of his contemporaries and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of "savage" people and Westerners.&lt;ref name=stringer /&gt;

Tylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as "spiritualism" but realised that would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]], that was then prevalent across Western nations.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term "animism" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3–4}} The first known usage in English appeared in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67–S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that there had once been "one universal form of primitive religion" (whether labelled "animism", "totemism", or "shamanism") has been dismissed as "unsophisticated" and "erroneous" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that "it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}

==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====
Tylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of "primitive society" by lawyers, theologians and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science: anthropology. By the end of the 19th century, an orthodoxy on "primitive society" had emerged, but few anthropologists still would accept that definition. The "19th-century armchair anthropologists" argued "primitive society" (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism, the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of "developed" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism. However, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented "survivals" of the original animism of early humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), the Edinburgh lawyer, [[John Ferguson McLennan]], argued that the animistic thinking evident in [[fetishism]] gave rise to a religion he named [[Totemism]]. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.&lt;ref name="Kuper 2005 85" /&gt; Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists "have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]]."&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.&lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Tim. (2000). "Totemism, Animism and the Depiction of Animals" in ''The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''. London: Routledge, pp.&amp;nbsp;112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his studies into child development, [[Jean Piaget]] suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}} Conversely, from her ethnographic research, [[Margaret Mead]] argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}}
Stewart Guthrie saw animism – or "attribution" as he preferred it – as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}

In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the "most widespread" concept of animism was that it was the "attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}

=== The new animism ===

Many anthropologists ceased using the term "animism", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups – namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers – who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as "animists".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the "old animist" definition had been problematic, the term "animism" was nevertheless "of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world."{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}

[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the "new animism".]]
The "new animism" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to "act as a person".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}

Hallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}

More recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to "animate" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our "professional subcultures," which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22–4|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" /&gt;

Nurit Bird-David argues that "Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!"&lt;ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" /&gt; She argues that animism is a "relational epistemology", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the "individual"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ("dividuals"), some of which are with "superpersons" (i.e. non-humans).

Guthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that "the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning "the scientific project".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}

Tim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&amp;nbsp; ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, "feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.

Cultural ecologist and philosopher [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us—we 'see what they say'—much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. "To tell the story in this manner—to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around—is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief "that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore "concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}
Graham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's "I-thou" as opposed to "I-it". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a "thou" rather than as an "it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Graham|title=The Handbook of Contemporary Animism|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fetishism/totemism ===

In many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shamanism ===

{{Main|Shamanism}}
A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[Evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance]] state during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies — the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abram|first=David|title=The Spell of the Sensuous|year=1996|publisher=Pantheon|location=New York|pages=3–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinction from pantheism ===
Animism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Harrison ''Elements of Pantheism'' 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl McColman ''When Someone You Love Is Wiccan: A Guide to Witchcraft and Paganism for Concerned Friends, Nervous parents and Curious Co-Workers'' 2002, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animist life ==

=== Animals, plants, and the elements ===

Animism entails the belief that "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=99}} The actions of non-human animals are viewed as "intentional, planned and purposive",{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=101}} and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=100}} In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in [[kinship]] systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=102}} Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a [[powwow]] held by the [[Conne River]] [[Mi'kmaq]] in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102–103}}

Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104–105}}

Various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106–107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108–109}}

The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}

=== Spirits ===

Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}

== Other usages ==

=== Science and animism ===
In the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).

The physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.

{{quote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of "quantum animism" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level. If the world is truly quantum animated, then there is an immense amount of invisible inner experience going on all around us that is presently inaccessible to humans, because our own inner lives are imprisoned inside a small quantum system, isolated deep in the meat of an animal brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last= Herbert|authorlink=Nick Herbert (physicist)|title= Holistic Physics – or – An Introduction to Quantum Tantra|date=2002|accessdate=2014-05-01 |url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/16/herbert.essay.htm|publisher=southerncrossreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Werner Krieglstein]] wrote regarding his quantum Animism:

{{quote|Herbert's quantum Animism differs from traditional Animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.&lt;ref&gt;Werner J. Krieglstein ''Compassion: A New Philosophy of the Other'' 2002, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ashley Curtis has argued in ''Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment|last=Curtis|first=Ashley|publisher=Kommode Verlag|year=2018|isbn=978-3952462690|location=Zürich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Cartesian idea of an experiencing subject facing off with an inert physical world is incoherent at its very foundation, and that this incoherence is predicted rather than belied by Darwinism. Human reason (and its rigorous extension in the natural sciences) fits an evolutionary niche just as echolocation does for bats and infrared vision does for pit vipers, and is—according to western science's own dictates—epistemologically on a par with rather than superior to such capabilities. The meaning or aliveness of the "objects" we encounter—rocks, trees, rivers, other animals—thus depends for its validity not on a detached cognitive judgment but purely on the quality of our experience. The animist experience, and, indeed, the wolf's or raven's experience, thus become licenced as equally valid world-views to the modern western scientific one—indeed, they are more valid, since they are not plagued with the incoherence that inevitably crops up when "objective existence" is separated from "subjective experience."

=== Socio-political impact ===

Harvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords "intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}

=== In art and literature ===
Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}

Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]],  [[Linda Hogan]], [[David Abram]],  [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}} Animist worldviews have also been identified in the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/spirits-gods-and-pastel-paints-the-weird-world-of-master-animator-hayao-miyazaki-1880974.html|title=Spirits, gods and pastel paints: The weird world of master animator Hayao Miyazaki|author=Robert Epstein|date=January 31, 2010|publisher=The Independent|access-date=June 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kyotojournal.org/the-journal/culture-arts/musings-on-miyazaki-early-and-late-2/|title=Musings on Miyazaki|author=Dr. David A.

'''Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics''' (APCTP) is an international non-governmental research institute for physical sciences. It is located in the Campus of the [[Pohang University of Science and Technology]] (POSTECH), in Pohang, South Korea. The centre was founded in 1996 by Nobel Laureate [[Chen-Ning Yang]].

==Structure and history==
The Asia Pacific Theoretical Physics Center is theoretical physics research leading, international joint research programs, in  the Asia-Pacific region. The APCTP  was founded in June 1996 as an international non-governmental organizations, with current member states: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[the Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Mongolia]], [[India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] (16 countries).
The Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics is a close-knit, multi-disciplinary research environment that hosts scientists working on challenging problems at the forefront of [[biophysics]], [[condensed matter]], [[quantum information]], [[astrophysics]], [[cosmology]] and [[particle physics]]. The institute also plays a key role in Korea by inviting international scholars, acting as a conduit for collaboration through focus workshops and training young scientists.
The APCTP, whose previous presidents include Nobel Laureates C. N. Yang and [[Robert B. Laughlin]], has a rich history and celebrated its 20th year in 2016. In 2008 APCTP established Junior Research Groups (JRG) under a previous president, [[Peter Fulde]], in collaboration with the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Germany]], as a means to provide gifted young scientists with their first opportunity of managing research. The institute currently supports eight JRG groups.

The APCTP is located at the Pohang University for Science and Technology (POSTECH), which in addition to possessing established departments in both mathematics and the natural sciences, ranks globally within the top 100 universities. Moreover, the boutique campus currently boasts the [[POSTECH-Max Planck center for quantum materials]], as well as four centers from the Korean government flagship [[Institute for Basic Science (IBS)]] program, spanning low-dimensional electronic systems, immunology, self-assembly and notably, the only mathematics IBS center to date.

In [[biology]], an '''atavism''' is a modification of a biological structure whereby an ancestral [[Trait (biological)|trait]] reappears after having been lost through [[evolution]]ary change in previous generations.&lt;ref name="Briankhall1"&gt;{{Citation | title=Developmental mechanisms underlying the atavisms| author=Brian K. Hall| journal=Biological Reviews| year=1984| volume=59| issue=| pages=89–124| url=| doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1984.tb00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavisms can occur in several ways;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tomic|first1=Nenad| last2= Meyer-Rochow|first2= Victor Benno| year= 2011|title= Atavisms  -  medical, genetic, and evolutionary implications|journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=54 | issue = 3 | pages= 332–353| doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is when [[gene]]s for previously existing [[phenotype|phenotypic]] features are preserved in [[DNA]], and these become expressed through a [[mutation]] that either knocks out the overriding genes for the new traits or makes the old traits override the new one.&lt;ref name="Briankhall1"/&gt; A number of traits can vary as a result of shortening of the [[prenatal development|fetal development]] of a trait ([[neoteny]]) or by prolongation of the same. In such a case, a shift in the time a trait is allowed to develop before it is fixed can bring forth an ancestral phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Held, L.| year=2009 | title= Quirks of Human Anatomy, an Evo-Devo Look at the Human Body | publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-73233-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavisms are often seen as [[evidence of common descent|evidence of evolution]].&lt;ref name="Briankhall2"/&gt;

In [[social science]]s, atavism is the tendency of reversion. For example, people in the modern era reverting to the ways of thinking and acting of a former time. The word ''atavism'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''atavus''—a great-great-great-grandfather or, more generally, an ancestor.

==Biology==
Evolutionarily traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism's DNA. The gene sequence often remains, but is inactive. Such an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Collin | first1 = R.| last2 = Cipriani | first2 = R.| year = 2003| title = Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume = 270 | issue = 1533 | pages = 2551–2555| doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc = 1691546| pmid = 14728776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tomic|first1=Nenad| last2= Meyer-Rochow|first2= Victor Benno| year= 2011|title= Atavisms  -  medical, genetic, and evolutionary implications|journal= Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=54 | issue = 3 | pages= 332–353| doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the gene remains intact, a fault in the genetic control suppressing the gene can lead to it being expressed again. Sometimes, the expression of dormant genes can be induced by artificial stimulation.

Atavisms have been observed in humans, such as with infants born with [[vestigial tail]]s (called a "coccygeal process", "coccygeal projection", or "caudal appendage").&lt;ref name="talkorigins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html#atavisms|title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: Part 2|author=TalkOrigins Archive|authorlink=TalkOrigins Archive|accessdate=2006-11-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061029220608/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section2.html| archivedate= 29 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atavism can also be seen in humans who possess large teeth, like those of other primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/15/opinion/ed-tails15|title=What our tails tell us|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-02-15|accessdate=2009-03-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312093607/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/15/opinion/ed-tails15|archivedate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a case of "snake heart", the presence of "coronary circulation and myocardial architecture [which resemble] those of the reptilian heart", has also been reported in medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Walia | first1 = I. | last2 = Arora | first2 = H.

Atavism is a term in [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s explanation of [[World War I]] in twentieth-century [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Europe]]. He defends the [[liberal international relations theory]] that an international society built on commerce will avoid war because of war's destructiveness and comparative cost. His reason for World War I is termed "atavism", in which he asserts that senescent governments in Europe (those of the [[German Empire]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) pulled the liberal Europe into war, and that the liberal regimes of the other continental powers did not cause it. He used this idea to say that [[liberalism]] and commerce would continue to have a soothing effect in international relations, and that war would not arise between nations which are connected by commercial ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Imperialism and Capitalism | title=Imperialism and Social Classes | author=[[Joseph Schumpeter]] | place=Cleveland | publisher=The World Publishing Company | year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of London]] professor [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] has identified three distinct sub-groups of the [[precariat]], one of which he refers to as "atavists", who long for what they see as a lost past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/precariat-global-class-rise-of-populism|title=Meet the precariat, the new global class fuelling the rise of populism|author=Guy Standing|date=2016-11-09|publisher=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Darwinism===
During the interval between the acceptance of [[evolution]] in the mid-1800s and the rise of the modern understanding of [[genetics]] in the early 1900s, atavism was used to account for the reappearance in an individual of a trait after several generations of absence—often called a "throw-back".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The idea that atavisms could be made to accumulate by [[selective breeding]], or [[breeding back]], led to breeds such as the [[Heck cattle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} This had been bred from ancient [[landrace]]s with selected primitive traits, in an attempt of "reviving" the [[aurochs]], an [[extinct]] species of wild [[cattle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The same notions of atavisms were used by [[social Darwinism|social Darwinists]], who claimed that inferior [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] displayed atavistic traits, and represented more primitive traits than their own race.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Both atavisms and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[recapitulation theory]] are related [[evolutionary progress]], as development towards greater complexity and superior ability.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In addition, the concept of atavism as part of an individualistic explanation of the causes of criminal deviance was popularised by the Italian criminologist [[Cesare Lombroso]] in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/lombroso.htm |title=Lombroso and the pathological perspective can be traced back to the 19th Century following a history of demonic and classical perspectives |publisher=Criminology.fsu.edu |date=2000-11-27 |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923231227/http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/crimtheory/lombroso.htm |archivedate=2013-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to identify physical characteristics common to criminals and labeled those he found as atavistic, 'throw-back' traits that determined 'primitive' criminal behavior. His statistical evidence and the closely related idea of [[eugenics]] have long since been abandoned by the scientific community, but the concept that physical traits may affect the likelihood of criminal or unethical behavior in a person still has some scientific support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Haselhuhn | first1 = M.

'''Bottom trawling''' is [[trawling]] (towing a '''trawl''', which is a [[fishing net]]) along the sea floor. It is also referred to as "dragging". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into [[Benthic zone|benthic]] trawling and [[Demersal zone|demersal]] trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the [[benthic zone]].

Bottom trawling can be contrasted with [[midwater trawling]] (also known as [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] trawling), where a net is towed higher in the [[water column]]. Midwater trawling catches [[pelagic fish]] such as [[anchovies]], and [[mackerel]], whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish ([[groundfish]]) and semi-pelagic species such as [[cod]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], and [[Sebastes|rockfish]].

Trawling is done by a [[Fishing trawler|trawler]], which can be a small open boat with only {{convert|30|hp|abbr=on}} or a large factory trawler with {{convert|10000|hp|abbr=on}}. Bottom trawling can be carried out by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively ([[pair trawling]]).

Global catch from bottom trawling has been estimated at over 30 million tonnes per year, an amount larger than any other fishing method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Reg A.|last2=Tidd|first2=A.|date=2018-07-01|title=Mapping nearly a century and a half of global marine fishing: 1869–2015|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X18300605|journal=Marine Policy|language=en|volume=93|pages=171–177|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2018.04.023|issn=0308-597X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the environmental impacts of bottom trawling have led to changes in gear design, such as the addition of [[Turtle excluder device|turtle excluder devices]] to reduce [[bycatch]], and limitations on locations where bottom trawling is allowed, such as [[Marine protected area|marine protected areas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/ocean-issues/fishing-and-farming-methods|title=Fishing and Farming Methods from the Seafood Watch Program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium|website=www.seafoodwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pino Ladra 29.jpg|thumb|right|A bottom trawler at [[Viveiro]] in Spain]]

An early reference to fishery conservation measures comes from a complaint about a form of trawling dating from the 14th century, during the reign of [[Edward III]]. A petition was presented to [[Good Parliament|Parliament]] in 1376 calling for the prohibition of a "subtlety contrived instrument called the ''wondyrchoum''". This was an early beam trawl with a wooden beam, and consisted of a net 6&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) wide,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"of so small a mesh, no manner of fish, however small, entering within it can pass out and is compelled to remain therein and be taken...by means of which instrument the fishermen aforesaid take so great abundance of small fish aforesaid, that they know not what to do with them, but feed and fatten the pigs with them, to the great damage of the whole commons of the kingdom, and the destruction of the fisheries in like places, for which they pray remedy."&lt;ref&gt;March, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fishbull.noaa.gov/7-1/collins3.pdf |title=The Beam Trawl Fishery of Great Britain with Notes on Beam-Trawling in Other European Countries |page=292 |last=Collins |first= J.W. |date=1887 |website= |publisher=[[Fishery Bulletin|Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission]] |access-date=17 March 2017 |quote=100 MegaByte PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another source describes the wondyrchoum as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"three fathom long and ten mens' feet wide, and that it had a beam ten feet long, at the end of which were two frames formed like a colerake, that a leaded rope weighted with a great many stones was fixed on the lower part of the net between the two frames, and that another rope was fixed with nails on the upper part of the beam, so that the fish entering the space between the beam and the lower net were caught.  The net had maskes of the length and breadth of two men’s thumbs"&lt;ref&gt;Davis, F (1958) ''An Account of the Fishing Gear of England and Wales.'' 4th edition, HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The response from the Crown was to "let Commission be made by qualified persons to inquire and certify on the truth of this allegation, and thereon let right be done in the [[Court of Chancery]]". Thus, already back in the Middle Ages, basic arguments about three of the most sensitive current issues surrounding trawling - the effect of trawling on the wider environment, the use of small mesh size, and of industrial fishing for animal feed - were already being raised.

Until the late 18th century sailing vessels were only capable of towing small trawls. However, in the closing years of that century a type of vessel emerged that was capable of towing a large trawl, in deeper waters. The development of this type of craft, the sailing trawler, is credited to the fishermen of Brixham in Devon. The new method proved to be far more efficient than traditional long-lining. At first its use was confined to the western half of the English Channel, but as the Brixham men extended their range to the North Sea and Irish Sea it became the norm there too.

By the end of the 19th century there were more than 3,000 sailing trawlers in commission in UK waters and the practice had spread to neighbouring European countries. Despite the availability of steam, trawling under sail continued to be economically efficient, and sailing trawlers continued to be built until the middle of the 1920s. Some were still operating in UK waters until the outbreak of World War II, and in Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands until the 1950s.

English commissions in the 19th century determined that there should be no limitation on trawling.  They believed that bottom trawling, like tilling of land, actually increased production.  As evidence, they noted that a second trawler would often follow a first trawler, and that the second trawler would often harvest even more fish than the first.  The reason for this peculiarity is that the destruction caused by the first trawl resulted in many dead and dying organisms, which temporarily attracted a large number of additional species to feed on this moribund mass.

Bottom trawling has been widely implicated in the population collapse of a variety of fish species, locally and worldwide, including [[orange roughy]], [[barndoor skate]], [[shark]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Callum (2007).

The design requirements of a bottom trawl are relatively simple, a mechanism for keeping the mouth of the net open in horizontal and vertical dimensions, a "body" of net which guides fish inwards, and a "cod-end" of a suitable mesh size, where the fish are collected. The size and design of net used is determined by the species being targeted, the engine power and design of the fishing vessel and locally enforced regulations.

===Beam trawling===
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The simplest method of bottom trawling, the mouth of the net is held open by a solid metal beam, attached to two "shoes", which are solid metal plates, welded to the ends of the beam, which slide over and disturb the seabed. This method is mainly used on smaller vessels, fishing for [[flatfish]] or [[prawn]]s, relatively close inshore.

===Otter trawling===
[[File:FMIB 36645 Otter trawl.jpeg|thumb|right|Otter trawl]]
Otter trawling derives its name from the large rectangular '''otter boards''' which are used to keep the mouth of the trawl net open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned in such a way that the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a [[plough]], digging up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm into the seabed, creating a [[turbid]] cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.
The net is held open vertically on an otter trawl by [[Float (nautical)|float]]s and/or kites attached to the "headline" (the rope which runs along the upper mouth of the net), and weighted "bobbins" attached to the "foot rope" (the rope which runs along the lower mouth of the net). These bobbins vary in their design depending on the [[surface roughness|roughness]] of the sea bed which is being fished, varying from small rubber discs for very smooth, sandy ground, to large metal balls, up to 0.5 m in diameter, for very rough ground. These bobbins can also be designed to lift the net off the seabed when they hit an obstacle. These are known as "rock-hopper" gear.

===Body of the trawl===

[[File:Pelagisches Schleppnetz.jpg|thumb|left|Pelagic (midwater) otter trawl. 1: trawl warp, 2: otter boards, 3: longline chains, 4 hunter, 5: weights 6: headline with floats, 7: pre-net, 8: tunnel and belly, 9: codend]]
The body of the trawl is funnel-like, wide at its "mouth" and narrowing towards the cod end, and usually is fitted with wings of netting at the both sides of the mouth. It is long enough to assure adequate flow of water and prevent fish from escaping the net, after having been caught. It is made of diamond-meshed netting, the size of the meshes decreasing from the front of the net towards the codend. Into the body, fish and turtle escape devices can be fitted. These can be simple structures like "square mesh panels", which are easier for smaller fish to pass through, or more complicated devices, such as [[bycatch]] grills.

===Cod end===
The cod end is the trailing end of the net where fish are finally "caught". The size of mesh in the cod end is a determinant of the size of fish which the net catches. Consequently, regulation of mesh size is a common way of managing [[death|mortality]] of [[juvenile (animal)|juvenile]] fishes in trawl nets.

==How trawls work==
[[Image:Netbobbins.jpg|thumb|right|Bobbins (lower left) and floats (lower right - upper right) on a trawl net]]
The idea that fish are passively "scooped up" is commonly held, and has been since trawling was first developed, but has been revealed to be erroneous. Since the development of [[scuba diving]] equipment and cheap [[video camera]]s it has been possible to directly observe the processes that occur when a trawl is towed along the seabed.
The trawl doors disturb the sea bed, create a cloud of muddy water which hides the oncoming trawl net and generates a noise which attracts fish. The fish begin to swim in front of the net mouth. As the trawl continues along the seabed, fish begin to tire and slip backwards into the net. Finally, the fish become exhausted and drop back, into the "cod end" and are caught.
The speed that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species which is being targeted and the exact gear that is being used, but for most [[Demersal zone|demersal]] species, a speed of around 4 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s (7&amp;nbsp;km/h) is appropriate.

==Environmental damage==
{{see also|Environmental impact of fishing|environmental damage|Marine conservation}}
Bottom fishing has operated for over a century on heavily fished grounds such as the [[North Sea]] and [[Grand Banks]]. While [[overfishing]] has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water [[coral]] ''[[Lophelia pertusa]]''. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-59-PV.56 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=59 |meeting=56 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk02 |date=17 November 2004 |speakername=Ms. Kimball | speakernation=International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=2009-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A global analysis of the impacts of bottom trawling found that the impact on seabed [[Biota (biology)|biota]] was strongly dependent on the type of gear used, with otter trawls estimated has having the smallest impact and removing 6% of biota per pass while hydraulic dredges had the largest impact and removed 41% of biota per pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiddink|first=Jan Geert|last2=Jennings|first2=Simon|last3=Sciberras|first3=Marija|last4=Szostek|first4=Claire L.|last5=Hughes|first5=Kathryn M.|last6=Ellis|first6=Nick|last7=Rijnsdorp|first7=Adriaan D.|last8=McConnaughey|first8=Robert A.|last9=Mazor|first9=Tessa|date=2017-07-14|title=Global analysis of depletion and recovery of seabed biota after bottom trawling disturbance|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/11/1618858114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=201618858|doi=10.1073/pnas.1618858114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28716926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resuspension===
Bottom trawling stirs up the sediment at the bottom of the sea. The [[suspended solids|suspended solid]] plumes can drift with the current for tens of kilometres from the source of the trawling, increasing sedimentation rates in deep environments &lt;ref&gt;Paradis et al. (2017), [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep43332 ''Bottom-trawling along submarine canyons impacts deep sedimentary regimes''], Scientific Reports 7, 43332, doi:10.1038/srep43332 &lt;/ref&gt;. These plumes introduce a [[turbidity]] which decreases light levels at the bottom and can affect [[kelp]] reproduction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Ocean sediments are the sink for many [[persistent organic pollutants]], usually [[lipophilic]] pollutants like [[Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane|DDT]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiff, K.C. (2000) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6N-3YS3815-B/2/1ff623efeaf696f99aa50c6f7a1aa3ae ''Sediment Chemistry on the Mainland Shelf of the Southern California Bight''] Marine Pollution Bulletin 40, pp 268-276.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Bottom trawling mixes these pollutants into the [[plankton|plankton ecology]] where they can move back up the [[food chain]] and into our food supply.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw et al. (2012), [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749112003284 ''Bottom trawling resuspends sediment and releases bioavailable contaminants in a polluted fjord''], Environmental Pollution 170, 232-241 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phosphorus]] is often found in high concentration in soft shallow sediments.&lt;ref&gt;Ruttenberg, K.C.(2003) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B782S-4CJV6M2-4Y/2/6e1f99141d41404a3f9ae9ac91bf4bb9 ''The Global Phosphorus Cycle.''] in Treatise on Geochemistry, Volume 8 (Biogeochemistry). Editor Schlesinger, W.H.; Executive editors, Holland, H.D. &amp; Turekian, K.K. Pergamon, Oxford, pp. 585-643.&lt;/ref&gt;  Resuspending nutrient solids like these can introduce oxygen demand into the water column, and result in oxygen deficient [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Even in areas where the bottom sediments are ancient, bottom trawling, by reintroducing the sediment into the water column, can create [[algae bloom|harmful algae blooms]].&lt;ref&gt;Giannakourou, A., Orlova, T.Y., Assimakopoulou, G., Pagou, K.

===Current restrictions===
Today, some countries regulate bottom trawling within their jurisdictions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethehighseas.org/recentaction.cfm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204193626/http://www.savethehighseas.org/recentaction.cfm |date=February 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[United States]] [[U.S. Regional Fishery Management Councils|Regional Fishery Management Councils]] limit bottom trawling in specific closed areas to protect specific species or habitat. For instance, on the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]] a large Rockfish Conservation Area was created in 2002 prohibiting trawling in most areas of the coast between 75 and 150 [[fathoms]] to protect [[overfished]] [[Sebastes|rockfish]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Trawl Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) Boundary Modifications Draft  Environmental Assessment September 2013, National Marine Fisheries Service Sustainable Fisheries Division Northwest Region|url=https://www.pcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/G6b_RCA_DRAFT_EA_SEPT2013BB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, these closures were revised to allow trawling in some previously closed areas while closing new areas of sensitive habitat to bottom trawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EDF and Fishermen Help Secure 140,000-Square-Miles of New Ocean Protections |date=April 10, 2018 |access-date=August 22, 2018|url=https://www.edf.org/media/edf-and-fishermen-help-secure-140000-square-miles-new-ocean-protections}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Council of the European Union]] in 2004 applied "a precautionary approach" and closed the sensitive [[Darwin Mounds]] off Scotland to bottom trawling.
* In 2005, the [[FAO]]’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below 1000 metres and, in January 2006, completely closed ecologically sensitive areas off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all bottom trawling.
* [[Norway]] first recognized in 1999 that trawling had caused significant damage to its cold-water lophelia corals.  Norway has since established a program to determine the location of cold-water corals within its [[EEZ]] so as to quickly close those areas to bottom trawling.
* [[Canada]] has acted to protect vulnerable coral reef ecosystems from bottom trawling off [[Nova Scotia]].  The [[Gulf of Maine|Northeast Channel]] was protected by a fisheries closure in 2002, and the [[The Gully (Atlantic)|Gully]] area was protected by its designation as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2004.
* [[Australia]] in 1999 established the [[Tasmanian Seamounts Marine Reserve]] to prohibit bottom trawling in the south [[Tasman Sea]].   Australia also prohibits bottom trawling in The Great Australian Bight Marine Park near Ceduna off [[South Australia]].   In 2004, Australia established the world’s largest marine protected area in the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]] where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.
* [[New Zealand]] in 2001 closed 19 seamounts within its [[EEZ]] to bottom trawling, including in the Chatham Rise, sub-Antarctic waters, and off the east and west coasts of the North Island.  [[New Zealand]] Fisheries Minister [[Jim Anderton]] announced on 14 February 2006 that a draft agreement had been reached with fishing companies to ban bottom trawling in 30 percent of New Zealand's [[exclusive economic zone]], an area of about 1.2 million km² reaching from sub-Antarctic waters to sub-tropical ones.&lt;ref name="nzherald1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10368258 |title=NZ to close 30pc of waters to trawling - National - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But only a small fraction of the area proposed for protection will cover areas actually vulnerable to bottom trawling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3766013a6160,00.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Palau]] has banned all bottom trawling within its jurisdiction and by any Palauan or Palauan corporation anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethehighseas.org/display.cfm?ID=104]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515010559/http://www.savethehighseas.org/display.cfm?ID=104 |date=May 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The President of [[Kiribati]], Anote Tong, announced in early 2006 the formation of the world’s first deep sea marine reserve area.  This measure— the [[Phoenix Islands Protected Area]]— creates the world's third largest marine protected area and may protect deep sea corals, fish, and seamounts from bottom trawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smh.com.au/news/world/kiribati-creates-worlds-first-deepsea-marine-reserve/2006/03/29/1143441214620.html |title=Kiribati creates world's first deep-sea marine reserve - World |publisher=smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual boundaries of this reserve and what harvest limitations may occur therein have not been detailed. Moreover, Kiribati currently has only 1 patrol boat to monitor this proposed region.
* [[Hong Kong]] passed legislation banning trawling on 18 May 2011 in an effort to restore the territory's devastated fish stocks and marine ecosystem. The ban came into effect on 31 December 2012. The government paid HK$1.72 billion to affected trawlers in a buyout scheme. Persons who contravene the ban can be fined or imprisoned under the Fisheries Protection Ordinance (Cap 171).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About the Trawling Ban in Hong Kong Waters|url=http://www.wwf.org.hk/en/whatwedo/conservation/marine/sos/abouttrawlban/|publisher=WWF Hong Kong|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AFCD officers intercept illegal trawler (with photo)|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201607/26/P2016072600978.htm|publisher=Hong Kong Government|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of regulation===
Beyond national jurisdictions, most bottom trawling is unregulated either because there is no Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) with competence to regulate, or else what RFMOs that do exist have not actually regulated.  The major exception to this is in the Antarctic region, where the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] regime has instituted extensive bottom trawling restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/e_pubs/am/man-ant/p4.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913233502/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/e_pubs/am/man-ant/p4.htm |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) also recently closed four seamounts and part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge from all fishing, including bottom trawling, for three years. This still leaves most of international waters completely without bottom trawl regulation.

As of May 2007 the area managed under the South Pacific [[Regional Fisheries Management Organisation]] (SPRFMO) [http://www.southpacificrfmo.org/] has gained a new level of protection. All countries fishing in the region (accounting for about 25 percent of the global ocean) agreed to exclude bottom trawling on high seas areas where vulnerable ecosystems are likely or known to occur until a specific impact assessment is undertaken and precautionary measures have been implemented. Also observers will be required on all high seas bottom trawlers to ensure enforcement of the regulations.

===Failed United Nations ban===
[[Palau]] President [[Tommy Remengesau]] has called for a ban on destructive and unregulated bottom trawling beyond national jurisdictions. Palau has led the effort at the [[United Nations]] and in the [[Pacific]] to achieve a [[consensus]] by countries to take this action at an international level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palauun.org/news_archive.cfm?news_id=76 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626070249/http://www.palauun.org/news_archive.cfm?news_id=76 |date=June 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/vol25/enb2525e.html |title=Earth Negotiations Bulletin - ENB SUMMARY OF THE WORKING GROUP ON MARINE BIODIVERSITY BEYOND AREAS OF NATIONAL JURISDICTION - MONDAY, 20 FEBRUARY 2006 |publisher=Iisd.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Palau has been joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], and [[Tuvalu]] in supporting an interim bottom trawling ban at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0608/S00026.htm |title=Pacific Leaders Back Bottom Trawling Ban &amp;#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for this ban did not result in any actual legislation and was blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6181396.stm |title=Science/Nature &amp;#124; Ban on 'brutal' fishing blocked |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[New Zealand]] Fisheries Minister [[Jim Anderton]] promised to support a global ban on bottom trawling if there was sufficient support to make that a practical option. Bottom Trawling has been banned in 1/3 of New Zealand's waters (although a large percentage of these areas were not viable for bottom trawling in the first place) &lt;ref name="nzherald1"/&gt;

The ten-year program was implemented through a contract by the [[Administration for Children and Families]] with Mathematica Policy Research.&lt;ref name=mathematica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813065842/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |archivedate=2010-08-13 |df= }} Mathematica Policy Research website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major study questions of the Building Strong Families Project included:&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

* '''Foundation''': What underlying conditions, preparation, resources, and context make it possible to implement programs that focus on promoting healthy marriage for a target population of low-income unwed couples with children? On what theories of behavior and family well-being do the programs rest? What types of organizations are well suited to operating such programs?
* '''Operation''': What are the important issues and challenges in designing, implementing, and operating programs, and what lessons can be drawn from the program experience? What services are included, and how do they complement existing programs for low-income families?
* '''Participation''': Who participates and for how long? What services do they receive? How does participation differ for subgroups?
* '''Impacts''': How do BSF programs affect couples’ attitudes and expectations about marriage, the quality and stability of their relationships, and whether they marry? What effects are found on parents and their relationships with their children, and the well-being and development of children? Which program designs work best?

==Rationale==

"Strengthening relationships and increasing fathers' involvement have emerged as central national policy strategies to improve the lives of low-income families and enhance the well-being of children. We are conducting studies to increase understanding about how to help low-income couples solidify their relationships, engage fathers more fully, and create the best environments in which to raise children ... [our] 10-year Building Strong Families demonstration is testing whether workshops on communication and relationship skills, combined with social supports, can help unwed parents stay together, manage conflict, maintain intimacy, increase the degree to which fathers are involved in their children’s lives, and improve children’s early development. The study is using a rigorous random assignment design and includes more than 5,000 couples in seven states. A report released in May 2010 provides short-term results on BSF’s impacts on couples after about 15 months, focusing on the stability and quality of the couples’ relationships."&lt;ref name="mathematica"/&gt;

==Impact report==
[[File:BSF Impacts.jpg|thumb|BSF 15-Month Impact Report]]

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]]. Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

==Impact debate==

Scholars offered different perspectives on the findings:

A study from Harvard's Kennedy School reported: "In general, at the time of the 15-month follow-up the BSF intervention did not have a statistically or substantively significant effect on couples‘ relationship status or quality, or fathers‘ involvement with their children. Although the BSF had little or no effect on couples‘ relationships overall, impacts varied meaningfully across the eight evaluation sites; for example, the Oklahoma City site‘s BSF program had a consistent pattern of positive effects at 15 months. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, at the Baltimore site the BSF intervention had numerous negative effects: at the time of the 15-month follow-up survey, Baltimore couples who had been randomly assigned to participate in the BSF program were much less likely than control group couples to be romantically involved; fathers assigned to the BSF program were less likely to provide substantial financial support for their children or see them regularly; and mothers in the BSF sample were more likely to report experiencing a severe physical assault than were mothers in the control group."&lt;ref&gt;Clarkwest, Andrew; Killewald, Alexandra; Wood, Robert. "Stepping up or Stepping Back: Highly Disadvantaged Parents' Responses to the Building Strong Families Program," Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government, May 23, 2012.[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/wiener/wps/BSF_Baltimore_chapter_05232012_HKS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for RH Reality Check, Joseph DiNorcia wrote, "The evidence is unmistakable: there’s just no amount of government coaxing that will make unmarried couples want to, as Beyoncé would say, 'put a ring on it.' A new report from Mathematica Policy Research, Inc, shows that the relationship skills education programs implemented by the Administration for Children and Families have, with a few exceptions, no effect on participants. These programs provide 'education' and support services to unmarried, low-income, heterosexual couples with newborn babies, and are among the marriage-promotion projects which had been enthusiastically touted by the Bush administration as a magic pill for poverty and unstable families."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/node/14001] DiNorcia, Joseph. "Building Strong Families Found Completely Ineffective," RH Reality Check, August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Stanley, Ph.D. and Frank Fincham, Ph.D., two leading researchers in the field of Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE), attributed the impact findings to flaws in program implementation, arguing: "A summary from the BSF study that marriage/relationship education (MRE) does not work is not tenable, in our view. In addition to studying many other aspects of program and delivery, BSF really became more of a study of participation rates than of the impacts of MRE and other program elements. The main reason is that, in many sites, the 'dose' of MRE that couples received was quite low. In fact, in some sites, only 40% of couples ever attended even one session together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narme.org]"Comments from Dr. Scott Stanley and Dr. Frank Fincham on the Building Strong Families Study," National Association of Relationship and Marriage Educators, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Loving Couples Loving Children (LCLC) is a curriculum developed by [[John Gottman|John and Julie Gottman]] especially for low-income couples who are expecting a child. John Gottman is world-renowned for his scientific work identifying the predictors of relationship success and failure, while Julie Gottman is a master clinician who provides advanced training in marriage education and couples therapy ... To engage and retain the interest of low-income couples, they substantially modified the presentation of the material by developing a series of video 'talk shows' in which racially and ethnically diverse low-income couples discuss relationship issues. Each of the forty-two sessions in LCLC begins with such a talk show, which leads to a lively discussion among group participants. In these unscripted shows real couples, not actors, describe the challenges they have faced in their relationship and how they overcame them. The second half of each group session is devoted to activities that teach specific skills and techniques that couples can use to address the issues raised in the video. Participants practice skills with their partners during the session, with individual attention from the male and female co-facilitators, as needed."&lt;ref name=dion&gt;Dion, Robin M. "Healthy Marriage Programs: Learning What Works," Marriage and Child Wellbeing, Volume 15, Number 2, Fall 2005.

"Love's Cradle is based on the well-established Relationship Enhancement (RE) program, adapted and supplemented by new material developed especially to address issues identified by researchers as crucial barriers to positive family formation in fragile families. Created by Mary Ortwein, a marriage and family therapist with experience serving low-income families, and Bernard Guerney, the original developer of RE, Love's Cradle relies on a simplified and more culturally sensitive version of Relationship Enhancement taught at the fifth-grade level, and adds content to the standard RE skills. The simplified version avoids psychological jargon and teaches skills at a slower pace, with greater access to individual skills coaching. Love's Cradle consists of twenty-one two-hour group sessions. Ten sessions, most at the beginning of the program, are devoted to the simplified RE skills. Additional sessions allow couples to use their new skills to address the issues indicated by research to be common to low-income couples, including how to build, rebuild, and maintain trust; deal with multiple- partner fertility; manage emotions; work as a team on money matters; and reframe their understanding of marriage. Love's Cradle was field-tested with low-income couples and will be part of the Building Strong Families national evaluation."&lt;ref name="dion"/&gt;

"The Becoming Parents Program (BPP) curriculum, developed by Dr. Pamela Jordan, focused on three areas: (1) communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun; (2) self-care and anger management; and (3) infant care and development. To meet BSF requirements, BPP was adapted to include material relevant for low-income families. The information on communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun was largely drawn from the PREP curriculum. Skills included using a 'speaker–listener' technique, establishing ground rules, identifying hidden issues, and maintaining friendship and fun in the relationship. The focus on self-care and anger management included such strategies as using time-out to prevent escalation. Material was adapted from the Stop Anger and Violence Prevention program and the Domestic Conflict Containment Program."&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;"Catalog of Research: Programs for Low-Income Couples," Mathematica Policy Research, May 2012.[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opre/catalog_couples.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer-assisted language learning (CALL), British, or Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI)/Computer-Aided Language Instruction (CALI), American'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=John|date=1983|title=Computer assisted language learning|url=|journal=Language Teaching|volume=16(2)|pages=102-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''',''' is briefly defined in a seminal work by Levy (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;1) as "the search for and study of applications of the computer in language teaching and learning".&lt;ref name=levy1997&gt;Levy M. (1997) ''CALL: context and conceptualisation'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; CALL embraces a wide range of [[information and communications technology]] applications and approaches to teaching and learning foreign languages, from the "traditional" drill-and-practice programs that characterised CALL in the 1960s and 1970s to more recent manifestations of CALL, e.g. as used in a [[virtual learning environment]] and Web-based [[distance learning]]. It also extends to the use of [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards,&lt;ref name=schmidcutrim2009&gt;Schmid Euline Cutrim (2009) ''Interactive whiteboard technology in the language classroom: exploring new pedagogical opportunities'', Saarbrücken, Germany: VDM Verlag Dr. Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-mediated communication (CMC),&lt;ref name=lamyhampel&gt;Lamy M.-N. &amp; Hampel R. (2007) ''Online communication in language learning and teaching'', Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]], and [[Mobile Assisted Language Learning|mobile-assisted language learning (MALL)]].&lt;ref name=shieldkukulska&gt;Shield L. &amp; Kukulska-Hulme A. (eds.) (2008) Special edition of ''ReCALL'' (20, 3) on ''Mobile Assisted Language Learning''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CALI (computer-assisted language instruction) was in use before CALL, reflecting its origins as a subset of the general term CAI (computer-assisted instruction). CALI fell out of favour among language teachers, however, as it appeared to imply a teacher-centred approach (instructional), whereas language teachers are more inclined to prefer a student-centred approach, focusing on learning rather than instruction. CALL began to replace CALI in the early 1980s (Davies &amp; Higgins 1982: p.&amp;nbsp;3)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1982) ''Computers, language and language learning'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now incorporated into the names of the growing number of [[#Professional associations|professional associations]] worldwide.

An alternative term, technology-enhanced language learning (TELL),&lt;ref&gt;Bush M. &amp; Terry R. (1997) (eds.) ''Technology-enhanced language learning'', Lincolnwood, Illinois: National Textbook Company.&lt;/ref&gt; also emerged around the early 1990s: e.g. the TELL Consortium project, University of Hull.

The current philosophy of CALL puts a strong emphasis on student-centred materials that allow learners to work on their own. Such materials may be structured or unstructured, but they normally embody two important features: interactive learning and individualised learning. CALL is essentially a tool that helps teachers to facilitate the language learning process. It can be used to reinforce what has already been learned in the classroom or as a remedial tool to help learners who require additional support.

The design of CALL materials generally takes into consideration principles of language pedagogy and methodology, which may be derived from different learning theories (e.g. behaviourist, cognitive, constructivist) and second-language learning theories such as Stephen Krashen's [[monitor hypothesis]].

A combination of face-to-face teaching and CALL is usually referred to as [[blended learning]]. Blended learning is designed to increase learning potential and is more commonly found than pure CALL (Pegrum 2009: p.&amp;nbsp;27).&lt;ref&gt;Pegrum M. (2009) ''From blogs to bombs: The future of digital technologies in education'', Perth: University of Western Australia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CALL dates back to the 1960s, when it was first introduced on university mainframe computers. The PLATO project, initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960, is an important landmark in the early development of CALL (Marty 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marty | first1 = F | year = 1981 | title = Reflections on the use of computers in second language acquisition | url = | journal = System | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 85–98 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of the microcomputer in the late 1970s brought computing within the range of a wider audience, resulting in a boom in the development of CALL programs and a flurry of publications of books on CALL in the early 1980s.

Dozens of CALL programs are currently available on the internet, at prices ranging from free to expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://Lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=12 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other programs are available only through university language courses.

There have been several attempts to document the history of CALL. Sanders (1995) covers the period from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, focusing on CALL in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders R. (ed.) (1995) ''Thirty years of computer-assisted language instruction'', Festschrift for John R. Russell, ''CALICO Journal'' Special Issue, 12, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Delcloque (2000) documents the history of CALL worldwide, from its beginnings in the 1960s to the dawning of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Delcloque P. (2000) ''History of CALL'' [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/History_of_CALL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2005) takes a look back at CALL's past and attempts to predict where it is going.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2005) ''Computer Assisted Language Learning: Where are we now and where are we going?'' [ Online]: http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/docs/UCALL_Keynote.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard (2009) offers a compilation of 74 key articles and book excerpts, originally published in the years 1988-2007, that give a comprehensive overview of the wide range of leading ideas and research results that have exerted an influence on the development of CALL or that show promise in doing so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P.

''Computer-assisted language learning'', Volumes I-IV, Routledge: London and New York: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callcc/&lt;/ref&gt; A published review of Hubbard's collection can be found in ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 14, 3 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' (2010) 14, 3, pp. 14-18 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/issues/october2010/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler-Pascoe (2011) looks at the history of CALL from a different point of view, namely the evolution of CALL in the dual fields of educational technology and second/foreign language acquisition and the paradigm shifts experienced along the way.&lt;ref&gt;Butler-Pascoe M. E. (2011) "The history of CALL: the intertwining paths of technology and second/foreign language teaching", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 1: 16-32: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology and phases==

During the 1980s and 1990s, several attempts were made to establish a CALL typology. A wide range of different types of CALL programs was identified by Davies &amp; Higgins (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. &amp; Higgins J. (1985) ''Using computers in language learning: a teacher's guide'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones &amp; Fortescue (1987),&lt;ref&gt;Jones C. &amp; Fortescue S. (1987) ''Using computers in the language classroom'', Harlow: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty &amp; Windeatt (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty D. &amp; Windeatt S. (1989) ''CALL'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Levy (1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;118ff.).&lt;ref name=levy1997/&gt; These included gap-filling and Cloze programs, multiple-choice programs, free-format (text-entry) programs, adventures and simulations, action mazes, sentence-reordering programs, exploratory programs—and "total Cloze", a type of program in which the learner has to reconstruct a whole text. Most of these early programs still exist in modernised versions.

Since the 1990s, it has become increasingly difficult to categorise CALL as it now extends to the use of [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[social networking]], [[podcasting]], [[Web 2.0]] applications, [[#Virtual worlds|language learning in virtual worlds]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] (Davies et al. 2010: Section 3.7).&lt;ref name=davieswalkeretal/&gt;

Warschauer (1996)&lt;ref name=warschauer96&gt;Warschauer M. (1996) "Computer-assisted language learning: an introduction". In Fotos S. (ed.) ''Multimedia language teaching'', Tokyo: Logos International [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/warschauer.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Warschauer &amp; Healey (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Warschauer | first1 = M. | last2 = Healey | first2 = D. | year = 1998 | title = Computers and language learning: an overview | url = | journal = Language Teaching | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 57–71 | doi=10.1017/s0261444800012970}}&lt;/ref&gt; took a different approach. Rather than focusing on the typology of CALL, they identified three historical phases of CALL, classified according to their underlying pedagogical and methodological approaches:

* Behavioristic CALL: conceived in the 1950s and implemented in the 1960s and 1970s.
* Communicative CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Integrative CALL: embracing Multimedia and the Internet: 1990s.

Most CALL programs in Warschauer &amp; Healey's first phase, Behavioristic CALL (1960s to 1970s), consisted of drill-and-practice materials in which the computer presented a stimulus and the learner provided a response. At first, both could be done only through text. The computer would analyse students' input and give feedback, and more sophisticated programs would react to students' mistakes by branching to help screens and remedial activities. While such programs and their underlying pedagogy still exist today, behaviouristic approaches to language learning have been rejected by most language teachers, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has led CALL to other possibilities.

The second phase described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Communicative CALL, is based on the [[communicative approach]] that became prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s (Underwood 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Underwood J. (1984) ''Linguistics, computers and the language teacher: a communicative approach'', Rowley, Massachusetts: Newbury House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the communicative approach the focus is on using the language rather than analysis of the language, and grammar is taught implicitly rather than explicitly. It also allows for originality and flexibility in student output of language. The communicative approach coincided with the arrival of the PC, which made computing much more widely available and resulted in a boom in the development of software for language learning. The first CALL software in this phase continued to provide skill practice but not in a drill format—for example: paced reading, text reconstruction and language games—but the computer remained the tutor. In this phase, computers provided context for students to use the language, such as asking for directions to a place, and programs not designed for language learning such as [[Sim City]], ''Sleuth'' and [[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]] were used for language learning. Criticisms of this approach include using the computer in an ad hoc and disconnected manner for more marginal aims rather than the central aims of language teaching.

The third phase of CALL described by Warschauer &amp; Healey, Integrative CALL, starting from the 1990s, tried to address criticisms of the communicative approach by integrating the teaching of language skills into tasks or projects to provide direction and coherence. It also coincided with the development of multimedia technology (providing text, graphics, sound and animation) as well as Computer-mediated communication (CMC). CALL in this period saw a definitive shift from the use of the computer for drill and tutorial purposes (the computer as a finite, authoritative base for a specific task) to a medium for extending education beyond the classroom. Multimedia CALL started with interactive laser videodiscs such as ''Montevidisco'' (Schneider &amp; Bennion 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Schneider E.W. &amp; Bennion J.L. (1984) "Veni, vidi, vici, via videodisc: a simulator for instructional courseware". In Wyatt D.H. (ed.) ''Computer-assisted language instruction'', Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A la rencontre de Philippe'' (Fuerstenberg 1993),&lt;ref&gt;Fuerstenberg G. (1993) ''A la rencontre de Philippe'': Videodisc, Software, Teacher's Manual and Student Activities Workbook: Yale University Press [Online]: http://web.mit.edu/fll/www/projects/Philippe.html&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were simulations of situations where the learner played a key role. These programs later were transferred to CD-ROMs, and new [[role-playing games]] (RPGs) such as ''Who is Oscar Lake?'' made their appearance in a range of different languages.

In a later publication Warschauer changed the name of the first phase of CALL from Behavioristic CALL to Structural CALL and also revised the dates of the three phases (Warschauer 2000):&lt;ref&gt;Warschauer M. (2000) "CALL for the 21st Century", IATEFL and ESADE Conference, 2 July 2000, Barcelona, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Structural CALL: 1970s to 1980s.
* Communicative CALL: 1980s to 1990s.
* Integrative CALL: 2000 onwards.

Bax (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = CALL – past, present and future | url = | journal = System | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 13–28 | doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(02)00071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; took issue with Warschauer &amp; Haley (1998) and Warschauer (2000) and proposed these three phases:

* Restricted CALL – mainly behaviouristic: 1960s to 1980s.
* Open CALL – i.e. open in terms of feedback given to students, software types and the role of the teacher, and including simulations and games: 1980s to 2003 (i.e. the date of Bax's article).
* Integrated CALL – still to be achieved. Bax argued that at the time of writing language teachers were still in the Open CALL phase, as true integration could only be said to have been achieved when CALL had reached a state of "normalisation" – e.g. when using CALL was as normal as using a pen.

See also Bax &amp; Chambers (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bax | first1 = S. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Making CALL work: towards normalisation | url = | journal = System | volume = 34 | issue = 4| pages = 465–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bax (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bax S. (2011) "Normalisation revisited: the effective use of technology in language education", ''International Journal of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Teaching (IJCALLT)'' 1, 2: 1-15: http://www.igi-global.com/ijcallt&lt;/ref&gt; in which the topic of "normalisation" is revisited.

==Flashcards==

A basic use of CALL is in vocabulary acquisition using [[flashcard]]s, which requires quite simple programs. Such programs often make use of [[spaced repetition]], a technique whereby the learner is presented with the vocabulary items that need to be committed to memory at increasingly longer intervals until long-term retention is achieved. This has led to the development of a number of applications known as spaced repetition systems (SRS),&lt;ref&gt;Mounteney M. ''Spaced repetition learning systems (SRS):'' http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php. Accessed 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; including the generic [[Anki (software)|Anki]] or [[SuperMemo]] package and programs such as BYKI&lt;ref&gt;BYKI (Before You Know It): A personalized language-learning system, designed to promote language proficiency by expanding the learner's vocabulary. The system makes use of a flashcard interface and tracks everything that has been learned, automatically presenting and re-presenting the material at appropriate intervals: http://www.byki.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and phase-6,&lt;ref&gt;phase-6: A flashcard system that presents vocabulary at phased intervals, aiding long-term retention. http://www.phase-6.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which have been designed specifically for learners of foreign languages.

==Software design and pedagogy==

Above all, careful consideration must be given to [[pedagogy]] in designing CALL software, but publishers of CALL software tend to follow the latest trend, regardless of its desirability. Moreover, approaches to teaching foreign languages are constantly changing, dating back to [[grammar-translation]], through the [[direct method (education)|direct method]], [[Audio-lingual method|audio-lingualism]] and a variety of other approaches, to the more recent [[communicative approach]] and [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] (Decoo 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Decoo W. (2001) ''On the mortality of language learning methods''. Paper given as the James L. Barker lecture on 8 November 2001 at Brigham Young University [Online]: https://web.archive.org/web/20080208190123/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Designing and creating CALL software is an extremely demanding task, calling upon a range of skills. Major CALL development projects are usually managed by a team of people:

* A subject specialist (also known as a content provider) – usually a language teacher – who is responsible for providing the content and pedagogical input. More than one subject specialist is required for larger CALL projects.
* A programmer who is familiar with the chosen programming language or authoring tool.
* A graphic designer, to produce pictures and icons, and to advise on fonts, colour, screen layout, etc.
* A professional photographer or, at the very least, a very good amateur photographer. Graphic designers often have a background in photography too.
* A sound engineer and a video technician will be required if the package is to contain substantial amounts of sound and video.
* An instructional designer. Developing a CALL package is more than just putting a text book into a computer. An instructional designer will probably have a background in cognitive psychology and media technology, and will be able to advise the subject specialists in the team on the appropriate use of the chosen technology (Gimeno &amp; Davies 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Gimeno-Sanz A. &amp; Davies G. (2010) CALL software design and implementation. Module 3.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

CALL inherently supports [[learner autonomy]], the final of the eight conditions that Egbert et al. (2007) cite as "Conditions for Optimal Language Learning Environments". Learner autonomy places the learner firmly in control so that he or she "decides on learning goals" (Egbert et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Egbert J., Chao C.-C., &amp; Hanson-Smith E. (2007) Introduction: Foundations for Teaching and Learning. In Egbert J. &amp; E. Hanson-Smith (eds.) '' CALL environments: Research, practice, and critical issues '' (2nd edition). Alexandria, VA: TESOL. (pp. 1-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is all too easy when designing CALL software to take the comfortable route and produce a set of multiple-choice and gap-filling exercises, using a simple authoring tool (Bangs 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Bangs P. (2011) Introduction to CALL authoring programs. Module 2.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but CALL is much more than this; Stepp-Greany (2002), for example, describes the creation and management of an environment incorporating a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] and [[whole language]] philosophy. According to constructivist theory, learners are active participants in tasks in which they "construct" new knowledge derived from their prior experience. Learners also assume responsibility for their learning, and the teacher is a facilitator rather than a purveyor of knowledge. Whole language theory embraces constructivism and postulates that language learning moves from the whole to the part, rather than building sub-skills to lead towards the higher abilities of comprehension, speaking, and writing. It also emphasises that comprehending, speaking, reading, and writing skills are interrelated, reinforcing each other in complex ways. Language acquisition is, therefore, an active process in which the learner focuses on cues and meaning and makes intelligent guesses. Additional demands are placed upon teachers working in a technological environment incorporating constructivist and whole language theories. The development of teachers’ professional skills must include new pedagogical as well as technical and management skills. Regarding the issue of teacher facilitation in such an environment, the teacher has a key role to play, but there could be a conflict between the aim to create an atmosphere for learner independence and the teacher's natural feelings of responsibility. In order to avoid learners’ negative perceptions, Stepp-Greany points out that it is especially important for the teacher to continue to address their needs, especially those of low-ability learners.&lt;ref name=steppgreany&gt;Stepp-Greany J. (2002) "Student perceptions on language learning in a technological environment: implications for the new millennium", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 6, 1: 165-180 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol6num1/steppgreany/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia==

Language teachers have been avid users of technology for a very long time. Gramophone records were among the first technological aids to be used by language teachers in order to present students with recordings of native speakers’ voices, and broadcasts from foreign radio stations were used to make recordings on reel-to-reel tape recorders. Other examples of technological aids that have been used in the foreign language classroom include slide projectors, film-strip projectors, film projectors, videocassette recorders and DVD players. In the early 1960s, integrated courses (which were often described as multimedia courses) began to appear. Examples of such courses are ''Ecouter et Parler'' (consisting of a coursebook and tape recordings)&lt;ref&gt;Côté D., Narins Levy S. &amp; O'Connor P. (1962) ''Ecouter et Parler'', Paris: Librairie Marcel Didier.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deutsch durch die audiovisuelle Methode'' (consisting of an illustrated coursebook, tape recordings and a film-strip – based on the Structuro-Global Audio-Visual method).&lt;ref&gt;Burgdorf I. Montani K., Z. Skreb Z. &amp; Vidovic M. (1962) ''Deutsch durch die audio-visuelle Methode'', New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s standard microcomputers were incapable of producing sound and they had poor graphics capability. This represented a step backwards for language teachers, who by this time had become accustomed to using a range of different media in the foreign language classroom. The arrival of the multimedia computer in the early 1990s was therefore a major breakthrough as it enabled text, images, sound and video to be combined in one device and the integration of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing (Davies 2011: Section 1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm&gt;Davies G. (2011) Introduction to multimedia CALL. Module 2.2 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers'' (ICT4LT), Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of CALL programs for multimedia computers that were published on CD-ROM and DVD from the mid-1990s onwards are described by Davies (2010: Section 3).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; CALL programs are still being published on CD-ROM and DVD, but Web-based multimedia CALL has now virtually supplanted these media.

Following the arrival of multimedia CALL, multimedia language centres began to appear in educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to individualise learning but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt; There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go the same way as the language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p.&amp;nbsp;28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.&lt;ref name=davieslessons&gt;Davies G. (1997) "Lessons from the past, lessons for the future: 20 years of CALL". In Korsvold A-K. &amp; Rüschoff B. (eds.) ''New technologies in language learning and teaching'', Strasbourg: Council of Europe, p. 28. Also on the Web in a revised edition (2009): http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/coegdd1.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

Managing a multimedia language centre requires not only staff who have a knowledge of foreign languages and language teaching methodology but also staff with technical know-how and budget management ability, as well as the ability to combine all these into creative ways of taking advantage of what the technology can offer. A centre manager usually needs assistants for technical support, for managing resources and even the tutoring of students. Multimedia centres lend themselves to self-study and potentially self-directed learning, but this is often misunderstood. The simple existence of a multimedia centre does not automatically lead to students learning independently. Significant investment of time is essential for materials development and creating an atmosphere conducive to self-study. Unfortunately, administrators often have the mistaken belief that buying hardware by itself will meet the needs of the centre, allocating 90% of its budget to hardware and virtually ignoring software and staff training needs (Davies et al. 2011: ''Foreword'').&lt;ref name=daviesmmlc&gt;Davies G., Hamilton R., Weidmann B., Gabel S., Legenhausen L., Meus V. &amp; Myers S. (2011) Managing a multimedia language centre. Module 3.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Self access language learning centers|Self-access language learning centres]] or independent learning centres have emerged partially independently and partially in response to these issues. In self-access learning, the focus is on developing learner autonomy through varying degrees of self-directed learning, as opposed to (or as a complement to) classroom learning. In many centres learners access materials and manage their learning independently, but they also have access to staff for help. Many self-access centres are heavy users of technology and an increasing number of them are now offering online self-access learning opportunities. Some centres have developed novel ways of supporting language learning outside the context of the language classroom (also called 'language support') by developing software to monitor students' self-directed learning and by offering online support from teachers. Centre managers and support staff may need to have new roles defined for them to support students’ efforts at self-directed learning: v. Mozzon-McPherson &amp; Vismans (2001), who refer to a new job description, namely that of the "language adviser".&lt;ref&gt;Mozzon-McPherson M. &amp; Vismans R. (eds.) (2001) ''Beyond language teaching towards language advising'', London: CILT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] (now known simply as "the Web") in the early 1990s marked a significant change in the use of communications technology for all computer users. [[Email]] and other forms of [[electronic communication]] had been in existence for many years, but the launch of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]], the first graphical [[Web browser]], in 1993 brought about a radical change in the ways in which we communicate electronically. The launch of the Web in the public arena immediately began to attract the attention of language teachers. Many language teachers were already familiar with the concept of [[hypertext]] on stand-alone computers, which made it possible to set up non-sequential structured reading activities for language learners in which they could point to items of text or images on a page displayed on the computer screen and branch to any other pages, e.g. in a so-called "stack" as implemented in the [[HyperCard]] program on Apple Mac computers. The Web took this one stage further by creating a worldwide hypertext system that enabled the user to branch to different pages on computers anywhere in the world simply by pointing and clicking at a piece of text or an image. This opened up access to thousands of authentic foreign-language websites to teachers and students that could be used in a variety of ways. A problem that arose, however, was that this could lead to a good deal of time-wasting if Web browsing was used in an unstructured way (Davies 1997: pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43),&lt;ref name=davieslessons/&gt; and language teachers responded by developing more structured activities and online exercises (Leloup &amp; Ponterio 2003).&lt;ref&gt;LeLoup J. &amp; Ponterio R. (2003) "Interactive and multimedia techniques in online language lessons: a sampler", ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 7, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol7num3/net/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Davies (2010) lists over 500 websites, where links to online exercises can be found, along with links to online dictionaries and encyclopaedias, concordancers, translation aids and other miscellaneous resources of interest to the language teacher and learner.&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2010) [http://www.camsoftpartners.co.uk/websites.htm Graham Davies's Favourite Websites]&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of the (free) ''[[Hot Potatoes]]'' (Holmes &amp; Arneil) authoring tool, which was first demonstrated publicly at the EUROCALL 1998 conference, made it possible for language teachers to create their own online interactive exercises. Other useful tools are produced by the same authors.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes M. &amp; Arneil S. ''Hot Potatoes'', University of Victoria, Canada. Downloadable from: http://hotpot.uvic.ca: A library of Clipart for use with ''Hot Potatoes'' and other authoring tools is also available at the University of Victoria site: http://hcmc.uvic.ca/clipart/&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days the Web could not compete seriously with [[multimedia]] CALL on CD-ROM and DVD. Sound and video quality was often poor, and interaction was slow. But now the Web has caught up. Sound and video are of high quality and interaction has improved tremendously, although this does depend on sufficient bandwidth being available, which is not always the case, especially in remote rural areas and developing countries. One area in which CD-ROMs and DVDs are still superior is in the presentation of listen/respond/playback activities, although such activities on the Web are continually improving.

Since the early 2000s there has been a boom in the development of so-called [[Web 2.0]] applications. Contrary to popular opinion, Web 2.0 is not a new version of the Web, rather it implies a shift in emphasis from Web browsing, which is essentially a one-way process (from the Web to the end-user), to making use of Web applications in the same way as one uses applications on a desktop computer. It also implies more interaction and sharing. Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to the Internet. Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; list the following examples of Web 2.0 applications that language teachers are using:

* Image storage and sharing
* [[Social bookmarking]]
* Discussion lists, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[social networking]]
* [[Chat room]]s, [[MUD]]s, [[MOO]]s and [[MUVE]]s (virtual worlds)
* [[Podcasting]]
* Audio tools
* [[Video sharing]] applications and [[screen capture (disambiguation)|screen capture]] tools (referring to both video screen capture tools and screenshot tools)
* Animation tools – comic strips, movies, etc.
* [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|Mashup]]s
* Blog assisted language learning (BALL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esp-world.info/Articles_26/push%20button%20publishing%20ward%202004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There is no doubt that the Web has proved to be a main focus for language teachers, who are making increasingly imaginative use of its wide range of facilities: see Dudeney (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Dudeney G. (2007) ''The Internet and the language classroom'', Second Edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M. (2008) ''Handbook of research on Web 2.0 and second language learning'', Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA: IGI Global.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, the use of Web 2.0 tools calls for a careful reexamination of the role of the teacher in the classroom (Richardson 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson W. (2006) ''Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms''. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpora and concordancers==

Corpora have been used for many years as the basis of linguistic research and also for the compilation of dictionaries and reference works such as the Collins Cobuild series, published by HarperCollins.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins: http://www.harpercollins.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Tribble &amp; Barlow (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Tribble C. &amp; Barlow M. (eds.) (2001) ''Using corpora in language teaching and learning'', Special Issue, ''Language Learning &amp; Technology'' 5, 3 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol5num3/default.html&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair J. (ed.) (2004) ''How to use corpora in language teaching'', Amsterdam: John Benjamins&lt;/ref&gt; and McEnery &amp; Wilson (2011)&lt;ref name=mcenerywilson&gt;McEnery A. &amp; Wilson A. (2011) Corpus linguistics. Module 3.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; describe a variety of ways in which corpora can be used in language teaching.

An early reference to the use of electronic concordancers in language teaching can be found in Higgins &amp; Johns (1984: pp.&amp;nbsp;88–94),&lt;ref&gt;Higgins J. &amp; Johns T. (1984) ''Computers in language learning'', London: Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; and many examples of their practical use in the classroom are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2010).&lt;ref name = lamyklarskov/&gt;

It was Tim Johns (1991), however, who raised the profile of the use of concordancers in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL).&lt;ref&gt;Johns T. (1991) "From printout to handout: grammar and vocabulary teaching in the context of Data Driven Learning". In Johns T. &amp; King P. (eds.) ''Classroom concordancing'', Special issue of ''ELR Journal'' 4, University of Birmingham, Centre for English Language Studies: 27-45.&lt;/ref&gt; DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy &amp; Klarskov Mortensen (2011).&lt;ref name=lamyklarskov&gt;Lamy M-N. &amp; Klarskov Mortensen H. J. (2011) Using concordance programs in the Modern Foreign Languages classroom. Module 2.4 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod2-4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Robb (2003) shows how it is possible to use Google as a concordancer, but he also points out a number of drawbacks, for instance there is no control over the educational level, nationality, or other characteristics of the creators of the texts that are found, and the presentation of the examples is not as easy to read as the output of a dedicated concordancer that places the key words (i.e. the search terms) in context.&lt;ref&gt;Robb T. (2003) "Google as a Quick 'n Dirty Corpus Tool", ''TESL-EJ'' 7, 2 [Online]: http://tesl-ej.org/ej26/int.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual worlds==

[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. Language teachers discovered that it was possible to exploit these text-only programs by using them as the basis for discussion. Jones G. (1986) describes an experiment based on the Kingdom simulation, in which learners played roles as members of a council governing an imaginary kingdom. A single computer in the classroom was used to provide the stimulus for discussion, namely simulating events taking place in the kingdom: crop planting time, harvest time, unforeseen catastrophes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = G | year = 1986 | title = Computer simulations in language teaching – the KINGDOM experiment | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 179–186 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90007-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early adventure games and simulations led on to multi-user variants, which were known as [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains). Like their predecessors, MUDs were text-only, with the difference that they were available to a wider online audience. MUDs then led on to [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding: see Donaldson &amp; Kötter (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = R.P. | last2 = Kötter | first2 = M. | year = 1999 | title = Language learning in cyberspace: teleporting the classroom into the target culture | url = | journal = CALICO Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 531–558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major breakthrough in the history of virtual worlds was the graphical user interface. [[Habitat (video game)|Lucasfilm's Habitat]] (1986), was one of the first virtual worlds that was graphically based, albeit only in a two-dimensional environment. Each participant was represented by a visual avatar who could interact with other avatars using text chat.

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as Traveler and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. Traveler included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars who were represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of Active Worlds as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the interest of language teachers with the launch of the first of the series of SLanguages conferences in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2011: Section 14.2.1)&lt;ref name=introinternet/&gt; and Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2010)&lt;ref name=molka&gt;Molka-Danielsen, J. &amp; Deutschmann, M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Trondheim, Norway: Tapir Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; describe a number of experiments and projects that focus on language learning in Second Life. See also the Wikipedia article [[Virtual world language learning]].

To what extent Second Life and other virtual worlds will become established as important tools for teachers of foreign languages remains to be seen. It has been argued by Dudeney (2010) in his ''That's Life'' blog that Second Life is "too demanding and too unreliable for most educators". The subsequent discussion shows that this view is shared by many teachers, but many others completely disagree.&lt;ref&gt;Second Life – The Long Goodbye: http://slife.dudeney.com/?p=446&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the pros and cons of Second Life, language teachers’ interest in virtual worlds continues to grow. The joint EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2009, and there are now many areas in Second Life that are dedicated to language learning and teaching, for example the commercial area for learners of English, which is managed by Language Lab,&lt;ref&gt;LanguageLab: http://www.languagelab.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and free areas such as the region maintained by the Goethe-Institut&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands.&lt;ref&gt;EduNation Islands: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of simulations created specifically for language education, such as those produced by the EC-funded NIFLAR&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt; and AVALON&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; projects. NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|Opensim]].

==Human language technologies==

Human language technologies (HLT) comprise a number of areas of research and development that focus on the use of technology to facilitate communication in a multilingual information society. Human language technologies are areas of activity in departments of the European Commission that were formerly grouped under the heading [[language engineering]] (Gupta &amp; Schulze 2011: Section 1.1).&lt;ref name=guptaschulze&gt;Gupta P. &amp; Schulze M. (2011) Human Language Technologies (HLT). Module 3.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod3-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of HLT that is of greatest interest to the language teacher is [[natural language processing]] (NLP), especially [[parsing]], as well as the areas of [[speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]].

Speech synthesis has improved immeasurably in recent years. It is often used in electronic dictionaries to enable learners to find out how words are pronounced. At word level, speech synthesis is quite effective, the artificial voice often closely resembling a human voice. At phrase level and sentence level, however, there are often problems of intonation, resulting in speech production that sounds unnatural even though it may be intelligible. Speech synthesis as embodied in [[text to speech]] (TTS) applications is invaluable as a tool for unsighted or partially sighted people. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 4.1) list several examples of speech synthesis applications.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Speech recognition is less advanced than speech synthesis. It has been used in a number of CALL programs, in which it is usually described as [[automatic speech recognition]] (ASR). ASR is not easy to implement. Ehsani &amp; Knodt (1998) summarise the core problem as follows:

"Complex cognitive processes account for the human ability to associate acoustic signals with meanings and intentions. For a computer, on the other hand, speech is essentially a series of digital values. However, despite these differences, the core problem of speech recognition is the same for both humans and machines: namely, of finding the best match between a given speech sound and its corresponding word string. Automatic speech recognition technology attempts to simulate and optimize this process computationally."&lt;ref name=ehsaniknodt&gt;Ehsani F. &amp; Knodt E. (1998) "Speech technology in computer-aided language learning: strengths and limitations of a new CALL paradigm", ''Language Learning and Technology'' 2, 1: 45–60 [Online]: http://llt.msu.edu/vol2num1/article3/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs embodying ASR normally provide a native speaker model that the learner is requested to imitate, but the matching process is not 100% reliable and may result in a learner's perfectly intelligible attempt to pronounce a word or phrase being rejected (Davies 2010: Section 3.4.6 and Section 3.4.7).&lt;ref name=daviesmodmm/&gt;

Parsing is used in a number of ways in CALL. Gupta &amp; Schulze (2010: Section 5) describe how parsing may be used to analyse sentences, presenting the learner with a tree diagram that labels the constituent parts of speech of a sentence and shows the learner how the sentence is structured.&lt;ref name=guptaschulze/&gt;

Parsing is also used in CALL programs to analyse the learner's input and diagnose errors. Davies (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Davies G. (2002) Article on CALL in the ''Good Practice Guide'' at the website of the Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies (LLAS), University of Southampton [Online]: http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/61&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

"Discrete error analysis and feedback were a common feature of traditional CALL, and the more sophisticated programs would attempt to analyse the learner's response, pinpoint errors, and branch to help and remedial activities. ... Error analysis in CALL is, however, a matter of controversy. Practitioners who come into CALL via the disciplines of [[computational linguistics]], e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Language Technologies (HLT), tend to be more optimistic about the potential of error analysis by computer than those who come into CALL via language teaching. [...] An alternative approach is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to parse the learner's response – so-called ''intelligent CALL'' (ICALL) – but there is a gulf between those who favour the use of AI to develop CALL programs (Matthews 1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matthews | first1 = C | year = 1994 | title = Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning as cognitive science: the choice of syntactic frameworks for language tutoring | url = | journal = Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 533–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at the other extreme, those who perceive this approach as a threat to humanity (Last 1989:153)".&lt;ref&gt;Last R.W. (1989) ''Artificial intelligence techniques in language learning'', Chichester: Ellis Horwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underwood (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Underwood | first1 = J | year = 1989 | title = On the edge: Intelligent CALL in the 1990s | url = | journal = Computers and the Humanities | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 71–84 | doi=10.1007/bf00058770}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heift &amp; Schulze (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heift T. &amp; Schulze M. (eds.) (2007) ''Errors and intelligence in CALL: parsers and pedagogues'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; present a more positive picture of AI.

Research into speech synthesis, speech recognition and parsing and how these areas of NLP can be used in CALL are the main focus of the NLP Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group: http://siglp.eurocall-languages.org/&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[European Association for Computer-Assisted Language Learning|EUROCALL]] professional association and the ICALL Special Interest Group&lt;ref&gt;CALICO ICALL Special Interest Group: http://purl.org/calico/icall&lt;/ref&gt; within the [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]] professional association. The EUROCALL NLP SIG also maintains a Ning.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL NLP Special Interest Group Ning: http://nlpsig.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The question of the impact of CALL in language learning and teaching has been raised at regular intervals ever since computers first appeared in educational institutions (Davies &amp; Hewer 2011: Section 3).&lt;ref name=ict4ltmod11&gt;Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2011) Introduction to new technologies and how they can contribute to language learning and teaching. Module 1.1 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Recent large-scale impact studies include the study edited by Fitzpatrick &amp; Davies (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) (2003) ''The impact of Information and Communications Technologies on the teaching of foreign languages and on the role of teachers of foreign languages'', EC Directorate General of Education and Culture.&lt;/ref&gt; and the EACEA (2009) study,&lt;ref&gt;Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission (2009) ''Study on the impact of ICT and new media on language learning'' [Online]: http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/studies/study_impact_ict_new_media_language_learning_en.php&lt;/ref&gt; both of which were produced for the European Commission.

A distinction needs to be made between the impact and the effectiveness of CALL. Impact may be measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the uptake and use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] in teaching foreign languages, issues of availability of hardware and software, budgetary considerations, Internet access, teachers’ and learners' attitudes to the use of CALL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=mahmoudi|first=elham|title=Attitude and student's performance in Computer Assisted English Language Learning (CALL) for Learning Vocabulary|journal=procedia social and behavioral science|date=June 30, 2012|volume=66|pages=489–498|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812052780|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.11.293}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes in the ways in which languages are learnt and taught, and paradigm shifts in teachers’ and learners’ roles. Effectiveness, on the other hand, usually focuses on assessing to what extent ICT is a more effective way of teaching foreign languages compared to using traditional methods – and this is more problematic as so many variables come into play. Worldwide, the picture of the impact of CALL is extremely varied. Most developed nations work comfortably with the new technologies, but developing nations are often beset with problems of costs and broadband connectivity. Evidence on the effectiveness of CALL – as with the impact of CALL – is extremely varied and many research questions still need to be addressed and answered. Hubbard (2002) presents the results of a CALL research survey that was sent to 120 CALL professionals from around the world asking them to articulate a CALL research question they would like to see answered. Some of the questions have been answered but many more remain open.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard P. (2002) ''Survey of unanswered questions in Computer Assisted Language Learning: Effectiveness issues'' [Online]: http://www.stanford.edu/~efs/callsurvey/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Leakey (2011) offers an overview of current and past research in CALL and proposes a comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of CALL platforms, programs and pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;Leakey J. (2011) ''Evaluating Computer Assisted Language Learning: an integrated approach to effectiveness research in CALL'', Bern: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial issue is the extent to which the computer is perceived as taking over the teacher's role. Warschauer (1996: p.&amp;nbsp;6) perceived the computer as playing an "intelligent" role, and claimed that a computer program "should ideally be able to understand a user's spoken input and evaluate it not just for correctness but also for appropriateness. It should be able to diagnose a student's problems with pronunciation, syntax, or usage and then intelligently decide among a range of options (e.g. repeating, paraphrasing, slowing down, correcting, or directing the student to background explanations)."&lt;ref name=warschauer96/&gt; Jones C. (1986), on the other hand, rejected the idea of the computer being "some kind of inferior teacher-substitute" and proposed a methodology that focused more on what teachers could do with computer programs rather than what computer programs could do on their own: "in other words, treating the computer as they would any other classroom aid".&lt;ref name=jones86&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = C | year = 1986 | title = It's not so much the program: more what you do with it: the importance of methodology in CALL | url = | journal = System | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 171–178 | doi=10.1016/0346-251x(86)90006-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warschauer's high expectations in 1996 have still not been fulfilled, and currently there is an increasing tendency for teachers to go down the route proposed by Jones, making use of a variety of new tools such as [[#Corpora and concordancers|corpora and concordancers]], interactive whiteboards&lt;ref name= schmidcutrim2009/&gt; and applications for online communication.&lt;ref name= lamyhampel/&gt;

Since the advent of the Web there has been an explosion in online learning, but to what extent it is effective is open to criticism. Felix (2003) takes a critical look at popular myths attached to online learning from three perspectives, namely administrators, teachers and students. She concludes: "That costs can be saved in this ambitious enterprise is clearly a myth, as are expectations of saving time or replacing staff with machines."&lt;ref&gt;Felix U. (2003) "Teaching languages online: deconstructing the myths", ''Australian Journal of Educational Technology'' 19, 1: 118-138 [Online]: http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet19/felix.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the effectiveness of CALL in promoting the four skills, Felix (2008) claims that there is "enough data in CALL to suggest positive effects on spelling, reading and writing", but more research is needed in order to determine its effectiveness in other areas, especially speaking online. She claims that students' perceptions of CALL are positive, but she qualifies this claim by stating that the technologies need to be stable and well supported, drawing attention to concerns that technical problems may interfere with the learning process. She also points out that older students may not feel comfortable with computers and younger students may not possess the necessary metaskills for coping effectively in the challenging new environments. Training in computer literacy for both students and teachers is essential, and time constraints may pose additional problems. In order to achieve meaningful results she recommends "time-series analysis in which the same group of students is involved in experimental and control treatment for a certain amount of time and then switched – more than once if possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Felix | first1 = U | year = 2008 | title = The unreasonable effectiveness of CALL: what have we learned in two decades of research? | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 141–161 | doi=10.1017/s0958344008000323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of technology training in CALL for language teaching professionals certainly vary. Within second language teacher education programs, namely pre-service course work, we can find "online courses along with face-to-face courses", computer technology incorporated into a more general second language education course, "technology workshops","a series of courses offered throughout the teacher education programs, and even courses specifically designed for a CALL certificate and a CALL graduate degree"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = K. H. | year = 2010 | title = CALL teacher education as an impetus for 12 teachers in integrating technology | url = | journal = ReCALL | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 53–69 | doi = 10.1017/s095834400999019X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified four levels of courses with only components, namely "web-supplemented, web-dependent, mixed mod and fully online".&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a rapidly growing interest in resources about the use of technology to deliver CALL. Journals that have issues that "deal with how teacher education programs help prepare language teachers to use technology in their own classrooms" include ''Language Learning and Technology'' (2002), ''Innovations in Language Learning and Teaching'' (2009) and the TESOL international professional association's publication of technology standards for TESOL includes a chapter on preparation of teacher candidates in technology use, as well as the upgrading of teacher educators to be able to provide such instruction. Both CALICO and EUROCALL have special interest groups for teacher education in CALL.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. E. (2013) A Case for Online English Language Teacher Education. The International Research Foundation for English Language Education. http://www.tirfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TIRF_OLTE_One-PageSpread_2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered at the organisational level, CSR is an organisational policy. As such, it must align with and be integrated into a [[business model]] to be successful.  With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance with regulatory  requirements, and  engages in "actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law".&lt;ref name=CPRtheory2001&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corporate social responsibility: A theory of the firm perspective |first1=Abagail |last1=McWilliams |first2=Donald |last2=Siegel |year=2001 |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=117–127 |doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSRinternational2005&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choices of 'complying' with the law, failing to comply, and 'going beyond' are three distinct strategic organisational choices. While in many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers may choose to comply with the law, or go beyond the law, other organisations may choose to flout the law. These organisations are taking on clear legal risks.  The nature of the legal risk, however, changes when attention is paid to [[soft law]].&lt;ref&gt;Klarsfeld, A., Delpuech, C. (2008).

Overall, businesses may engage in CSR for strategic or ethical purposes. From a strategic perspective, the aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions. CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thomas |last=Farrington |first2=Ross |last2=Curran |first3=Keith |last3=Gori |first4=Kevin D. |last4=O'Gorman |first5=C.

Proponents argue that [[corporation]]s increase long-term profits by operating with a CSR perspective, while critics argue that CSR distracts from businesses' economic role. A 2000 study compared existing [[econometric]] studies of the relationship between social and financial performance, concluding that the contradictory results of previous studies reporting positive, negative, and neutral financial impact, were due to flawed [[empirical analysis]] and claimed when the study is properly specified, CSR has a neutral impact on financial outcomes.&lt;ref name=CPRneutral2000&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that CSR is merely [[Display window|window-dressing]], or an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful [[multinational corporations]]. In line with this critical perspective, political and sociological [[New institutionalism|institutionalists]] became interested in CSR in the context of theories of [[globalization]], [[neoliberalism]] and [[late capitalism]]. Some institutionalists viewed CSR as a form of capitalist legitimacy and in particular point out that what began as a social movement against uninhibited [[corporate power]] was transformed by corporations into a 'business model' and a 'risk management' device, often with questionable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-5893.2011.00439.x| title = Socially Responsible Private Regulation: World-Culture or World-Capitalism?| journal = Law &amp; Society Review| volume = 45| issue = 2| pages = 313–336| year = 2011| last1 = Shamir | first1 = R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is titled to aid an organization's mission as well as serve as a guide to what the company represents for its consumers. [[Business ethics]] is the part of [[applied ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that can arise in a business environment. [[ISO 26000]] is the recognized international standard for CSR. Public sector organizations (the United Nations for example) adhere to the [[triple bottom line]] (TBL). It is widely accepted that CSR adheres to similar principles, but with no formal act of legislation.

== Definition ==

Since the 1960s,{{sfn |De George |2011}} corporate social responsibility has attracted attention from a range of businesses and stakeholders. A wide variety of definitions have been developed but with little consensus. Part of the problem with definitions has arisen because of the different interests represented. A business person may define CSR as a business strategy, an NGO activist may see it as 'greenwash' while a government official may see it as voluntary regulation."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2015-10-01|title=Defining CSR: Problems and Solutions|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=131|issue=3|pages=625–648|doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2281-x|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, disagreement about the definition will arise from the disciplinary approach."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For example, while an economist might consider the director's discretion necessary for CSR to be implemented a risk of agency costs, a law academic may consider that discretion to be an appropriate expression of what the law demands from directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommer|first=A.A. Jr|date=1991|title=Whom should the corporation serve? the Berle Dodd debate revisited sixty years later|url=|journal=Delaware Journal of Corporate Law|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheehy|first=Benedict|date=2014|title=Anglo-American Directors' Legal Duties and CSR: Prohibited, Permitted or Prescribed?|url=|journal=Dalhousie Law Journal|volume=31|pages=345|via=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/dalholwj37&amp;div=15&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate social responsibility has recently been defined by Sheehy as "international private business self-regulation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sheehy examined a range of different disciplinary approaches to defining CSR. The definitions reviewed included the economic definition of "sacrificing profits," a management definition of "beyond compliance", institutionalist views of CSR as a "socio-political movement" and law's own focus on directors' duties. Further, Sheehy considered Carroll's widely used description of CSR as a pyramid of responsibilities, namely, economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B.|date=July 1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: Toward the moral management of organizational stakeholders|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34|issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g|issn=0007-6813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, while Carroll was not defining CSR but simply arguing for classification of activities, Sheehy developed a definition differently following the philosophy of science—the branch of philosophy used for defining phenomena.

Carroll 1991 extended corporate social responsibility from the traditional economic and legal responsibility to ethical and philanthropic responsibility in response to the rising concerns on ethical issues in businesses, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Archie B. |date=1991|title=The pyramid of corporate social responsibility: toward moral management of organizational stakeholders|url=|journal=Business Horizons|volume=34 |issue=4|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(91)90005-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is reflected in the ''Business Dictionary'' which defines CSR as "A company's sense of responsibility towards the community and environment (both ecological and social) in which it operates. Companies express this citizenship (1) through their waste and pollution reduction processes, (2) by contributing educational and social programs and (3) by earning adequate returns on the employed resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/corporate-social-responsibility.html |title=Definition of CSR |accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most consumers agree that while achieving business targets, companies should engage in CSR efforts at the same time.{{sfn |Epstein-Reeves |2010}} Most consumers believe companies doing charity work will receive a positive response.{{sfn |Somerville |2013}} Somerville also found that consumers are loyal and willing to spend more on retailers that support charity. Consumers also believe that retailers selling local products will gain loyalty.{{sfn |Kardashian |2013}} Smith (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Nicola |title=Corporate social responsibility: Power to the people |url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/trends/corporate-social-responsibility-power-to-the-people/4006810.article |date=2013 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; shares the belief that marketing local products will gain consumer trust. However, environmental efforts are receiving negative views given the belief that this would affect customer service.{{sfn |Kardashian |2013}} Oppewal et al. (2006) found that not all CSR activities are attractive to consumers.{{sfn |Oppewal |Alexander |Sulliwan |2006}} They recommended that retailers focus on one activity.{{sfn |Smith |Lopez |Read |2010}} Becker-Olsen (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Becker-Olsen |first=K.

A more common approach to CSR is corporate [[philanthropy]]. This includes monetary donations and aid given to nonprofit organizations and communities. Donations are made in areas such as the arts, education, housing, health, social welfare and the environment, among others, but excluding political contributions and commercial event sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilcsik |first=András |last2=Marquis |first2=Christopher |title=Punctuated Generosity: How Mega-events and Natural Disasters Affect Corporate Philanthropy in U.S. Communities |journal=Administrative Science Quarterly |date=1 February 2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=111–148 |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028982 |publisher=Social Science Research Network |accessdate=19 January 2018 |doi=10.1177/0001839213475800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to CSR is to incorporate the CSR strategy directly into operations, such as procurement of [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] tea and coffee.

[[Creating shared value]] or CSV is based on the idea that corporate success and social welfare are interdependent. A business needs a healthy, educated workforce, sustainable resources and adept government to compete effectively. For society to thrive, profitable and competitive businesses must be developed and supported to create income, wealth, tax revenues and philanthropy. The Harvard Business Review article ''Strategy &amp; Society: The Link between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility'' provided examples of companies that have developed deep linkages between their business strategies and CSR.{{sfn |Porter |Kramer |2006}} CSV acknowledges trade-offs between short-term profitability and social or environmental goals, but emphasizes the opportunities for competitive advantage from building a social value proposition into corporate strategy. CSV gives the impression that only two stakeholders are important - shareholders and consumers.

Many companies employ [[benchmarking]] to assess their CSR policy, implementation and effectiveness. Benchmarking involves reviewing competitor initiatives, as well as measuring and evaluating the impact that those policies have on society and the environment, and how others perceive competitor CSR strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoessle|first= Ulrike|title= Ten Steps Toward a Sustainable Business (WWS Series 1 Seattle 2013)| isbn =978-0-9898270-0-3|url= http://www.wwsworldwide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-benefit analysis ===

In competitive markets [[cost-benefit analysis]] of CSR initiatives can be examined using a [[resource-based view]] (RBV). According to Barney (1990), "formulation of the RBV, sustainable competitive advantage requires that resources be valuable (V), rare (R), inimitable (I) and non-substitutable (S)."&lt;ref name=BarneyRBV&gt;
{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/014920639101700108| title = Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage| journal = Journal of Management| volume = 17| pages = 99–120| year = 1991| last1 = Barney | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBV&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/smj.4250050207| title = A resource-based view of the firm| journal = Strategic Management Journal| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 171–180| year = 1984| last1 = Wernerfelt | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A firm introducing a CSR-based strategy might only sustain high returns on their investment if their CSR-based strategy could not be copied (I). However, should competitors imitate such a strategy, that might increase overall social benefits. Firms that choose CSR for strategic financial gain are also acting responsibly.

RBV presumes that firms are bundles of heterogeneous resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy. They concluded that managers can determine the appropriate level of investment in CSR by conducting cost benefit analysis in the same way that they analyze other investments. Reinhardt (1998) found that a firm engaging in a CSR-based strategy could only sustain an abnormal return if it could prevent competitors from imitating its strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Donald S. |year=2009 |title=Green Management Matters Only If It Yields More Green: An Economic/Strategic Perspective |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/jmswpaper/8.htm |publisher= Academy of Management Perspectives |volume= 23 |issue=3 |pages=5–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moreover, when it comes to cost benefit analysis, you should look at Waddock and Graves (1997), who showed that corporate social performance was positively linked to financial performance, meaning that the benefit of being socially responsible outweigh the costs.  McWilliams and Siegel (2000) noted that Waddock and Graves hadn’t taken innovation into account, that companies that did CSR were also very innovative, and that the innovation drove financial performance, not CSR. Hull and Rothenberg (2007) then found that when companies are not innovative, a history of CSR does in fact help financial performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hull|first=Clyde|last2=ROTHENBERG|first2=SANDRA|date=February 2008|title=Firm Performance: The Interactions of Corporate Social Performance with Innovation and Industry Differentiation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bd04/2027709bca590b8c2b68bf74be39148f64d9.pdf|journal=Strategic Management Journal|volume=Strat. Mgmt. J. , 29 : 781 – 789|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scope ==

Initially, CSR emphasized the official behaviour of individual firms. Later, it expanded to include supplier behaviour and the uses to which products were put and how they were disposed of after they lost value.

=== Supply chain ===
In the 21st century, corporate social responsibility in the supply chain has attracted attention from businesses and stakeholders. Corporations' supply chain is the process by which several organizations including suppliers, customers and logistics providers work together to provide a value package of products and services to the end user, who is the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Designing and managing the supply chain|last=Simchi-Levi;kaminsky, D.P|first=Levi;D., P|publisher=McGraw Hill/Irwin|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate social irresponsibility in the supply chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies, leading to a lot of cost to solve the problems. For instance, incidents like the [[2013 Savar building collapse]], which killed over 1000 people, pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and environment. On the other side, the horse meat scandal of 2013 in the United Kingdom affected many food retailers, including Tesco, the largest retailer in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9891296/Horsemeat-scandal-supermarkets-have-failed-to-check-meat-suppliers-MPs-told.html |title=Horsemeat scandal: supermarkets have failed to check meat suppliers, MPs told|first=Rowena|last=Mason|date=24 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the dismissal of the supplier. Corporate social irresponsibility from both the suppliers and the retailers has greatly affected the stakeholders who lost trust for the affected business entities, and despite the fact that sometimes it's not directly undertaken by the companies, they become accountable to the stakeholders. These surrounding issues have prompted [[supply chain management]] to consider the corporate social responsibility context. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggested that companies need to include social responsibility in their reviews of component quality. They highlighted the use of technology in improving visibility across the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andreas |last=Wieland |first2=Robert B. |last2=Handfield |year=2013 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=90423931&amp;site=ehost-live |title=The Socially Responsible Supply Chain: An Imperative for Global Corporations |journal=Supply Chain Management Review |volume= 17 |issue= 5 |pages=22–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social initiatives===
Corporate social responsibility includes six types of corporate social initiatives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Nancy|last2=Kotler|first2=Philip|title=Corporate social responsibility doing the most good for your company and your cause|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118045770}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corporate philanthropy: company donations to charity, including cash, goods, and services, sometimes via a corporate foundation
* Community volunteering: company-organized volunteer activities, sometimes while an employee receives pay for pro-bono work on behalf of a non-profit organization
* Socially-responsible business practices: ethically produced products which appeal to a customer segment
* Cause promotions: company-funded advocacy campaigns
* Cause-related marketing: donations to charity based on product sales
* Corporate social marketing: company-funded behavior-change campaigns

All six of the corporate initiatives are forms of corporate citizenship. However, only some of these CSR activities rise to the level of [[cause marketing]], defined as "a type of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in which a company's promotional campaign has the dual purpose of increasing profitability while bettering society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Organ|first1=Michael|title=Cause Marketing — Definition|url=https://causemarketing.com/research/cause-marketing-definition/|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies generally do not have a [[profit motive]] when participating in corporate philanthropy and community volunteering. On the other hand, the remaining corporate social initiatives can be examples of cause marketing, in which there is both a societal interest and profit motive.

== Implementation ==

CSR may be based within the [[human resources]], [[business development]] or [[public relations]] departments of an organisation,&lt;ref name=careers&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.careers.ed.ac.uk/STUDENTS/Careers/Corporate%20Social%20Responsibility%20and%20Ethical%20Careers.html

 |publisher=University of Edinburgh Careers Service
 |accessdate= 2008-03-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may be a separate unit reporting to the [[CEO]] or the [[board of directors]].

=== Engagement plan ===

An engagement plan can assist in reaching a desired audience. A corporate social responsibility individual or team plans the [[goal]]s and [[Goal|objectives]] of the organization. As with any corporate activity, a defined budget demonstrates commitment and scales the program's relative importance.

=== Accounting, auditing and reporting ===
{{Main |Social accounting}}

[[Social accounting]] is the communication of social and environmental effects of a company's economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-02630-0_2| chapter = Corporate Responsibility, Accounting and Accountants| title = Professionals' Perspectives of Corporate Social Responsibility| pages = 11–32| year = 2009| last1 = Tilt | first1 = C. A. | isbn = 978-3-642-02629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social accounting emphasizes the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. Crowther defines social accounting as "an approach to reporting a firm's activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behavior, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques."&lt;ref name="Crowther2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Crowther |title=Social and Environmental Accounting |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QLYCAAAACAAJ |p=20}} |year=2000 |publisher=Financial Times/Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-273-65092-8 |p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reporting guidelines and standards serve as frameworks for social accounting, auditing and reporting:

In nations such as France, legal requirements for social accounting, auditing and reporting exist, though international or national agreement on meaningful measurements of social and environmental performance has not been achieved. Many companies produce externally audited annual reports that cover [[Sustainable Development]] and CSR issues ("Triple Bottom Line Reports"), but the reports vary widely in format, style, and [[evaluation]] [[methodology]] (even within the same industry). Critics dismiss these reports as lip service, citing examples such as [[Enron]]'s yearly "Corporate Responsibility Annual Report" and tobacco companies' social reports.

In South Africa, as of June 2010, all companies listed on the [[Johannesburg Stock Exchange]] (JSE) were required to produce an [[Integrated reporting|integrated report]] in place of an annual financial report and sustainability report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pr |url= https://www.saica.co.za/tabid/695/itemid/2344/language/en-ZA/An-integrated-report-is-a-new-requirement-for-list.aspx |title=News Articles and Press &amp; media releases |publisher=South African Institute of Chartered Accountants |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An integrated report reviews environmental, social and economic performance alongside financial performance. This requirement was implemented in the absence of formal or legal standards. An Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC) was established to issue guidelines for good practice.

One of the reputable institutions that capital markets turn to for credible sustainability reports is the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]], or CDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.esg.adec-innovations.com/blog/bid/311299/the-benefit-of-corporate-social-responsibility-csr-reporting The Benefit of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reporting]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verification ===
Corporate social responsibility and its resulting reports and efforts should be verified by the consumer of the goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verifying Delivery of Sustainable Products and Services - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |url=https://sftool.gov/plan/541/verifying-delivery-sustainable-products-services |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accounting, auditing and reporting resources provide a foundation for consumers to verify that their products are [[Social sustainability|socially sustainable]]. Due to an increased awareness of the need for CSR, many industries have their own verification resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products |title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products  - GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool |publisher=U.S. General Services Administration |access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The include organizations like the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (paper and forest products), [http://www.cocoainitiative.org/ International Cocoa Initiative], and [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberly Process]] (diamonds). The United Nations also provides frameworks not only for verification, but for reporting of human rights violations in corporate supply chains.

=== Ethics training ===

The rise of ethics training inside corporations, some of it required by government regulation, has helped CSR to spread. The aim of such training is to help employees make ethical decisions when the answers are unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tullberg |first1=J. |last2=Tullberg |first2=S. |year=1996 |title=On Human Altruism: The Discrepancy between Normative and Factual Conclusions |journal=Oikos |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=327–329 |publisher= |doi= 10.2307/3546259 |jstor=3546259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most direct benefit is reducing the likelihood of "dirty hands",{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} fines and damaged reputations for breaching laws or moral norms. Organizations see increased employee loyalty and pride in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/pages/0907agenda_training.aspx|title=Supporting Ethical Employees|last=Thilmany|first=Jean|date=2007|website=HR Magazine|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Common actions ===

Common CSR actions include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Tegan |title=Talent Management |url=http://talentmgt.com/articles/view/the_business_value_of_virtue_corporate_social_responsibility_and_employee_engagement/1 |work=The Business Value of Virtue: Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental sustainability: recycling, waste management, water management, renewable energy, reusable materials, 'greener' supply chains, reducing paper use and adopting [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) building standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Richard |title=The Green Market Oracle |url=http://thegreenmarketoracle.com/2012/01/top-sustainability-trends-for.html |work=Top Business Sustainability Trends for 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2012-01-26 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Forest |url=http://www.greatforest.com/services.html |work=Services |accessdate=2013-11-19 |year=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001152417/http://greatforest.com/services.html |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Environmental Leader |url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |work=Top Sustainability Consultants Revealed |accessdate=2013-11-19 |date=2013-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006160850/http://www.environmentalleader.com/2013/01/14/microsoft-kpmg-ey-lead-sustainability-survey/ |archivedate=2013-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community involvement: This can include raising money for local charities, providing volunteers, sponsoring local events, employing local workers, supporting local economic growth, engaging in fair trade practices, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Camden Community Empowerment Network |url=http://www.camdencen.org.uk/jargonbuster.htm |work=Camden Community Empowerment Network Jargon Buster |accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Workforce Management |url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/starbucks-is-pleasing-employees-and-pouring-profits |work=Starbucks is Pleasing Employees and Pouring Profits |accessdate=2013-11-19 |pages=58–59 |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethical marketing]]: Companies that ethically market to consumers are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them as people who are ends in themselves. They do not try to manipulate or falsely advertise to potential consumers. This is important for companies that want to be viewed as ethical.

=== Social license to operate ===

Social License to Operate can be determined as a contractual grounds for the legitimacy of activities and projects company is involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Demuijnck|first=Geert|last2=Fasterling|first2=Björn|date=2016-01-15|title=The Social License to Operate|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=136|issue=4|pages=675–685|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2976-7|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the level of support and approval of a company’s activities by its stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gehman|first=Joel|last2=Lefsrud|first2=Lianne M.|last3=Fast|first3=Stewart|date=2017-06-01|title=Social license to operate: Legitimacy by another name?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|journal=Canadian Public Administration|language=en|volume=60|issue=2|doi=10.1111/capa.12218/epdf|issn=1754-7121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displaying commitment to CSR is one way to achieve social license, by enhancing a company's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbr.org/downloads/pdfs/eta/PES_2013_summitpaper_Yates_Horvath.pdf|title=Social License to Operate: How to Get It, and How to Keep It|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated in ''Enduring value:'' the Australian minerals industry framework for sustainable development the concept of the 'social license to operate', then defined simply as obtaining and maintaining broad community support and acceptance. Unless a company earns and maintains that license social license holders may intend to block project developments; employees may leave the company for a company that is a better corporate citizen: and companies may be under ongoing legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.minerals.org.au/enduring-value-framework|title=Enduring Value Framework|date=2017-04-10|work=Minerals Council of Australia|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In research of [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] Dr [[Elliott Jaques]] defines Social License to Operate for the company as the social contract the company has with the social license holders (employees, trade unions, communities, government)  for them to manifest positive intention to support the business short- and long-term objectives by ''“providing managerial leadership that nurtures the social good and also gives the foundation for sustainable growth in organizational results.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/478621081|title=Social power and the CEO : leadership and trust in a sustainable free enterprise system|last=Elliott|first=Jaques,|date=2002|publisher=Quorum Books|isbn=1567205518|oclc=478621081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective for the companies is to obtain and maintain the Social License to Operate. Based on the [[Requisite organization|Requisite Organization]] research of Dr. Elliott Jaques to achieve this goal a company needs to:
* Identify the business strategy and business objectives
* Identify the social license holders (employees of a company, labour unions, local and national governments, communities, activist groups, etc.) for every business objectives
* Identify the support that the company desires to achieve from the social license holders by specifying for every business objective social license elements (target of support, context of support, time of support, action of support)
* Quantitatively measure the intention (positive or negative) of the social license holders to support the business objectives
* Identify the factors that negatively impact the intention of the social license holders to support the business objectives (strength of their belief in support, their evaluation of support outcomes, pressure to provide support, enablers / disablers of support, etc.)
* Develop the Social License Development Strategy to remove the negative factors and ensure positive intention of all the social license holders to support all the business objectives of the company.
* Perform ongoing monitoring and quantitative measurement of changes in the Social License to Operate of the company   

== Potential business benefits ==

A large body of literature exhorts business to adopt non-financial measures of success (e.g., [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]]'s Fourteen Points, [[balanced scorecard]]s). While CSR benefits are hard to quantify, Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |title=Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis |first=Marc |last=Orlitzky |author2=Frank L. Schmidt |author3=Sara L. Rynes |journal=Organization Studies |year=2003 |format=PDF |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=403–441 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=London |accessdate=2008-03-07 |doi=10.1177/0170840603024003910 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929182545/http://www.finanzasostenibile.it/finanza/moskowitz2004.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance.

The [[business case]] for CSR{{sfn |Bhattacharya |Sen |Korschun |2011}} within a company employs one or more of these arguments:

=== Triple bottom line ===

"People, planet and profit", also known as the triple bottom line, form one way to evaluate CSR.
"People" refers to fair labour practices, the community and region where the business operates.
"Planet" refers to sustainable environmental practices. [[Profit (economics)|Profit]] is the economic value created by the organization after deducting the cost of all inputs, including the cost of the capital (unlike accounting definitions of profit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gopal K. |last=Kanj |first2=Parvesh K. |last2=Chopra |year=2010 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility in a Global Economy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news

 | title=Idea: Triple bottom line
 | date= 2009-11-17
 | accessdate= 2016-01-07
 | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was claimed to help some companies be more conscious of their social and moral responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/|title=Moral Responsibility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that it is selective and substitutes a company's perspective for that of the community. Another criticism is about the absence of a standard auditing procedure.{{sfn |De George |2011 |p=205}}

The term was coined by John Elkington in 1994.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

=== Human resources ===

A CSR program can be an aid to [[recruitment]] and [[Employee retention|retention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=C.B. |first2=Sankar |last2=Sen |first3=Daniel |last3=Korschun |year=2008 |title=Using Corporate Social Responsibility to Win the War for Talent |publisher=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=37–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2008-03-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly within the competitive [[graduate school|graduate]] student market. Potential recruits often consider a firm's CSR policy. CSR can also help improve the perception of a company among its staff, particularly when staff can become involved through [[payroll giving]], [[fundraising]] activities or community volunteering. CSR has been credited with encouraging customer orientation among customer-facing employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1509/jm.11.0245| title = Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees| journal = Journal of Marketing| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 20–37| year = 2014| last1 = Korschun | first1 = D. | last2 = Bhattacharya | first2 = C. B. | last3 = Swain | first3 = S. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSR is known for impacting [[employee turnover]]. Several executives suggest that employees are their most valuable asset and that the ability to retain them leads to organization success. Socially responsible activities promote fairness, which in turn generate lower employee turnover. On the other hand, if an irresponsible behavior is demonstrated by a firm, employees may view this behavior as negative. Proponents argue that treating employees well with competitive pay and good benefits is seen as a socially responsible behavior and therefore reduces employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Galbreath (2010-06-29). "How does corporate social responsibility benefit firms? Evidence from Australia". ''European Business Review''. 22 (4): 411-431. doi:10.1108/09555341011056186. ISSN 0955-534X.&lt;/ref&gt; Executives have a strong desire for building a positive work context that benefits CSR and the company as a whole. This interest is driven particularly by the realization that a positive work environment can result in desirable outcomes such as more favorable job attitudes and increased work performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Valentine | first1 = S. | last2 = Godkin | first2 = L. | last3 = Fleischman | first3 = G.

The [[Institute for Business Value|IBM Institute for Business Value]] conducted a survey of 250 business leaders worldwide in 2008. The survey found out that businesses have assimilated a much more strategic view, and that 68% companies reported are utilizing CSR as an opportunity and part of a sustainable growth strategy. The authors noted that while developing and implementing a CSR strategy represents a unique opportunity to benefit the company. However, only 31% of businesses surveyed engaged their employees on the company's CSR objectives and initiatives. The survey's authors also stated that employee engagement on CSR initiatives can be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. As a result, employees tend to discard employers with a bad reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mandrake.ca/bill/images/corporate_responsibility_white_paper.pdf |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and Employee Engagement: Making the Connection |first=Rob |last=Gross |work=www.mandrake.ca |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk management ===

Managing [[risk]] is an important executive responsibility. Reputations that take decades to build up can be ruined in hours through corruption scandals or environmental accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Ghardwaj |first2=G. |year=2011 |title= Corporate Social Responsibility: Does Social Responsibility Help Protect a Company's Reputation? |journal=MIT Sloan Management Review |volume=52 (March) |pages=18–18 |url=http://sloanreview.mit.edu/the-magazine/2011-spring/52313/does-social-responsibility-help-protect-a-companys-reputation/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These draw unwanted attention from regulators, courts, governments and media. CSR can limit these risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies use their commitment to CSR as their primary positioning tool, e.g., [[The Co-operative Group]], [[The Body Shop]] and [[American Apparel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx Dr. Tantillo's 30-Second 'How To': How To Brand CSR The American Apparel Way"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429132810/http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/28/dr-tantillos-30second-how-to.aspx |date=April 29, 2013 }} Marketing Doctor Blog.

Some companies use CSR methodologies as a strategic tactic to gain public support for their presence in global markets, helping them sustain a competitive advantage by using their social contributions as another form of advertising.{{sfn|Fry|Keim|Meiners|1982|p=105}}

Companies that operate strong CSR activities tend to drive customer's attention to buy products or services regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers are aware of the company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential differentiator because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. Lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kemper | first1 = J. | last2 = Shilke | first2 = O. | last3 = Reimann | first3 = M. | last4 = Wang | first4 = X. | last5 = Brettel | first5 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Competition-motivated corporate social responsibility | url = | journal = Journal of Business Research | volume = 66 | issue = 10| page = 1954 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whole Foods]]' marketing and promotion of organic foods have had a positive effect on the supermarket industry. Proponents assert that Whole Foods has been able to work with its suppliers to improve animal treatment and quality of meat offered in their stores. They also promote local agricultures in over 2,400 independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result, Whole Foods' high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact, they are pleased buying organic products that come from sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, J., &amp; Vivari, B. (2009). Chapter 11: United States of America: Internal Commitments and External Pressures. In Global Practices of Corporate Social Responsibility (pp. 235-250). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, there are three theaters of practice in which CSR can be divided. Theater one focuses on philanthropy, which includes donations of money or equipment to non-profit organizations, engagement with communities' initiatives and employee volunteering. This is characterized as the "soul" of a company, expressing the social and environmental priorities of the founders. The authors assert that companies engage in CSR because they are an integral part of the society. The [[Coca-Cola Company]] contributes with $88.1 million annually to a variety of environmental educational and humanitarian organization. Another example is [[PNC Financial Services]]' "Grow Up Great" childhood education program. This program provides critical school readiness resources to underserved communities where PNC operates.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rangan, Kasturi; Chase, Lisa; Karim, Sohel. [https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-truth-about-csr "The Truth About CSR"]. ''www.hbr.org''. Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, theater two focuses on improving operational effectiveness in the workplace. The researchers assert that programs in this theater strive to deliver social or environmental benefits to support a company's operation across the value chain by improving efficiency. Some of the examples mentioned include sustainability initiatives to reduce resource use, waste, and emission that could potentially reduce costs. It also calls for investing in employee work conditions such as health care and education which may enhance productivity and retention. Unlike philanthropic giving, which is evaluated by its social and environmental return, initiatives in the second theater are predicted to improve the corporate bottom line with social value. [[Bimbo]], the largest bakery in [[Mexico]], is an excellent example of this theater. The company strives to meet social welfare needs. It offers free educational service to help employees complete high school. Bimbo also provides supplementary medical care and financial assistance to close gaps in the government health coverage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moreover, the third theater program aims to transform the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges that will lead to financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in [[Unilever|Unilever's]] Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, oils, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages. Another example is [[IKEA|IKEA's]] People and Planet initiative to be 100% sustainable by 2020. As a consequence, the company wants to introduce a new model to collect and recycle old furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reduced scrutiny ===
Corporations are keen to avoid interference in their business through [[taxation]] or [[regulations]]. A CSR program can persuade governments and the public that a company takes [[health and safety]], diversity and the environment seriously, reducing the likelihood that company practices will be closely monitored.

=== Supplier relations ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Appropriate CSR programs can increase the attractiveness of supplier firms to potential customer corporations. E.g., a fashion merchandiser may find value in an overseas manufacturer that uses CSR to establish a positive image—and to reduce the risks of bad publicity from uncovered misbehavior.

== Criticisms and concerns ==

CSR concerns include its relationship to the purpose of business and the motives for engaging in it.

=== Nature of business ===

[[Milton Friedman]] and others argued that a corporation's purpose is to maximize returns to its shareholders and that obeying the laws of the jurisdictions within which it operates constitutes socially responsible behavior.&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite news

While some CSR supporters claim that companies practicing CSR, especially in developing countries, are less likely to exploit workers and communities, critics claim that CSR itself imposes outside values on local communities with unpredictable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;c.f., Aquino, M.P., Nuestro Clamor por la Vida. Teología Latinoamericana desde la Perspectiva de la Mujer (San José, Costa Rica: Departamento Ecuménico de Investigaciones, 1992), et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Better governmental regulation and enforcement, rather than voluntary measures, are an alternative to CSR that moves decision-making and resource allocation from public to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganguly | first1 = S | year = 1999 | title = The Investor-State Dispute Mechanism (ISDM) and a Sovereign's power to protect public health | url = | journal = Columbia Journal of Transnational Law | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics claim that effective CSR must be voluntary as mandatory social responsibility programs regulated by the government interferes with people's own plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J. Scott|last2=Green|first2=Kesten C.|title=Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like Aistiphi Inc have tried to subscribe to the latter view as it relates to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philanthropy.space|title=Philanthropy Space - AISTIPHI {{!}} Development Philanthropy and Community Service|website=philanthropy.space|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aistiphi pioneered the Philanthropy Space™ model that strips down CSR to basic corporate philanthropy. However, rather than leave the entire field to businesses alone, the Philanthropy Space Model situates corporate philanthropy within a larger Commonwealth of Goodwill™ that includes nearly everyone: NGOs, clubs and societies, alumni, professional bodies, international partners, and even students from across the educational spectrum. The Philanthropy Space™ Model oversimplifies CSR, which of course is more than just being philanthropic. However, it creates a public square of goodwill actors that draws broad public attention. By doing so, it enable the public to make judgments about the philanthropic output and motives of businesses. The problem is that the concept assumes that the public is savvy and discerning and that they are able to provide strong evaluative verdicts on a business's CSR based on local understandings and realities.

=== Motives ===

Some critics believe that CSR programs are undertaken by companies to distract the public from ethical questions posed by their core operations. They argue that the reputational benefits that CSR companies receive (cited above as a benefit to the corporation) demonstrate the hypocrisy of the approach.&lt;ref name="McKibben"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests at the cost of the shareholders so they are a type of an [[Principal–agent problem|agency problem]] in corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Ing-Haw|last2=Hong|first2=Harrison|last3=Shue|first3=Kelly|title=Do Managers Do Good with Other People's Money? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 19432 |doi=10.3386/w19432|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adhikari|first=Binay K.|date=2016-12-01|title=Causal effect of analyst following on corporate social responsibility |journal=Journal of Corporate Finance|volume=41|pages=201–216|doi=10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B2ueBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 |title=The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power|last=Bakan|first=Joel|date=2012-03-01|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781780337418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the most prominent critics of the conflict of interest between private profit and public good, and his argument is summarised by Haynes that "a corporate calculus exists in which costs are pushed onto both workers, consumers and the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249921889|title=Rationality, morality and Joel Bakan's The Corporation|last=Haynes|first=Michael|date=2007|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR spending may be seen in these financial terms, whereby the higher costs of socially undesirable behaviour are offset by a CSR spending of a lower amount. Indeed, it has been argued that there is a "halo effect" in terms of CSR spending. Research has found that firms which had been convicted of bribery in the USA under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) received more lenient fines if they had been seen to be actively engaging in comprehensive CSR practices. It was found that typically either a 20% increase in corporate giving or a commitment to eradicating a significant labour issue, such as child labour, was equated to a 40% lower fine in the case of bribing foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656218-do-gooding-policies-help-firms-when-they-get-prosecuted-halo-effect|title=The halo effect|journal=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-29|date=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguinis and Glavas conducted a comprehensive review of CSR literature, covering 700 academic sources from numerous fields including [[Organizational behavior|organizational behaviour]], [[strategic management|corporate strategy]], [[marketing]] and [[human resource management|HRM]]. It was found that the primary reason for firms to engage in CSR were the expected financial benefits associated with CSR, rather than being motivated a desire to be responsible to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aguinis|first=Herman|last2=Glavas|first2=Ante|date=2012-07-01|title=What We Know and Don't Know About Corporate Social Responsibility: A Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Management|language=en|volume=38|issue=4|pages=932–968|doi=10.1177/0149206311436079|issn=0149-2063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical ideologies ===
CEOs' political ideologies are evident manifestations of their different personal views. Each CEO may exercise different powers according to their organizational outcomes. In fact, their political ideologies are expected to influence their preferences for the CSR outcomes. Proponents argue that politically liberal CEOs will envision the practice of CSR as beneficial and desirable to increase a firm's reputation. They tend to focus more on how the firm can meet the needs of the society. As a consequence, they will advance with the practice of CSR while adding value to the firm. On the other hand, property rights may be more relevant to conservative CEOs. Since conservatives tend to value free markets, individualism and call for a respect of authority, they will not likely envision this practice as often as those identifying as liberals might.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Chin, M.K.; Treviño, Linda; Hambrick, Donald (2013). "Political Ideologies of CEOs: The Influence of Executives' Values on Corporate Social Responsibility" (PDF). ''SAGE Journals''. Johnson Cornell University. 58 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The financials of the company and the practice of CSR also have a positive relationship. Moreover, the performance of a company tends to influence conservatives more likely than liberals. While not seeing it from the financial performance point of view, liberals tend to hold a view that CSR adds to the business triple bottom line. For instance, when the company is performing well, they will most likely promote CSR. If the company is not performing as expected, they will rather tend to emphasize this practice because they will potentially envision it as a way to add value to the business. In contrast, politically conservative CEOs will tend to support the practice of CSR if they hold a view that it will provide a good return to the financials of the company. In other words, this type of executives tend to not see the outcome of CSR as a value to the company if it does not provide anything in exchange.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Misdirection ===
There have been unsubstantiated social efforts, ethical claims, and outright [[greenwashing]] by some companies that has resulted in increasing consumer cynicism and mistrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahdi |first1=Khosro S. |last2=Acikdilli |first2=Gaye |title=Marketing Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Marriage of Convenience or Shotgun Wedding? |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=August 2009 |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=103–113 |doi=10.1007/s10551-009-0113-1 |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10551-009-0113-1?LI=true |issn=0167-4544 |language=en |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes companies use CSR to direct public attention away from other, harmful business practices. For example, [[McDonald's Corporation]] positioned its association with [[Ronald McDonald House]] and other children's charities as CSR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Responsibility - U.S. Perspective |url= http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |publisher=McDonald's USA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230235955/http://mcdonalds.com/usa/good/report.RowPar.0002.ContentPar.0002.ColumnPar.0001.File.tmp/2006%20U.S.%20CR%20Brochure%20(English).pdf |dead-url=yes |archivedate=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while its meals have been accused of promoting poor eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;Judgment p264&lt;/ref&gt;

Acts which may initially appear to be altruistic CSR may have ulterior motives. The funding of scientific research projects has been used as a source of misdirection by firms. [[Stanley B. Prusiner|Prusiner]], who discovered the protein responsible of [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|CJD]] and won of the 1997 Nobel prize in Medicine, thanks the tobacco company [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|RJ Reynolds]] for their crucial support. RJ Reynolds funded the research into CJD. [[Robert N. Proctor|Proctor]] states that "the tobacco industry was the leading funder of research into genetics, viruses, immunology, air pollution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Harford |date=2017-03-09 |url= https://www.ft.com/content/eef2e2f8-0383-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9 |title=The problem with facts |website=Financial Times |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; anything which formed a distraction from the well-established research linking smoking and cancer.

Research has also found that corporate [[social marketing]], a form of CSR promoting societal good, is being used to direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones |first=Sandra C. |last2=Wyatt |first2=Austin |last3=Daube |first3=Mike |date=2016-12-01 |title=Smokescreens and Beer Goggles: How Alcohol Industry CSM Protects the Industry |url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524500415621558 |journal=Social Marketing Quarterly |language=en |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1177/1524500415621558 |issn=1524-5004 |access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a [[Social norms approach|social norm]]. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.

=== Controversial industries ===

Industries such as tobacco, alcohol or munitions firms make products that damage their consumers or the environment. Such firms may engage in the same philanthropic activities as those in other industries. This duality complicates assessments of such firms with respect to CSR.{{sfn |Halpern |Snider |2012 |pages=604–624}}

===The Kizhakkambalam takeover===
[[Textile company]] Kitex has taken over the administration of an entire Indian village called [[Kizhakkambalam]] near Cochin by winning the local body elections. Environmentalists and mainstream politicians of India point out that this can lead to a dangerous precedent because the company got actively involved in CSR only after they were caught red-handed in [[pollution|polluting]] the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ittyipe |first=Minu |title=A Corp’s New Clothes |url= https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-corps-new-clothes/295855 |publisher=Outlook |date=25 November 2015 |location=India |accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stakeholder influence ==

One motivation for corporations to adopt CSR is to satisfy stakeholders.

Branco and Rodrigues (2007) describe the stakeholder perspective of CSR as the set of views of corporate responsibility held by all groups or constituents with a relationship to the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branco |first=M.C. |author2=Rodrigues, L.L. |title=Positioning stakeholder theory within the debate on corporate social responsibility |journal=Electronic Journal of Business Ethics and Organization Studies |year=2007 |volume=12 |pages=5–15 |url=http://ejbo.jyu.fi/pdf/ejbo_vol12_no1_pages_5-15.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their normative model the company accepts these views as long as they do not hinder the organization. The stakeholder perspective fails to acknowledge the complexity of network interactions that can occur in cross-sector partnerships. It relegates communication to a maintenance function, similar to the exchange perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shumate |first=M |author2=O'Conner, A. |title=The symbiotic sustainability model: Conceptualizing NGO-corporate alliance communication |journal=Journal of Communication |year=2010 |volume=60 |pages=577–609 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01498.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical consumerism ===

The rise in popularity of [[ethical consumerism]] over the last two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and ethical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=A.B. |last2=Rubera |first2=G. |last3=Seifert |first3=M. |last4=Bhardwaj |first4=G. |year=2011 |title=Doing Good and Doing Better Despite Negative Information? The Role of Corporate Social Responsibility in Consumer Resistance to Negative Information |journal=Journal of Service Research |volume=14 (February) |pages=60–75 |url=http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/14/1/60.abstract |doi=10.1177/1094670510389164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One issue with the consumer's relationship with CSR is that it is much more complex than it first appears. In their paper on the consumer and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme looked into a phenomenon that they termed the "CSR-Consumer Paradox".&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-104|[104]]]&lt;/sup&gt; This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. A survey by Cohn &amp; Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-105|[105]]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that when it comes down to their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does.

One theory put forward for explaining the "CSR-Consumer Paradox" is that of "bystander apathy" or the [[bystander effect]]. This theory stems from the social psychology works of Darley and Latané&lt;sup&gt;[[Corporate social responsibility#cite note-106|[106]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and states that the likelihood of an individual acting in a given situation is greatly reduced if other bystanders do nothing even if that individual strongly believes in a certain course of action. In terms of explaining the CSR-Consumer Paradox, this theory would suggest an "If they do not care then why should I?" mentality. So even if a consumer is against the use of sweatshops or wants to support green causes, they may continue to make purchases from companies that are socially irresponsible just because other consumers seem apathetic towards the issue.

A second explanation issued by Janssen and Vanhamme is that of [[reciprocal altruism]]. This is a key concept in evolutionary psychology that is argued to fuel all human behaviour: people only do something if they can get something back in return. In the case of CSR and ethical consumerism, however, consumers get very little in return for their investment. Ethically sourced or manufactured products are typically higher in price due to greater costs. However, the reward for consumers is not much different from that of a non-ethical counterpart. Therefore, evolutionary speaking making an ethical purchase is not worth the higher cost to the individual even if they believe in supporting ethically, environmentally and socially beneficial causes.

=== Socially responsible investing ===
{{main|Socially responsible investing}}

Shareholders and investors, through [[socially responsible investing]], are using their capital to encourage behavior they consider responsible. However, definitions of what constitutes ethical behavior vary. For example, some religious investors in the US have withdrawn investment from companies that violate their religious views, while secular investors divest from companies that they see as imposing religious views on workers or customers.&lt;ref name="responsibility945"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Laughlin |first=Bridget |title=Governing Capital?

=== Public policies ===

Some national governments promote socially and environmentally responsible corporate practices. The heightened role of government in CSR has facilitated the development of numerous CSR programs and policies.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10551-007-9514-1| jstor = 25075478| title = Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe| journal = Journal of Business Ethics| volume = 74| issue = 4| pages = 391–407| year = 2007| last1 = Albareda| first1 = Laura| last2 = Lozano| first2 = Josep M.| last3 = Ysa| first3 = Tamyko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various European governments have pushed companies to develop sustainable corporate practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; CSR critics such as [[Robert Reich]] argued that governments should set the agenda for social responsibility with laws and regulation that describe how to conduct business responsibly.

==== Regulation ====

Fifteen [[European Union]] countries are actively engaged in CSR regulation and public policy development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/corporate-social-responsibility-national-public-policies-european-union-compendium-2014|title=Corporate Social Responsibility National Public Policies in the European Union - Compendium 2014 - Digital Single Market - European Commission|website=Digital Single Market|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSR efforts and policies are different among countries, responding to the complexity and diversity of governmental, corporate and societal roles. Some studies have claimed that the role and effectiveness of these actors were case-specific.&lt;ref name="Public Policies on Corporate Social Responsibility: The Role of Governments in Europe"/&gt; This variety among company approaches to CSR can complicate regulatory processes.{{sfn |Sacconi |2004}}

The 'Heilbronn Declaration' is a voluntary agreement of enterprises and institutions in Germany especially of the Heilbronn-Franconia region signed the 15th of September 2012. The approach of the 'Heilbronn Declaration' targets the decisive factors of success or failure, the achievements of the implementation and best practices regarding CSR. A form of responsible entrepreneurship shall be initiated to meet the requirements of stakeholders' trust in economy. It is an approach to make voluntary commitments more binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stehr|first1=Christopher|last2=Jakob|first2=Benjamin E.|title=Corporate Social Responsibility th rough Voluntary Commitment in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises – the Case of the 'Heilbronn Declaration'|journal=European Journal of Sustainable Development|date=September 2014|volume=3|issue=4|pages=135–150|doi=10.14207/ejsd.2014.v3n4p135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to mandated CSR regulation, Researchers Armstrong &amp; Green suggest that all regulation is "harmful", citing regulation as the cause for North Korea's low economic freedom and per capita GDP. They further claim without source that "There is no form of market failure, however egregious, which is not eventually made worse by the political interventions intended to fix it," and conclude "there is no need for further research on regulation in the name of social responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J.

==== Laws ====

In the 1800s, the US government could take away a firm's license if it acted irresponsibly. Corporations were viewed as "creatures of the state" under the law. In 1819, the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Dartmouth College vs. Woodward]] established a corporation as a legal person in specific contexts. This ruling allowed corporations to be protected under the Constitution and prevented states from regulating firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banerjee |journal= Critical Sociology |year=2008 |pages=51–75 |doi=10.1177/0896920507084623 |title=Corporate Social Responsibility: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly |volume=34 |issue=1 |first=S. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently countries included CSR policies in government agendas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 16 December 2008, the Danish parliament adopted a bill making it mandatory for the 1100 largest Danish companies, investors and state-owned companies to include CSR information in their financial reports. The reporting requirements became effective on 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp Danish Centre for CSR's official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703215633/http://www.csrgov.dk/sw51190.asp |date=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The required information included:
* CSR/SRI policies
* How such policies are implemented in practice
* Results and management expectations

CSR/SRI is voluntary in Denmark, but if a company has no policy on this it must state its positioning on CSR in financial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrgov.dk/home/0/2|title=Home - CSRgov|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, item S50K of the Income Tax Act of Mauritius mandated that companies registered in Mauritius paid 2% of their annual book profit to contribute to the social and environmental development of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/Ramtohul/corporate-social-responsibility-in-mauritius|title=Corporate Social Responsibility in Mauritius|author=Yoganand Ramtohul|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Evolution of corporate social responsibility in India|India]] also enacted a mandatory minimum CSR spending law. Under [[Companies Act, 2013]], any company having a net worth of 500 [[crore]] or more or a turnover of 1,000 crore or a net profit of 5 crore must spend 2% of their net profits on CSR activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Implications of Companies Act, 2013 Corporate Social Responsibility |url=http://gtw3.grantthornton.in/assets/Companies_Act-CSR.pdf |publisher=Grant Thornton India LLP |accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules came into effect from 1 April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Flag Off of CSR Rules: India Inc.'s To-Do List for Compliance to Section-135 |url=http://forbesindia.com/blog/the-good-company/the-flag-off-of-csr-rules-india-inc-s-to-do-list-for-compliance-to-section-135/ |accessdate=7 March 2014 |newspaper=Forbes |date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only mandatory CSR law in the world thus far was passed by the Indian parliament in 2013 as Article 135 of the Companies Law.  According to that bill, all firms with net worth above $75 million, turnover over $150 million, or net profit over $750,000 are required to spend at least 2% of their annual profits (averaged over three years). The law requires that all businesses affected establish a CSR committee to oversee the spending. Prior to this law’s passage, CSR laws applied to public sector companies only.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gatewayhouse.in/a-brief-history-of-indian-csr//&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crises and their consequences ===

Crises have encouraged the adoption of CSR. The [[Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies|CERES]] principles were adopted following the 1989 ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' incident.{{sfn |Grace |Cohen |2004}} Other examples include the [[lead paint]] used by toy maker [[Mattel]], which required the recall of millions of toys and caused the company to initiate new risk management and quality control processes. [[Magellan Metals]] was found responsible for lead contamination killing thousands of birds in Australia. The company ceased business immediately and had to work with independent regulatory bodies to execute a cleanup. [[Odwalla]] experienced a crisis with sales dropping 90% and its stock price dropping 34% due to cases of [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]. The company recalled all apple or [[carrot]] juice products and introduced a new process called "flash pasteurization" as well as maintaining lines of communication constantly open with customers.

== Geography ==

Corporations that employ CSR behaviors do not always behave consistently in all parts of the world.&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Alan |author2=Gail Whiteman |title=Exploring the Geography of Corporate Philanthropic Disaster Response: A Study of Fortune Global 500 Firms |journal=Journal of Business Ethics |date=February 2009 |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=589–603 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/198172266 |accessdate=11 February 2013 |doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9710-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a single behavior may not be considered ethical in all jurisdictions. E.g., some jurisdictions forbid women from driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/26/world/meast/saudi-arabia-women-drivers|title=Saudi Arabia women defy authorities over female driving ban|author=Mohammed Jamjoom and Laura Smith-Spark, CNN|date=26 October 2013|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others require women to be treated equally in employment decisions.

=== UK retail sector ===

A 2006 study{{sfn |Oppewal |2006}} found that the UK retail sector showed the greatest rate of CSR involvement. Many of the big retail companies in the UK joined the [[Ethical Trading Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/ |title=Ethical trading Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association established to improve working conditions and worker health.

[[Tesco]] (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tescoplc.com/ |accessdate=24 February 2014 |title=Tesco CSR report}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that their 'essentials' are 'Trading responsibility', 'Reducing our Impact on the Environment', 'Being a Great Employer' and 'Supporting Local Communities'. [[J Sainsbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/index.jsp |title=Sainsbury CSR Report |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; employs the headings 'Best for food and health', 'Sourcing with integrity', 'Respect for our environment', 'Making a difference to our community', and 'A great place to work', etc.
The four main issues to which UK retail these companies committed are environment, social welfare, ethical trading and becoming an attractive workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=P. |author2=Wynn, M., Comfort, D. and Hillier, D. |title=Corporate Social Responsibility and UK Retailers |journal=Issues in Social &amp; Environmental Accounting |year=2007 |volume=1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whooley |first=Niamh |title=The corporate responsibility report |year=2003 |volume=1 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martinuzzi et al. described the terms, writing that human responsibility is "the company deals with suppliers who adhere to principles of natural and good breeding and farming of animals, and also maintains fair and positive working conditions and work-place environments for their own employees. Product responsibility means that all products come with a full and complete list of content, that country of origin is stated, that the company will uphold its declarations of intent and assume liability for its products. Environmental responsibility means that a company is perceived to produce environmental-friendly, ecological, and non-harmful products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martinuzzi |first=André |author2=Robert Kudlak |author3=Claus Faber |author4=Adele Wiman |title=CSR Activities and Impacts of the Retail Sector |journal=RIMAS Working Papers |year=2011 |volume=No.4 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">In [[linguistics]], '''critical language awareness''' ('''CLA''') refers to an understanding of social, political, and ideological aspects of language, linguistic variation, and discourse. It functions as a pedagogical application of a [[critical discourse analysis]] (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosley Wetzel|first=Melissa|last2=Rogers|first2=Rebecca|date=2015-12-01|title=Constructing racial literacy through critical language awareness: A case study of a beginning literacy teacher|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898589815000352|journal=Linguistics and Education|series=Special Issue on Critical Language Awareness Approaches in the Americas: theoretical principles, pedagogical practices and distribution of intellectual labor|volume=32, Part A|pages=27–40|doi=10.1016/j.linged.2015.03.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical language awareness as a part of language education teaches students how to analyze the language that they and others use. More specifically, critical language awareness is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luke|first=Allan|date=2012-01-06|title=Critical Literacy: Foundational Notes|journal=Theory into Practice|volume=51|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/00405841.2012.636324|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding linguistic variation, Fairclough argued that it is insufficient to teach students to use "appropriate" language without considering why that language is preferred and who makes that decision (as well as the implications for speakers who do not use "appropriate language").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Global capitalism and critical awareness of language|url=http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|first=Norman|last=Fairclough|accessdate=2009-07-29|publisher=Schools on the Web|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909092406/http://www.schools.ash.org.au/litweb/norman1.html|archivedate=2012-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLA generally includes consideration of how a person may be marginalized by speaking a particular way, especially if that way of speaking serves as an index of their [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social status]], etc.

Because power is reproduced through language, CLA is "a prerequisite for effective [[democracy|democratic]] [[citizenship]], and should therefore be seen as an entitlement for citizens, especially children developing towards citizenship in the educational system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark, Romy|year=1990|title=Critical Language Awareness Part I: A Critical Review of Three Current Approaches to Language Awareness.|journal=Language and Education: An International Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=249–60|issn=0950-0782|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ437787&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ437787|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reginald Mpho Monareng|first= Rakwena |title=The Critical Language Awareness Perspective within the English Second Language Teacher Development|journal=The International Journal of the Humanities|volume=5|issue=1|pages=67–74|url=http://ijh.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.26/prod.968|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Deborah Mehl|author3=Shirley Pendlebury |year=1991|title=Grey areas and open minds: critical language awareness for student teachers |journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|volume=23|issue=5|pages=435–448|issn=1366-5839|doi=10.1080/0022027910230506|author=Mehl, Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=H.

== Possible physiological explanations ==

The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not certain.&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biotropica |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=338–339 |title=Crown shyness in a tropical cloud forest |year=1988 |authors=Alan J Rebertus |issn=0006-3606 |url=ftp://169.158.189.34/pub/Biotropica/1980s/1988/20-4/Biotropica-1988-20-4-p338.pdf |doi=10.2307/2388326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/FIA/2008/FSP_Y083088.pdf TASS III: Simulating the management, growth and yield of complex stands]&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of [[convergent evolution]].

Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to “reciprocal pruning” of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during [[wind]]s. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbors until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Franco|first1=M|title=. The influences of neighbours on the growth of modular organisms with an example from trees|journal=Biol. Sci|date=14 August 1986|volume=313|issue=1159|pages=313, 209–225.|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/313/1159/209|accessdate=10 June 2016|doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sfmn.ales.ualberta.ca/en/Publications/~/media/sfmn/Publications/ResearchNotes/Documents/RN_E36_CrownShyness_low.ashx |title=Crown shyness in maturing boreal forest stands |author=Victor Lieffers |journal=SFM Network Research Note Series |issn=1715-0981 |volume=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This  explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ROL_1980"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The vegetation of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve |authors=RO Lawton and Francis E Putz |journal=Brenesia |volume=18 |pages=101–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral branches has a large bearing on degree of crown shyness.

Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in [[eucalyptus]] in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maxwell Ralph Jacobs |title=Growth Habits of the Eucalypts |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/28637821 |year=1955 |publisher=Forestry and Timber Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of ''[[Picea sitchensis]]'' (Sitka spruce) and ''[[Larix kaempferi]]'' (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/313/1159/209 |title=The Influences of Neighbours on the Growth of Modular Organisms with an Example from Trees |author=M. Franco |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=313 |issue=1159 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0034 |date=14 August 1986 |pages=209–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/courses/bio669/papers/Chapter_comments_embedded/2_Interact_comments9_29.doc |title=The nature of the plant community: a reductionist view |chapter=2: Interactions between species |authors=J. Bastow Wilson and Andrew D.Q. Agnew |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballaré|first1=CL|last2=Scopel|first2=AL|last3=Sánchez|first3=RA|title=Far-red radiation reflected from adjacent leaves: an early signal of competition in plant canopies.|journal=Science|date=19 January 1990|volume=247|issue=4940|pages=329–32|pmid=17735851|doi=10.1126/science.247.4940.329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants are able to sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered [[far-red]] (FR) light, a task largely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the [[phytochrome]] photoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballare|first1=C. L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=R. A.|last3=Scopel|first3=Ana L.|last4=Casal|first4=J. J.|last5=Ghersa|first5=C. M.|title=Early detection of neighbour plants by phytochrome perception of spectral changes in reflected sunlight.|journal=Plant, Cell and Environment|date=September 1987|volume=10|issue=7|pages=551–557|doi=10.1111/1365-3040.ep11604091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species of plant respond to an increase in FR light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the FR stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballaré|first1=CL|last2=Scopel|first2=AL|last3=Sánchez|first3=RA|title=Foraging for light: photosensory ecology and agricultural implications|journal=Plant, Cell and Environment|date=June 1997|volume=20|issue=6|pages=820–825|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-112.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, blue (B) light is used by plants to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jansen|first1=Marcel A.K|last2=Gaba|first2=Victor|last3=Greenberg|first3=Bruce M|title=Higher plants and UV-B radiation: balancing damage, repair and acclimation|journal=Trends in Plant Science|date=April 1998|volume=3|issue=4|pages=131–135|doi=10.1016/S1360-1385(98)01215-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this modality is just beginning to be characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christie|first1=JM|last2=Reymond|first2=P|last3=Powell|first3=GK|last4=Bernasconi|first4=P|last5=Raibekas|first5=AA|last6=Liscum|first6=E|last7=Briggs|first7=WR|title=Arabidopsis NPH1: a flavoprotein with the properties of a photoreceptor for phototropism.|journal=Science|date=27 November 1998|volume=282|issue=5394|pages=1698–701|pmid=9831559|doi=10.1126/science.282.5394.1698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses.&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F.S.P. Ng 1997 34–37"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Malaysiana |title=Shyness in trees |volume=2 |pages=34–37 |year=1997 |author=F.S.P. Ng }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysian scholar [[Francis S.P. Ng]], who studied ''[[Dryobalanops aromatica]]'' in 1977 suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F.S.P. Ng 1997 34–37"/&gt;

A recent study has suggested that [[Arabidopsis]] shows different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crepy|first1=María A.|last2=Casal|first2=Jorge J.|title=Photoreceptor-mediated kin recognition in plants|journal=New Phytologist|date=January 2015|volume=205|issue=1|pages=329–338|doi=10.1111/nph.13040|pmid=25264216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F.S.P. Ng 1997 34–37"/&gt; though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry has yet to be experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.&lt;ref name="AJR_1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KP_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/802/v27n3-260-268.pdf |title=Plant Succession on Pago and Witori Volcanoes, New Britain |author=K.

'''DPSIR''' (drivers, pressures, state, impact and response model of intervention) is a causal framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment: [[Human impact on the environment]] and vice versa because of the [[interdependence]] of the components.

== Description ==

This framework has been adopted by the [[European Environment Agency]]. The components of this model are:
* '''D'''riving forces: e.g. [[industry]], [[tourism]], [[economic growth]]
* '''P'''ressures: e.g. [[pollution]], [[land-use change]], [[population growth]]
* '''S'''tates : e.g. [[water quality]], [[soil quality]], [[air quality]], [[habitat]], [[vegetation]]
* '''I'''mpacts : e.g. ill [[public health]], [[habitat fragmentation]], [[economic crisis]], [[environmental damage]], [[biodiversity loss]]
* '''R'''esponses : e.g. [[tax]]es, [[environmental law]]s, 

This framework is an extension of the pressure-state-response model developed by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As a first step, data and information on all the different elements in the DPSIR chain is collected. Then possible connections between these different aspects are postulated. Through the use of the DPSIR modelling framework, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of responses put into place.

{{Neuropsychology}}
In [[neuropsychology]], '''dissociation''' involves identifying the [[neural substrate]] of a particular brain function through identification of case studies, [[neuroimaging]], or neuropsychological testing.

==Dissociation types==

===Single dissociation===
When dissecting complex mental tasks into their subcomponents, a researcher can establish a "single dissociation" between functions. This is done by demonstrating that a lesion to brain structure A disrupts function X but not function Y. Such a demonstration allows one to infer that function X and function Y are independent of each other in some way.

Dr. [[Oliver Sacks]] has described many famous cases of dissociation in his books. An example of "single dissociation" is a patient who cannot name an object when he or she can only see it, but can when he or she uses other senses like touching or smelling. Patient D.F. was unable to place a card in a slot, but could do so when told to place it "as if mailing a letter". From this the conclusion was drawn that judging orientation is one ability (which D.F. had lost) and visual control of an action another (which D.F. could still do).&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;E. Bruce Goldstein: Sensation and Perception. Wadsworth, Pacific Grove (USA), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double dissociation===
To strengthen a single dissociation, a researcher can establish a "double dissociation", a term that was introduced by [[Hans-Lukas Teuber]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10954167_ITM What do double dissociations prove? | Cognitive Science (January, 2001)&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the demonstration that two experimental manipulations each have different effects on two dependent variables; if one manipulation affects the first variable and not the second, the other manipulation affects the second variable and not the first.&lt;ref&gt;Huettel, Scott A.; Song, Allen W.; McCarthy, Gregory: "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging" p. 439. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; If one can demonstrate that a lesion in brain structure A impairs function X but not Y, and further demonstrate that a lesion to brain structure B impairs function Y but spares function X, one can make more specific inferences about brain function and function localization.

In [[cognitive neuroscience]], double dissociation is an experimental technique by which two areas of neocortex are functionally dissociated by two behavioral tests, each test being affected by a lesion in one zone and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology,'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of patients with [[traumatic brain injury]], one might find two patients, A and B. Patient A has difficulty performing cognitive tests for, say auditory memory but has no problem with visual memory. Patient B has the opposite problem. By using [[neuroimaging]] (or [[neuropathology]] post-mortem) to identify the overlap and dissociation between lesioned areas of the brain, one can infer something about the localization of visual and auditory function in the normal brain.

Establishing a single dissociation between two functions provides limited and potentially misleading information, whereas a double dissociation can conclusively demonstrate that the two functions are localized in different areas of the brain.

To make the difference between single and double dissociations easier to understand, Parkin&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;A.J. Parkin: Explorations in Cognitive Neuropsychology. Blackwell, Oxford, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If your TV set suddenly loses the color you can conclude that picture transmission and color information must be separate processes (single dissociation: they cannot be independent because you cannot lose the picture and still have the color). If on the other hand you have two TV sets, one without sound and one without a picture you can conclude that these must be two independent functions (double dissociation).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Examples of double dissociations ===
[[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]] were two physicians of the 1800s whose patients were evidence of the double dissociation between generating language (speech) and understanding language. Broca's patients could no longer speak but could understand language ([[non-fluent aphasia]]) while Wernicke's patients could no longer understand language but could produce jumbled speech ([[fluent aphasia]]). Post-mortems revealed lesions in separate areas of the brain in each case (now referred to as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]] respectively). Although the neurophysiology of language is now known to be more complicated than described by Broca or Wernicke, this classic double dissociation acted to begin modern neuropsychological investigation of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = First-Pass versus Second-Pass Parsing Processes in a Wernicke's and a Broca's Aphasic: Electrophysiological Evidence for a Double Dissociation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X97919064|journal = Brain and Language|date = 1998-05-01|pages = 311–341|volume = 62|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/brln.1997.1906|first = Angela D.|last = Friederici|first2 = Anja|last2 = Hahne|first3 = D. Yves|last3 = von Cramon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions [[Capgras delusion]] and [[prosopagnosia]] have also been argued to represent a double dissociation. In the former, a patient is able to recognise a person but does not get the feeling of knowing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capgras delusion: a window on face recognition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466130001620X|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 149–156|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01620-X|first = Hadyn D.|last = Ellis|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, a patient is unable to recognise a familiar person but sometimes has a feeling of knowing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">In [[engineering]], '''double-subscript notation''' is notation used to indicate some variable ''between'' two points (each point being represented by one of the subscripts). In [[electronics]], the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage, while in [[mechanical engineering]] it is sometimes used to describe the [[force]] or [[Stress (physics)|stress]] between two points, and sometimes even a component that spans between two points (like a beam on a bridge or [[truss]]). Note that, although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used, they are not necessarily called ''double subscript notation'' specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Circuit Analysis for Power Engineering Handbook |author=Moses E. Zarudi, Shenkman, Arieh L. Shenkman|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-412-83180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic usage ==
IEEE standard 255-1963, "Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices", defined eleven original quantity symbols expressed as abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 255-1963 - IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices|last =|first =|publisher = IEEE|year = 1963|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] to standardize the directions of double-subscript labels. The following uses [[transistors]] as an example, but shows how the direction is read generally. The convention works like this:

&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{CB} \ &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[voltage]] from C to B. In this case, C would denote the collector end of a transistor, and B would denote the base end of the same transistor. This is the same as saying "the voltage drop from C to B". Though this applies the standard definitions of the letters C and B,&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics|last=Graf|first=Rudolf F.|publisher=Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=683-684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{CE} \ &lt;/math&gt; would in turn represent the current from C to E. In this case, C would again denote the collector end of a transistor, and E would denote the emitter end of the transistor. This is the same as saying "the current in the direction going from C to E".&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IC power supply pin|Power supply pins on integrated circuits]] utilize the same letters for denoting what kind of voltage the pin would receive. For example, a power input labeled V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; would be a positive input that would presumably connect to the collector pin of a BJT transistor in the circuit, and likewise respectively with other subscripted letters. The format used is the same as for notations described above, though without the connotation of V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; meaning the voltage from a collector pin to collector pin; the repetition avoids confusion as such an expression would not exist.

The table above shows only the originally denoted letters; others have found their way into use over time, such as S and D for the Source and Drain of a [[Field-effect transistor|FET]], respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15178">{{Linguistics}}
'''Ecolinguistics''', or '''ecological linguistics''', emerged in the 1990s as a new [[paradigm|frame of study]] of linguistic research, widening [[sociolinguistics]] to take into account not only the social context in which language is embedded, but also the [[ecology|ecological]] context.

[[Michael Halliday]]'s 1990 paper ''New ways of Meaning: the challenge to applied linguistics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.|first=Halliday, M. A.|date=April 1990|title=New Ways of Meaning: A Challenge to Applied Linguistics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED324960}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often credited as a seminal work which provided the stimulus for linguists to consider the ecological context and consequences of language. Among other things, the challenge that Halliday put forward was to make linguistics relevant to overarching contemporary issues, particularly the widespread destruction of the [[ecosystem]]s that life depends on. The main example Halliday gave was that of 'economic growth', describing how 'countless texts repeated daily all around the world contain a simple message: growth is good. Many is better than few, more is better than less, big is better than small, grow is better than shrink', which leads to ecologically destructive consequences. 

==Overview==
Since Halliday's initial comments, the field of ecolinguistics has developed in several directions, employing a wide range of linguistic frameworks and tools to investigate language in an ecological context. The [http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ International Ecolinguistics Association], characterizes ecolinguistics in these terms:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ecolinguistics explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org|title=The International Ecolinguistics Association|website=ecolinguistics-association.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this way, the 'eco' of ecolinguistics corresponds to ecology in its literal sense of the relationship of organisms (including humans) with other organisms and the physical environment. This is a sense shared with other ecological humanities disciplines such as ecocriticism and ecopsychology.

The term 'ecolinguistics' has also been used with a metaphorical sense of 'ecology', for example in '[[Linguistic ecology]]', 'communication ecology' and 'learning ecology' in ways which do not include consideration of other species or the physical environment. This is becoming less prevalent now as ecolingusitics becomes increasingly understood as a form of ecological humanities/social science.

Another aspect of ecolinguistics is the influence of the natural world on language. In 1996, [[David Abram]]'s book, ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World,'' described how the wider ecology (or 'the more than human world') shapes language in oral cultures (Abram, 1996), helping people attune to their environment. On the other hand, writing has gradually alienated people in literate cultures from the natural world, to the extent that 'our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs' (1996:267).

Overall there are three main areas of interest for ecolinguistics. The first can be described as 'The Ecological Analysis of Language', the second 'Language Diversity', and the third 'The Influence of Ecology on Language'.

==Ecological analysis of language==

The ecological analysis of language draws on a wide range of linguistic tools including critical discourse analysis, framing theory, cognitive linguistics, identity theory, rhetoric and systemic functional grammar to reveal underlying worldviews or the 'stories we live by'. The stories we live by are cognitive structures in the minds of individuals or across a society (social cognition) which influence how people treat each other, other animals, plants, forests, rivers and the physical environment. The stories are questioned from an ecological perspective with reference to an ecological framework (or ecosophy), and judged to be beneficial in encouraging people to protect the ecosystems that life depends on, or destructive in encouraging behavior which damages those ecosystems. Ecolinguistics attempts to make a practical difference in the world through resisting destructive stories and contributing to the search for new stories to live by (Stibbe 2015). Stories which have been exposed and resisted by ecolinguistics include consumerist stories, stories of unlimited economic growth, advertising stories, stories of intensive farming, and stories which represent nature as a machine or a resource. Using Positive Discourse Analysis, ecolinguistics has also searched for new stories to live by through exploring nature writing, poetry, environmental writing and traditional and indigenous forms of language around the world.

This form of analysis started with the application of critical discourse analysis to texts about the environment and environmentalism, in order to reveal hidden assumptions and messages and comment on the effectiveness of these in achieving environmental aims (e.g. Harré et al. 1999). It then developed to include analysis of any discourse which has potential consequences for the future of ecosystems, such as neoliberal economic discourse or discursive constructions of consumerism, gender, politics, agriculture and nature (e.g. Goatly 2000). The cognitive approach and the term 'stories we live by' was introduced in Stibbe (2015), which describes eight kinds of story: ideology, framing, metaphor, evaluation, identity, conviction, salience and erasure. Approaches such as [[environmental communication]] and [[ecocriticism]] have broadly similar aims and techniques to this form of ecolinguistics.

==Language diversity==

Language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the relationship between diversity of local languages and biodiversity. This relationship arises because of the ecological wisdom (or cultural adaptation to the environment) that is encoded in local languages. The forces of globalisation and linguistic imperialism are allowing dominant language to spread, and replace these local languages (Nettle and Romaine 2000). This leads to a loss of both sustainable local cultures and the important [[Traditional ecological knowledge|ecological knowledge]] contained within their languages. One of the goals of ecolinguistic research is to protect both cultural diversity and the linguistic diversity that supports it (Terralingua 2016, Nettle and Romaine 2000, Harmond 1996, Mühlhaüsler 1995). This research is in line with the United Nations Environment Program's position that:

"Biodiversity also incorporates human cultural diversity, which can be affected by the same drivers as biodiversity, and which has impacts on the diversity of genes, other species, and ecosystems. (UNEP 2007)"

Nettle and Romaine (2000:166) write that 'Delicate tropical environments in particular must be managed with care and skill. It is indigenous peoples who have the relevant practical knowledge, since they have been successfully making a living in them for hundreds of generations. Much of this detailed knowledge about local ecosystems is encoded in indigenous language and rapidly being lost'. Mühlhaüsler (2003:60) describes how 'The rapid decline in the world's linguistic diversity thus must be regarded with apprehension by those who perceive the interconnection between linguistic and biological diversity'.

Overall, language diversity is part of ecolinguistics because of the correlation between the diversity of language and biological diversity, with the ecological wisdom embedded in local cultures being the link between the two.

==Influence of ecology on language==

Abram's early chapter on "The Flesh of Language"  examined the contribution of the sensate body—and of the body's ongoing interaction with the earthly terrain—in the emergence of meaningful speech. A longer chapter on "Animism and the Alphabet" contrasted the discourse of indigenous, oral cultures with the discourse of literate cultures. For oral cultures, the coherence of spoken language is inseparable from the coherence of the surrounding ecology, from the expressive vitality of the more-than-human terrain. For these peoples "it is the animate earth that speaks; human speech is but a part of that vaster discourse." (p.&amp;nbsp;179) A subsequent chapter, entitled "In the Landscape of Language," drew examples from a range of divergent oral cultures to show some of the diverse ways that the local, more-than-human terrain informs and influences the discursive speech of oral cultures. Overall, Abram argues that ecology plays a key role in shaping human language in oral cultures, but with writing this role becomes less and less significant. This results in a situation where ‘our organic atonement to the local earth is thwarted by our ever-increasing intercourse with our own signs’ (1996:267). He therefore argues for using language in ways which bring ecology (or the 'more-than-human-world') back into language:

"there can be no question of simply abandoning literacy, of turning away from all writing. Our task, rather, is that of taking up the written word, with all of its potency, and patiently, carefully, writing language back into the land. Our craft is that of releasing the budded, earthy intelligence of our words, freeing them to respond to the speech of the things themselves - to the green uttering-forth of leaves from the spring branches." (Abram 1996:273)

[[File:PExdcr01CJC.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A circuit built on a printed circuit board (PCB).]]

An '''electronic circuit''' is composed of individual [[electronic component]]s, such as [[resistor]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[diode]]s, connected by conductive [[wire]]s or [[Conductive trace|traces]] through which [[electric current]] can flow. To be referred to as ''electronic'', rather than ''electrical'', generally at least one [[active component]] must be present. The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another.&lt;ref name="Alexander and Sadiku"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fundamentals of Electric Circuits|author=Charles Alexander and Matthew Sadiku|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Circuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]] (a [[printed circuit board]] or PCB) and [[solder]] the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an [[integrated circuit]] or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as [[silicon]] or (less commonly) [[gallium arsenide]].&lt;ref name="Jaeger"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microelectronic Circuit Design|author=Richard Jaeger|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an [[analog circuit]], a [[digital circuit]], or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits).

[[Breadboard]]s, [[perfboard]]s, and [[stripboard]]s are common for testing new designs. They allow the designer to make quick changes to the circuit during development.

==Analog circuits==
{{Main|Analog electronics}}
[[File:Common Base amplifier.png|right|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] representing an analog circuit, in this case a simple amplifier]]  

[[analog electronics|Analog electronic circuits]] are those in which current or [[voltage]] may vary continuously with time to correspond to the information being represented. Analog circuitry is constructed from two fundamental building blocks: [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] and [[Series and parallel circuits|parallel]] circuits.

In a series circuit, the same current passes through a series of components. A string of Christmas lights is a good example of a series circuit: if one goes out, they all do.

In a parallel circuit, all the components are connected to the same voltage, and the current divides between the various components according to their resistance.

[[File:Simple electrical schematic with Ohms law.png|right|thumb|width200| A simple schematic showing wires, a resistor, and a battery]]

The basic components of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, [[diode]]s, and [[transistor]]s. (In 2012 it was demonstrated that [[memristor]]s can be added to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in [[schematic diagram]]s, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]]: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a [[field-effect transistor]] can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.

An alternative model is to take independent power sources and [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] as basic electronic units; this allows modeling frequency dependent [[Negative resistance|negative resistors]], [[gyrator]]s, [[negative impedance converter]]s, and [[dependent source]]s as secondary electronic components.{{clarify|date=April 2018}}{{cn|date=April 2018}}

When the circuit size is comparable to a wavelength of the relevant signal frequency, a more sophisticated approach must be used, the [[distributed element model]].  Wires are treated as transmission lines, with nominally constant [[characteristic impedance]], and the [[electrical impedance|impedances]] at the start and end determine transmitted and reflected waves on the line.  Circuits designed according to this approach are [[distributed element circuit]]s. Such considerations typically become important for circuit boards at frequencies above a GHz; integrated circuits are smaller and can be treated as lumped elements for frequencies less than 10GHz or so.

==Digital circuits==
{{Main|Digital electronics}}

In [[digital electronics|digital electronic circuits]], electric signals take on discrete values, to represent logical and numeric values.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Digital Logic Design|author=John Hayes|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; These values represent the information that is being processed. In the vast majority of cases, binary encoding is used: one voltage (typically the more positive value) represents a binary '1' and another voltage (usually a value near the ground potential, 0 V) represents a binary '0'.  Digital circuits make extensive use of [[transistor]]s, interconnected to create [[logic gate]]s that provide the functions of [[Boolean logic]]: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR and all possible combinations thereof.  Transistors interconnected so as to provide positive feedback are used as latches and flip flops, circuits that have two or more metastable states, and remain in one of these states until changed by an external input.  Digital circuits therefore can provide both logic and memory, enabling them to perform arbitrary computational functions.  (Memory based on [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] is known as [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM).  Memory based on the storage of charge in a capacitor, [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) is also widely used.) 

The design process for digital circuits is fundamentally different from the process for analog circuits. Each logic gate regenerates the binary signal, so the designer need not account for distortion, gain control, offset voltages, and other concerns faced in an analog design.  As a consequence, extremely complex digital circuits, with billions of logic elements integrated on a single silicon chip, can be fabricated at low cost.  Such digital integrated circuits are ubiquitous in modern electronic devices, such as calculators, mobile phone handsets, and computers.  As digital circuits become more complex, issues of time delay, [[race condition|logic race]]s, power dissipation, non-ideal switching, on-chip and inter-chip loading, and leakage currents, become limitations to the density, speed and performance.  

Digital circuitry is used to create general purpose computing chips, such as [[microprocessor]]s, and custom-designed logic circuits, known as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). [[Field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs), chips with logic circuitry whose configuration can be modified after fabrication, are also widely used in prototyping and development. &lt;!-- and to be done through it --&gt;

==Mixed-signal circuits==
{{main | Mixed-signal integrated circuit }}

Mixed-signal or hybrid circuits contain elements of both analog and digital circuits.  Examples include [[comparator]]s, [[timers]], [[phase-locked loop]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.  Most modern radio and communications circuitry uses mixed signal circuits.  For example, in a receiver,  analog circuitry is used to amplify and frequency-convert signals so that they reach a suitable state to be converted into digital values, after which further signal processing can be performed in the digital domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6568">'''Eliezer (Lazer) ben Elijah Ashkenazi''' (1512–December 13, 1585) ({{lang-he|אליעזר בן אליהו אשכנזי}}) was a [[Talmud]]ist, [[rabbi]], physician, and many-sided scholar. Though of a [[Jews of Germany|German]] family (according to some, the relative of [[Joseph Colon]]; see [[Marco Mortara]], ''Indice Alfabetico,'' s.v.), he was probably born in the [[Levant]], and received his Talmudic education under [[Joseph Taitazak]] in [[Salonica]]. Ashkenazi first became rabbi in [[Egypt]] 1538-60, probably at [[Fostat]], where, by his learning and wealth, he became widely known. Compelled by circumstances—doubtless of a political nature—to leave Egypt, he went to [[Cyprus]], remaining there for two years as rabbi at [[Famagusta]].

A desire to visit foreign lands and to observe foreign peoples impelled him to give up this position and to travel. He went first to [[Venice]], but a disagreement with the rabbis [[Meïr Padua]] and his son [[Judah Katzenellenbogen]] caused him to leave the city and in the same year to take up his residence at [[Prague]] (1561). Here—either because he was a rabbi, or, at all events, because he was a leading authority—his was the first signature appended to the constitution of the burial society of the congregation. After leaving [[Bohemia]] and proceeding eastward as far as the [[Crimea]], Ashkenazi returned to [[Italy]], not before 1570. While rabbi of [[Cremona]] he published there (1576) his work, ''Yosef Lekah'' (Increases Learning; compare [[Prov.]] i. 5), dedicated to Joseph Nasi, duke of Naxos, which was several times reprinted. Four years later he was again in eastern Europe, as rabbi of [[Poznań|Posen]]. In 1584 he left that city to take up his abode in Cracow, where he died on December 13, 1585.

== Works ==
Ashkenazi's printed works are as follows: 
* ''Yosef LekaḦ''  A commentary on the [[Book of Esther]]
* ''Ma'ase ha-Shem'' (The Works of God; Venice, 1583; several other editions), a commentary on the historical portions of the [[Pentateuch]], written for the instruction of his son Elijah, and containing also a complete commentary on the [[Passover Haggadah]], which has frequently been published separately
* Eight "[[selihot]]" (penitential prayers), included in the Bohemian liturgy
* A "tokahah" (homily), published by his son.
* His supercommentary to [[Nahmanides]], and his critical marginal notes—said to number one thousand—on [[Joseph Caro]]'s ''Bet Yosef,'' have not been preserved.

== His individuality ==
Ashkenazi's personality was an extraordinary one. He may be called the last survivor of a most brilliant epoch in the history of the [[Sephardim]].  Although educated by a [[kabalist]], and a fellow-pupil of [[Moses Alshech]], yet he was a student—if not a deep one—of philosophy and physics. As a [[Talmudist]], such men as [[Joseph Caro]], [[Moses Isserles]], and [[Solomon Luria]] considered him of equal authority with themselves; however, when the rabbinical decisions of earlier rabbis ran counter to his own judgment, he never sought a sophistical justification for them, as was then the custom, especially in Poland.

Valuable material for a correct estimate of Ashkenazi may be found in several of his decisions preserved in the [[responsa]] literature of the time. In [[Venice]] he decided that a man could be forced to a divorce, if, by immoral conduct, he had incurred his wife's aversion (Isserles, Responsa, No. 96). It was likely this decision which brought upon him the opposition of the above-mentioned Venetian rabbis, though he was connected with them, for Ashkenazi's son was [[Katzenellenbogen]]'s son-in-law. From the standpoint of strict Talmudic interpretation, Ashkenazi's opponents were in the right, since his sentence contravened that of the [[Tosafists]], who for the German-Italian Jews constituted, as it were, a court of last resort.

== Controversies with Polish rabbis ==
It appears that Ashkenazi's fierce confidence and independence led to clashes with the rabbinic establishment in Poland. The following occurrence is one such instance: The "[[Rosh yeshiva|rashei yeshivot]]" (heads of academies) had forbidden their pupils to establish a rival academy in close proximity to their own. Ashkenazi declined to assent to this resolution, even when requested in the name of [[Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon]] ha-Kohen, the "rosh yeshibah" at [[Cracow]]. In a letter to the latter he claimed that, although the decision of the Polish [[rabbis]] was based upon the authority of [[Maimonides]], he considered it unsupported by Talmudic literature and therefore deemed it as needlessly discouraging religious instruction. Ashkenazi even went so far as to question if indeed a great scholar like the rabbi of Cracow had truly requested this at all! Here too, despite the great respect shown Ashkenazi in his reply, the rabbi of Cracow responded forcefully at length, vindicating Maimonides' standpoint by erudite and astute references to the [[Talmud]] (Joseph b. Mordecai Gershon, ''She'erit Yosef,'' No. 19). Consequently, [[J. S. del Medigo]] is quoted as saying that although Ashkenazi lived and taught in Poland in his later years his work was largely unknown to Polish Jews for "his way was hidden from them, and they did not fully understand his views nor his lofty ideas" (Nobeloth Hokhmah, Samuel b. Judah Loeb Ashkenazi, Basilia 1631, p. 46a).

Ashkenazi's wife, Rachel, died at Cracow April 3, 1593. Her epitaph, still extant, bears witness to her piety and benevolence (''Monatsschrift,'' xliv. 360). His son Elijah published the liturgic collection, ''Zibhe Shelamim,'' and wrote a short elegy on his father, which was used as the latter's epitaph.

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
In philosophy, '''empiricism''' is a [[theory]] that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [[Empirical evidence|sensory experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415546133|pages=129–38|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of several views of  [[epistemology]], the study of human knowledge, along with [[rationalism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasises the role of [[empirical evidence]] in the formation of ideas, over the idea of [[innate idea]]s or [[traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. ''Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1748.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empiricism in the [[philosophy of science]] emphasises evidence, especially as discovered in [[experiment]]s. It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, M. (2006). Empiricism. In F. English (Ed.), Encyclopedia of educational leadership and administration. (pp. 338–39). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term ''empirical'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἐμπειρία, ''empeiria'', which is cognate with and translates to the Latin ''experientia'', from which are derived the word ''experience'' and the related ''experiment''.

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|Empirical method}}

A central concept in  [[science]] and the [[scientific method]] is that it must be ''empirically'' based on the evidence of the senses. Both [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use working [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that are [[testable]] by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.&lt;ref&gt;Markie, P. (2004), "Rationalism vs. Empiricism" in Edward D. Zalta (ed.), ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is commonly contrasted with [[rationalism]], which states that knowledge may be derived from [[reason]] independently of the senses. For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone. Similarly [[Robert Boyle]], a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Luis E. (1981), ''From Descartes to Hume: Continental Metaphysics and the Development of Modern Philosophy'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engfer, Hans-Jürgen (1996), ''Empirismus versus Rationalismus? Kritik eines philosophiegeschichtlichen Schemas'', Padeborn: Schöningh.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main continental rationalists ([[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) were also advocates of the empirical "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Stephen (1999), "British Sceptical Realism. A Fresh Look at the British Tradition", ''European Journal of Philosophy'', 7, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anstey, "[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/09/esp-is-best/ ESP is best]", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early empiricism===
''[[Vaisheshika]]'' [[darsana]], founded by the ancient Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|"phenomena"]]''.&lt;ref name=sini&gt;Sini, Carlo (2004), "Empirismo", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("clean slate" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words "white paper") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (Latin for "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses").

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] "that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; So the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a ''tabula rasa'' to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through experience alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', was written by the Arab theologian and physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist's mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.&lt;ref name="Roubi"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'')&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] adopted the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] position that the senses are essential to mind into [[scholasticism]]. [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), one of Aquinas' strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===
In the late [[renaissance]] various writers began to question the [[medieval]] and [[classical philosophy|classical]] understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the "effectual truth" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) said, "If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."&lt;ref&gt;"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 – 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for "experiment" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded "experience and demonstration" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===
'''British empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[René Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th century "[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]" [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a "blank tablet", in Locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].

[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]
A generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen (1987) "Berkeley's Theory of Reality" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "George Berkeley", vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP2"/&gt;

The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt; And,&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on."|Hume Section XIV "of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. "that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions". For Hume, an "impression" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]—that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt; Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;Hume, D. "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===
{{Main|Phenomenalism}}
Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi, Diego (2004), "Fenomenismo"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the "permanent possibility of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., "An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;}}

Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred (2005), "John Stuart Mill", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of "reality" that goes beyond mere "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MEP6&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Phenomenalism", vol. 6, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all".&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name=MEP2&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Empiricism", vol. 2, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Axiomatic Method", vol. 5, pp. 188–89, 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Bolender, John (1998), "Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512–17 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical empiricism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
Logical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, "''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term "pragmatism", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of "pragmaticism".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.

[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the "data-driven" strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach "presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Teddy (n.d.), "Empiricism", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]]]]
In his Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the "three cotary propositions of pragmatism" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they "put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or "thisness"—what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''—that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term "[[radical empiricism]]" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed "directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support",&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' "radical empiricism" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term "empiricism", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term "[[empirical]]". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physical sciences as in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.

'''Fantavision''' is an animation program by Scott Anderson and published by [[Brøderbund]] for the [[Apple II series]] in 1985. It was ported to the [[Amiga]] (1988), [[Apple IIGS]] (1987), and [[MS-DOS]] (1988).

Advertisements claim that Fantavision is a revolutionary software breakthrough that, for the ''first'' time, brings to home computers the special powers known to computer animators as "[[tweening]]" and "transforming".&lt;ref name="cgw198602"/&gt; It allows the user to create short [[vector graphics]] animations frame-by-frame using a [[computer mouse|mouse]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], or other device. The software then uses a primitive [[morphing]] technology to generate frames in-between the user-created frames, allowing complex animations to be created without the requirement that every frame be drawn by the user. Because this is done in real-time, it allows for creative exploration and quick changes.

The [[user interface|interface]] is a [[GUI]]—similar to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] of the day—with [[pull-down menus]] and black text on a white background.

==Reception==
''[[Compute!]]'' in 1989 called ''Fantavision'' the best animation program for the IBM PC, although it noted the inability to draw curves.&lt;ref name=anzovin198902/&gt;

&lt;!--[[File:Hands_of_people_playing_Friday_Night_at_the_ER_training_game.jpeg|thumb|Friday Night at the ER experiential learning game is played with four players at each game board for 1.5 hours, followed by 1.5 to 2 hour debriefing and discussion.]]--&gt;
'''Friday Night at the ER''' is an [[experiential learning|experiential team-learning]] game. Played on game boards at tables with four players per board, each gameplay session is followed by a detailed debriefing in which participants relate the [[simulation]] experience to their own work and gain insights for performance improvement.

The game simulates the challenge of managing a hospital during a 24-hour period. Players perform distinct functions, but they come to realize that they also depend on one another. While the game was designed to teach [[systems thinking]], it has served diverse learning objectives across many industries and cultures.

Each session includes 1.5 hours of game play followed by approximately 1.5 to 2 hours of debrief and discussion.

==Background==
The Friday Night at the ER game was developed in 1992 by Breakthrough Learning, Inc., a consulting and training firm based in Morgan Hill, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1994 | title=The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook | publisher=Crown Business Publishing | pages=541–542 | isbn=978-0385472562 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OnIMbEC0UdgC | accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial purpose was to broadly teach people to think systemically, collaborating across functional boundaries to achieve system goals. The game's design objectives were:
* to create an experiential learning tool that would engage people in a learning process; 
* to simulate and illustrate dynamics that are common to complex systems; and  
* to promote an understanding of key systems principles in a way that enables people to gain insight about their relevance.

Since its initial release, the Friday Night at the ER game has found use for a broader range of learning objectives within diverse organizations. Demonstrating the universality of systems principles, the game is in use by service organizations, manufacturing companies, government agencies, academic institutions and others in at least 30 countries.

==History and development==
A predecessor learning game, [[Beer Distribution Game|The Beer Distribution Game]], demonstrated effective team learning about the behavior of complex systems through an experiential activity.

In 1990, [[Peter Senge]] published ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]''&lt;ref name="senge-1990"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized systems thinking as a discipline essential to [[learning organizations]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Friday Night at the ER game has its origins in a business case that took place in 1990 at San Jose Medical Center, in [[San Jose, California]], where a persistent problem of decreasing capacity for emergency patients was resolved using a [[system dynamics]] study that included a simulation model of patient flow.&lt;ref name="oreilly-1990"&gt;

In 1992, healthcare management consultant Bette Gardner created the Friday Night at the ER game, loosely based on that case, to teach management principles and the practice of systems thinking within healthcare and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Bette; DeMello, Steve (July/August 1993).''"Transformational leadership. Systems thinking in action."'' ''Healthcare Forum Journal,'' 36(4):25-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The game development process included a computer-based simulation model (using the [[IThink|IThink simulation modelling environment]]),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond, finding use across diverse industries including other service organizations, manufacturing companies, government agencies, and academic institutions. The Friday Night at the ER game has been used for training in at least 30 countries.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 2014, an updated version of the Friday Night at the ER game was released with modernized and upgraded game and support materials.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of the effectiveness of Friday Night at the ER are largely based on [[Likert scale|Likert]] surveys, testimonials and [[Net Promoter]] surveys. In 2018, educators at University of North Carolina at Greensboro published results of research in which students were assessed before and after using Friday Night at the ER. They concluded that the Friday Night at the ER activity is a useful teaching strategy for complex problem solving and application of systems thinking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enhancing Systems Thinking for Undergraduate Nursing Students Using Friday Night at the ER |journal=Journal of Nursing Education |date=November 2018|last=Bacon |first=Cynthia Thornton |last2=Trent |first2=Peggy |last3=McCoy |first3=Thomas P. |volume=57 |issue=11 |pages=687-689 |doi=10.3928/01484834-20181022-11 |url=https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20181022-11 |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program structure==
Participants in a group (from 4 to 200 people) are assembled at tables equipped with game boards and associated materials. A program leader or coordinator provides verbal instructions; then participants play the game on their own for approximately one hour. The gameplay is followed by scoring to measure team performance. After a brief stretch break, participants reconvene for a debriefing. The debrief is facilitated by the program leader with a structured progression of discussion questions, reflection exercises, didactic presentation, and group tasks to bring to light key lessons of the experience, its relevance to the group and how participants will put lessons into practice after the program.

The structure of the program may be varied. For example, the gameplay's 24-hour simulation may be conducted in two 12-hour segments with a short debrief or planning meeting in between segments. Another variation has groups playing in separate rooms with a slightly different instruction or game-board structure in each room so that behavior and results can be compared. In addition to variations in the gameplay, the structure and content of the debrief may be designed to teach either a narrow or broad purpose.

The program generally requires 3.5 to 4 hours to complete the gameplay and debrief.

==Gameplay and scoring==
At each four-person table, players each manage one of four departments in a hospital: Emergency, Surgery, Critical Care, and Step Down. The gameboard hospital is consolidated and simplified (relative to reality) to enable players to progress through a simulated 24 hours in just one hour.

Each department contains spaces in which patients are treated by staff, and game cards determine new patient arrivals as well as “ready to exit” indicators for patients. The game board may be seen as a hybrid version of a [[System dynamics#stock and flow diagrams|stock-flow]] map or [[flow process chart|process-flow chart]]. Players’ management tasks include determining staffing levels, accepting internal patient transfers, and remaining open to additional patients or diverting new ambulance arrivals. Among the other details of the gameplay are “events” that occur (e.g., a doctor is late, a room is being renovated, a staff member goes home sick), requiring reaction and management by players.

Demand rates in the gameplay, by hour, from mid-day Friday to mid-day Saturday, represent the typical pattern seen in hospitals. Emergency arrivals ramp up during Friday night (a time when people more often engage in risky behaviors that lead to emergencies); while arrivals to other departments in the hospital decrease as the weekend begins. A portion of Emergency arrivals flow through to other departments, so players experience the ripple effect of demand and the challenge of interdepartmental hand-offs.

Consequences of player decisions in the gameplay are both local and systemic. The structure of the game board, role assignments and the accounting system influence players to focus on department performance; yet as the game progresses it becomes evident that the more one tries to optimize a part, the worse the system as a whole performs.

During the gameplay, players keep track of certain data on paperwork forms at each department. Following the gameplay, individuals at each table contribute to calculating a team score that reflects the quality of service they delivered and financial performance. Teams scores are displayed to provide benchmarks and to enable participants to relate behavior to performance.

==Debriefing==
A standard debrief to teach applied systems thinking is described in the Friday Night at the ER Guide for Program Leaders with presentation slides to support key points. The debrief includes team reflection exercises, guided group discussion, didactic presentation and group tasks.

During the debrief, participants are guided to focus on collaboration, innovation and data-driven decision-making as key strategies necessary for successful system performance. These three strategies are examined and they are shown to be interdependent. Participants see that these three strategies produce excellent performance in the gameplay, and that the same applies to their real-world endeavors within organizations.

While these three strategies are not new ideas to most participants, the question is posed in the debrief, “Why, then, don’t we routinely put these strategies into day-to-day practice?”—as they demonstrated in the gameplay and as seen in the real world? An axiom from the field of [[system dynamics]], “structure drives behavior,” is presented and participants are led through an exercise in which they examine how various structures within their organization may (unintentionally) inhibit desired behaviors.

Numerous variations to the standard debrief have been reported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">{{short description|A hot, ionised, gaseous component in the Galactic halo}}
The terms '''galactic corona''' and '''gaseous corona''' have been used in the first decade of the 21st century to describe a hot, [[ion]]ised, gaseous component in the [[Galactic halo]] of the [[Milky Way]]. A similar body of very hot and tenuous gas in the halo of any [[spiral galaxy]] may also be described by these terms.

This coronal gas may be sustained by the galactic fountain, in which [[superbubble]]s of ionised gas from [[supernova remnant]]s expand vertically through galactic chimneys into the halo. As the gas cools, it is pulled back into the [[galactic disc]] of the galaxy by gravitational forces. 

Galactic coronas have been and are currently being studied extensively, in the hope of gaining a further understanding of galaxy formation. Although, considering how galaxies differ in shaping and sizing, no particular theory has been able to adequately illustrate how the galaxies in the Universe originally formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2017/hubbles-cool-galaxy-with-a-hot-corona|title=Hubble's Cool Galaxy with a Hot Corona|last=Hille|first=Karl|date=2017-09-22|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">In [[bioethics]] and [[law]], '''gene theft''' or '''DNA theft''' is the act of acquiring the [[genetic material]] of another human being without his or her permission, often from a public place. The [[DNA]] may be harvested from a wide variety of common objects such as discarded cigarettes, used coffee cups, and hairbrushes.  This genetic material can then be used for purposes such as establishing [[Paternity (law)|paternity]], proving [[genealogy|genealogical connections]] or even unmasking [[medical privacy|private medical]] conditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harmon, Amy.  Stalking Strangers’ DNA to Fill in the Family Tree.  ''The New York Times'' April 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==

The '''Global Studies Consortium''' (GSC) is an international academic association of over 20 institutions of higher learning. It seeks to "promote and facilitate graduate teaching programs in [[global studies]] and to foster cooperation among them." &lt;ref&gt;[http://globalstudiesconsortium.org/info/by-laws By-Laws, Global Studies Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; That cooperation includes exchange of materials and development of methods to survey outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EOp0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QeBuweU4Ql&amp;sig=80G_Z7C6oucuBMYCq2jAel-63Lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiwKbNivHKAhUDRCYKHarRCQg4ChDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Tokyo&amp;f=false Lena Bader, et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4403">In [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the '''Gunn–Peterson trough''' is a feature of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[quasars]] due to the presence of neutral [[hydrogen]] in the [[Intergalactic space|Intergalactic Medium (IGM)]]. The trough is characterized by suppression of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic emission]] from the quasar at wavelengths less than that of the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] line at the [[redshift]] of the emitted light. This effect was originally predicted in 1965 by [[James E. Gunn (astronomer)|James E. Gunn]] and [[Bruce Peterson (astronomer)|Bruce Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gunn | first = J.E. |author2=Peterson, B.A. | title=On the Density of Neutral Hydrogen in Intergalactic Space | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1965 | volume=142 | pages=1633–1641 | bibcode=1965ApJ...142.1633G | doi=10.1086/148444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First detection==

For over three decades after the prediction, no objects had been found distant enough to show the Gunn–Peterson trough. It was not until 2001, with the discovery of a quasar with a redshift z = 6.28 by Robert Becker and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Becker | first=R. H. |display-authors=etal | title=Evidence For Reionization at z ~ 6: Detection of a Gunn-Peterson Trough in a z=6.28 Quasar | date=2001 | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=122 | issue=6 | pages=2850–2857 | bibcode=2001AJ....122.2850B | doi=10.1086/324231|arxiv = astro-ph/0108097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using data from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], that a Gunn–Peterson trough was finally observed. The paper also included quasars at redshifts of z = 5.82 and z = 5.99, and, while each of these exhibited absorption at wavelengths on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha transition, there were numerous spikes in flux as well. The flux of the quasar at z = 6.28, however, was effectively zero beyond the Lyman-alpha limit, meaning that the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM must have been larger than ~10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Evidence for reionization==

The discovery of the trough in a z = 6.28 quasar, and the absence of the trough in quasars detected at redshifts just below z = 6 presented strong evidence for the hydrogen in the universe having undergone a transition from neutral to ionized around z = 6. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], the universe was expected to be neutral, until the first objects in the universe started emitting light and energy which would [[reionization|reionize]] the surrounding IGM. However, as the scattering cross section of photons with energies near that of the Lyman-alpha limit with neutral hydrogen is very high, even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen will make the [[optical depth]] of the IGM high enough to cause the suppression of emission observed. Despite the fact that the ratio of neutral hydrogen to ionized hydrogen may not have been particularly high, the low flux observed past the Lyman-alpha limit indicates that the universe was in the final stages of reionization.

Following the first release of data from the [[WMAP]] spacecraft in 2003, the determination by Becker that the end of reionization occurred at z ≈ 6 appeared to conflict with estimates made from the WMAP measurement of the electron column density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kogut |first=A. |display-authors=etal | title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature-Polarization Correlation | date=2003 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=148 | issue=1 | pages = 161–173 | bibcode=2003ApJS..148..161K | doi=10.1086/377219|arxiv = astro-ph/0302213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the WMAP III data released in 2006 now seems to be in much better agreement with the limits on reionization placed by observation of the Gunn–Peterson trough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Page | first=L. |display-authors=etal | title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Polarization Analysis | date=2007 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=170 | issue=2 | pages=335–376 | bibcode=2007ApJS..170..335P | doi=10.1086/513699|arxiv = astro-ph/0603450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6099">[[File:HaddaGenius.JPG|thumb|right|The "Genius with flowers", Hadda, Gandhara. 2-3rd century CE. [[Musée Guimet]].]]

'''Haḍḍa''' ({{lang-ps|هډه}}) is a [[Greco-Buddhist]] archeological site located in the ancient region of [[Gandhara]], ten kilometers south of the city of [[Jalalabad]], in the [[Nangarhar Province]] of eastern [[Afghanistan]].

==Background==
Some 23,000 Greco-Buddhist sculptures, both clay and plaster, were excavated in Hadda during the 1930s and the 1970s. The findings combine elements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] in an almost perfect Hellenistic style.

[[Image:HaddaBodhisattva.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Chandeka]], Hadda, 5th century CE]]
{{History of Afghanistan}}
Although the style of the artifacts is typical of the late Hellenistic 2nd or 1st century BCE, the Hadda sculptures are usually dated (although with some uncertainty), to the 1st century CE or later (i.e. one or two centuries afterward). This discrepancy might be explained by a preservation of late Hellenistic styles for a few centuries in this part of the world.  However it is possible that the artifacts actually were produced in the late Hellenistic period.

Given the antiquity of these sculptures and a technical refinement indicative of artists fully conversant with all the aspects of Greek sculpture, it has been suggested that Greek communities were directly involved in these realizations, and that "the area might be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in [[Indo-Greek]] style".&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity'' ({{ISBN|0-691-03680-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of many of the works at Hadda is highly Hellenistic, and can be compared to sculptures found at the [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo in Bassae, Greece]].

The [[toponym]] Hadda has its origins in [[Sanskrit]] haḍḍa n. m., "a bone", or, an unrecorded *haḍḍaka, adj., "(place) of bones". The former - if not a fossilized form - would have given rise to a Haḍḍ in the subsequent vernaculars of northern India (and in the [[Old Indic]] loans in modern Pashto). The latter would have given rise to the form ''Haḍḍa'' naturally and would well reflect the belief that Hadda housed a bone-relic of Buddha. The term haḍḍa is found as a loan in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] haḍḍ, n., id. and may reflect the linguistic influence of the original pre-Islamic population of the area.

==Works of art==
A sculptural group excavated at the Hadda site of Tapa-i-Shotor represents [[Buddha]] surrounded by perfectly Hellenistic [[Herakles]] and [[Tyche]] holding a [[cornucopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731041835/www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only adaptation of the Greek iconography is that Herakles holds the thunderbolt of [[Vajrapani]] rather than his usual club.

Other attendants to the Buddha have been excavated which display manifest Hellenistic styles, such as the "Genie au Fleur", today in Paris at the [[Guimet Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130103001644/www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist scriptures==
It is believed the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts-indeed the oldest surviving Indian manuscripts of any kind-were recovered around Hadda. Probably dating from around the 1st century CE, they were written on bark in [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] using the [[Kharoṣṭhī]] script, and were unearthed in a clay pot bearing an inscription in the same language and script. They are part of the long-lost canon of the [[Sarvastivadin]] Sect that dominated [[Gandhara]] and was instrumental in Buddhism's spread into central and east Asia via the [[Silk Road]]. The manuscripts are now in the possession of the [[British Library]].

==Destruction==
Hadda is said to have been almost entirely destroyed in the fighting during the civil war in [[Afghanistan]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
There were also many works of art lost as a result of the civil war. One of the worst of the casualties was the loss of two statues. The Red Mountain range in Bamiyan that once housed two giant statues of the Buddha, on cliff faces, besides smaller structures of archaeological significance. The two big statues, dating back to the 5th or 6th century CE, were the largest of all Buddhist statues so far attested in the world. Only remnants of these statues were left behind.

'''Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology''' ('''ISMB''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on the subjects of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]] organised by the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB). The principal focus of the conference is on the development and application of advanced computational methods for biological problems. The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown to become one of the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linial2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linial | first1 = M. | last2 = Mesirov | first2 = J.

Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB).

The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]]. Most presentations are given in multiple parallel tracks; however, keynote talks are presented in a single track and are chosen to reflect outstanding research in bioinformatics. Notable ISMB keynote speakers have included eight Nobel laureates. The recipients of the ISCB [[Overton Prize]] and [[ISCB Senior Scientist Awards|ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award]] are invited to give keynote talks as part of the programme. The proceedings of the conference are currently published by the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.

==History==
[[File:Larry hunter computer scientist.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white portrait of Lawrence Hunter|[[Lawrence Hunter]], co-chair of the first ISMB conference.]]

===Early meetings===
The origins of the ISMB conference lie in a workshop for [[artificial intelligence]] researchers with an interest in [[molecular biology]] held in November 1991.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Todd A.|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in ISMB|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e1002679|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002679|pmid=22952443|pmc=3431341|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop was organised by [[United States of America|American]] researcher [[Lawrence Hunter]], then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Searls1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Searls|first=D.|author2=Shavlik, J. |author3=Hunter, L. |title=The First International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|journal=AI Magazine|year=1994|volume=15|issue=1|pages=12–13|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/1082/1000|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the [[National Science Foundation]], made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="about-ismb"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISMB|url=http://www.iscb.org/about-ismb|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having successfully applied for grants from [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]], [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] and the [[Office of Science#Biological and Environmental Research|Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research]], the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, [[David Searls]] (research associate professor at [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]]) and [[Jude Shavlik]] (assistant professor of computer science at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries,&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; submitting 69 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

The success of the first conference prompted the announcement of a second ISMB conference at the end of the meeting. ISMB 1994 was initially planned to be held in [[Seattle]]. However, a competing meeting forced ISMB to change venues at short notice. The conference was held at [[Stanford University]] in August 1994 and was organised by [[Russ Altman]], a research scientist at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt; To emphasise the international aspect of the conference, ISMB 1995 was held at [[Robinson College, Cambridge]]. ISMB 1995 also marked a shift in the focus of the conference. [[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]] Board member and Director of the [[Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute]] [[Alfonso Valencia]] has stated that, in 1995, "the conference changed from a computer science-based conference to a point where everyone realized that, if you want to make progress, there has to be more focus in biology."&lt;ref name=Gibson2012 /&gt;

===Formation of ISCB and expansion===
ISMB 1997 was held in [[Halkidiki]], [[Greece]] and marked the foundation of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] (ISCB).&lt;ref name="about-ismb" /&gt; ISCB was formed with a focus on managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) was attended by over 1,000 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 141 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

===Partnership with ECCB===
[[File:Wfm secc front.jpg|thumb|alt=The entrance to the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|The first joint conference with [[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] was held in 2004 at the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]].]]
In 2004, ISMB was jointly held with the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] for the first time. The conference was also co-located with the Genes, Proteins and Computers conference. This meeting, held in [[Glasgow]], [[UK]], was the largest [[bioinformatics]] conference ever held,&lt;ref name=iscb-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|work=www.iscb.org|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; attended by 2,136 delegates, submitting 496 scientific papers.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2004&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB/ECCB 2004|url=http://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2004/|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso Valencia considers ISMB/ECCB 2004 to be an important milestone in the history of ISMB: "it was the first one where the balance between Europe and the States became an important part of the conference. It was here that we established the rules and the ways and the spirit of collaboration between the Americans and the Europeans."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; The success of the joint conference paved the way for future European ISMB meetings to be held jointly with ECCB.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt;

===Recent meetings===
By the end of 2006, ISCB was in financial difficulty. Two conferences (ISMB 2003, in [[Brisbane]] and ISMB 2006, in [[Fortaleza]]) had drastically reduced numbers of participants due to their location, with a corresponding reduction in income.&lt;ref name="Rost2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rost|first=B.|title=ISCB: past-present perspective for the International Society for Computational Biology|journal=Bioinformatics|date=14 November 2013|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt629|pmid=24234004|pmc=5994947|volume=29|issue=24|pages=3243–3245}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allow more delegates to attend, it was decided to limit conference locations to North America and Europe. In January 2007, ISMB and ECCB agreed to hold joint conferences in Europe every other year, beginning with ISMB/ECCB 2007.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; ISMB would be held in North America in the years between joint meetings. {{As of|2016}}, this pattern has been confirmed to continue until at least 2019. ISMB/ECCB 2007 (held in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]) marked the first conference for which ISCB took full responsibility for organising.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Vienna became the first city to host ISMB twice with ISMB/ECCB 2011. This 'return visit' was an experiment intended to reduce the increasing effort required to find suitable conference venues. Although the return to Vienna was only deemed partially successful due to price increases, [[Boston]] (which hosted ISMB 2010 and 2014) is predicted to become a 'safe' site which ISMB can periodically return to.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

ISMB celebrated its 20th meeting with ISMB 2012, held in [[Long Beach, California]]. This event attracted around 1,600 delegates,&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; submitting 268 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Richard H. Lathrop and Lawrence Hunter presented a special keynote presentation, looking back at previous ISMB meetings and attempting to predict where the field of [[bioinformatics]] may head in the future.&lt;ref name=ismb2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012-program/ismb2012-keynotes|work=ISMB 2012|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISMB/ECCB 2013 was held in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] and was attended by around 2,000 delegates, submitting 233 scientific papers.&lt;ref name="Ben-Tal2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben-Tal|first=N.|title=Editorial|journal=Bioinformatics|date=21 June 2013|volume=29|issue=13|pages=i1–i2|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btt282|pmid=23812973|pmc=3694647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main conference===
The main ISMB conference is usually held over three days and consists of presentations, [[poster session]]s and [[keynote|keynote talks]].&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

[[Academic paper]]s at ISMB were traditionally presented in a single track.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; Presentations at ISMB 1994 were split further into three themed days, focusing on [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|protein secondary structure prediction]], [[sequence analysis]] and AI techniques and biochemical applications, respectively.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; As attendance at ISMB increased, the single track approach became increasingly unsustainable and two parallel tracks were introduced at ISMB/ECCB 2004. Further expansion meant that, by ISMB 2012, over 200 talks were presented in nine parallel tracks&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; including multiple [[proceedings]] tracks, a highlights track and a technology track. The introduction of parallel tracks to ISMB was controversial. [[Christopher Rawlings]] (head of Computational and Systems Biology at [[Rothamsted Research]] and organiser of ISMB 1995) has said: "There were a lot of people who wanted to keep it more strongly in the AI intelligent systems model and have a meeting where everybody would go to everything. But it just grew too big. We just couldn’t."&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; As the number of submitted [[proceedings]] papers has increased, the acceptance rate has decreased dramatically, from 75% in 1994 to 13% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gibson2012" /&gt; ISMB proceedings from 1993-2000 were published by [[AAAI Press]]. Since ISMB 2001, proceedings have been published in the journal ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISMB Proceedings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismb-proceedings|work=www.iscb.org|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunak|first=S.|author2=Krogh, A.|title=ISMB 2001|journal=Bioinformatics|date=1 June 2001|volume=17|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S1–S4|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.S1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of posters presented at ISMB has also increased dramatically. 25 posters were presented at ISMB 1994;&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; at recent ISMB meetings, 500-1,000 posters have been presented in multiple poster sessions.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt;

Roberts]] (keynote speaker in 1994, 2006), [[John Sulston]] (1995), [[Manfred Eigen]] (1999), [[Gerald Edelman]] (2000), [[Sydney Brenner]] (2003), [[Kurt Wüthrich]] (2006), [[Robert Huber]] (2006) and [[Michael Levitt]] (2015).&lt;ref name=about-ismb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neshich2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neshich|first=Goran|author2=Bourne, Philip E. |author3=Brunak, Søren |title=ISMB 2006|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=1 January 2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e11|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020011|pmid=16758006|pmc=1378106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ismb2015keynotes&gt;{{cite web|title=Keynotes|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015-program/ismbeccb2015-keynotes|work=ISMB/ECCB 2015|publisher=ISCB|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, ISMB runs on a budget in excess of $1.5M and, in terms of proceeds, brings in four times that of the other ISCB conferences (ISCB-Latin America, [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Bioinformatics Conference|ISCB-Africa]], ISCB-Asia, Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference, [[CSHALS]] and the Great Lakes Bioinformatics Conference) combined.&lt;ref name="Rost2012" /&gt; Standard registration fees (as of 2013) are around $1,000 for academics who are ISCB members ($1,350 for non-members), with lower rates for students and higher rates for corporate delegates respectively. Discounts are provided for early registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGISTER|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-registration#registrationfee|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite events===
Pre-conference tutorials have played an important role in ISMB since the first conference.&lt;ref name="Linial2008" /&gt; Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to [[genetic algorithms]], [[neural networks]], [[artificial intelligence|AI]] for molecular biologists and [[molecular biology]] for computer scientists.&lt;ref name="Searls1994" /&gt; Tutorials on computational [[mass spectrometry]]-based [[proteomics]] and [[ENCODE]] data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=iscbeccb2013-tutorials&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutorials|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-tutorials|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As attendance at ISMB grew in the late 1990s, several satellite meetings and special interest group (SIG) meetings formed alongside the main conference. SIG meetings are held over one or two days before the main conference and focus on a specific topic, allowing more detailed discussion than there would be time for in the main conference.&lt;ref name=ismbeccb2013-sigs&gt;{{cite web|title=SIGs &amp; Satellite Meetings|url=http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013-program/ismbeccb2013-satellite-meetings|work=ISMB/ECCB 2013|publisher=[[International Society for Computational Biology|ISCB]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable SIG meetings include the [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC), which has been held annually since 2000&lt;ref name=bosc&gt;{{cite web|title=BOSC - Open Bioinformatics Foundation|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Past_BOSC_conferences |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bio-Ontologies, which has been held annually since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-last1=Bodenreider|author-first1=Olivier|author-last2=Stevens|author-first2=Robert|title=Bio-ontologies: current trends and future directions|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=256–274|doi=10.1093/bib/bbl027|pmid=16899495|pmc=1847325|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite meetings are usually two days long and are held in conjunction with ISMB. The 12th CAMDA conference and the 9th 3DSIG meeting were held as satellite meetings of ISMB/ECCB 2013.&lt;ref name=3dsig-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=3DSIG 2013 - Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biophysics, Berlin 2013|url=http://bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca/3dsig13/|work=3DSIG 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=camda-2013&gt;{{cite web|title=CAMDA 2013 Conference - CAMDA 2013|url=http://dokuwiki.bioinf.jku.at/doku.php|work=CAMDA 2013|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">The '''International Medical Education Directory''' ('''IMED''') was a public database of worldwide [[medical schools]]. The IMED was published as a joint collaboration of the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) and the [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information available in IMED was derived from data collected by the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) throughout its history of evaluating the medical education credentials of international medical graduates. Using these data as a starting point, [[Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research]] (FAIMER) began developing ''IMED'' in 2001 and made it publicly available in April 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2014, IMED was merged with the [[Avicenna Directories|Avicenna Directory]] to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faimer.org/resources/world-directory.html|title=FAIMER {{!}} World Directory of Medical Schools|website=www.faimer.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Directory is now the definitive list of medical schools in the world, as IMED and [[Avicenna Directories|Avicenna]] were discontinued in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faimer.org/news/2015/04/international-medical-education-directory-imed-discontinued-mid-2015/|title=International Medical Education Directory (IMED) To Be Discontinued by Mid-2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.faimer.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''J.F. Schouten School for User System Interaction''' is a research institute of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] dedicated to user interaction with man-made systems, including [[Human Computer Interaction]]. 

The institute is named after the Dutch physician Prof.dr. [[Jan Frederik Schouten]] (1910-1980), who was Professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology from 1958 to 1978 to &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuencyclopedie.nl/index.php?title=Schouten_J.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5900">The '''Modern Architectural Research Group''', or '''MARS Group''', was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[architecture|architectural]] think tank founded in 1933 by several prominent architects and architectural critics of the time involved in the British [[International style (architecture)|modernist movement]]. The MARS Group came after several previous but unsuccessful attempts at creating an organization to support modernist architects in Britain such as those that had been formed on continental Europe, like the Union des Artistes Modernes in [[France]].  

The group first formed when [[Sigfried Giedion]] of the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] asked [[Morton Shand]] to assemble a group that would represent Britain at their events.  Shand, along with [[Wells Coates]], chose [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[F. R. S. Yorke]] as the founding members.  They were also joined by a few members of [[Tecton]], another architectural group, by [[Ove Arup]] and by [[John Betjeman]], a poet and contributor to ''[[Architectural Review]]''. The group's greatest success came in 1938 with a show at the New Burlington Galleries, but it also unfortunately left them in debt. The MARS group proposed a radical plan for the redevelopment of postwar London, the details of which were published the Architectural Review in 1942.&lt;ref name="odnb01"&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/60598, accessed 27 Dec 2008. Charlotte Benton. 2004. 'Korn, Arthur (1891–1978)’ in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height there were about 58 members in the group.The group itself began to lose steam along with the movement and many members left as a result of creative differences.  The group finally disbanded in 1957.

==The MARS Plan for London==

:"The plan for London issued by the Mars Group (the English wing of CIAM) and prepared by their Town Planning Committee was a marked contrast to anything that had gone before and, one might add, anything produced subsequently. It was frankly [[Utopian]] and Socialistic in concept."  Dennis Sharp, 1971.&lt;ref name="sharp01"/&gt;

The plan was devised by what has been described as a 'small and devoted' group, under the town planning sub committee of MARS, chaired by [[Arthur Korn (architect)|Arthur Korn]], and including Arthur Ling, [[Maxwell Fry]], the latter who worked as secretary, and fellow Jewish emigre, engineer [[Felix Samuely]].&lt;ref name="fry01"&gt;Pp 165-6 ''in'' Fry  E. M. 1971, ' The MARS Group plan of London ''in'' Arthur Korn, [[Maxwell Fry]], [[Dennis Sharp]]. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London. ''Perspecta, Vol. 13 (1971), pp. 163-173''&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Korn is described as having been 'the main spring of the enterprise'  and as providing an 'infectious enthusiasm' that drove the project forward.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gold01"&gt;P.88 ''in'' Gold J. R. 2000. 'Towards the functional city? MARS, CIAM and the London plans 1933-42. ''In'' Thomas Deckker, ''The Modern City Revisited''. Oxford: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by the Soviet urbanist Miliutin, the plan essentially conceived the centre of the city remaining much the same but with a series of linear forms or tongues extending from the Thames, described as like a herring bone, composed of social units and based around the rail network.&lt;ref name="sharp01"&gt;P. 167 ''in'' Sharp S. 1971. 'Concept and Interpretation The aims and principles of the MARS plan for London'. ''In ''Arthur Korn, Maxwell Fry, Dennis Sharp. 1971. The M.A.R.S. Plan for London. ''Perspecta, Vol. 13 (1971), pp. 163-173''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moughtin01"&gt;p122 ''in'' Moughtin J.C. and Shirley P. 1995. ''Urban Design: Green Dimensions''. Oxford: Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Habitation in each social unit was to consist mainly of flats and owed much to  [[Le Corbusier]]'s notion of the [[Unite d'Habitation|''unite d'habitation'']].&lt;ref name="moughtin01"/&gt; Described as 'unworkable' by [[Dennis Sharp]], in his 1971 essay on the plan, he concedes it 'was not a concrete scheme but a concept that would by its very nature produce interpretations'.&lt;ref name="sharp01"/&gt; Marmaras and Sutcliffe argue the plan 'saw London almost entirely in terms of movement ...[being] presented primarily as a centre of exchange and communications'.&lt;ref name="marmaras01"&gt;Pp. 434-40 ''in'' Marmaras E. and Sutcliffe A. 1994. Planning for post-war London: the three independent plans, 1942-3. ''In'' ''Planning Perspectives, 9, (1994) 431-453''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moughtin and Shirley (1995) note that one of the aims of the plan was to promote public transport, where with railways integral to planning, the 'need for cars will be few'. .&lt;ref name="moughtin01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="korn01"&gt;A. Korn and F.J. Samuely, A master plan for London,'' Architectural Review, 91, January (1942). 143–150.''&lt;/ref&gt; Korn's initial chairmanship of the plan was interrupted by his 18-month internment in the [[Isle of Man]] from 1939,  being a German citizen, during which period work on the plan fizzled out.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt; On his release, in 1941, work recommenced, an exhibition of the plan was organised and a 'description and analysis' was published under the joint authorship of Arthur Korn and Felix Samuely in the Architectural Association journal in 1942.&lt;ref name="fry01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marmaras01"/&gt;

'''Management of dyslexia''' depends on a multiple of variables; there is no one specific strategy or set of strategies which will work for all who have dyslexia. 

Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

Several [[special education]] approaches have been developed for students with dyslexia. [[Adaptive technology]], such as specialized computer software, has resulted in recent innovations helpful to many people with dyslexia.

One factor that characterises the field of dyslexia remediation is the stream of [[alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities]]. These controversial treatments include nutritional supplements, special diets, [[homeopathy]], and [[osteopathy]]/[[chiropractic]] manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Int J Lang Commun Disord |year=2008 |title= Survey of complementary and alternative therapies used by children with specific learning difficulties (dyslexia) |volume= 44 |author= Bull L |doi=10.1080/13682820802015643 |issue= 2 |pmid=18608596 |pages= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems and orthography==
[[File:Visual-dyslexia.jpg|thumb|290px|Corrective glasses are used to cure visual dyslexia]]
{{details|topic=Orthography|Orthographies and dyslexia}}
A [[writing system]] is a type of [[symbolic system]] used to represent elements or statements expressible in [[language]].
The [[orthography]] of a [[language]] specifies the correct way of using a specific [[writing system]] to write the language. Where more than one writing system is used for a language, for example for [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], there can be more than one orthography.

===Alphabetic orthography===
Most teaching is geared to remediating specific areas of weakness, such as addressing difficulties with phonetic decoding by providing phonics-based tutoring.  Some teaching is geared to specific reading skill areas, such as phonetic decoding; whereas other approaches are more comprehensive in scope, combining techniques to address basic skills along with strategies to improve comprehension and literary appreciation. Many programs are multisensory in design, meaning that instruction includes visual, auditory, and kinesthetic or tactile elements; as it is generally believed that such forms of instruction are more effective for dyslexic learners.&lt;ref name=Henry1998&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite claims of some programs to be "research based", there is very little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular approach to reading instruction as compared to another when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torgesen (2004) emphasized the importance of explicit instruction for remediation as well as the need for intensity that is completely different from regular classroom instruction.  To make gains in reading, students need highly structured, sequential interactive activities and close monitoring, directly connecting the known with the new, with sufficient time for practice of new skills to build automaticity and fluency. The size of the instructional group is also important, ideally between 1:1 and 1:3.&lt;ref&gt;Birsh, Judith R. (2005).  Research and reading disability. In Judith R. Birsh (Ed), "Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills" (pp. 16-17). Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. Baltimore, Maryland. {{ISBN|978-1-55766-676-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interventions in a Latin alphabet writing system==

There is little empirical or quantitative research supporting the use of any particular program for reading instruction when used with dyslexic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sed.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/40/3/171 |title=Orton-Gillingham and Orton-Gillingham Based Reading Instruction: A Review of the Literature -- Ritchey and Goeke 40 (3): 171 -- The Journal of Special Education |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor2007/&gt;

In 2007 the researchers Joseph Torgesen and Richard Wagner have shown that, when teaching children with reading disabilities, programs including systematic and explicit instruction in phoneme awareness and grapheme-phoneme correspondence are far more successful than programs that do not.

==Academic remediations==
With appropriate instruction, dyslexics can become skilled readers. Appropriate remedial instruction includes using:

* Direct, explicit and comprehensive instruction in the structure of language
* A systematic sequence for teaching individual skills
* Structured information from the simple to the complex
* Simultaneous multisensory approaches, including combinations of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities
* Interaction between student and teacher during instruction of new skills
* Reinforcement throughout the day of newly learned skills
* Integrated spelling and handwriting instruction sequence with reading instruction, so that they are mutually reinforcing
* Extended practice for each skill until the student overlearns the skill (see [[Overlearning]] and [[Automaticity]])
* Ongoing review of previously learned skills
* Careful pacing to avoid information overload
* Intensive instruction until reading, spelling and writing skills are at grade level.
* Repeated reading to help develop fluency and reading rate&lt;ref name="uhry"&gt;Uhry, Joanna Kellogg and Diana Brewster Clark (2004). Dyslexia: theory and practice of instruction. Pro-ed publishers. pp. 88-89. {{ISBN|1-4164-0115-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paired reading to help develop fluency and enhance comprehension.

==Classroom accommodations==
Although there are no treatments or quick cures for dyslexia there are many techniques that can be used to assist dyslexic students in the classroom while reading skills are being remediated. These include such things as:
* Oral testing
* Untimed tests
* Audiobooks
* Eliminate or reduce spelling tests
* Minimizing the need to read out loud &lt;ref&gt;Reid, Gavin. Dyslexia 2nd edition. New York: Continuum International.(2007).Pages 41-95&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allow students to record the Teacher explaining homework (for example on a Dictaphone) to ensure an accurate account of the homework is made.
* Accept dictated homework
* Reduce homework load
* Grade on content, not spelling nor handwriting
* Reduce copying tasks
* Avoid or reduce essay tests
* Providing teacher handouts to supplement the notes taken
* Using materials that are not visually overcrowded
* To increase motivation, giving assignments in areas in which the student has a strong interest, for example, sports stories, biographies of inventors or rock musicians, or fiction about teenage issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allkindsofminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use an appropriate layout, including a larger font size, larger line spacing (1.5) and a clear font - sans-serif fonts are usually recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html Dyslexia Style guide from the British Dyslexia Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224433/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/further-information/dyslexia-style-guide.html |date=2013-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Some dyslexic people are sensitive to the colour of the paper and may find off-white, pale green or pale purple paper can make reading easier. 
* Using appropriate font type and size.  It is suggested{{by whom|date=July 2011}} that [[Sassoon (typeface)|Sassoon]] and [[Comic Sans]] may be the easiest to read; [[Times New Roman]] may be one of the most difficult to read. The font should not be too small. There are several fonts and typefaces designed for dyslexia including ''Gill Dyslexic'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ Gill Dyslexic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924215435/http://www.pixelscript.net/gilldyslexic/ |date=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Read Regular'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readregular.com/english/regular.html Read Regular] typeface&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexia Readable]],  ''Sylexiad'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html Sylexiad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709074857/http://www.robsfonts.com/sylexhome.html |date=2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDyslexic]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.opendyslexic.org/ OpenDyslexic]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cadman'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://pjmiller.deviantart.com/art/Cadman-732272890 Cadman] &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dyslexie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664561/dyslexie-a-typeface-designed-to-help-dyslexics-read Dyslexie] font&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin writing system only). However, although dyslexics may prefer some of these special fonts, there is no evidence that any of the fonts nominally designed for dyslexics helps them read more easily or better,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s-e-o.org/which-font-is-best-for-dyslexic-users-the-science-reviewed/|title=Which Font is Best For Dyslexic Users? The Science Reviewed|website=S-E-O.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some make false claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigelowandholmes.typepad.com/bigelow-holmes/2014/11/typography-dyslexia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
[[Accessible publishing]] works to make reading easier for all who struggle with the standard one-size-fits-all method of book publishing. Accessible publishing works with publishers and  [[Print on Demand]] technology which allows the reader to choose how the books will be published. Available format variations include choosing the font size (from 11 point font  through to 28 point font), whether the font is bold, italic or regular, and choosing the amount of line spacing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Format/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a variety of special fonts being developed for dyslexia, eye tracking problems and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/making-reading-easier/ | work=The New York Times | title=Making Reading Easier | first=Dwight | last=Garner | date=2008-05-20 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some individuals with dyslexia report improved ease of reading with different fonts, these reports are anecdotal; there is little empirical evidence to support the use of "dyslexia fonts". 
Accessible publishers, such as ReadHowYouWant, also work to make books available in [[Braille]], [[e-books]], [[audiobook]]s and [[DAISY]].

New formats such as streamline text&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx What is streamline text?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233331/http://www.streamlinetext.com/WhatIsStreamlineTxt.aspx |date=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been developed that help dyslexic people to track (move from one line to the next) more fluently. These work by adding 'sign-posts' into the text to show where to go next.

Teachers are also using audiobooks as a way of teaching textbooks in an engaging way to those with dyslexia. In the UK, one of the biggest charities is [[Listening Books]], which offers members a streaming service over the internet. An Australian company, ReadHowYouWant is working to make all published books available in [[audiobook]] form.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readhowyouwant.com/Technology/overview.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the nonprofit [[Learning Ally]] offers the world's largest library of human-narrated audio textbooks, and a second organization,  [[Bookshare]], offers a wide selection of synthetic-read audiobooks. These audiobooks work well for individuals who have word reading accuracy and fluency difficulties (i.e. dyslexics).

Individuals with dyslexia require more practice to master skills in their areas of deficit. In the circumstances where typically developing children need 30 to 60 hours training, the number of hours that has resulted in optimistic conclusions concerning the remediation of dyslexia is between 80 and 100 hours, or less if the intervention is started sufficiently early. Only approximately 20% of adults with early reading difficulties have acquired fluent reading skills in adulthood.&lt;ref name=Lyytinen&gt;{{Cite book | author = Lyytinen, Heikki, Erskine, Jane, Aro, Mikko, Richardson, Ulla | contribution = Reading and reading disorders | editor-last = Hoff | editor-first = Erika | title = Blackwell Handbook of Language Development | pages = 454–474 | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4051-3253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fmri|Functional MRI]] ([[fMRI]]) studies have shown neurological changes in dyslexic children and adults who have used phonological interventions, with improved performance on tests of phonemic awareness and text decoding.&lt;ref name=ClinicalTrial&gt;{{cite journal | title=Neural Changes following Remediation in Adult Developmental Dyslexia (Clinical Study) | journal=Neuron | date=2004-10-28 | first1=Guinevere | last1=Eden |first2=Karen M. |last2=Jones |first3=Katherine |last3=Cappell |first4=Lynn |last4=Gareau |first5=Frank B. |last5=Wood |first6=Thomas A. |last6=Zeffiro |first7=Nicole A.E. |last7=Dietz |first8=John A. |last8=Agnew |first9=D.

A recent study has shown that the usage of an FM system drives neural plasticity in children with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hornickel J, Zecker S, Bradlow A, Kraus N |title=Assistive listening devices drive neuroplasticity in children with dyslexia|journal=[PNAS] |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1206628109|pmc=3478599}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FM system is a personal assistive listening device, consisting of a wireless microphone worn by the teacher, and a wireless receiver similar to a Bluetooth receiver worn on the ears by the pupil. Measurements of the brain’s response to speech sounds showed that the children who wore the device for one year responded more consistently to the very soft and rapidly changing elements of sounds that help distinguish one consonant from another (cat, bat, pat etc.). That improved stability was linked with reading improvement based on standardized measures of readability – which, as a long-term benefit, points to brain plasticity.

==National statutory provision and support structures==
{{details|topic=National statutory provision and support structures|:Category:Dyslexia support by country}}
Each country has adopted and developed a [[writing system]] of choice.
Each country has their own Statutes relating to the [[:Category:Education by country|provision of Education]], and special educational needs. The statutory provision framework of support in each country is usually complemented by many independent and voluntary support agencies providing more specialised information and support.

The concept of noise-based logic and its name was created by [[Laszlo B. Kish]]. In its foundation paper&lt;ref name =first/&gt;  it is noted that the idea was inspired by the stochasticity of [[brain]] signals and by the unconventional noise-based communication schemes, such as the [[Laszlo_B._Kish|Kish]] cypher.

==The noise-based logic space and hyperspace==
The logic values are represented by [[multi-dimensional]] "[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s" ([[orthogonal functions]]) and their [[Superposition principle|superposition]], where the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] are independent noises. By the proper combination (products or [[Intersection (set theory)|set-theoretical products]]) of basis-noises, which are called ''noise-bit'', a logic hyperspace can be constructed with  {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} number of [[dimension]]s, where ''N'' is the number of noise-bits. Thus ''N'' noise-bits in a single wire correspond to a system of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} classical bits that can express {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} different logic values. Independent realizations of a stochastic process of zero mean have zero [[cross-correlation]] with each other and with other stochastic processes of zero mean. Thus the basis noise vectors are orthogonal not only to each other but they and all the noise-based logic states (superpositions) are orthogonal also to any background noises in the hardware. Therefore, the noise-based logic concept is robust against background noises, which is a property that can potentially offer a high energy-efficiency.

==The types of signals used in noise-based logic==
In the paper,&lt;ref name =first/&gt; where noise-based logic was first introduced, generic stochastic-processes with zero mean were proposed and a system of orthogonal sinusoidal signals were also proposed as a deterministic-signal version of the logic system. The mathematical analysis about statistical errors and signal energy was limited to the cases of [[Gaussian process|Gaussian noises]] and superpositions as logic signals in the basic logic space and their products and superpositions of their products in the logic hyperspace (see also.&lt;ref name =second/&gt; In the subsequent brain logic scheme,&lt;ref name =third/&gt; the logic signals were (similarly to neural signals) unipolar spike sequences generated by a [[Poisson process]], and set-theoretical unifications (superpositions) and intersections (products) of different spike sequences. Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt;  and computation works,&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.

==The noise-based logic gates==
Noise-based logic [[Logic gate|gates]] can be classified according to the method the input identifies the logic value at the input. The first gates&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =second/&gt; analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the reference noises. The advantage of these is the robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates&lt;ref name =third/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with [[Bipolar signal|bipolar]] random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use [[Correlation function|correlator]]-based logic gates for an error-free signal.&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;

==Universality of noise-based logic==
All the noise-based logic schemes listed above have been proven universal.&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; The papers typically produce the [[Inverter (logic gate)|NOT]] and the [[AND gate|AND]] gates to prove universality, because having both of them is a satisfactory condition for the universality of a [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]].

==Computation by noise-based logic==
The string verification work&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the [[hash function]]. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; that the authors intuitively conclude that the ''[[intelligence]]'' of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer numbers can be produced with only 2''N'' operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper.&lt;ref name =second/&gt;

==Computer chip realization of noise-based logic==
Preliminary schemes have already been published&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.

'''Object conservation''' involves the [[Conservation-restoration|preservation]] of three-dimensional works of art. This type of [[conservator-restorer|conservator]] is differentiated from other specialists because they treat a broad range of objects and material types. This classification of material includes [[archaeological]], [[ethnographic]], [[historical]], [[sculpture]], [[decorative arts]], and [[contemporary art]].

==Archaeological conservation==
This type of conservator specializes in the preservation of artifacts that are excavated from a burial environment. These environments can be in a terrestrial setting or underwater. Archaeological conservators work closely with archaeologists to identify what the conservation needs of an excavation site are and assist in setting up field laboratories.

[[File:Ovules in flower.png|thumb|Location of ovules inside a ''[[Helleborus foetidus]]'' flower]]
In [[seed plant]]s, the '''ovule''' is the structure that gives rise to and contains the female reproductive cells. It consists of three parts: The '''integument(s)''', forming its outer layer(s), the '''nucellus''' (or remnant of the [[sporangium|megasporangium]]), and the female [[gametophyte]] (formed from a haploid [[megaspore]]) in its center. The female gametophyte — specifically termed a ''megagametophyte''— is also called the '''embryo sac''' in [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]]. The megagametophyte produces an [[ovum|egg cell]] (or several in some groups) for the purpose of [[fertilization]].

== Location within the plant ==
In [[flowering plants]], the ovule is located inside the portion of the [[flower]] called the [[gynoecium]]. The [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] of the gynoecium produces one or more ovules and ultimately becomes the [[fruit]] wall. Ovules are attached to the placenta in the ovary through a stalk-like structure known as a '''funiculus''' (plural, funiculi). Different patterns of ovule attachment, or [[placentation]], can be found among plant species, these include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xVoDxupADJMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Kotpal, Tyagi, Bendre, &amp; Pande. Concepts of Biology XI]. Rastogi Publications, 2nd ed. New Delhi 2007. {{ISBN|8171338968}}. Fig. 38 Types of placentation, page 2-127&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Apical placentation''': The placenta is at the apex (top) of the ovary. Simple or compound ovary.
*'''Axile placentation''': The ovary is divided into  radial segments, with placentas in separate [[locule]]s. Ventral sutures of carpels meet at the centre of the ovary. Placentae are along fused margins of carpels. Two or more carpels. (e.g. ''[[Hibiscus]]'', ''[[Citrus]]'', ''[[Solanum]]'')
*'''Basal placentation''': The placenta is at the base (bottom) of the ovary on a protrusion of the thalamus ([[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]). Simple or compound carpel, unilocular ovary. (e.g. ''[[Sonchus]]'', ''[[Helianthus]]'', [[Compositae]])
*'''Free-central placentation''': Derived from axile as partitions are absorbed, leaving ovules at the central axis. Compound unilocular ovary. (e.g. ''[[Stellaria]]'', ''[[Dianthus]]'')
*'''Marginal placentation''': Simplest type. There is only one elongated placenta on one side of the ovary, as ovules are attached at the fusion line of the carpel's margins . This is conspicuous in legumes. Simple carpel, unilocular ovary. (e.g. ''[[Pisum]]'')
*'''Parietal placentation''': Placentae on inner ovary wall within a non-sectioned ovary, corresponding to fused carpel margins. Two or more carpels, unilocular ovary. (e.g. ''[[Brassica]]'')
*'''Superficial''': Similar to axile, but placentae are on inner surfaces of multilocular ovary (e.g. ''[[Nymphaea]]'')

[[File:Ovule morphology anatropous.png|thumb|Ovule structure (anatropous) 1: nucleus 2: [[chalaza]] 3: funiculus 4: raphe]]
Ovule orientation may be '''anatropous''', such that when inverted the micropyle faces the placenta (this is the most common ovule orientation in flowering plants), '''amphitropous''', '''campylotropous''', or '''orthotropous'''.

In [[gymnosperm]]s such as conifers, ovules are borne on the surface of an ovuliferous (ovule-bearing) scale, usually within an ovulate [[conifer cone|cone]] (also called [[strobilus|megastrobilus]]). In some extinct plants (e.g. [[Pteridosperms]]), megasporangia and perhaps ovules were borne on the surface of leaves. In other extinct taxa, a cupule (a modified leaf or part of a leaf) surrounds the ovule (e.g. ''[[Caytonia]]'' or ''[[Glossopteris]]'').

== Ovule parts and development ==
[[File:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg|thumb|300px|Plant ovules: Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule (inside ovary) on right]]
[[File:Modellreihe von Grundformen der Samenanlagen -Brendel Nr. 164-166-.jpg|thumb|Models of different ovules, [[Botanical Museum Greifswald]]]]
The ovule appears to be a megasporangium with integuments surrounding it. Ovules are initially composed of [[diploid]] maternal tissue, which includes a megasporocyte (a cell that will undergo meiosis to produce megaspores). Megaspores remain inside the ovule and divide by mitosis to produce the [[haploid]] female gametophyte or megagametophyte, which also remains inside the ovule. The remnants of the megasporangium tissue (the nucellus) surround the megagametophyte. Megagametophytes produce archegonia (lost in some groups such as flowering plants), which produce egg cells. After fertilization, the ovule contains a diploid [[zygote]] and then, after cell division begins, an [[embryo]] of the next [[sporophyte]] generation. In flowering plants, a second sperm nucleus fuses with other nuclei in the megagametophyte forming a typically polyploid (often triploid) [[endosperm]] tissue, which serves as nourishment for the young sporophyte.

=== Integuments, micropyle and chalaza ===
An [[integument]] is a protective cell layer surrounding the ovule. Gymnosperms typically have one integument (unitegmic) while angiosperms typically have two (bitegmic). The evolutionary origin of the inner integument (which is integral to the formation of ovules from megasporangia) has been proposed to be by enclosure of a megasporangium by sterile branches (telomes).&lt;ref&gt;Herr, J.M. Jr., 1995. The origin of the ovule. Am. J. Bot. 82(4):547-64&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elkinsia'', a preovulate taxon, has a lobed structure fused to the lower third of the megasporangium, with the lobes extending upwards in a ring around the megasporangium. This might, through fusion between lobes and between the structure and the megasporangium, have produced an integument.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book |first1=W.N. |last1=Stewart |first2=G.W. |last2=Rothwell |date=1993 |title=Paleobotany and the evolution of plants |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521382947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the second or outer integument has been an area of active contention for some time. The cupules of some extinct taxa have been suggested as the origin of the outer integument. A few angiosperms produce vascular tissue in the outer integument, the orientation of which suggests that the outer surface is morphologically abaxial. This suggests that cupules of the kind produced by the [[Caytoniales]] or [[Glossopteris|Glossopteridales]] may have evolved into the outer integument of angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;Frohlich and Chase, 2007. After a dozen years of progress, the origin of angiosperms is still a great mystery. Nature 450:1184-1189 (20 December 2007) | {{doi|10.1038/nature06393}};&lt;/ref&gt;

The integuments develop into the seed coat when the ovule matures after fertilization.

The integuments do not enclose the nucellus completely but retain an opening at the apex referred to as the '''[[wiktionary:Micropyle|micropyle]]'''. The micropyle opening allows the pollen (a male [[gametophyte]]) to enter the ovule for fertilization. In gymnosperms (e.g., conifers), the pollen is drawn into the ovule on a drop of fluid that exudes out of the micropyle, the so-called pollination drop mechanism.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt; Subsequently, the micropyle closes. In angiosperms, only a pollen tube enters the micropyle. During [[germination]], the [[seedling]]'s [[radicle]] emerges through the micropyle.

Located opposite from the micropyle is the [[chalaza]] where the nucellus is joined to the integuments. Nutrients from the plant travel through the [[phloem]] of the vascular system to the funiculus and outer integument and from there [[apoplast]]ically and [[symplast]]ically through the chalaza to the nucellus inside the ovule. In chalazogamous plants, the pollen tubes enter the ovule through the chalaza instead of the micropyle opening.

=== Nucellus, megaspore and perisperm ===
The '''nucellus''' (plural: nucelli) is part of the inner structure of the ovule, forming a layer of diploid ([[sporophyte|sporophytic]]) cells immediately inside the integuments. It is structurally and functionally equivalent to the [[sporangium|megasporangium]]. In immature ovules, the nucellus contains a megasporocyte (megaspore mother cell), which undergoes [[sporogenesis]] via [[meiosis]]. In the [[megaspore mother cell|megasporocyte]] of ''Arabidopsis thaliana'', [[meiosis]] depends on the expression of [[gene]]s that facilitate [[DNA repair]] and [[homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="pmid22077663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seeliger K, Dukowic-Schulze S, Wurz-Wildersinn R, Pacher M, Puchta H |title=BRCA2 is a mediator of RAD51- and DMC1-facilitated homologous recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana |journal=New Phytol. |volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=364–75 |year=2012 |pmid=22077663 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03947.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In gymnosperms, three of the four [[haploid]] spores produced in meiosis typically degenerate, leaving one surviving megaspore inside the nucellus. Among angiosperms, however, a wide range of variation exists in what happens next. The number (and position) of surviving megaspores, the total number of cell divisions, whether nuclear fusions occur, and the final number, position and ploidy of the cells or nuclei all vary. A common pattern of embryo sac development (the ''Polygonum'' type maturation pattern) includes a single functional megaspore followed by three rounds of mitosis. In some cases, however, two megaspores survive (for example, in ''Allium'' and ''Endymion''). In some cases all four megaspores survive, for example in the ''Fritillaria'' type of development (illustrated by ''Lilium'' in the figure) there is no separation of the megaspores following meiosis, then the nuclei fuse to form a triploid nucleus and a haploid nucleus. The subsequent arrangement of cells is similar to the ''Polygonum'' pattern, but the ploidy of the nuclei is different.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Gifford, E.M. |author2=Foster, A.S. |year=1989  |title=Morphology and evolution of vascular plants |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fertilization, the nucellus may develop into the '''perisperm''' that feeds the embryo. In some plants, the diploid tissue of the nucellus can give rise to the embryo within the seed through a mechanism of [[asexual reproduction]] called [[nucellar embryony]].

=== Megagametophyte ===
[[File:Embryosack Polygonum Lilium.png|thumb|500 px|Megagametophyte formation of the genera ''Polygonum'' and ''Lilium''. Triploid nuclei are shown as ellipses with three white dots. The first three columns show the meiosis of the megaspore, followed by 1-2 mitoses.]]
[[File:Embryosac-en.svg|300px|thumb|Ovule with megagametophyte: egg cell (yellow), synergids (orange), central cell with two polar nuclei (bright green), and antipodals (dark green)]]
The haploid megaspore inside the nucellus gives rise to the female [[gametophyte]], called the '''megagametophyte'''.

In gymnosperms, the megagametophyte consists of around 2000 nuclei and forms [[archegonium|archegonia]], which produce '''egg cells''' for fertilization.

In flowering plants, the megagametophyte (also referred to as the '''embryo sac''') is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei. This type of megagametophyte develops from the megaspore through three rounds of [[mitosis|mitotic]] divisions. The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell, with two '''synergid cells''' by its side that are involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube. Three '''antipodal cells''' form on the opposite (chalazal) end of the ovule and later degenerate. The large '''central cell''' of the embryo sac contains two '''polar nuclei'''.

=== Zygote, embryo and endosperm ===
The pollen tube releases two [[sperm]] nuclei into the ovule. In gymnosperms, [[fertilization]] occurs within the archegonia produced by the female gametophyte. While it is possible that several egg cells are present and fertilized, typically only one [[zygote]] will develop into a mature [[embryo]] as the resources within the seed are limited. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

In flowering plants, one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote, the other fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to the polyploid (typically triploid) [[endosperm]]. This double fertilization is unique to flowering plants, although in some other groups the second sperm cell does fuse with another cell in the megagametophyte to produce a second embryo. The plant stores nutrients such as [[starch]], [[protein]]s, and [[oil]]s in the endosperm as a food source for the developing embryo and seedling, serving a similar function to the [[yolk]] of animal eggs. The endosperm is also called the [[albumen]] of the seed. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Embryos may be described by a number of terms including '''Linear''' (embryos have axile placentation and are longer than broad), or '''rudimentary''' (embryos are basal in which the embryo is tiny in relation to the endosperm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seedbiology.de/evolution2.asp The Seed Biology Place:Structural seed types based on comparative internal morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of gametophytes ===
Megagametophytes of flowering plants may be described according to the number of megaspores developing, as either '''monosporic''', '''bisporic''', or '''[[tetraspore|tetrasporic]]'''. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''Philosophy For All (PFA)''' is a [[London]]-based association of people interested in philosophy. It was founded in 1998. It aims to bridge the gap between professional and amateur philosophers, by holding talks, lectures and debates. Many of its events are held in pubs; and others in adult education colleges.

According to its website, its aims are: "to encourage philosophical debate between professional and non-professional philosophers in a non-technical way; to provide a forum for an active exchange of ideas and information; to give guidance and information concerning courses as well as relevant literature in philosophy; to inspire those interested in philosophy to develop their interest further."

It is believed to be the largest philosophy organisation in London in terms of membership. Its bi-annual Public Lecture is often attended by more than 100 people and its monthly Kant's Cave talks, which are often given by notable academics, regularly draw 70 or so people to a room above a pub in [[Euston Road|Euston]].

During the early years of the new millennium it organised a series of Round Table debates in which four leading philosophers and an audience of around 150 people would debate issues such as the relationship between science and philosophy.

The PFA Public Lectures are a series of lectures held every six months or so (from around 2003 onwards) in which a well-known thinker gives a lecture and then holds a lengthy discussion session with the audience. The lectures give members of the public the opportunity to question  and discuss with internationally-known philosophers who have included as [[Simon Blackburn]], [[Antony Flew]], [[Piers Benn]], [[Jonathan Glover]], [[Anthony Grayling]], [[Ted Honderich]], [[Moshe Machover]], [[Nicholas Maxwell]], [[Mary Margaret McCabe]], [[Mary Midgley]], [[David Papineau]], [[Janet Radcliffe Richards]], [[Barry C. Smith]], [[Jonathan Wolff (philosopher)|Jonathan Wolff]], [[Raymond Tallis]], and [[Colin Wilson]].

Other regular monthly Philosophy For All events include a philosophy film club, seminars on important philosophical texts and regular Philosophical Walks in the countryside around London.

==PFA Fargo-Moorhead==
Since 2003, Philosophy For All has had a US chapter based in the twin cities of Fargo and Moorhead. The chapter was founded by Dr Mark Chekola, and meets monthly at the [[Plains Art Museum]] in Fargo.  It has a Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Philosophy-For-All-Fargo-Moorhead/879933445356607

''Rapid serial visual presentation'' is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm requires participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are placed inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items known as distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.

==Overview==
There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds. A person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one. The first number which is an important target, would be caught by the person, however, the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed. RSVP asks the question, What would reading be like if there were no eye movements? A text is delivered at a spot on the screen, like a series of flash cards. The user can set how long each card is to be displayed. The readers are liberated from having to decide how much time to spend on each word because that is set in advance, and saccades, regressive eye movements, line sweeps, and page turning have been eliminated. A reader can fully concentrate on comprehending the text as it flashes through, however, with longer texts the reading experience is found to be monotonous and exhausting. There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception. The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times. With the attentional blink, the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend, interpret, and store the information properly. The human brain is capable of processing complex tasks, but it has restrictions. The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information. An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag, but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag.  The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target.

==History==

Potter (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.2.5.509| title = Short-term conceptual memory for pictures| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 509–522| year = 1976| last1 = Potter | first1 = M. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the amount people who are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli. Potter had participants search for the RSVP series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target. This was depicted before the appearance of the RSVP series. Results showed that participants performed well on this task. Here, the RSVP rate was eight items per second; however, participants were still able to accurately find the target on 75% of the trials. Performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described. Each picture was acknowledged within 125 milliseconds. However, Potter &amp; Levy (1969) found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the RSVP sequence. The results showed that the participants’ performance accurately scored 10% in the task when the RSVP rate was eight items per second.

Sperling and colleagues  examined the RSVP paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention (e.g., Reeves &amp; Sperling, 1986; Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.180| pmid = 3714927| title = Attention gating in short-term visual memory| journal = Psychological Review| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 180–206| year = 1986| last1 = Reeves | first1 = A. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=G|author2=Weichselgartner, E. |title=Episodic theory of the dynamics of spatial attention|journal=Psychological Review|year=1995|volume=102|pages=503–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004). Sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two RSVP series were presented altogether. There was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point. One series contained letters and the other series contained numbers. The object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter. Results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around 400 milliseconds after the cue. They concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one RSVP series. Participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter. Results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around 400 milliseconds after the letter was presented. No spatial shift of attention was required. Participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item.

Broadbent and Broadbent (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03210498| title = From detection to identification: Response to multiple targets in rapid serial visual presentation| journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 105–13| year = 1987| last1 = Broadbent | first1 = D.

P. | pmid=3627930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discovered the attentional blink when they used a rapid serial visual presentation task to look at the recognition of multiple target words. Results showed that following the presence of a target, attentional processing is restricted and people can’t report the items that came after the target, however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness. This concludes that when two targets are shown within 500 milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors, the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen.

[[Inattentional blindness]] as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation. Rees, Russell, Frith, and Driver (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5449.2504| pmid = 10617465| title = Inattentional Blindness Versus Inattentional Amnesia for Fixated but Ignored Words| journal = Science| volume = 286| issue = 5449| pages = 2504–7| year = 1999| last1 = Rees | first1 = G.| last2 = Russell| first2 = C| last3 = Frith| first3 = C.

Participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed. They found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing.

==Modes==

There are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Robert|title=Rapid Serial Visual Presentation: Design for Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447150855|author2=Witkowski, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modes is the static mode. Here, the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving. The other mode, the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially, move about the display and then disappear.

===Static mode===
The pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations.  Pictures are shown one by one at the same rate. Here, participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds. This is an advantage of this static mode. A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen.  The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300-400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen. The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: steady gaze, search to steady and visual search.

===Moving modes===
We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane. These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth. The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world. This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects. The moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: diagonal, stream and ring.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Advantages over conventional reading==
The unique method used by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/571985.572014| chapter = Web ''Thumb''| title = Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02| pages = 205| year = 2002| last1 = Wobbrock | first1 = J. O. | last2 = Forlizzi | first2 = J. | last3 = Hudson | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Myers | first4 = B. A. | isbn = 1581134886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45756-9_18| chapter = Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation| title = Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices| volume = 2411| pages = 225| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2002| last1 = Öquist | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-44189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by about 20% versus display at 250 WPM, from a score of 74.6 to 52.1, resulting in an effective 82% increase in words comprehended per minute, assuming the scoring is linear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D. G.| last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. A.| last3 = Freeman | first3 = J.| last4 = Su | first4 = M.| last5 = Berger | first5 = T. D.| last6 = Majaj | first6 = N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and limitations==

Several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation. The RSVP can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand. The memory load for each individual differs and can be high, because using RSVP, more attention is needed. Also, RSVP allows us to miss vital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 3672124
| year = 1987

| last2 = Sperling
| first2 = G
 | doi=10.1126/science.3672124
}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP also often results with [[repetition blindness]] during use. When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other disadvantages include [[attentional blink]], in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence, {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as [[temporal masking]], causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Web browsing on small-screen devices===

Using RSVP-based browsers offers a space–time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDAs. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like 'Where am I', 'Where can I usefully go', 'Where have I been' and 'How do I get back to X', need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007790200024| title = RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices| journal = Personal and Ubiquitous Computing| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 245–252| year = 2002| last1 = De Bruijn | first1 = O.| last2 = Spence | first2 = R.| last3 = Chong | first3 = M. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.

===Peripheral reading===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D.

===Adolescent sexual offenders===
Limited existing previous research by Beech et al. suggests that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink.  A stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  However, this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1079063208328677| title = Applying Rapid Serial Visual Presentation to Adolescent Sexual Offenders: Attentional Bias as a Measure of Deviant Sexual Interest?| journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 135–148| year = 2009| last1 = Crooks | first1 = V.

[[Image:RostamMournsSohrab.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Persian language|Persian]] manuscript painting:Rustam laments for Suhrab]]

The tragedy of '''  Rostam and Sohrab''' forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. It tells the tragic story of the heroes [[Rostam]] and his son, [[Sohrab]].

==Plot==
Rostam lived in [[Sistan]], [[Iran]] (also known as [[Persia]]), hero and one of the favorites of King [[Kay Kāvus|Kaykavous]]. Once, following the traces of his lost horse, he enters the kingdom of [[Samangan]] where he becomes the guest of the king during the search for his horse. There, Rostam meets princess [[Tahmina]]. She admires Rostam and knows of his reputation. She goes into his room at night and asks if he will give her a child and in return, she will bring his horse. Rostam leaves after he impregnates Tahmina and his horse is returned. Before he leaves, he gives her two tokens. If she has a girl, she is to take the jewel and plait it in the girl's hair. If she has a boy, she is to take the seal and bind it on the boy's arm. Nine months later, she bears his child—a son, whom she later names Sohrab. Years go by before Rostam and Sohrab meet. Finally, a new war between [[Persia]] and [[Turan]] is on the horizon. The two armies face each other and prepare for the imminent battle. By then, Sohrab has become known as the best fighter of Turan army. But Rostam's legend precedes him and the Turan army cowers before the hero. No one else dares to fight Rostam, so Sohrab is sent to wrestle with the legendary Khurasaan hero. Though Sohrab knows his father's name, he is unaware that the man before him is Rostam. On the battlefield, Rostam and Sohrab fight for what seems like an eternity, neither knowing the true name of his opponent.

After a very long and heavy bout of wrestling, Rostam breaks Sohrab's back and stabs him. Sohrab, dying, tells Rostam that his father will avenge his death and only then do they realize their identities. Sohrab produces the necklace that Rostam once gave Tahmina, who gave it to her son to keep him safe during the war. Rostam grieves heavily but cannot save his son. When she finds out her son is dead, Tahmina burns Sohrab's house and gives away all his riches. Then "the breath departed from out her body, and her spirit went forth after Sohrab her son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Ferdowsi/kings.8.rustemsohrab.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Epic of Kings by Ferdowsi|author=|date=|website=classics.mit.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rudder ratio''' refers to a value that is monitored by the computerized [[flight control system]]s in modern [[aircraft]]. The ratio relates the  aircraft airspeed to the [[rudder]] deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently [[Flight dynamics|yaw]], or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash.

The '''Sea Mammal Research Unit''' (SMRU) is a [[marine science]] research organisation in [[Fife]], Scotland. It provides the UK's main science capability in the field of [[marine mammal]] biology. It is located at the [[Gatty Marine Laboratory]], part of the [[University of St Andrews]]. It was established in 1978, when the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] merged its Seals Research Division and Whale Research Unit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/documents/SMRU_Scientific_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's current strategic science priorities include evaluating the status of marine mammal populations; investigating the importance of marine mammals as components of [[marine ecosystem]]s; determining the dynamics of marine mammal populations; studying marine mammal social structure and communication; providing the technological basis for observing free-ranging marine mammals and their environment. SMRU also uses the popularity of marine mammals to improve public knowledge about the [[marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=408&lt;/ref&gt;

SMRU's activities address the requirements for information about marine mammals identified in the UK and Scottish Sustainable Development and Biodiversity Strategies and the Strategy for Scotland’s Coast and Inshore Waters. It is also relevant to the Joint UK Response to the Review of Marine Nature Conservation, the EU Marine Strategy and the UK Small Cetacean Bycatch Response Strategy.

SMRU is an independent NERC collaborative centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/collaborative/smru.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The funding it receives from NERC is mainly to support the [[Conservation of Seals Act 1970]]. SMRU focuses over half of its research effort on [[cetaceans]]. In agreement with NERC, SMRU raises the remainder of its funding from other sources. These include the [[European Union]], [[Defra]], [[Scottish Government]] and UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. It also develops and supplies instrumentation to the science community.

SMRU Consulting Ltd (Europe)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smruconsulting.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 2006 as the commercial arm of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews and provides consultancy services and advice on marine environmental issues. They have offices in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.

Notable SMRU Consulting projects includes Marine Mammal Mitigation on the world's first commercial tidal device at Strangford Loch&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seageneration.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of PAMBuoy, now Decimus - run by St Andrews Instrumentation Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sa-instrumentation.com//&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1st June 2016, a dead Minke whale washed ashore on the West Sands beach of St. Andrews, near to the SMRU, and was discovered by a dog walker that evening. During low-tide on the 2nd June, staff and students from the SMRU, along with the Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme, jointly conducted a necropsy of the whale in view of the public. Noting signature abrasions on the tailstock, and excessive fluid in the lungs, they concluded that the animal had been caught in a fishing trawler's lines, and was drowned by the dragging.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Strandings/posts/1015236731900447&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13268">In [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]] a '''string rewriting system''' ('''SRS'''), historically called a '''semi-[[Axel Thue|Thue]] system''', is a [[rewriting]] system over [[String (computer science)|strings]] from a (usually [[Finite set|finite]]) [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Given a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; between fixed strings over the alphabet, called '''rewrite rules''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;s\rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;, an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as [[substring]]s, that is &lt;math&gt;usv\rightarrow utv&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are strings.

The notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the [[presentation of a monoid]]. Thus they constitute a natural framework for solving the [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] for monoids and groups.

An SRS can be defined directly as an [[abstract rewriting system]]. It can also be seen as a restricted kind of a [[term rewriting]] system. As a formalism, string rewriting systems are [[Turing complete]]. The semi-Thue name comes from the Norwegian mathematician [[Axel Thue]], who introduced systematic treatment of string rewriting systems in a 1914 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Thue introduced this notion hoping to solve the word problem for finitely presented semigroups. It wasn't until 1947 the problem was shown to be [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]&amp;mdash; this result was obtained independently by [[Emil Post]] and [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|A. A. Markov Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Abramsky et al. p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salomaa et al., p.444&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A '''string rewriting system''' or '''semi-Thue system''' is a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; where  
* {{math|&amp;Sigma;}} is an alphabet, usually assumed finite.&lt;ref&gt;In Book and Otto a semi-Thue system is defined over a finite alphabet through most of the book, except chapter 7 when monoid presentation are introduced, when this assumption is quietly dropped.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; (* is the [[Kleene star]] here) are finite (possibly empty) strings on {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, sometimes called ''words'' in [[formal languages]]; we will simply call them strings here.
* {{mvar|R}} is a [[binary relation]] on strings from {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, i.e., &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*.&lt;/math&gt; Each element &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''(rewriting) rule'' and is usually written &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.  

If the relation {{mvar|R}} is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], then the system is called a '''Thue system'''.

The rewriting rules in {{mvar|R}} can be naturally extended to other strings in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by allowing substrings to be rewritten according to {{mvar|R}}. More formally, the '''one-step rewriting relation''' relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}} on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; for any strings &lt;math&gt;s, t \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;s \xrightarrow[R]{} t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s = xuy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t = xvy&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, the pair &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma^*, \xrightarrow[R]{})&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of an [[abstract rewriting system]]. Obviously {{mvar|R}} is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;. Some authors use a different notation for the arrow in &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;) in order to distinguish it from {{mvar|R}} itself (&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) because they later want to be able to drop the subscript and still avoid confusion between {{mvar|R}} and the one-step rewrite induced by {{mvar|R}}.

Clearly in a semi-Thue system we can form a (finite or infinite) sequence of strings produced by starting with an initial string &lt;math&gt;s_0 \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and repeatedly rewriting it by making one substring-replacement at a time: 

:&lt;math&gt;s_0 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_1 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_2 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

A zero-or-more-steps rewriting like this is captured by the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]). This is called the '''rewriting relation''' or '''reduction relation''' on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}}.

== Thue congruence ==

In general, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; of strings on an alphabet forms a [[free monoid]] together with the [[binary operation]] of [[string concatenation]] (denoted as &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and written multiplicatively by dropping the symbol). In a SRS, the reduction relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that &lt;math&gt;x\xrightarrow[R]{*} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;uxv\xrightarrow[R]{*} uyv&lt;/math&gt; for all strings &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a [[preorder]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\Sigma^*, \cdot, \xrightarrow[R]{*}\right)&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[Monoidal_category#Monoidal_preorders|monoidal preorder]].

Similarly, the [[reflexive transitive symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]), is a [[Congruence relation|congruence]], meaning it is an [[equivalence relation]] (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Thue congruence''' generated by {{mvar|R}}. In a Thue system, i.e. if {{mvar|R}} is symmetric, the rewrite relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the Thue congruence &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Factor monoid and monoid presentations ==
Since &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence, we can define the '''factor monoid''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R = \Sigma^*/\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[free monoid]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by the Thue congruence in the [[factor monoid|usual manner]]. If a monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R&lt;/math&gt;, then the semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[monoid presentation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {''a'', ''b''} with the rules { ''ab'' → ε, ''ba'' → ε }, where ε is the [[empty string]], is a presentation of the [[free group]] on one generator. If instead the rules are just { ''ab'' → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the [[bicyclic monoid]].

The importance of semi-Thue systems as presentation of monoids is made stronger by the following:

'''Theorem''': Every monoid has a presentation of the form &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt;, thus it may be always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, Theorem 7.1.7, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''set of generators''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called the set of '''defining relations''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. We can immediately classify monoids based on their presentation. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is called
* '''finitely generated''' if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is finite.
* '''finitely presented''' if both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are finite.

== The word problem for semi-Thue systems ==

The word problem for semi-Thue systems can be stated as follows: Given a semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;T:=(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; and two words (strings) &lt;math&gt;u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, can &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be transformed into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by applying rules from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;? This problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], i.e. there is no general algorithm for solving this problem. This even holds if we limit the input to finite systems{{Definition needed|date=January 2018}}.

Martin Davis offers the lay reader a two-page proof in his article "What is a Computation?" pp.&amp;nbsp;258–259 with commentary p.&amp;nbsp;257. Davis casts the proof in this manner: "Invent [a word problem] whose solution would lead to a solution to the [[halting problem]]."

== Connections with other notions ==

A semi-Thue system is also a [[term-rewriting]] system&amp;mdash;one that has [[monadic (arity)|monadic]] words (functions) ending in the same variable as the left- and right-hand side terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nachum Dershowitz]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud]]. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/dershowitz90rewrite.html Rewrite Systems] (1990) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a term rule &lt;math&gt;f_2(f_1(x)) \rightarrow g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the string rule &lt;math&gt;f_1f_2 \rightarrow g&lt;/math&gt;.

A semi-Thue system is also a special type of [[Post canonical system]], but every Post canonical system can also be reduced to an SRS. Both formalisms are [[Turing complete]], and thus equivalent to [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which are sometimes called ''semi-Thue grammars''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel I. A. Cohen|D.I.A. Cohen]], Introduction to Computer Theory, 2nd ed., Wiley-India, 2007, {{isbn|81-265-1334-9}}, p.572&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal grammar]] only differs from a semi-Thue system by the separation of the alphabet into [[terminal symbol|terminal]]s and non-terminals, and the fixation of a starting symbol amongst non-terminals. A minority of authors actually define a semi-Thue system as a triple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, A, R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''set of axioms''. Under this "generative" definition of semi-Thue system, an unrestricted grammar is just a semi-Thue system with a single axiom in which one partitions the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and makes the axiom a nonterminal.&lt;ref&gt;Dan A. Simovici, Richard L. Tenney, ''Theory of formal languages with applications'', World Scientific, 1999 {{isbn|981-02-3729-4}}, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The simple artifice of partitioning the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals is a powerful one; it allows the definition of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on what combination of terminals and non-terminals the rules contain. This was a crucial development in the theory of [[formal languages]].

==History and importance==
Semi-Thue systems were developed as part of a program to add additional constructs to [[logic]], so as to create systems such as [[propositional logic]], that would allow general mathematical theorems to be expressed in a [[formal language]], and then proven and verified in an automatic, mechanical fashion. The hope was that the act of [[theorem proving]] could then be reduced to a set of defined manipulations on a set of strings.  It was subsequently realized that semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which in turn are known to be isomorphic to [[Turing machine]]s. This method of research succeeded and now computers can be used to verify the proofs of mathematic and logical theorems.

At the suggestion of [[Alonzo Church]], [[Emil Post]] in a paper published in 1947, first proved "a certain Problem of Thue" to be unsolvable, what [[Martin Davis]] states as "...the first unsolvability proof for a problem from classical mathematics -- in this case the word problem for semigroups." (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;292)

Davis [ibid] asserts that the proof was offered independently by A. A. Markov (C. R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. (n.s.) 55(1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;583–586.

'''''The Battle for God: Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam''''' is a book by best-selling author [[Karen Armstrong]] published in 2000 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[HarperCollins]] which the ''[[New York Times]]'' described as "one of the most penetrating, readable, and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/holy-wars.html|date=Mar 26, 2000|title=Holy Wars|author=Chris Hedges|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle for God'' traces the history of the rise of [[fundamentalism]] in the three major [[monotheistic]] faiths. Armstrong's analysis starts with developments in [[Jewish fundamentalism|Judaism]] and traces it through the creation of fundamentalism in [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christianity]] to adoption of a similar approach to modernity in [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islam]].

==Synopsis==
Armstrong's central case rests on the confusion between ''mythos'' and ''logos'', using these in the technical sense suggested by [[Johannes Slok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Slok|title=Devotional Language. Translated by Henrik Mossin.|publisher= Danbury: Walter De Gruyter Incorporated|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth concerns "what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... Myth was not concerned with practical matters but with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]]. ''The Battle for God''; page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast "Logos was the rational, pragmatic and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world". In religion, logos appears in legal systems and practical action. By the eighteenth century, "people in Europe and America began to think that ''logos'' was the only means to truth and began to discount ''mythos'' as false and superstitious." Armstrong suggests that fundamentalists have turned their mythos into logos using the mindset of the modern scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|author=Darrel Morgan|title=The Battle for God|date=Aug 2000|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805015838/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|archivedate=2009-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the book, "The Old World and the New", compares the progression of the three monotheistic faiths between 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] discovered [[Americas|America]], and 1870, when "The Franco-Prussian War had revealed the hideous effects of modern weaponry, and there was a dawning realisation that science might also have a malignant dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong. ''The Battle for God''; page 136&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the way Jews and Muslims modernized during this period.

This leads to the modern period described in part two, “Fundamentalism”, when there was a growing adoption of a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of scripture in the United States, which eventually gave rise to ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a series of 12 volumes refuting modern ideas published shortly before and during the [[World War I]], of which 3 million copies  were distributed to every pastor, professor and theological student across America by the largesse of oil millionaires. Though this led to a distinctive ideology, it was not till the 1980s that it emerged as a political force.

In Judaism, the growth of [[Zionism]] was given its biggest boost by the [[Holocaust]] which led to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. Although many traditional Jews migrated there, the most conservative rejected the secular interpretation of Zionism and it wasn't until the emergence of [[Gush Emunim]] after the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1974 that fundamentalism emerged in Israel as a political force.

In Islam, fundamentalism did not emerge until modernization had taken hold, first in [[Egypt]] with the creation of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] by [[Hasan al-Banna]]. Armstrong traces the development of [[Sunni]] fundamentalism under [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Shia]] fundamentalism under [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

==Response==
After [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Karen Armstrong became one of the best selling authors in the US, as people attempted to understand the culture of men capable of carrying out such acts. One reviewer points out that "9-11 holds a fresh irony. While Osama and Co. wouldn't exist without the hegemony of Western secularism to rally against, their most effective attack on the Great Satan has breathed new life into our own fundamentalist tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C.

Farley|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2003_03_08.html|title=Review a day, The Battle for God|date=Mar 8, 2003|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106080233/http://www.powells.com/review/2003_03_08.html|archivedate=January 6, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History of Human Marriage''''' is an 1891 book about the history of human marriage by the Finnish philosopher [[Edvard Westermarck]]. The work is a classic in its field.

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
''The History of Human Marriage'' is an overview of the world history of human marriage.&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Westermarck argues that marriage is a social institution that rests on a biological foundation, and developed through a process in which human males came to live together with human females for sexual gratification, companionship, mutual economic aid, procreation, and the joint rearing of offspring.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37"&gt;[[#Bla07|Blankenhorn 2007]]. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly reception==
[[David Blankenhorn]] calls the book one of the best histories of human marriage, and considers it deservedly famous. He comments, however, that it leaves out a great deal of material while "skimming too quickly over too much."&lt;ref name="Blakenhornpp910" /&gt; Blankenhorn believes, however, that scholarship subsequent to Westermarck's has tended to support his conclusions.&lt;ref name="Blankenhornp37" /&gt;

The Finnish philosopher [[Jaakko Hintikka]] calls the work a monumental study and a classic in its field, but notes that it is now antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hin95|Hintikka 2005]]. p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB)''' is a research institute of the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]]. It is the national [[biotechnology]] research center and repository for all crops other than [[rice]], which is handled by the [[Philippine Rice Research Institute]].

It traces its roots to the [[Plant Breeding]] Division of the Department of [[Agronomy]], [[UPLB College of Agriculture|College of Agriculture]]. In 1975, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] elevated the Division to an Institute and provided additional funds for new facilities and expanded research initiatives.

==Core functions==
*Develop new and improved varieties of dryland crops
*Conduct studies in plant breeding and allied disciplines related to crop improvement
*Collect, introduce, preserve, and maintain germplasm of important and potentially useful agricultural and horticultural crops
*Assist other agencies in multiplying quality seeds and vegetative materials of recommended crop varieties
*Promote widescale use of IPB varieties and ensure that seeds are made available to small farmers

==Divisions and laboratories==
*Cereal Crops Division
*Feed and Industrial Crops Division
*Fruit and Ornamental Crops Division
*Legume Crops Division
*Vegetables and Special Crops Division
*Plant Pathology Laboratory
*Entomology Laboratory
*Plant Physiology Laboratory
*Extension Division
*Genetics Laboratory
*National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory
*Biochemistry Laboratory
*Plant Cell and Tissue Culture Laboratory
*National Seed Foundation

==Samples of IPB research==
*'''Papaya Ringspot Virus (PSRV)-Resistant'''
This variety is a genetically-enhanced [[papaya]] with PRSV resistance and delayed ripening trait. This trait will help reduce post-harvest losses due to spoilage which is another major problem to farmers. The first and second generation papayas had been previously subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicated that the lines contain a copy of the PRSV coat protein gene. A third generation papaya is currently under development.

*'''Fruit and Shoot Borer Resistant Eggplant'''
Initial crosses had already been made between Indian transgenic [[eggplants]] and selected Philippine varieties Mara, Mistisa, Dumaguete Long Purple, and Casino. The progeny of these crosses were then back-crossed with their Philippine variety parent in [[India]].

*'''Multiple Virus Resistant Tomato'''
The multiple virus resistant project aims to combine transgenic technologies for Cucumber Mosaic Virus with conventional resistance against Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV) to produce commercial tomato varieties. After introgression lines and appropriate controls were supplied by IPB partners, these tomato lines were screened to identify the genome regions that confer resistance against each local ToLCV. Reliable DNA markers are also being developed for each identified genome (introgression) region.

*'''Mutation Breeding of Philippine Avocado'''
Although engaged in [[genetic engineering]], the Institute also uses mutation breeding, which is an alternative method of improving crop varieties. Small portions of [[avocado]] plant tissue (embryos) were allowed to grow (embryogenic cultures) and to differentiate into somatic embryos and shoots. Some of the plant tissue cultures were subjected to gamma irradiation to facilitate mutation from the regenerated plant tissue cultures. During the irradiation, some cells were killed and those capable of regrowth were multiplied. The surviving cells were grown to produce somatic embryos and shoots. The shoots from irradiated and non-irradiated tissues were then treated in a [[test tube]] environment to promote root growth and prepare them for natural growth environment. The IPB is currently undertaking the rooting and potting out of the plantlets to enable maximum recovery. The established regenerated plants will then be transferred to the greenhouse, and finally to the field for further evaluation.
