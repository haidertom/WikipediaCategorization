The '''American Marketing Association''' ('''AMA''') is a [[professional association]] for [[marketing]] professionals with 30,000 members as of 2012. It has 76 professional chapters and 250 collegiate chapters across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| publisher = American Marketing Association

 | title = History of the American Marketing Association
| year = 2010
 |accessdate = October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMA was formed in 1937 from the merger of two predecessor organizations, the National Association of Marketing Teachers and the American Marketing Society. It also publishes a number of handbooks and research monographs.&lt;ref&gt;Boone, Louis E., and David L. Kurtz. Contemporary Marketing. Fort Worth, TX: Dryden Press, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-03-054018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMA publishes the ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'', ''[[Journal of Marketing Research]]'', ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', ''Journal of International Marketing'', and ''Marketing News''.

==Organization==
The American Marketing Association has a board of directors that are elected annually by its members&lt;ref&gt;American Marketing Association 2012-2013 Election. (2012). Marketing News, 46(2), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and a set of councils that are appointed. The headquarters is located in Chicago, Il. Russ Klein was named CEO in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140728005689/en/American-Marketing-Association-Appoints-Russ-Klein-CEO#.VFRMA_nF-cI|title=American Marketing Association Appoints Russ Klein as New CEO|author=|date=|website=businesswire.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the association appointed Jeremy Van Ek as its Chief Operations Officer and Jennifer Faris Severns as its new Chief Experience Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/17/05/p9484065/american-marketing-association-appoints-new-chief-operations-officer-an|title=American Marketing Association Appoints New Chief Operations Officer and Chief Experience Officer|website=Benzinga|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
As the global leader in marketing knowledge, the American Marketing Association hosts a broad range of conferences, trainings, and virtual events catering to marketers, researchers, and academicians in all stages of their careers. The Summer AMA Academic Conference has its roots in the first meeting of the National Association of Marketing Teachers. It is held in conjunction with AMA Academic Placement - where the majority of first-round interviews for tenure-track marketing faculty positions are held. AMA's International Collegiate Conference offers undergraduate students numerous marketing competitions over a three-day weekend. The relatively new AMA Annual Conferences caters to marketers from middle market firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ama.org/events-training/Conferences/Pages/default.aspx?k=ContentType:%22AMAConferencePage%22+IsDocument:1+&amp;r=AMAMergedEventDate%3E=10/31/2014|title=AMA Conferences|author=|date=|website=ama.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At a 1915 convention of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, a group of advertising teachers established the National Association of Teachers of Advertising (NATA). Initial discussions revolved around the definition of advertising and the study of advertising. The group's name changed to National Association of Teachers of Marketing &amp; Advertising (NATMA) and then National Association of Teachers of Marketing (NATM) as its focus expanded to marketing, incorporating educators from a variety of disciplines, including economics and accounting.

Approximately 15 years later a second organization, the American Marketing Society (AMS), was founded dedicated to the science of marketing. Lewis and Owen explained the first president, Paul Nystrom, "expressed a need to find ways of lowering the cost of marketing, a concern for criticisms against marketing, and an interest in finding 'useful tools and devices in marketing practice'".&lt;ref&gt;Early History of the American Marketing Association and the Journal of Marketing. (1993). [https://www.ama.org/publications/JournalOfMarketing/Pages/Current-Issue.aspx Journal of Marketing], 488.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two organizations jointly published the [[Journal of Marketing]] in 1936 and merged in 1937 to form the American Marketing Association. The association was housed at the University of Illinois in its early years and eventually moved its headquarters to Chicago as its professional staff expanded. As the study and practice of marketing became more sophisticated and specialized, the AMA also provided new offerings with the launch of the Journal of Marketing Research (1964) and acquisitions of Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing (from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas C. Kinnear (2011) In the Beginning: The Founding of Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing.

In 1895 he built the [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] as one of the world's first [[hydroelectric power plant]]s, and connected it to a lighting system using [[alternating current]]. It was the first of its kind in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Croatia]].

Ante Šupuk was a generally influential mayor of Šibenik, the first Croat mayor to be elected under universal suffrage in 1872. He held the office in three periods: 1873–1882, 1886–1892, and 1896–1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sibenskileksikon.com/cms_view.asp?articleID=170 |title=Šibenski leksikon - Devetorica najčuvenijih poteštata |work=Šibenska početnica u deset lekcija |author=Ivo Jakovljević |year=2008 |language=Croatian |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716064532/http://www.sibenskileksikon.com/cms_view.asp?articleID=170 |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the city built a number of features: a railroad connection (1877), waterworks (1879), a sewer system, and a new harbor, a new hospital building (1883).&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

In 1893, Šupuk and one Vjekoslav Meichsner started a business and obtained a license to use the waters of river [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]], and in 1894 they obtained permission to set up electrical power lines on municipal property in order to start lighting the streets with electric power. The construction of the [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] started in 1894 and lasted for 16 months. It had a two-phase generator that produced 0.6&amp;nbsp;MW of electric power. It was connected to the city with an {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} long 3&amp;nbsp;kV power line, where it was transformed to 110&amp;nbsp;V. On August 28, 1895 the first electric [[street light]]s lit up in Šibenik. This achievement made Šibenik the third city in the world with [[alternating current]]-powered street lights. In 1904, Šupuk's company built a new power plant, Jaruga II, still operational today.&lt;ref name="HE"/&gt;

[[Hajji]] '''Antemas''' (20 October 1923 &amp;ndash; 21 December 1970) was an Indonesian entrepreneur. The [[Antemas Award]] (1974&amp;ndash;92) was named after him.

==Biography==
Antemas was born in [[Amuntai]], [[South Kalimantan]], on 20 October 1923.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}} He completed a junior high school education.{{sfn|TIM, Antemas}}

In the 1950s Antemas was the head of Mastraco, an import and export company, which entered the film industry in 1957. The company owned the Cathay Jakarta cinema and a film company, Pan Asiatic Film. Over the next thirteen years he took a variety of roles, including chairman of the All-Indonesia Cinema Owners' Association (Gabungan Pengusaha Bioskop Seluruh Indonesia, or GPBSI), as well as secretary general of both the Indonesian Film Import and Distribution Union (Persatuan Impor dan Distribusi Film Indonesia, or PIDFI) and the National Film Council (Badan Musyawarah Film Nasional).{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}}

During the 1960s Antemas, together with Naziruddin Naib and other film brokers who disapproved of the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]]'s influence in the film industry, broke away from PIDFI (since renamed PIDFIN) and established the Association of Indonesian Film Importers, Producers, and Distributors (Gabungan Importir, Produser, dan Distributor Film Indonesia, or GIP-RODFIN).{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}} The author Eddie Karsito describes this as Antemas "bravely and openly challenging the Communist Party".{{sfn|Karsito|2008|p=130}} Following the [[30 September Movement|coup attempt]] on 30 September 1965, PIDFIN was banned, while GIP-RODFIN survived.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}}

On 21 December 1970, while attending a meeting of the GPBSI in [[Jakarta]], Antemas had a heart attack. He was declared dead in the meeting room.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}}

Beginning in 1974, GPBSI awarded the [[Antemas Award]] during the [[Indonesian Film Festival]]. This award was granted to the film which had sold the most tickets in the preceding year.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=47}} The award lasted until 1992.{{sfn|TIM, Antemas}} The last winner award was [[Garin Nugroho]]'s ''[[Cinta dalam Sepotong Roti]]''.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Penghargaan Cinta}}

Inspired from the success of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]]’s series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s, the APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-Pacific economies and the advent of regional [[trade bloc]]s in other parts of the world; and to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw materials beyond Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecc.org/resources/doc_view/601-back-to-canberra-founding-apec|title=PECC - Back to Canberra: Founding APEC|website=www.pecc.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/History |website=www.apec.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pecc.org/resources/regional-cooperation/601-back-to-canberra-founding-apec/file}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Singapore]], the APEC is recognized as the oldest forum and highest-level multilateral bloc in the Asia-Pacific region, and exerts a significant global influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ncapec.org/docs/what_is_apec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chu |first1=Shulong |title=The East Asia Summit: Looking for an Identity |url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-east-asia-summit-looking-for-an-identity/ |website=Brookings |date=NaN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Achievements and Benefits |url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/Achievements-and-Benefits |website=www.apec.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Could The 2016 APEC Forum Affect The World Economy? - FXCM |url=https://www.fxcm.com/insights/2016-apec-forum-affect-world-economy/ |work=FXCM Insights |date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parreñas |first1=Julius Caesar |title=ASEAN and Asia‐Pacific economic cooperation |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09512749808719255 |website=The Pacific Review |pages=233–248 |language=en |doi=10.1080/09512749808719255 |date=January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.anzam.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf-manager/2336_BAMBER_GREG_AMI-13.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is attended by the [[heads of government]] of all APEC members except [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (which is represented by a [[List of Chinese Taipei Representatives to APEC|ministerial-level official]] under the name [[Chinese Taipei]] as ''economic leader'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2013/08/27/387427/Conditions-not.htm Conditions not right for APEC attendance: Ma].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
[[File:APEC ABC.ogv|thumb|right|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report of the first APEC meeting in Canberra, November 1989, featuring delegates watching the [[Melbourne Cup]].]]
The APEC was initially inspired when [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]’s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the mid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences among ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing economies. By 1989, the post ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace 12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The developments led [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] to believe the necessity of region-wide cooperation on economic matters. In January 1989, Bob Hawke called for more effective economic cooperation across the Pacific Rim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the [[Australia]]n capital of [[Canberra]] in November, chaired by [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Australian Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]]. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with commitments for future annual meetings in [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]]. Ten months later, 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra, Australia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was established to coordinate the activities of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/History |website=www.apec.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pecc.org/resources/regional-cooperation/601-back-to-canberra-founding-apec/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the meeting in 1994 in [[Bogor]], [[Indonesia]], APEC leaders adopted the Bogor Goals that aim for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and by 2020 for developing economies. In 1995, APEC established a business advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), composed of three business executives from each member economy.

In April 2001, the APEC, in collaboration with five other international organisations (Eurostat, IEA, OLADE, OPEC and the UNSD) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative]] (JODI).

==Member economies==

APEC currently has 21 members. However, the criterion for membership is that the member is a separate ''economy'', rather than a state. As a result, APEC uses the term ''member economies'' rather than ''member countries'' to refer to its members. One result of this criterion is that membership of the forum includes [[Taiwan]] (officially the Republic of China, participating under the name "Chinese Taipei") alongside [[People's Republic of China]] (see [[Cross-Strait relations]]), as well as [[Hong Kong]], which entered APEC as a British colony but it is now a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]]. APEC also includes three official observers: [[ASEAN]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref name="apec.org"/&gt;

==Business facilitation==
APEC has long been at the forefront of reform efforts in the area of business facilitation. Between 2002 and 2006 the costs of business transactions across the region was reduced by 6%, thanks to the APEC Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAPI). Between 2007 and 2010, APEC hopes to achieve an additional 5% reduction in business transaction costs. To this end, a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20101119130533/http://apec.org/apec/apec_groups/committee_on_trade.MedialibDownload.v1.html?url=%2Fetc%2Fmedialib%2Fapec_media_library%2Fdownloads%2Fcommittees%2Fcti%2Fpubs%2F2003.Par.0028.File.v1.1 Trade Facilitation Action Plan] has been endorsed.

===Proposed FTAAP===
APEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for such an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist {{Interlanguage link multi|Kiyoshi Kojima|ja|3=小島清}}'s proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement proposal. While it gained little traction, the idea led to the formation of [[Pacific Trade and Development Conference]] and then the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] in 1980 and then APEC in 1989.

In the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Fred Bergsten|Bergsten, C. Fred]], "Toward a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific", [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] Number Pb07-2. Pdf can be found via Google. Retrieved 2014-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, [[ASEAN]] and existing [[free trade agreement]] (FTA) partners are negotiating as [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (RCEP), not officially including Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebricspost.com/china-led-rcep-trade-talks-to-begin-in-may/#.VGDoinBi7ew "China-led RCEP trade talks to begin in May"], ''thebricspost.com'', April 25, 2013. Retrieved 2014-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) without China or Russia involved has become the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dw.de/p/1Dje5 "China's President Xi touts 'Asia-Pacific dream' ahead of APEC summit"], Deutsche Welle, November 9, 2014.

Retrieved 2014-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the [[Doha round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations, and as a way to overcome the "noodle bowl" effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious free trade agreements — there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in 2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2007 — |url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/09northeastasia_brilliant.aspx |title=FTAAP |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920100958/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/09northeastasia_brilliant.aspx |archivedate=2011-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free trade agreements - many of which were bilateral.{{efn|"As of January 2012 ASEAN countries have 186 FTAs implemented, signed, under negotiation or under proposal/study, which is substantial progress since… 1992.

The FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/opeds/oped.cfm?ResearchID=655 |title=Plan B for World Trade |publisher=Petersoninstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}} No reference to numbers of FTAs.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other regional free trade areas such as the [[ASEAN Plus Three]] ([[ASEAN]] + [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]).&lt;ref name="VSM"&gt;[http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb07-2.pdf Policy Briefs in International Economics] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications with nations of other regions.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; The development of the FTAAP is expected to take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations between member economies.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; It is also affected by the absence of political will and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pecc.org/research/ftaap The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council - FTAAP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524154836/http://www.pecc.org/research/ftaap |date=2012-05-24 }}. PECC. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch "a collective strategic study" on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-11/11/c_133782162.htm "APEC roadmap on FTAAP a historic decision: Xi"].

The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] includes 12 of the 21 APEC members and has provisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which have expressed interest in membership.

==APEC Study Centre Consortium==
In 1993, APEC Leaders decided to establish a network of APEC Study Centres among universities and research institutions in member economies.&lt;ref name=ASCC&gt;[http://www.apec.org/en/Groups/Other-Groups/APEC-Study-Centers-Consortium.aspx APEC Study Center Contortium]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201162758/http://www.apec.org/en/Groups/Other-Groups/APEC-Study-Centers-Consortium.aspx |date=December 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==APEC Business Advisory Council==
The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) was created by the APEC Economic Leaders in November&amp;nbsp;1995 with the aim of providing advice to the APEC Economic Leaders on ways to achieve the Bogor Goals and other specific business sector priorities, and to provide the business perspective on specific areas of cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.abaconline.org/|title=Home - APEC Business Advisory Council|first=Abac|last=Online|website=www2.abaconline.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncapec.org/abac/index.html|title=National Center for APEC - About ABAC|website=www.ncapec.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each economy nominates up to three members from the private sector to ABAC. These business leaders represent a wide range of [[industry]] sectors. ABAC provides an annual report to APEC Economic Leaders containing recommendations to improve the business and investment environment in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, and outlining business views about priority regional issues. ABAC is also the only non-governmental organization that is on the official agenda of the APEC Economic Leader's Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaapec.org/en/about_apec/content_2.shtml|title=APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) - China APEC Development Council|website=www.chinaapec.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual APEC economic leaders' meetings==
Since its formation in 1989, APEC has held annual meetings with representatives from all member economies. The first four annual meetings were attended by ministerial-level officials. Beginning in 1993, the annual meetings are named APEC Economic Leaders' Meetings and are attended by the [[heads of government]] from all member economies except [[Taiwan]], which is represented by a ministerial-level official. The annual Leaders' Meetings are not called summits.

===Meeting developments===
In 1997, the APEC meeting was held in [[Vancouver]]. Controversy arose after officers of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] used [[pepper spray]] against protesters. The protesters objected to the presence of [[autocratic]] leaders such as [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian president]] [[Suharto]].&lt;ref name="Pue 2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=W.

At the [[2001 Leaders' Meeting]] in [[Shanghai]], APEC leaders pushed for a new round of trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and [[capacity building]]. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade [[transaction cost]]s in the Asia-Pacific region by 5 percent over 5 years, and pursue [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]] policies relating to information technology goods and services.

In 2003, [[Jemaah Islamiah]] leader [[Riduan Isamuddin]] had planned to attack the APEC Leaders Meeting to be held in [[Bangkok]] in October. He was captured in the city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]] by Thai police on August 11, 2003, before he could finish planning the attack.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
[[Chile]] became the first [[South America]]n nation to host the Leaders' Meeting in 2004. The agenda of that year was focused on [[terrorism]] and commerce, [[small and medium enterprise]] development, and contemplation of free agreements and regional trade agreements.

The 2005 Leaders' Meeting was held in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. The meeting focused on the [[Doha round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) negotiations, leading up to the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]] held in [[Hong Kong]] in December. Weeks earlier, trade negotiations in [[Paris]] were held between several WTO members, including the United States and the [[European Union]], centred on reducing agricultural [[trade barrier]]s. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European Union to agree to reducing [[farm subsidies]]. In a continuation of the climate information sharing initiative established by APEC Climate Network working group, it was decided by the leaders to install the [[APEC Climate Center]] in [[Busan]]. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting schedule was not affected.

At the Leaders' Meeting held on November 19, 2006 in [[Hanoi]], APEC leaders called for a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism and other threats to security. APEC also criticised [[North Korea]] for conducting a [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear test]] and a [[2006 North Korean missile test|missile test launch]] that year, urging the country to take "concrete and effective" steps toward [[nuclear disarmament]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] in the region was discussed in addition to economic topics. The [[United States]] and [[Russia]] signed an agreement as part of Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.

The [[APEC Australia 2007]] Leaders' Meeting was held in [[Sydney]] from 2–9 September 2007. The political leaders agreed to an "aspirational goal" of a 25% reduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development.&lt;ref name=wnn&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[World Nuclear News]] | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/energyEnvironment/APEC_supports_nuclear_agrees_climate_targets.shtml | title = Apec supports nuclear, agrees climate targets | date = 2007-09-10 | accessdate=2007-09-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071004151857/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/energyEnvironment/APEC_supports_nuclear_agrees_climate_targets.shtml| archivedate= 4 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme security measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-concrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential terrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security envelope was penetrated with ease by a [[The Chaser APEC pranks|spoof diplomatic motorcade]] manned by members of the Australian television program ''[[The Chaser]]'', one of whom was dressed to resemble the [[Al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]].

The APEC USA 2011 Leaders' Meeting was held on Honolulu, Hawaii 8–13 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.apec2011.gov/meetings/index.htm | title = Apec Honolulu Schedule |date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=November 9, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121013082225/http://www.apec2011.gov/meetings/index.htm| archivedate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===APEC leaders' group photo===
At the end of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting the leaders gather for the official APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A tradition has the leaders dressing to reflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S.&amp;nbsp;President [[Bill Clinton]] insisted on informal attire and gave the leaders leather [[Flight jacket|bomber jackets]]. At the 2010 meeting Japan had the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional [[kimono]].&lt;ref name="no_kimono"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AA4H220101111 |title=No kimonos for APEC leaders in Japan |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2010-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115061555/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AA4H220101111 |archivedate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S.&amp;nbsp;President [[Barack Obama]] joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in "flowered shirts and grass skirts". After viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in [[aloha shirt]]s might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama instead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for the photo.&lt;ref name="no_aloha_shirts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/133780488.html?id=133780488|title=No aloha for Hawaiian shirts at APEC family photo|publisher=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|date=2011-11-13|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik outfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in Peru 2016 vicuna wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/nov/17/awkward-apec-fashion-what-the-world-leaders-wore-in-pictures |title=Awkward Apec Fashion: what the world leaders wore |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=8 November 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APEC has been criticised for promoting free trade agreements that would impose restrictions on national and local laws, which regulate and ensure labor rights, environmental protection and safe and affordable access to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gerhardt |first=Tina |date=11 November 2011 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/11/11-0 |title=America's Pacific Century?: APEC Summit in Hawaii Seeks to Implement Free Trade Agreement of the Asia Pacific Region |work=[[Commondreams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the organization, it is "the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region" established to "further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apec.org/apec/about_apec.html About APEC – Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119101455/http://www.apec.org/apec/about_apec.html |date=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness and fairness of its role has been questioned, especially from the viewpoints of European countries that cannot take part in APEC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9788478 |work=The Economist |title=APEC—a pretty empty chatter |date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pacific Island nations that cannot participate but stand to be affected by its decisions.

A succession of South Indian dynasties, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Western Gangas]], the [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]] and the [[Hoysalas]], ruled the present region of Bangalore until in 1537 CE, [[Kempe Gowda|Kempé Gowdā]]&amp;nbsp;– a feudal ruler under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]&amp;nbsp;– established a [[Bengaluru Pete|mud fort]] considered to be the foundation of modern Bangalore. In 1638, the [[Maratha Empire|Marāthās]] conquered and ruled Bangalore for almost 50 years, after which the [[Mughals]] captured and sold the city to the [[Mysore Kingdom]] of the [[Wadiyar dynasty]]. It was captured by the [[British East India Company|British]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. The old city developed in the dominions of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] and was made capital of the [[Princely State of Mysore]], which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the [[British Raj]].

In 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of [[British India]]. Following [[independence of India|India's independence]] in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of [[Mysore State]], and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore&amp;nbsp;– city and cantonment&amp;nbsp;– which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing [[Kannada]] name, ''Bengalūru'', was declared the [[official name]] of the city in 2006.

Bangalore is sometimes referred to as the "[[Silicon Valley of India]]" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading [[information technology]] (IT) exporter.&lt;ref name="cnn-Dec2012"&gt;{{cite news | url    = http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/06/tech/bangalore-india-internet-access| title  = How the 'Silicon Valley of India' is bridging the digital divide| last   = Canton| first  = Naomi| publisher  = CNN| accessdate = 6 December 2012| date   = 6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url    = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/business/worldbusiness/20bangalore.html | title  = Is the Next Silicon Valley Taking Root in Bangalore? | last   = RAI | first  = Saritha |work   = [[The New York Times]]  | accessdate = 20 March 2006 | date   = 20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url    = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20201666 | title  = Can the 'American Dream' be reversed in India? | last   = Vaidyanathan| first  = Rajini| publisher  = [[BBC World News]]| accessdate = 5 November 2012 | date   = 5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian technological organisations [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]] and [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|HAL]] are headquartered in the city.

==Etymology==
The name "Bangalore" represents an [[Anglicization|anglicised]] version of the [[Kannada language]] name, "Bengalūru" [[ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು]] {{IPA-kn|ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru||Bengaluru-Kannada-Pronunciation.ogg}}. It is the name of a village near Kodegehalli and was copied by Kempegowda to the city of Bangalore. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] stone inscription on a "''vīra gallu''{{-"}} ({{lang|kn|ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು}}) (literally, "[[hero stone]]", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in [[Begur, Bangalore|Begur]], "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 [[Common Era|CE]]. It states that the place was part of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga Kingdom]] until 1004 and was known as "''Bengaval-uru''", the "City of Guards" in [[Halegannada]] (Old Kannada).&lt;ref name="OtherNames"&gt;{{cite news

An [[apocryphal]] story recounts that the 12th century [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala II]], while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru".&lt;ref name="OtherNames" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bendakaaluru"&gt;{{cite web

Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537 by a [[vassal]] of the Vijayanagara Empire, [[Kempe Gowda I]], who aligned with the Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he defeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built [[Bengaluru Pete|a mud-brick fort]] for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made by Achuta Deva Raya, who feared the potential power of Kempe Gowda and did not allow a formidable stone fort. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes".&lt;ref name=gandubhoomi&gt;{{cite news

The town had two main streets—Chikkapeté Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapeté Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapeté Square—the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda I's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").&lt;ref name=bglrHist2&gt;{{Cite thesis

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 in the [[Battle of Talikota]], Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. Kempe Gowda declared independence, then in 1638, a large [[Adil Shahi]] Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command [[Shahaji|Shāhji Bhōnslé]] defeated Kempe Gowda III,&lt;ref name=bglrHist2 /&gt; and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal estate). In 1687, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] general Kasim Khan, under orders from [[Aurangzeb]], defeated [[Ekoji I]], son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar]] (1673–1704), the then ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] for three lakh rupees.&lt;ref name=ekoji&gt;{{Cite news

The [[Bengaluru Pete|old city]] ("pētē") developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore.

A town grew up around the cantonment, by absorbing several villages in the area.

Bangalore was hit by a [[Bubonic plague|plague]] epidemic in 1898 that claimed nearly 3,500 lives. The crisis caused by the outbreak catalysed the city's sanitation process. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations. Regulations for building new houses with proper sanitation facilities came into effect. A health officer was appointed and the city divided into four wards for better co-ordination.

Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had established itself as the ''[[Silicon Valley]] of India''.&lt;ref name=bglrHist2 /&gt; Today, Bangalore is India's third most populous city. During the 21st century, Bangalore has suffered terrorist attacks in [[2008 Bangalore serial blasts|2008]], [[2010 Bangalore stadium bombing|2010]], and [[2013 Bangalore blast|2013]].

[[River Vrishabhavathi]], a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city.

In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills [[waterworks]] was commissioned by [[Mirza Ismail|Sir Mirza Ismail]] ([[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] of Mysore, 1926–41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river [[Kaveri]] provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river.&lt;ref name="watersup"&gt;{{cite web

Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and [[water tank]]s, the largest of which are Madivala tank, [[Hebbal]] lake, [[Ulsoor]] lake, Yediyur Lake and [[Sankey Tank]]. Groundwater occurs in [[silt]]y to [[sand]]y layers of the [[alluvial]] sediments. The [[Peninsular Gneiss]]ic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes [[granite]]s, [[gneiss]]es and [[migmatite]]s, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red [[laterite]] and red, fine [[loam]]y to [[clay]]ey soils.&lt;ref name="EIA" /&gt;

Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large [[deciduous]] [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and minority [[coconut]] trees.

Bangalore's rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature of growth in the city resulted in massive traffic [[gridlock]]s that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a [[flyover (overpass)|flyover]] system and by imposing one-way traffic systems.

'''Booze cruise''' is a British colloquial term for a brief trip from Britain to [[France]] or [[Belgium]] with the intent of taking advantage of lower prices, and buying personal supplies of (especially) [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] or [[tobacco]] in bulk quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2403437.stm |title=We're all going on a 'booze-cruise' holiday |work=[[BBC News]] |date=5 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a legally acceptable process and should not be confused with [[smuggling]].

The term is also used in other countries to refer to a pleasure outing on a ship or boat involving a significant amount of drinking, or an outing to purchase large amounts of alcohol in bulk for a party or outing. It probably originated during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], when Americans would take "cruises to nowhere" to enjoy alcohol, which could legally be served on board once outside American territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/prohibition-americas-failed-noble-experiment/|title=Prohibition: America's Failed Noble Experiment|date=12 June 2012|publisher=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The background==
{{refimprove|date=April 2009}}
Generally, alcohol and tobacco taxes are lower in France than in Britain. Economically, it makes sense for people to buy their supplies of wine, beer, spirits, and tobacco in bulk in France instead of Britain.  There is keen competition between [[List of ferry operators|ferry operators]] and the [[Channel Tunnel]] [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]]. The day fares to [[Calais]] are normally around £60 per vehicle, but are sometimes discounted to as little as £10 at off-peak times. Since beer often costs little more than half the English shop price, at worst, the savings defray the cost of a day out.

Serving this market has become big business around the major ferry ports of [[Calais]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], and [[Dunkirk]] in France, and [[Ostend]] in Belgium. Even longer routes from [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] generate business, boosted by ferries from Ireland where alcohol duties are even higher. The exit route from the Calais ferry port passes several large warehouse retailers (English-owned) that serve the market, and some large British supermarket chains have alcohol-only branches selling bottles identical to those in Britain, but at deep discounts. The French have opened an enormous shopping precinct adjacent to the Channel Tunnel ([[Cité Europe]]) that attracts large numbers of British shoppers.

Following large increases in tobacco duty in France, it is now very common for smokers to make a detour to the small town of [[Adinkerke]] just over the border in [[Belgium]], where tobacco duty is lower.  Many people intending to purchase mainly tobacco products opt for the revitalised service from Dover to Dunkirk, as Dunkirk is much closer to the Belgian border than Calais, and the ferries on this route are slightly more 'smoker-friendly'.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some buying both tobacco and alcohol make a triangular journey (Dover - Dunkirk - Calais - Dover or vice versa).

It is important to differentiate between booze cruisers (who purchase and transport goods legally) and professional [[smugglers]], who often have criminal motives. Genuine booze cruisers are often people 'on a budget', who simply opt to purchase their own personal supplies from 'Shop A' (in France or Belgium) at lower prices than offered at 'Shop B' (in Britain). Booze cruisers normally travel as a family or group of friends, and often take the opportunity to generally have a 'day out' in France and indulge in recreational 'channel shopping' for French produce and unfamiliar foods, clothing and other goods while they are there.  In addition to alcohol and tobacco, many other items, including mundane household items such as washing powder and cooking oil are much cheaper in France than the UK.

The cost of getting to France fluctuates due to season and fuel surcharges, but fares for foot passengers remain low. Calais in particular is very well-served by public transport, with the ferry companies also providing a shuttle bus from the ferry terminal to the town centre and (by request) the bus interchange at the SNCF railway station.

French tobacco duties have also risen, reducing further the economic advantage of a "booze cruise". Unless one is close to the Channel ports, it's unlikely to be financially beneficial. The motivation is changing, therefore, from purely economic to leisure and variety of choice.

Originally alcohol purchases on board the ferry had the additional attraction of being duty-free, adding a secondary meaning to booze cruise.

==Economic impacts==
The current situation benefits individuals living near to the English south coast who retain an economic advantage by shopping in France. It benefits the entrepreneurs who have businesses around the French ports dependent upon bulk purchases and also other local businesses that benefit from passing trade. The Calais area suffers high unemployment (around 20%) and benefits from the service jobs created by the influx of English [[day-tripper]]s. The ferry and tunnel operators also benefit from the extra traffic, in a situation that might otherwise be over-supplied.

On the downside, UK taxes (especially on tobacco) seem to have risen beyond the point of diminishing returns, so the British Exchequer loses substantial revenue that might otherwise have been collected to the economies of France and Belgium.{{Citation needed|reason=Need source, also possible peacock word with the "substantial"|date=June 2012}} Shops (particularly in the English South-East) also report that their trade suffers because taxes make their prices uncompetitive with both legal and illegal imports.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

== French law limiting the transport of tobacco ==

A recent French law has effectively outlawed tobacco tourism which uses France either as a destination or as a route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.day-tripper.net/xzi/xphotoaccessfrenchdouanes.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714013944/http://www.day-tripper.net/xzi/xphotoaccessfrenchdouanes.gif |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from the tobacco sellers interest group, les bureaux de tabac, and despite the resistance of the French government, the French Parliament has enacted a law that makes it illegal to transport more than 200 cigarettes whilst in French territory:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article583712.ece French tobacco law]&lt;/ref&gt; fines and confiscation are sanctions if a person is found to be in possession of more than 200 cigarettes whilst traveling through/in France. The law is designed to prevent French citizens buying tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg.

Following recent tax increases in France it has become more attractive for French citizens to buy tobacco in Belgium and Luxembourg. The law also applies to citizens of other European countries traveling through France with more than 200 cigarettes in their possession. There is a suggestion that the law is incompatible with European Commission directives which demand freedom of movement and goods, for personal use, across the borders of European Union countries excluding specifically named "new member states".

== Legal issues and UK Customs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jun/28/shopping.money &lt;!-- old URL: http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1807926,00.html --&gt; |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=June 28, 2006 |title=Europe drops 'booze cruise' battle with Britain |author=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==

EU Directive 92/12 Article 8 states:  ''"As regards products acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported by them... excise duty shall be charged in the member state in which they are acquired".''

In answer to a legal challenge; a European Court of Justice ruling on 23 November 2006 surprisingly overturned their own Advocate-General's advice and reconfirmed that: ''"only products acquired and transported personally by private individuals are exempt from excise duty in the member state of importation".''

This ruling effectively thwarted the hoped-for option of ordering goods (particularly tobacco), via Internet, from low duty states in the European Union and having them posted to a United Kingdom address, causing discussion in the British media about how a supposed 'Free Trade Area' seems to work for the benefit of some but not others.

The current position is: people may personally ''bring'' into Britain ''with them'' unlimited amounts of alcohol and/or tobacco from another EU member state, provided that they have been legally purchased (with the relevant local rate of duty paid) in the member state of origin, and are for either personal consumption, or as a genuine gift to another.  Importing goods for resale at a profit, or even 'not for profit' proxy purchases on behalf of non-travelling third parties is not permitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Although fully aware of this, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC), faced with widespread abuse by smugglers, impose 'guidelines' - limits based on what they are prepared to believe are reasonable amounts for personal consumption (nominally six months' supply). Most travellers are unaffected, but there are instances of infrequent trippers forward-buying large supplies of (for example) their favourite brand of cigarette, and falling foul of the 'limits' intended to deal with professional smugglers.

HMRC have the legal right to stop and search any vehicle.  As their main duty is to detect 'smuggled' goods (and other far more sinister imports), they can (and usually do) use their own common sense regarding unconcealed (i.e. openly carried) goods above their 'limits', if they are happy that the goods are genuinely for personal consumption.  Generally, suspicion will only be aroused if the goods start to look less like a 'personal' hoard, and more like a commercial operation.  For example: importing more different brands of tobacco products than there are adult travellers in the vehicle arouses particular suspicion, as most smokers tend to remain loyal to one particular brand. However, there have been reported cases of more extreme treatment (especially where people have unnecessarily concealed extra goods in vehicle cavities, spare wheel wells etc.), with family cars and contents being confiscated on the spot and the travelers left stranded at Dover in the dead of night. This has led to legal challenges to the powers of HMRC, citing the heavy-handedness and inconsistency of some actions, and their dubious legality under European law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/20/travelnews.travel &lt;!-- old URL: http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1690719,00.html --&gt; |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 20, 2006 |title=Customs pays out £2m to settle booze cruise claim |first=Miles |last=Brignall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the standard booze cruise was the ill-fated [[offshore off-licence]] which operated briefly off Hartlepool in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/3900181.stm |title=Offshore off-licence will reopen |date=16 July 2004 |work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cash break even ratio''' is used in evaluating the [[financial]] performance of an income property to determine what rate of occupancy is required to meet both operating expense and mortgage payments (debt service).

== Formula ==
'''Cash Break Even Ratio''' = (Operating Expenses + Mortgage Payment - Reserves for Replacement) / Potential [[Gross Income]]

It allows both [[lender|lenders]] and [[investor|investors]] to assess a particular income properties ability to meet its operating expenses and provide a measurable level of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. The ratio does not include reserves for replacement, because it is not an actual cash expense. Additionally, it includes mortgage payment (debt service) which applies to most income properties that use leverage to enhance [[return on investment]] and equity dividend rate ([[cash on cash return]]).

'''Charles Edward Goad''' (March 15, 1848 – June 10, 1910 ) was a noted [[cartographer]] and [[civil engineer]]. Goad is most noted for his insurance surveys of cities in Canada, Great Britain, and elsewhere. Fire insurance companies needed to know in detail the nature and size of buildings, width of streets, construction, building materials and the proximity of fire services and water supplies in order to estimate appropriate premiums.  Goad established a company (the ''Charles E. Goad Company'') in 1875 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to produce maps to provide this information. These and like maps are now referred to as [[Goad maps]]. Goad returned to England in 1885 and began work in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;

{{accounting}}
'''Creative accounting''' is a [[euphemism]] referring to [[accounting]] practices that may follow the letter of the rules of [[standard accounting practice]]s, but deviate from the spirit of those rules. They are characterized by excessive complication and the use of novel ways of characterizing income, assets, or [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and the intent to influence readers towards the interpretations desired by the authors. The terms "innovative" or "aggressive" are also sometimes used. Other synonyms include '''Cooking the books''' and '''[[Enron Scandal|Enronomics]]'''.

The term as generally understood refers to systematic misrepresentation of the true [[income]] and [[asset]]s of corporations or other organizations. "Creative accounting" has been at the root of a number of [[accounting scandals]], and many proposals for [[accounting reform]]&amp;nbsp;– usually centering on an updated analysis of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[factors of production]] that would correctly reflect how value is added.

Newspaper and television journalists have hypothesized that the [[stock market downturn of 2002]] was precipitated by reports of "accounting irregularities" at [[Enron]], [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], and other firms in the [[United States]].

One commonly accepted incentive for the systemic over-reporting of corporate income&lt;ref&gt;[[Corporate tax]]&lt;/ref&gt; which came to light in 2002 was the granting of [[stock option]]s as part of [[executive compensation]] packages. Since stock prices reflect earning reports, stock options could be most profitably exercised when income is exaggerated, and the stock can be sold at an inflated profit.

The most notable activist is [[Abraham Briloff]] ([[professor emeritus]] of [[CUNY Baruch]]) who for years wrote a column for ''[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]'' that constantly analyzed breaches of ethics and audit professionalism among [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] firms. His book is called ''Unaccountable Accounting''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham J. Briloff]]&lt;/ref&gt; The profession, in turn, was not kind to Dr. Briloff&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = |url = http://aaahq.org/PublicInterest/newsletr/spring99/item07.htm|last = Owsen|first = Dwight M.|journal = In the Public Interest|publisher = American Accounting Association|volume = 27|issue = 2|publication-date = Spring 1999|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221054447/http://aaahq.org/PublicInterest/newsletr/spring99/item07.htm|archivedate = December 21, 2004|title = The AICPA's Prosecution of Dr. Abraham Briloff, Some Observations}}&lt;/ref&gt; but much of what he advocated has been forced on the industry in the wake of the [[Enron scandal]] (See [[Sarbanes-Oxley]]).

According to critic [[David Ehrenstein]], the term "creative accounting" was first used in 1968 in the film [[The Producers (1968 film)|''The Producers'']] by [[Mel Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/918-the-producers The Producers - From the Current - The Criterion Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earnings management==
{{main|Earnings management}}
Creative accounting can be used to manage earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creative Accounting|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creative-accounting.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earnings management occurs when [[Management|managers]] use judgment in [[financial reporting]] and in structuring transactions to alter financial reports to either mislead some [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s about the underlying economic performance of a company or influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, P. M. and J. M. Wahlen. 'A review of the earnings management literature and its implications for standard setting', ''Accounting Horizons'', December 1999, pp. 365–383.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Damiani S.p.A''' or ''Damiani Group'', is an Italian luxury [[jewelry]] [[corporate group]] that designs, manufactures, distributes and sells jewelry and luxury [[watches]].&lt;ref name="Damiani S.p.A. eveluation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.highbeam.com/company-profiles/info/774950/damiani-s-p-a | title=Damiani S.p.A. eveluation | publisher=HighBeam | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in Italy in 1924. The company uses celebrity endorsements to market its products. In the early 2000s the company had a dispute with [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] regarding the use of their names and wedding ring designs. The dispute was settled for $50 million and the couple helped Damiani create and market a line of products.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Damiani expanded across Asia and the US. It went public in 2007. Its most well-known jewelry product brands are Salvini, Alfieri &amp; St. John and Bliss.

==History==
Damiani was founded in 1924 by Enrico Grassi Damiani, in [[Valenza]], [[Italy]]. It became popular among affluent Italians.&lt;ref name="Damiani on sparkling form with new travel retail concept"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moodiereport.com/document.php?doc_id=24288 | title=Damiani on sparkling form with new travel retail concept | publisher=The Moodie Report | date=28 October 2010 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=Pittilla,  Mary Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damiani's son led the company from 1960-1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studi Societari|url=http://www.borsaitaliana.it/documenti/studi.htm?filename=96429.pdf|publisher=Borsa Italian SpA|accessdate=12 February 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started selling products on the US market in 2001 and introduced a $2.5 million ad campaign the following year.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Molofsky R.

Accessed May 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Damiani experienced negative press&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; after [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] filed a lawsuit. They said Damiani was selling reproductions of the ring custom-designed by Brad Pitt and made exclusively for their wedding in violation of their agreement with Damiani.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; Damiani said they never made that agreement and that the rings were merely chosen from a collection of wedding rings.&lt;ref name="Damiani says it owns the designs to Pitt and Aniston's wedding bands"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jckonline.com/2001/08/09/damiani-says-it-owns-designs-to-pitt-and-anistons-wedding-bands | title=Damiani says it owns the designs to Pitt and Aniston's wedding bands | publisher=JCK Magazine | date=August 9, 2001 | accessdate=6 February 2014 | author=DeMarco, Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement was reached for $50 million in January 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">'''Daniel Starch''' (1883–1979) was an American [[psychologist]] and [[marketing research]]er. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of marketing and consumer research in the early 20th century.

==Life==
Starch received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in mathematics and psychology from the Morning Side College in [[Iowa]]. After that he moved for postgraduation studies to the [[University of Iowa]], where he completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in psychology in 1906. The advisor of his thesis was Charles E. Seashore. After that he worked briefly as a lecturer in Iowa and then went on to teach at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] while pursuing further studies at [[Harvard University]]. In 1908 he became a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin]] where he stayed until 1919. From 1920 to 1926 he was a professor at Harvard University and in 1923 he founded the marketing research company Daniel Starch and Staff. Later he resigned from his position at Harvard to concentrate on his company and work in the private sector. In 1932 he worked as a consultant and director of a research department of the American Association of Advertising Agencies as well. Starch ran his own company for 50 years until his retirement in 1973 at the age of 90.&lt;ref name="wisconsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iowa"/&gt;

==Work==
Starch authored several books in the fields of psychology, advertising and marketing research. Best known are ''Experiments in Educational Psychology'' (1911) and his pioneering work about advertising ''Advertising: Its Principles, Practice, and Technique'' and its follow-up ''Principles of Advertising'' (1923). He researched and devised methods to assess the effectiveness of advertising, among them what was later to become known as the "Starch test" or "Starch recognition procedure".  Also named after him is the "Starch formula", which describes how to determine the number of people recalling a full-page advertisement from the number of people recalling a half-page advertisement.&lt;ref name="wisconsin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gabler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcgraw-hill"/&gt;

'''Fidel Kuri Grajales''' (born 24 February 1962) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] businessman and politician from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). He serves as a deputy to the [[LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress]], representing Veracruz's 15th electoral district, which includes the city of [[Orizaba]]. He also served as a deputy in the [[LXI Legislature of the Mexican Congress|LXI Legislature]].&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfil del legislador|url=http://sil.gobernacion.gob.mx/Librerias/pp_PerfilLegislador.php?SID=&amp;Referencia=9218983|publisher=Legislative Information System|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the incumbent chairman of the [[Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz]].

==Political and business career==
Kuri Grajales was born on 24 February 1962 in Orizaba and pursued an undergraduate degree in business administration, which he abandoned in 1981.&lt;ref name="sil"/&gt; He started his political career in the 1990s in the PRI, becoming president of a municipal committee. He also was involved in various transportation and other business chambers.

From 1998 to 2000, Kuri served on the LVIII Legislature of the Congress of Veracruz, presiding over the Public Works and Communications Commission and serving on the Territorial Limits and Civil Protection Commissions. During this time, he was a substitute deputy to the LVII Legislature. He would be a substitute local deputy to the LX Legislature of Veracruz; during this time, he was part of the PRI's Veracruz State Directive Committee and assisted in get out the vote efforts for PRI deputies in the lead-up to the 2006 general elections.&lt;ref name="sil"/&gt;

He also started a business career, becoming director general of Transmilenia, a construction company. In 2009, while Kuri was serving his first term as a federal deputy, his company was criticized for abandoning paving work on a highway in [[Nogales, Veracruz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Vázquez Chagoya|url=http://archivo.vazquezchagoya.com/?p=7508|date=25 November 2009|title=CONSTRUCTORA DE FIDEL KURI ABANDONA OBRA MILLONARIA|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reputation for incomplete projects has continued to dog Transmilenia; one 2015 report called it the company's "hallmark"&lt;!--sello característico--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=El Buen Tono|date=29 May 2015|accessdate=1 June 2016|url=https://www.elbuentono.com.mx/caracteriza-a-kuri-abandono-de-obras/|title=Caracteriza a Kuri abandono de obras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Kuri was elected to serve what would be the first of two terms in the federal Chamber of Deputies, representing Veracruz's 15th electoral district. During his first tour in [[Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro|San Lázaro]], he sat on the Youth and Sports, Communications, Citizen Participation, Tourism and Gender Equality Commissions.&lt;ref name="sil"/&gt;

Three years after the end of the LXI Legislature, Kuri returned to the Chamber of Deputies, representing the same electoral district for the PRI. He currently sits on the Sports, Finances and Public Credit, and Housing Commissions of the Chamber of Deputies; he is the chairman of the former.&lt;ref name="sil"/&gt;

In 2017, Kuri Grajales launched a campaign to become mayor of the [[Veracruz (city)|city of Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="mayor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2017/05/kuri-veracruz-equipo-tiburones-femexfut/|work=Animal Político|title=Fidel Kuri mezcla política y futbol en campaña, pese a prohibición en estatuto de Femexfut|date=3 May 2017|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Kuri Grajales has owned several soccer teams. In 2008, he bought his local team, the [[Albinegros de Orizaba]], who played in the [[Ascenso MX|Liga de Ascenso]]. In 2011, he transferred the franchise to the state government, which moved it to Veracruz as the Tiburones Rojos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Sexenio|first=Constancia|last=Izquierdo|url=http://www.sexenio.com.mx/articulo.php?id=4761|date=20 May 2011|title=Fidel Kuri cede franquicia de Albinegros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuri then bought the [[C.F. La Piedad|Reboceros de La Piedad]], which earned promotion to the Liga MX in 2013. The team was relocated from Michoacán to Veracruz to become the most recent incarnation of the Tiburones Rojos, effectively promoting the Veracruz team. When they won the [[Copa MX]] in April 2016, Kuri allowed [[Héctor Yunes Landa]], the PRI's candidate for governor, to hoist the cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Vice México|url=https://sports.vice.com/latinamerica/article/fidel-kuri-diputado-mediocre-pero-con-poder|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=1 June 2016|first=Iván|last=Pérez|title=FIDEL KURI: DIPUTADO MEDIOCRE… PERO CON PODER}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]'' reported that the deal to move to Veracruz had occurred by way of an indefinite contract, in which Governor [[Javier Duarte]] sold Kuri's company, Promotora Deportiva del Valle de Orizaba, A.C., the rights to the name, logo, stadium and practice facilities at no cost. This contract was never signed by the state congress and legally expired in January 2014, though Kuri continues to profit from the club's intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Proceso|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=1 June 2016|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/424011/los-tiburones-del-veracruz-un-regalo-politico|title=Los Tiburones del Veracruz, un "regalo" político|first=Raúl|last=Ochoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Football Federation]] suspended Kuri Grajales from all soccer-related activities in January 2016 and imposed a fine of 146,000 pesos for being involved in an altercation with the head of the referees, [[Edgardo Codesal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Televisa Deportes|url=http://deportes.televisa.com/futbol-mexicano/2016-01-22/ano-sancion-kuri-grajales/|title=Un año de sanción para Kuri Grajales|date=22 January 2016|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been fined in 2014 for criticism of referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Milenio|url=http://laaficion.milenio.com/veracruz/Fidel_Kuri_Grajales-bombardero-Veracruz-Tiburones_Rojos_0_637736390.html|date=30 November 2015|first=Alejandra|last=García|title=Fidel Kuri, el bombardero de Veracruz|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, after a match in Puebla, Kuri, still banned by the FMF, entered the press area and confronted a local reporter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=ESPN|title=Fidel Kuri encaró a miembro de la prensa|url=http://espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/2795969/fidel-kuri-encaro-a-miembro-de-la-prensa|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; earning him an 8-month extension to his suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Aristegui Noticias|url=http://aristeguinoticias.com/2309/kiosko/ocho-meses-mas-de-castigo-contra-diputado-del-pri-por-agredir-a-camarografo/|date=23 September 2016|accessdate=24 September 2016|title=8 meses más de castigo contra diputado del PRI y dueño del Veracruz, por agredir a camarógrafo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists who witnessed the confrontation noted that Kuri was drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.univision.com/deportes/futbol/liga-mx/pese-a-estar-inhabilitado-fidel-kuri-se-pasea-en-zona-mixta-e-insulta-a-reportero?hootPostID=50c25923188a5dad2b661370b84d21d1|work=Univisión Deportes|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=21 September 2016|title=Pese a estar inhabilitado, Fidel Kuri se pasea en zona mixta e insulta a reportero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Kuri Grajales became the center of controversy when he threatened to move the Tiburones Rojos if the PRI did not win the impending gubernatorial elections; Tamaulipas, Sinaloa and Yucatán were floated as potential landing pads for the franchise. These statements ran contrary to Article 7 of the Code of Ethics of the Mexican Football Federation, which require team owners to "maintain a neutral position in political and religious matters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Animal Político|date=31 May 2016|title=Si no gana el PRI, hay riesgo de que Tiburones Rojos se vaya de Veracruz: Kuri Grajales|url=http://www.animalpolitico.com/2016/05/si-no-gana-el-pri-hay-riesgo-de-que-tiburones-rojos-se-vaya-de-veracruz-kuri-grajales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, Kuri changed his mind and announced that, even though the PRI had lost the election, the Tiburones Rojos would remain in Veracruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Milenio|date=6 June 2016|url=http://laaficion.milenio.com/veracruz/tiburones-rojos-queda-veracruz-fidel-kuri-grajales-futbol-liga-mx_0_751125212.html|title="Tiburones Rojos se quedan en Veracruz": Fidel Kuri|first=Héctor|last=González Villalba|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuri was additionally criticized during his Veracruz mayoral campaign for using the team as part of his campaign, including a logo featuring a shark, mixing team and campaign messages on his personal account, and the campaign slogan ''Veracruz de primera'', which also refers to the team remaining in Liga MX.{{r|mayor}}

During his inauguration speech, the new mayor gave his vision for Marathon and the surrounding region that included a focus on transparency, meritocracy and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.protothema.gr/elias-psinakis-is-the-mayor-of-marathon/|title=Elias Psinakis is the Mayor of Marathon|work=protothema.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2018, following the [[2018 Attica wildfires|disastrous fires]] in the region, the municipal council of Marathon passed unanimously a resolution characterising Psinakis "undesirable", "incapable" and "extremely dangerous even to the physical health of the municipality's citizens", and demanding his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/horis-ton-psinaki-synedriazei-dimotiko-symvoylio-marathona|title=Ομόφωνη απόφαση για παραίτηση του Ηλ. Ψινάκη|work=Εφημερίδα των Συντακτών}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psinakis refused to resign, characterising the action as planned unconstitutional procedure that is not provided for by law and has no legal precedent. According to him it only had purpose of "spoofing and anthropophagy". Instead of politicking, he urged to manage the consequences of this disaster in a climate of solidarity and joint effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/810398/psinakis-den-paraitoumai-den-meteho-se-mia-methodeumeni-adisudagmatiki-diadikasia/|title=Ψινάκης: Δεν παραιτούμαι, δεν μετέχω σε μια μεθοδευμένη αντισυνταγματική διαδικασία|work=Proto Thema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psinakis established the non-profit Marathon Foundation in order to further tourism, sports, and culture in the region as well as promote charitable events for the needy that provide food, water and medical care throughout Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://we24.gr/2016/01/prepi-na-anagennisoume-ti-chora/|title=Πρέπει να αναγεννήσουμε τη χώρα|author= Μιχάλης Οικονομάκος|work=we24.gr|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marathonfoundation.org/|title=Marathon Foundation, official website|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to unite the various regions of Greece containing antiquities as well as historical and cultural landmarks, Psinakis established the Amphictyony of Ancient Greek Cities (Greek: Αμφικτυονία Αρχαίων Ελληνικών Πόλεων) in March 2016.  Headquartered in Marathon, the focus of the association is protection and  propagation of Greek cultural heritage and support of cultural interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4461">'''Jan Bárta''' (born 9 August 1942 in [[Prague]]) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[architect]] and [[preservationist]]. He has written several books about historic preservation and is a specialist in the area of facades and plaster on historic buildings. He is also known as an advocate for restoration of the monument of [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Josef Radetzky]] in Prague, which was removed in 1921.

In 1991 Jan Bárta together with [[chemist]] [[Jiří Rathouský]] founded a company to produce facade colours, hydrophobic coats and other chemicals aimed for restoration of historic houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.euro.cz/byznys/jan-bartasametova-revoluce-prisla-pozde-878812|title=Jan Bárta: Sametová revoluce přišla pozdě - Euro.cz|date=2006-02-20|work=Euro.cz|access-date=2018-07-30|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the exclusive supplier of facade colours for the historic buildings of Prague Castle and various other historic monuments of [[Czech Republic|Czechia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.top09.cz/regiony/jihocesky-kraj/tiskove-zpravy/kandidatka-top-09-v-jiznich-cechach-22894.html|title=Kandidátka TOP 09 v jižních Čechách|last=|first=|date=|work=TOP 09|access-date=2018-07-30|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Jan Bárta founded ''Spolek Radecký Praha'' (Radetzky Association Prague), which aims to commemorate [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Field marshall Radetzky]] and for several years has been advocating for the restoration of Radetzky's monument on [[Malostranské náměstí]] in Prague. This endeavour has been supported by numerous historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/de/rubrik/spazier/fehlendes-monument-radetzky-denkmal-soll-zurueck-auf-den-kleinseitner-ring|title=Fehlendes Monument: Radetzky-Denkmal soll zurück auf den Kleinseitner Ring {{!}} Radio Prag|work=Radio Praha|access-date=2018-08-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bárta stresses that Radetzky was a great Czech historical personality from an old Bohemian noble family and the monument was a beautiful work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rp-online.de/politik/oesterreich-feiert-den-legendaeren-heerfuehrer-der-habsburger_aid-18277941|title=Österreich feiert den legendären Heerführer der Habsburger|last=|first=|date=|website=RP ONLINE|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview for Czech online newspaper iDNES.cz, Bárta stated that the nationalist concept of Czech history in the 20th caused many great persons (such as Radetzky) to be almost forgotten, so his aim is to correct that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://praha.idnes.cz/marsal-radecky-malostranske-namesti-socha-navrat-f7l-/praha-zpravy.aspx?c=A171115_364705_praha-zpravy_nuc|title=Spolek hledá peníze a termín pro návrat Radeckého na Malostranské náměstí|date=2017-11-15|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the association held great celebrations of 250 years since Radetzky's birth in his birthplace [[Sedlčany]] (under the patronage of the municipal government) and in [[Prague]]. In Sedlčany a commemorative plaque was unveilded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radio.cz/de/rubrik/tagesecho/ehrung-in-der-heimat-sedlcany-enthuellt-gedenktafel-fuer-josef-radetzky|title=Ehrung in der Heimat: Sedlčany enthüllt Gedenktafel für Josef Radetzky {{!}} Radio Prag|last=|first=|date=|work=Radio Praha|access-date=2018-08-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KnowledgeBench''' is a proprietary software suite which is used in the development of new products such as pharmaceuticals, food and drink, [[speciality chemicals]], paint, oil, and plastics.  It has modules to support formulation, management and reporting, [[expert systems]], knowledge management, and [[Product Lifecycle Management]].  The software is used by companies including [[AstraZeneca]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley]].  It is built using methods from the field of [[artificial intelligence]] that include [[rule based system]]s and [[case based reasoning]].

==History==

In 2005 KnowledgeBench acquired the rights to the Formulogic Expert Systems Product from Logica. This is an expert system suite originally known as PFES (Product Formulation Expert System) which was developed by [[Logica]] under the Government sponsored [[Alvey]] Programme in 1989.

The author is KnowledgeBench Ltd, which was founded in August 2003 by Jason Smith, the Chief Executive and Denis Howlett, the Chief Technical Officer and product architect.

==Application details==

A KnowledgeBench application consists of three parts:
* An underlying knowledgebase containing background information about ingredients, their properties, past formulations, and anything else required by the application
* A collection of rulesets to provide the functionality and decision processing
* A set of web pages to solicit input from the user and display the results and reports

KnowledgeBench is compatible with industry standard [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application server platforms, including [[Apache Tomcat]], [[IBM WebSphere]], [[Oracle Weblogic Server|Oracle WebLogic Server]], Jetty and other [[Java EE]] platforms.

The '''Ludington family''' was an American family active in the fields of business, banking, and politics. Members prominent in the [[American Revolution]] were [[Henry Ludington]] and [[Sybil Ludington]]. Additionally, [[Lewis Ludington|Lewis]], [[James Ludington|James]], [[Nelson Ludington|Nelson]], and [[Harrison Ludington]] were involved in the establishment and development of cities in the states of [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Michigan]]. Henry founded [[Kent, New York]], in 1775; Lewis founded [[Columbus, Wisconsin]], in 1844; James founded [[Ludington, Michigan]], in 1859; and Nelson founded [[Escanaba, Michigan]], in 1862. Harrison was involved in the development of [[Milwaukee]] and was a governor of Wisconsin.

== Origins ==
Historian La Reiana Rule says the American name Ludington is of English origin from ''Luddington''. She believes ancestors of the American Ludingtons were in towns in England from the 10th century. Her research indicates the name "Leodingtun" signifies "estate of the compatriot's family".&lt;ref name=LudGene&gt;{{cite news |last=Rule  |first=La Reiana |date= July 28, 1968|title= What Your Name Means|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10869673/ |work= Independent Press-Telegram |page=104  |location= Long Beach, California |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }} &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lion Passant Guardant.svg|thumb|upright 0.5|Lion Passant Guardant]]

Historian [[Willis Fletcher Johnson]] says the American surname Ludington is also spelled Luddington, Ludinton, and Ludenton.{{sfnp|Johnson|1907|p=5}} He believes this family originated from the 16th-century Ludingtons of [[Shrawley]] and [[Worcester]] in England. Tradition has it that a Ludington was a follower of [[Richard the Lionheart]] in the [[Third Crusade]] and helped him escape prison. This Ludington soldier received [[nobility]] status and a family [[coat of arms]] for his efforts. The coat of arms is colored in [[argent]], [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], and [[gules]], and emblazoned with a [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|lion passant guardant]] and a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] featuring a palmer's staff. The [[motto]] reads: ''Probum non penitet'' (Honor not penitence).{{sfnp|Johnson|1907|p=4}}{{sfnp|Cutter|1914|p=1102}}

Johnson says the earliest record of a Ludington in America is from April 6, 1635. On that date the ship ''Hopewell'' sailed from London for [[Massachusetts Bay]] with seven boys and four girls ranging from 12 to 22 years of age. William Bundock was the captain of the ship, which had already made several previous voyages to America. Among the people on the ''Hopewell'' passenger list was a "Christiom" Ludington. However, there are no confirmed records of any history about her. There is also a mention of a Christopher Ludington in the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia colony]] prior to 1635, also with no confirmed history records. The first confirmed Ludingtons in America are William (1608–1663) and his wife Ellen (b. 1617), and they are considered the American progenitors.{{sfnp|Johnson|1907|p=7}}

== Genealogy ==
=== William Ludington ===
William Ludington and his wife Ellen are of unknown English origin, but are considered the base foundation of the American Ludingtons since there are confirmed history records on them.{{sfnp|Patrick|1886|pp=8–14}} They were married in England about 1636.{{sfnp|Patrick|1886|pp=8–14}} They immigrated to America about 1639 and settled in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], which later became [[Malden, Massachusetts]].{{sfnp|Cutter|1914|p=1102}}{{sfnp|Johnson|1907|p=8-9}} Court records of 1640 show that William built his residence outside the city limits, which was illegal, and was issued a high fine for the infraction.{{sfnp|Patrick|1886|pp=9–10}} The fine was rescinded because about this same time the law was repealed.{{sfnp|Cutter|1914|pp=1102–1103}} William and Ellen raised seven children (the first born in England).{{sfnp|Johnson|1907|pp=10–18}} After raising their children they moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut]], around 1660, where William died shortly thereafter, as his widow remarried on May 5, 1663, to John Rose.{{sfnp|Clemons|1907|p=265}}{{sfnp|Cutter|1914|p=1103}} Williams will was probated May 25, 1663.{{sfnp|Patrick|1886|pp=8–14}}

[[File:Albany Lumber Yard 1870s.png|thumb|Frank A. Jagger loads his boat full of lumber at the [[Albany Lumber District]] in [[Albany, New York]] in the 1870s]]

A '''lumber yard''' is a location where [[lumber]] and [[wood]]-related products used in [[construction]] and/or [[home improvement]] projects are processed or stored. Some lumber yards offer [[retail]] sales to consumers, and some of these may also provide services such as the use of [[Thickness planer|planer]]s, saws and other large machines.

Generally, '''timber yards''' are locations where raw [[Trunk (botany)|logs]] and other wood or [[forest product]]s are processed and stored.&lt;ref&gt;Döring, Stephan (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NU-NhpbJxFsC&amp;pg=PA72 ''Power from Pellets: Technology and Applications'']. Springer. pp. 72-74. {{ISBN|3642199623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "lumber yard" and "timber yard" are sometimes used interchangeably, and timber yards may include additional aspects that lumber yards encompass, and vice versa.

==Overview==
Lumber yards sell products made at [[lumber mill]]s,&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt; where customers pick up products at the yard themselves or request that an order be built and delivered to them by the lumber yard. Lumber yards may also sell wood-plastic composites, such as [[Trex (Composite Material)|Trex]], any other type of construction material or supplies, and general [[hardware store]] [[household hardware|items]]. Lumber yards are the primary resources for contractors and homeowners when construction material is needed. [[Home Depot]] stores also have lumber sections, but this may not be considered a ''lumber yard'', although it serves the same purpose. Lumber yards use [[forklift|forklift trucks]] to move the large heavy units of lumber around the yard. [[Saw]]s may also be available to cut boards to a desired length for customers.

At timber yards (also sometimes referred to as lumber yards), logs and other forest products are processed and stored.

===United States===

====Products====
Some lumber yards sell products that are assessed and certified by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]'s (FSC), per its standards. One lumber yard in [[Portland, Oregon]] limits its product line to only those that meet or exceed FSC's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portlandtribune.com/sl/158972-one-of-a-kind-lumber-yard-only-stocks-wood-that-meets-fsc-rules- | title=One-of-a-kind lumber yard only stocks wood that meets FSC rules | publisher=''[[Portland Tribune]]'' | date=August 15, 2013 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Law, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit environmental group in Portland, Oregon, began operations sourcing and purveying environmentally friendly "green wood" products.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703104575174541891049132 | title='Green Wood' Lumberyard Out on a Limb | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | date=April 12, 2010 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Carlton, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group specializes in offering wood products that are sourced from trees in non-threatened forests.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;

====Fires====
In the United States, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] has been documenting incidences of lumber yard fires since 1998.&lt;ref name="HCN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m.homechannelnews.com/article/recent-lumberyard-fires-bring-attention-safety | title=Recent lumberyard fires bring attention to safety | publisher=Home Channel News | accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products at lumber yards are very prone to fires, and electrical problems at lumber yards are a significant causation of fires.&lt;ref name="HCN"/&gt; In [[Murray, Utah]], after a large lumber yard fire caused approximately US$1 million in damage at the CECO Concrete Construction company, city residents called for companies in the city to take further preventative actions to prevent fires from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=3719268 | title=Neighbors calling for fire prevention requirements after lumberyard fire | publisher=KSL News | date=July 9, 2008 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Johnson, Whit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cities, such as [[Phoenix, Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phoenix.gov/webcms/groups/internet/@inter/@dept/@fire/@prev/documents/web_content/094048.pdf | title=Lumber Yards, Mulch Yards and Woodworking Facilities | publisher=Phoenix.gov | accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; city fire protection and prevention codes for lumber yards exist.

'''Manuel Egozcue y Cintrón''' was born in [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]] in 1855. After completing university he emigrated to [[Puerto Rico]], then an overseas [[province]] of Spain, to pursue commercial projects; quickly becoming prominent in island business circles.

He became an active member of the [[Partido Incondicional Español]] (the [[loyalist]] Spanish Unconditional Party) and held important public offices under the Spanish government, including the vice presidency of the ''Diputación Provincial'' (Provincial Legislature). In 1896 he was honored by the government with the [[Orden del Mérito Naval]] for services rendered to Spain's navy.

After the American occupation he joined the newly formed [[Republican Party of Puerto Rico]] (whose main goal was obtaining statehood status for the Island) and was assigned a place on its board of directors, working closely with party founder [[José Celso Barbosa]].

During the municipal elections of 1900, the first to be held since the beginning of the American occupation, the Republican Party achieved an overwhelming victory; this resulted in Egozcue Cintrón becoming [[Alcalde]] of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], a position he held until elected a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|First House of Delegates]] for the 1901-1902 term. Following the House's seasonal adjournment he was reappointed to fill the unexpired term of Alcalde.

In 1904 he was again elected mayor, but this last term would be truncated when territorial governor [[William Henry Hunt (judge)|William Henry Hunt]] ordered his removal from office following a corruption scandal that tainted much of city government. Although he was ultimately acquitted of all charges the ordeal nevertheless left him much affected, requiring his internment in a psychiatric hospital. Mayor Manuel Egozcue Cintrón died shortly after in 1906.

During Egozcue Cintrón's various terms as mayor an urban police corps was created to patrol the city. Also, $600,000 worth of [[municipal bond]]s were issued, resulting in full payment of city debt and the completion of an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]].

''The accompanying portrait of mayor Egozcue Cintrón is from a contemporaneous [[Pen and ink|ink drawing]] by Puerto Rican political [[caricaturist]] Mario Brau de Zuzuárregui.''

'''Medicon Valley''' is a leading international [[life sciences|life-sciences]] cluster in [[Europe]], spanning the [[Greater Copenhagen (metropolitan region)|Greater Copenhagen region]] of eastern [[Denmark]] and southern [[Sweden]]. It is one of Europe's strongest life science clusters, with a large number of life science companies and research institutions located within a relatively small geographical area. The name has officially been in use since 1997.

Major life science sectors of the Medicon Valley cluster includes [[pharmacology]], [[biotechnology]], [[Health technology|health tech]] and medical technology. It is specifically known for its research strengths in the areas of [[neurological disorders]], [[inflammatory diseases]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].
 
== Background and activities ==
The population of Medicon Valley reaches close to 4 million inhabitants. In 2008, 60% of Scandinavian pharmaceutical companies were located in the region. The area includes 17 universities, 32 hospitals, and more than 400&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediconvalley.com/industry/database|title=Medicon Valley Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; life science companies. 20 are large pharmaceutical or medical technology firms and 170 are dedicated biotechnology firms. Between 1998 and 2008, 100  new  biotechnology  and  medical  technology  companies  were  created here. The biotechnology industry alone employs around 41,000 people in the region, 7,000 of whom are academic researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mva.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/State_of_Medicon_Valley_2017.pdf|title=Medicon Valley report 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicon Valley Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

International companies with major research centres in the region include [[Novo Nordisk]], [[Baxter International|Baxter]], [[Lundbeck]], [http://www.leo-pharma.com/ LEO Pharma], [https://www.hemocue.com/ HemoCue] and [[Ferring Pharmaceuticals]]. There are more than 7 [[science park]]s in the region, all with a significant focus on life science, including the [[Medicon Village]] in Lund, established in 2010. Companies within Medicon Valley account for more than 20% of the total GDP of Denmark and Sweden combined.&lt;ref name="Basic Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mva.org/medicon-valley/ |title=Medicon Valley Region |publisher=Medicon Valley Alliance |accessdate=26 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= |title=The  life  science  cluster  of  Medicon  Valley,  Scandinavia |author1=Asheim, B.  |author2=J.

Medicon Valley is promoted by [[Invest in Skåne]] and Copenhagen Capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediconvalley.com/ Medicon Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the region's universities have a strong heritage in biological and medical research and have produced several Nobel Prize winners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/create_list.html?active=1&amp;cat%5B%5D=phy&amp;cat%5B%5D=che&amp;cat%5B%5D=med&amp;year1=Type+year&amp;year2=Type+year&amp;laureate=Type+a+name+or+names+of+a+Laureate&amp;born_in%5B%5D=14&amp;born_in%5B%5D=46&amp;born1_year=0&amp;born1_month=0&amp;born1_day=0&amp;born2_year=0&amp;born2_month=0&amp;born2_day=0&amp;sorting=default&amp;photos=1|title=Nobel Prize Laureates life-science SE and DK|last=|first=|date=|website=Nobelprize.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The almost century-long presence of a number of research-intensive and fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, such as Novo Nordisk, H. Lundbeck and [[LEO Pharma]], has also contributed significantly to the medical research and business development of the region by strengthening abilities within applied research, attracting suppliers and producing spin-offs.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://mva.org/about-mva/mvas-history/ MVA's History] Medicon Valley Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minister for Defence ===
[[File:Shaikh Mohmmed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Airforce.jpg|thumb|Sheikh Mohammed at the Dubai Air Show in 2007]]
On his return from military training to Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed's father appointed him head of the [[Dubai Police Force]] and the Dubai Defence Force, which was later to become part of the Union Defence Force.

A period of uncertainty and instability followed the Union of the United Arab Emirates, including skirmishes between tribes over property straddling new borders. On 24 January 1972, the exiled former ruler of the [[Emirate of Sharjah]], [[Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi]] led an insurrectionist coup against the ruler, [[Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = My Early Life|last = Al Qasimi|first = Sultan|publisher = Bloomsbury|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4088-1420-8|location = UK|pages = 283–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a spirited firefight between the [[Union Defence Force (UAE)|Union Defence Force]] and Saqr's forces - mostly Egyptian mercenaries who had entered the UAE through Ras Al Khaimah&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; - Sheikh Mohammed accepted Saqr's surrender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sheikh Khalid had been killed in the action, leading to the accession of his brother [[Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi]] as ruler of Sharjah. Mohammed delivered Saqr to Sheikh Zayed, who put him under house arrest in Al Ain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Now the Dust Has Settled|last=De Butts|first=Freddie|publisher=Tabb House|year=1995|isbn=1873951132|location=231|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Sheikh Mohammed was involved in protracted negotiations with the hijackers of [[Japan Air Lines Flight 404|JAL 404]], led by [[Japanese Red Army]] member Osamu Maruouka, which landed in Dubai after being hijacked as it departed Schiphol. Although unsuccessful in obtaining the release of the hostages (they were finally freed, and the 747 blown up, in Libya), he was more successful in a later negotiation with the three hijackers of [[KLM Flight 861|KLM 861]], who released the balance of their hostages and handed over the plane in return for safe passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dubaiasitusedtobe.com/dubaihijackhistory.shtm#.VENSSWeSy-4|title = A Brief History of Hijacking in Dubai|date = |accessdate = 1 October 2014|website = Dubai as it used to be|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141205015024/http://dubaiasitusedtobe.com/dubaihijackhistory.shtm#.VENSSWeSy-4|archivedate = 5 December 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==

Sheikh Mohammed has been responsible for the creation and growth of a number of businesses and economic assets of Dubai, with a number held by two companies under his ownership, [[Dubai World]] and [[Dubai Holding]].

Dubai World was launched on 2 July 2006, as a holding company consolidating a number of assets including logistics company [[DP World]], property developer [[Nakheel Properties]], and investment company [[Istithmar World]]. With more than 50,000 employees in over 100 cities around the globe, the group has real estate, logistics and other business investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa.

Dubai Holding develops and manages hospitality, business parks, real estate, and telecommunications through four operating units: [[Jumeirah (hotel chain)|Jumeirah Group]], [[Dubai Internet City|TECOM Investments]], [[Dubai Properties Group]] and Emirates International Telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eitl.ae/ | title=Emirates International Telecommunications LLC | publisher=Emirates International Telecommunications (EIT) | accessdate=27 October 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105133339/http://www.eitl.ae/ | archivedate=5 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's investment group operating units include [[Dubai Group]] and [[Dubai International Capital]].

He also holds a controlling interest in property developer, asset and event management, and investment company Meraas Holding which is currently developing a number of retail, lifestyle and themed developments in Dubai, including Legoland and a Bollywood movie theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenational.ae/business/markets/meraas-plans-ipo-of-theme-parks-unit-to-fund-dubai-entertainment-complex-construction|title = Meraas Plans IPO of Theme Parks Unit|last = Kassem|first = Mahmoud|date = 9 September 2014|work = The National|accessdate = 1 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141104105010/http://www.thenational.ae/business/markets/meraas-plans-ipo-of-theme-parks-unit-to-fund-dubai-entertainment-complex-construction|archivedate = 4 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Mohammed was responsible for the launch of [[Emirates airline|Emirates Airline]], as well as heading the development of both [[Dubai International Airport]] and [[Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International Airport]]. He was also behind the establishment of government-owned low-cost carrier [[Flydubai|FlyDubai]].

== Key businesses ==

=== Launch of Emirates Airline ===

Through the 1970s, as well as his role as head of Dubai Defence Force and UAE Minister of Defence, Sheikh Mohammed oversaw Dubai's energy resources and was in charge of Dubai Civil Aviation. It was in this latter role, in March 1985, that he tasked the then head of DNATA, [[Maurice Flanagan]], with launching a new airline to be called [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] after a dispute with Gulf Air over Dubai's 'Open Skies' policy. The launch budget of the airline was $10 million (the amount Flanagan said he needed to launch an airline) and its inaugural flight took place on 25 October 1985.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/about/the_emirates_story.aspx|title = The Emirates Story|access-date = 16 April 2018|website = Emirates |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141008060013/http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/about/the_emirates_story.aspx|archivedate = 8 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Mohammed made his (younger) uncle, [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum|Ahmed bin Saeed]] chairman of the new company. A further $75 million in facilities and materials was provided, but Emirates has always maintained it has received no further subsidies throughout the company's meteoric growth to become one of the world's leading airlines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1989, Sheikh Mohammed inaugurated the first [[Dubai Airshow]]: in 2013 the exhibition had grown to over 1,000 exhibiting companies, and was the venue for Emirates' placement of the largest aeroplane order in history, with $99 billion combined orders with [[Airbus]] for its [[Airbus A380|A380]] and [[Boeing]] for its [[Boeing 777X|777X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/about/news/news_detail.aspx?article=1443077|title = Emirates announces largest-ever aircraft order|date = |accessdate = 3 October 2016|website = emirates.com|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161008200024/http://www.emirates.com/ae/english/about/news/news_detail.aspx?article=1443077|archivedate = 8 October 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dubai Ports World ===

In 1991, Sheikh Mohammed merged the Jebel Ali Port and Free Zone and Port Rashid to form the Dubai Ports Authority. In 1999, he founded Dubai Ports International to explore overseas acquisitions and management contracts which, in 2005, was folded into the Dubai Ports Authority to form [[DP World]]. In 2006, the company acquired [[P&amp;O (company)|P&amp;O]] for $7 billion. The acquisition led to the [[Dubai Ports World controversy|DP World controversy]] after a number of US politicians and lobbyists raised concerns regarding the safety of six ports acquired by DP World as part of the acquisition of P&amp;O. DP World subsequently divested the ports in question.

A profitable global enterprise, DP World today is one of the largest marine terminal operators in the world. The company operates more than 77 terminals across six continents, with container handling generating some 80% of its revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dpworld.ae/en/content/10/3 | title=About DP World | publisher=DP World | accessdate=27 October 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028022317/http://dpworld.ae/en/content/10/3 | archivedate=28 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah ===

The [[Burj Al Arab]] was inaugurated in December 1999. The hotel, constructed from a design by [[Atkins (company)|WS Atkins]] in response to a brief from Sheikh Mohammed to create a truly iconic building, styles itself as "the world's most luxurious hotel". It was constructed on an island offshore from the [[Jumeirah Beach Hotel]], the first property managed by Jumeirah,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jumeirah.com/Global/Jumeirah%20Group/Press%20Centre%20(1)/Press%20Kits/Jumeirah%20Beach%20Hotel%20-%20Media%20Fact%20File.pdf|title = Jumeirah Beach Hotel Fact File (PDF)|date = |accessdate = 1 October 2014|website = Jumeirah|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141019093400/http://www.jumeirah.com/Global/Jumeirah%20Group/Press%20Centre%20%281%29/Press%20Kits/Jumeirah%20Beach%20Hotel%20-%20Media%20Fact%20File.pdf|archivedate = 19 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hotel management company launched by Sheikh Mohammed in 1997 and headed by ex-Trust House Forte executive [http://www.jumeirah.com/en/jumeirah-group/about-jumeirah-group/executive-team/president-and-group-ceo-jumeirah-group/ Gerald Lawless]. In fact, work began on both hotels at the same time, but the island to house the Burj Al Arab required three years to build before construction began above ground. Jumeirah's international expansion, driven after it became part of [[Dubai Holding]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/15138-ceo-interview-jumeirahs-gerald-lawless/|title = Jumeirah's Gerald Lawless|last = Oakley|first = Louise|date = |work = Hotelier Middle East|accessdate = 1 October 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027203345/http://www.hoteliermiddleeast.com/15138-ceo-interview-jumeirahs-gerald-lawless/|archivedate = 27 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompasses 22 hotels in ten countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jumeirah.com/en/jumeirah-group/portfolio/jumeirah-hotels--resorts/|title = Jumeirah Portfolio|date = |accessdate = 1 October 2014|website = Jumeirah|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140929160306/http://www.jumeirah.com/en/jumeirah-group/portfolio/jumeirah-hotels--resorts/|archivedate = 29 September 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dubai Internet City and TECOM ===

On 29 October 1999, Sheikh Mohammed announced [[Dubai Internet City]], a technology hub and free trade zone. Offering companies long leases, full ownership, and fast access to government services, DIC grew from its first tenants in October 2000, to a current zone employing some 15,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dubaiinternetcity.com/about-dic|title = About DIC|date = |accessdate = 1 October 2014|website = Dubai Internet City|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20141019103723/http://www.dubaiinternetcity.com/about-dic|archivedate = 19 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, it was joined by [[Dubai Media City]], a content and media production-free zone which is co-located with DIC. The launch of DIC came with assurances from Sheikh Mohammed regarding media freedoms. In 2007, he issued a decree banning the imprisonment of journalists following an incident in which local journalists were accused of libel and sentenced to jail terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/sep/26/pressreedomboostasdubaiss|title = Press freedom boost as Dubai's Sheikh says journalists won't go to jail|last = Greenslade|first = Roy|date = September 2007|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 1 October 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141005182243/http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/sep/26/pressreedomboostasdubaiss|archivedate = 5 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other media and technology-related free zones have since been established by holding company [[TECOM Group|TECOM]] in Dubai, including: the [[International Media Production Zone]], [[Dubai Silicon Oasis]], [[Dubai Studio City]], [[Dubai Healthcare City]], [[Dubai Industrial City]] and [[Dubai Knowledge Village]].

=== Palm Islands ===

Developed by Nakheel Properties, part of Dubai World, the development of the three planned [[Palm Islands]] was halted by the global financial crisis of 2009. The first of the islands, the [[Palm Jumeirah]], has been completed and developed, while the second, the [[Palm Jebel Ali]], has completed land reclamation but not been further developed. The third and largest Palm, the Palm Deira, has been scaled back and re-launched as the [[Deira Island]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/business/property/uae/nakheel-to-restart-scaled-back-palm-deira-1.1240906|title = Nakheel to restart scaled back Palm Deira|last = |first = |date = 8 October 2013|work = Gulf News|accessdate = 1 November 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141027161337/http://gulfnews.com/business/property/uae/nakheel-to-restart-scaled-back-palm-deira-1.1240906|archivedate = 27 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burj Khalifa ===

On 4 January 2010, Sheikh Mohammed opened [[Burj Khalifa]], the world's tallest building, with a display of some 10,000 fireworks. It forms the centre of the $20 billion [[downtown Dubai]] development of mixed use towers, buildings, and retail outlets. The development is also home to the world's largest shopping mall by total area in the world, [[The Dubai Mall]]. Originally conceived as a development around an 80-story tower, the project team was sent away to return with "the greatest neighbourhood known to man".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He has said of the tower that it is "a national accomplishment, a historic milestone and a key economic turning point. It is a symbol of pride, not only to the Emirati people but to all Arabs."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Flashes of Thought|last = Maktoum|first = Mohammed|publisher = Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-86063-356-0|location = UAE|pages = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political reform ==

On 3 January 1995, Sheikh Mohammed's elder brother [[Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum]] signed two decrees that appointed him [[Crown Prince]] of Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://government.ae/en/about-the-uae/the-uae-government/government-leaders/h-h-sheikh-mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum|title=H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - The Official Portal of the UAE Government|website=government.ae|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh Mohammed, at the time of being appointed crown prince, also served as Minister of Defence, a position held since 9 December 1971.

After roughly a decade of [[de facto]] rule, he became the Ruler of Dubai on 4 January 2006 upon the death of Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wheeler |first=Julia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4582236.stm |title=Dubai's formidable new ruler |newspaper=BBC News |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=30 March 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231000857/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4582236.stm |archivedate=31 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the [[Federal National Council]] selected him as the new Vice President of the UAE. On 11 February, the Council approved [[President of the United Arab Emirates|President]] [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]]'s nomination of Sheikh Mohammed for Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uaepm.ae/English/PrimeMinister/Pages/Biography.aspx | title=The Official Website of the Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates | publisher=United Arab Emirates Prime Minister (archived URL) | accessdate=27 October 2016 | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125110449/http://uaepm.ae/English/PrimeMinister/Pages/Biography.aspx | archivedate=25 January 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Sheikh Mohammed announced a strategic review of the Federation's governance at both the Federal and local government levels. The UAE Federal Government Strategy, a process of strategic reform intended to address a lack of co-ordination and strategic planning in government, as well as policy making issues and deficiencies in the legislative and regulatory framework, would work on improvements in social development, economic development, public sector development, justice and safety, infrastructure, and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2007/April/theuae_April481.xml&amp;section=theuae|title=Shaikh Mohammed unveils federal government strategy|last=|first=|date=17 April 2007|work=Khaleej Times|access-date=|via=|accessdate=1 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026074410/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2007%2FApril%2Ftheuae_April481.xml&amp;section=theuae|archivedate=26 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the announcement in February 2010 of Vision 2021, a long term strategy and national agenda.

=== Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government ===

The [[Dubai School of Government|Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government]] (previously the Dubai School of Government) is an academic and research institution in the area of public policy and administration focused on the United Arab Emirates and the Arab world. Established in 2005, the School aims to promote and support excellence in governance through enhancing the region's capacity for effective public policy.

Toward this goal, the school maintains ties, and collaborates with, regional and global institutions in its research and training programs, and organizes policy forums and international conferences to facilitate the exchange of ideas and promote critical debate on public policy in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.mbrsg.ae/HOME.aspx?lang=en-US|title =MBRSG|date =|accessdate =1 November 2014|website =Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141102082140/http://www.mbrsg.ae/HOME.aspx?lang=en-US|archivedate =2 November 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school supports research and teaching programs including: applied research and master's degree in public policy and management; executive education for senior officials and executives; and knowledge forums for scholars and policy makers.

=== Moves against corruption ===

Signalling a zero tolerance policy towards corruption in government, in 2001, Sheikh Mohammed ordered the arrest of Obaid Saqr bin-Busit, the head of Dubai Customs and the chairman of the World Customs Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1163740.stm|title = Customs chief on corruption charges|last = |first = |date = 10 February 2001|work = BBC News|access-date = 1 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107163830/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1163740.stm|archivedate = 7 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busit and two aides, as well as three other employees, had been the subject of a two-year investigation for corruption. The high-profile arrests caused widespread shock and were followed by a slew of arrests of public officials later that month; in all, fourteen officials, including six senior officers, were arrested and charged with offences related to corruption. Unusually, the officials were publicly 'named and shamed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/14-government-officials-arrested-for-corruption-1.415529|title = 14 government officials arrested for corruption|last = |first = |date = 18 February 2001|work = Gulf News|accessdate = 11 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107145019/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/14-government-officials-arrested-for-corruption-1.415529|archivedate = 7 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the downturn exposed issues related to corruption at government-owned Dubai real estate company Deyaar.

Mohammed has been recorded to make surprise visits to ministerial departments and [[Online shaming|publicly humiliate]] offices in which staff had not been available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcalist.co.il/world/articles/0,7340,L-3696586,00.html | title=Ruler of Dubai: made a surprise visit and found empty offices (trans.)

The [[Mohammed bin Rashid Global Initiatives|Mohammed Bin Rashid Global Initiatives]] is a charitable foundation which consolidates the work of some 33 charitable foundations, entities and initiatives which together implement more than 1,400 development programs, contributing to the support of more than 130 million people in 116 countries in collaboration with over 280 strategic partners, including governmental institutions, [[private sector]] companies, as well as regional and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;The Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, Year in Review 2016, First Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aid to Palestine ===

Sheikh Mohammed has made a number of charitable donations to Palestinian causes in its struggle against Israeli occupation.&lt;ref name="Al Ras"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/mohammed-boosts-fund-for-palestinians-1.383155|title = Mohammed boosts fund for Palestinians|last = Al Ras|first = Haya Farouk|date = 2 April 2002|work = Gulf News|accessdate = 1 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107142932/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/mohammed-boosts-fund-for-palestinians-1.383155|archivedate = 7 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a grant of 600 houses to Gaza following the Israeli incursions of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/vp-donates-600-houses-palestinians-gaza|title = VP donates 600 houses to Palestinians in Gaza|last = |first = |date = 10 January 2009|work = Reliefweb|accessdate = 1 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107142427/http://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/vp-donates-600-houses-palestinians-gaza|archivedate = 7 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he cancelled New Year celebrations and the official opening of the Dubai Shopping Festival to mark solidarity with the Palestinians, as well as donations for refugees displaced by Israeli actions. Reflecting widespread public reaction to the events, and part of a groundswell of donations from prominent Emirati citizens, he also dedicated his victory and prize money from winning a major endurance race in Bahrain on 10 January 2009 to the Palestinian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09ABUDHABI34_a.html|title = HUMANITARIAN AID THE FOCUS OF PUBLIC EFFORTS ON GAZA|date = 11 January 2009|accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Wikileaks|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107141613/http://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09ABUDHABI34_a.html|archivedate = 7 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has frequently alluded to the need to pursue a two-state solution and negotiate a settlement to the Palestinian issue before any normalisation of relations with Israel.

The following year, some 15,000 refugees were repatriated from the Afghan/Pakistan border where they had been housed in the temporary accommodation.

=== Aiding mosque construction in the Netherlands ===
In 2000, Sheikh Mohammed donated [[Euro|€]]4 million for the construction of the [[:nl:Essalammoskee|Essalaam Mosque]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotterdam mosque: complete or demolish?|url=https://www.rnw.org/archive/rotterdam-mosque-complete-or-demolish|website=RNW Media|accessdate=8 July 2017|language=English|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129014257/http://www.rnw.org/archive/rotterdam-mosque-complete-or-demolish|archivedate=29 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roose|first1=Eric|title=The Architectural Representation of Islam: Muslim-commissioned Mosque Design in the Netherlands|date=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789089641335|page=236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDhoNLbM45gC&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, two new initiatives were added to the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, within the "Empowering Communities" sector, namely the International Institute for Tolerance and the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Award for Tolerance. In this respect, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum issued Law No. (9) of 2017 on the Establishment of the International Institute for Tolerance and Decree No. (23) of 2017 on the Formation of a Board of Trustees and Decree No. (28) of 2017 on the Appointment of a Managing Director for the International Institute for Tolerance. In this respect, Law No. (9) of 2017 includes the launch of the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Award for Tolerance, administered in accordance with the provisions and statute of said Law. Hence, the establishment of the International Institute for Tolerance aims at instilling a spirit of tolerance across the community, building a cohesive society, strengthening the UAE's standing and position as a model of tolerance, as well as renouncing extremism and all forms of discrimination among people on the basis of religion, sex, race, color or language, in addition to honoring all entities and institutions contributing to the promotion of tolerance and open, interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302620195 Mohammed bin Rashid issues law on establishing International Institute for Tolerance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801081432/http://wam.ae/en/details/1395302620195 |date=1 August 2017 }}, Emirates News Agency, Retrieved 21 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Racing silks of Sheikh Mohammed.svg|thumb|[[jockey|Racing silks]] of [[Darley Racing|Darley Stable]]]]

Sheikh Mohammed is a major figure in international [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] and [[Horse breeding|breeding]]. He owns [[Darley Stud]], the biggest horse breeding operation in the world with farms in the United States, Ireland, England, and Australia. In 1985 he bought the [[Irish Thoroughbred]] [[Park Appeal]] for an undisclosed sum at the end of her second season. She went on to produce at least nine winners from twelve foals and is the ancestor of many successful horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Timeform staff|title = Racehorses of 1984|publisher = Timeform|year = 1985|isbn = 0-900599-40-5}}

Sheikh Mohammed had raced horses as a child (he would share his breakfast with his horse on the way to school)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.godolphin.com/about-us/our-founder/|title = Our Founder|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Godolphin|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028115114/http://www.godolphin.com/about-us/our-founder/|archivedate = 28 October 2014|df = dmy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but he attended his first formal race at Newmarket in 1967, with his brother Hamdan, watching [[Royal Palace (horse)|Royal Palace]] win the 2,000 [[guineas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=eb0d5c1090cc4110VgnVCM1000007064a8c0RCRD|title = The Equestrian|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Sheikh Mohammed|publisher = |last = |first = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming an owner in his own right, ten years later he won his first race with Hatta at Brighton. And five years after that, he and Hamdan had three studs and 100 horses under training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.broughscott.com/story.asp?NewsID=1514|title = Sheikh Mohammed outlines his vision|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Brough Scott|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160306202732/http://broughscott.com/story.asp?newsid=1514|archivedate = 6 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1981, he purchased [[Gainsborough Stud]] at [[Woolton Hill]], near [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Berkshire]], United Kingdom. He owns [[Ballysheehan Stud]] in [[County Tipperary]], Ireland; as well as [[Gainsborough Farm Inc.]] in [[Versailles, Kentucky]], United States. His racing operations include the ownership of [[Darley Racing|Darley Stables]] and he is the leading partner in his family's [[Godolphin Stables]]. Sheikh Mohammed hosts the [[Dubai World Cup]] at [[Meydan Racecourse]].

By 1992, Sheikh Mohammed had started 'wintering' his horses in Dubai, frequently against the advice of trainers and pundits in the UK. The results were a string of high-profile wins, and by 1994 he founded Godolphin. In 1995, his hands-on approach to racing resulted in a major split with leading trainer Henry Cecil after a disagreement over racing a horse Mohammed insisted was injured. Cecil took the argument public and Mohammed removed all his horses from Cecil's stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sheikh-speaks-out-on-cecil-1344214.html|title = Sheikh Speaks Out On Cecil|last = Edmonson|first = Richard|date = 26 March 1996|work = The Independent|accessdate = 1 November 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141105004412/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sheikh-speaks-out-on-cecil-1344214.html|archivedate = 5 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Godolphin's first win, [[Balanchine (horse)|Balanchine]] taking the Oaks at Epsom Downs, England, in 1994, was to mark the beginning of a winning streak with horses such as: [[Lammtarra]], [[Daylami]], [[Fantastic Light]], [[Street Cry]], [[Sulamani]], [[Dubawi]], and [[Ramonti]] among them. [[Dubai Millennium]], said to be Sheikh Mohammed's favourite, won nine of his ten starts before succumbing to injury followed by grass sickness in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dubai Millennium: A Vision Realised, A Dream Lost|last = Pagones|first = Rachel|publisher = Highdown|year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-905156-32-0|location = UK|pages = 118}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Dubai World Cup was inaugurated as the world's richest horserace, drawing the legendary American dirt track horse [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]] to race in Dubai. Today, held at the Meydan Racecourse, the race meeting carries a prize of $27 million.

In the UK, his horses have won [[Group One]] races including several of the [[British Classic Races]]. His horses have also won the [[Irish Derby Stakes]], the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] and, the [[2006 Preakness Stakes|2006]] [[Preakness Stakes]] with [[Bernardini (horse)|Bernardini]] in the US. In 2008, he bought the Woodlands Stud empire for more than $460 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/meet-racings-new-king/2008/03/24/1206207012905.html|title = Meet racing's new king|newspaper = SMH|year = 2011|accessdate = 6 September 2011|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121108192340/http://www.smh.com.au/news/horseracing/meet-racings-new-king/2008/03/24/1206207012905.html|archivedate = 8 November 2012|df = dmy-all}}

Both his thoroughbreds and endurance horses have failed drug tests - although his trainers (including [[Mahmood Al Zarooni]]) have accepted the blame. His endurance racing stable has also been involved in other scandals, including both fatal injuries, and ringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/equestrianism/11334418/FEI-faces-backlash-after-Maktoum-ringer-inquiry-ends-with-no-disciplinary-action.html|title = FEI faces backlash after Maktoum 'ringer' inquiry ends with no disciplinary action|newspaper = The Telegraph|year = 2015|accessdate = 6 June 2015|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150709104020/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/equestrianism/11334418/FEI-faces-backlash-after-Maktoum-ringer-inquiry-ends-with-no-disciplinary-action.html|archivedate = 9 July 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural humanitarianism ==

Sheikh Mohammed is a poet in classical Arabic as well as the Bedouin (colloquial) [[Arabic poetry|Nabati]] style.&lt;ref name="poetry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6d1d5c1090cc4110VgnVCM1000007064a8c0RCRD|title=The Poet|publisher=Sheikh Mohammed|date=30 September 2000|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518122811/http://www.sheikhmohammed.co.ae/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=6d1d5c1090cc4110VgnVCM1000007064a8c0RCRD|archivedate=18 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing poetry as a young man, using pseudonyms such as 'Saleet' so his poetry would not be associated with the son of the then Ruler of Dubai. He received encouragement from the poet [[Ousha the Poet|Fatat Al Arab]], when she composed a reply to one of his earliest poems.

In 1998, he set up the [[Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Cultural Understanding]] (SMCCU), a not-for-profit organisation that aims to raise awareness and demystify the local culture, customs, and religion of the United Arab Emirates. Operating under the motto "Open Doors. Open Minds", SMCCU aims to improve cross-cultural understanding and communication between UAE locals and guests visiting or residing in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cultures.ae/index.php/aboutus|title = About Us|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Centre for Cultural Understanding|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141102090930/http://www.cultures.ae/index.php/aboutus|archivedate = 2 November 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patrons of the Arts Awards===

Sheikh Mohammed established the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Patrons of the Arts Awards in March 2009 to honour individuals and organisations who have contributed towards arts development in Dubai. The award allows artists and projects to benefit from the private sector's support under four categories: Distinguished Patrons of the Arts (AED 15 million), Patrons of the Arts (AED 2–5 million), Supporters of the Arts (AED 500,000), and Friends of the Arts (AED 50,000–500,000). The award aims to grant financial or in kind support  to the visual and performing arts, literature, and film sectors, which contribute to enriching the artistic and cultural scene in Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.patronsofthearts.ae/|title = Patrons of the Arts|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2014|website = Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Patrons Of The Arts Awards|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141217235944/http://patronsofthearts.ae/|archivedate = 17 December 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child camel jockeys ===
In 2006, a UNICEF-sponsored program with the UAE government resulted in the repatriation of hundreds of children formerly enslaved as camel jockeys, and provided them with social services and compensation upon return to their home countries of Pakistan, Sudan, Mauritania, and Bangladesh. The UAE government set aside US$2.7 million in initial funding in 2005 with an additional US$9 million for the second phase, and to enforce compliance, adopted a law officially banning the practice with penalties of jail time and a $US27,200 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uae-us.org/page.cfm?id=63|title=Initiatives to Combat Human Trafficking|publisher=UAE Embassy|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229160217/http://uae-us.org/page.cfm?id=63|archivedate=29 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNICEF endorsed the UAE's efforts and expressed the hopes that "the UAE's programme will serve as a model to other countries in the region, as a means of ending all forms of exploitation of children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_26692.html|title=UAE supports UNICEF in safe return of camel jockeys to home countries|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510102714/http://www.unicef.org/media/media_26692.html|archivedate=10 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Sheikh Mohammed was accused of encouraging the abduction and enslavement of thousands of boys for use as [[jockey]]s in [[camel racing|camel races]]. A [[class-action]] suit was filed against him in the US state of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dubai-princes-accused-of-masterminding-trade-in-jockey-slaves-416101.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|title=Dubai princes accused of masterminding trade in jockey slaves|first=Andrew|last=Gumbel|date=15 September 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303142836/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dubai-princes-accused-of-masterminding-trade-in-jockey-slaves-416101.html|archivedate=3 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5346430.stm|newspaper=BBC News|title=Dubai's ruler accused of slavery|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202134935/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5346430.stm|archivedate=2 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/dubai-leader-faces-charges-of-enslavement/62611/|title=A Dubai Leader Faces Charges of Enslavement|newspaper=The New York Sun|date=14 September 2007|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013002829/http://www.nysun.com/foreign/dubai-leader-faces-charges-of-enslavement/62611/|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, American lawyers representing the UAE raised a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that none of the involved parties resided in the U.S., arguing that the UN program best served the interests of the children.

=== Horse racing ===
In October 2013, scandal returned to Sheikh Mohammed in the venue of horseracing, with reports of potentially toxic and dangerous steroids, anaesthetics, and anti-inflammatory drugs being shipped into UAE, mislabeled as "horse tack". ''The Telegraph'' commented that a "PR campaign is already underway, with Sheikh Mohammed again cast as a victim of employee malpractice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/10345803/Sheikh-Mohammeds-equine-operations-must-not-be-above-the-law-after-recent-drug-scandals.html|work=Telegraph|title=Sheikh Mohammed's equine operations must not be above the law after recent drug scandals|last=Hayward|first=Paul|date=1 October 2014|accessdate=27 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227234415/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/10345803/Sheikh-Mohammeds-equine-operations-must-not-be-above-the-law-after-recent-drug-scandals.html|archivedate=27 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financials ===
Bin Ismail was listed as one of the 40 richest men in Malaysia in 2011&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with an estimated net worth of $155 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/84/malaysia-rich-10_Rozali-Ismail_JTR9.html|title=Malaysia's Richest - #35 Rozali Ismail|publisher=Forbes.com|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Puncak Niaga Annual Report 2012, his total numeration fell within the RM33.3-RM33.4 million band during the financial year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} His lucrative remuneration package has drawn public ire given the unsatisfactory level of water services in Selangor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/investigate-syabas-bosss-rm33-4-million-salary-says-dap-17726}}&lt;/ref&gt; His salary is a whooping RM 5.1 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;http://jelas.info/2009/03/20/water-scandal-summarising-bns-massive-conjob-or-how-you-are-making-the-super-rich-rozali-ismail-even-richer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/miserable-residents-blast-syabas-for-unsystematic-water-supply/&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Puncak Niaga ===
Puncak Niaga was founded by Bin Ismail in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=882666|title=Company Overview of Puncak Niaga Holdings Berhad|last=|first=|date=|website=Bloomberg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company orchestrated early water concession in Kuala Lumpur. Ismail's ties to Selangor politicians enabled him to facilitate public-private partnerships and influence the decision to employ a three-stage water treatment scheme in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=5B00DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=uk#v=snippet&amp;q=puncak%20niaga&amp;f=false|title=Asia after the Developmental State: Disembedding Autonomy|last=Carroll|first=Toby|last2=Jarvis|first2=Darryl S. L.|date=2017-10-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107137165|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Puncak Niaga is the parent company of SYABAS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In October 2015 both companies were taken over by the Selangor state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/10/syabas-puncak-niaga-takeover-oct-15|title=Syabas, Puncak Niaga takeover on Oct 15|date=2015-10-03|work=NST Online|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018 Syarikat Pengeluar Air Sungai Selangor (SPLASH) filed a suit against SYABAS, claiming RM 4.22 billion in outstanding receivables. According to the chairman of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), Tan Gim Tuan, since the government took over, Syabas had reported massive annual losses every year. He further claimed that the suit could bankrupt the whole state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/13/mca-is-selangor-govt-heading-towards-bankruptcy-following-splash-lawsuit/|title=MCA: Is Selangor govt heading towards bankruptcy following SPLASH lawsuit? - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
In the political scene, Rozali was the treasurer of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) Selangor and UMNO Hulu Selangor Division.

Rozali is also the adviser for the Sultan Idris Shah Polytechnics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2012&amp;dt=0520&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Kota&amp;pg=wk_02.htm|title=8.2 peratus graduan PSIS dapat pekerjaaan|publisher=Utusan Malaysia|date=20 May 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozali bin Ismail is the Chairman of [[Gabungan Wawasan Generasi Felda]] (GWGF) – a group of 14 non-government organizations that speak for settlers and their families nationwide, estimated at some 600,000 people. In 2017 he called to disclose the identity of those responsible in the land ownership transfer, to reveal the identities of those involved in the suspicious RM200 million sale of Felda's land in Jalan Semarak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/317325/expose-those-behind-shady-felda-deal|title=Expose those behind the shady Felda deal|last=Norrasyidah|first=Arshad|date=22 Dec 2017|work=New Straits Times|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018  bin Ismail announced that GWGF would continue to support the [[Barisan Nasional|Barisan Nasional Party]] and the United Malays National Organization Government in Malaysia's 14th general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2018/04/354337/gwgf-pledges-continued-undivided-support-bn-and-najib|title=GWGF pledges continued, undivided support for BN and Najib|last=Arumugam|first=Tharanya|date=7 Apr 2018|work=New Straits Times|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12317">'''Sales outsourcing''' is a way for companies to attract increased, high volumes of sales for their products or services by using a third party. The company typically uses outsourcing companies to improve sales volumes without links to the sales teams that carry out those campaigns. The company that undertakes the outsourcing will normally be paid based on the results they are able to generate, and therefore creates a mutually beneficial situation for both client and the outsourcing company. 

== Background ==
Full 'sales outsourcing' is observed when companies have an external third party [[sales]] force. It is differentiated from [[Value-added re seller|value added reselling]] or [[Distributor (business)|distribution]] in that the [[business model]] can be based on shared risk, although there are models where the outsourcer is paid for all of their activity - just as with a hired [[direct sales]] force, but the outsourcer provides rapidity, flexibility and experience. 
Other names for sales outsourcing include 'indirect sales' and 'channel sales'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trickle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full sales outsourcing is different from [[telemarketing]] in that it requires direct recruitment of sales personnel with specific backgrounds for each sales campaign. Usually the sales executives will be part of a team that may include telemarketing, [[marketing]], tools systems and methodologies as well as [[sales management]].

Sales [[outsourcing]] firms provide [[accountability]] regarding all sales results and activities while representing the brand of the client. For the end-customer, it usually appears as if the sales team sold the product themselves rather than the sales outsourcing firm. The outsourcing firm is, in essence, an extension of the client but is responsible for all operations associated with direct sales activities, often receiving sales engineering and initial product/service [[training]] support from the client.

== Purpose of indirect sales ==
The sole purpose of a contract sales organization is to provide sales resource to its clients, without taking title to their products.  Sales outsourcing providers include [[manufacturers' representative]]s, contract sales organizations, sales agents or sales outsourcing consultants. One way of organising the sales effort, especially when product delivery is erratic, is to replace or supplement internal resources with [[wikt:function|functionality]] and expertise brought in from contract sales organisations.

Sales outsourcing is quite different from large-scale service outsourcing, which has its advantages but also requires pro-active contract and relationship management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novick|first=H. J.|title=Selling through independent reps|year=2000|publisher=AMACOM|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to full sales outsourcing, many partial models are observed, particularly in large firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Sales outsourcing is expected to be cheaper than the fully loaded cost of employing salespeople, but calculating the cost comparison over time is far from straightforward. Nevertheless, replacing fixed costs with variable costs is attractive to budget-holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike many forms of outsourcing, the advantages of sales outsourcing does not often come from saving costs but rather increasing [[revenue]] or providing speed of response or flexibility.

The [[business case]] for sales outsourcing should also include consideration of the cost of controlling the contract.  Difficulty in measuring the link between sales activity and sales performance leads to a preference for employed salespeople.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krafft|first=M |author2=Albers, S. |author3=Lal, R.|title=Relative Explanatory Power of Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Analysis in German Salesforces|journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing|year=2004|volume=21|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2003.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the issues internally are often the same and the internal hire has many other corporate "distractions" that do not occur with external resources.

Companies may also choose sales outsourcing as a means of accessing the best sales skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[pejorative]] term “rent-a-rep” is still used, there is some evidence that contractors are perceived as good performers against qualitative as well as quantitative performance criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=E|title=Outsourcing the sales function: The real cost of field sales|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/South-western|location=Mason, Ohio|author2=Trinkle }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the reputational risk of third parties handling customer relationships has been observed as a factor restricting sales outsourcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=A M |author2=Anderson E |author3=MacInnis D J|title=Reputation Management as a Motivation for Sales Structure Decisions|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1999|volume=63|pages=74–89|doi=10.2307/1251975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One could argue that an employee is often using a company to gain 2–3 years salary and experience whereas a sales outsourcing firm would usually be looking at a long term contract even though the staff may change during that time. So the aims of an outsourcer can be closely aligned with the aims and objectives of the contracting company.

A recent study has highlighted flexibility as an important driver for outsourcing sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=An exploratory study of the make-or-buy decision in pharmaceutical sales|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=11–20|doi=10.1057/jmm.2008.32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain business environments accentuate the need to turn sales resource on and off quickly. Industries and companies undergoing rapid change may need to avoid hiring and firing costs and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downey|first=J. M.|title=Risks of outsourcing - applying risk management to staffing methods|journal=Facilities|year=1995|volume=13|series=9/10|pages=38–44|doi=10.1108/02632779510095617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract sales organizations can absorb employment risk, enabling their clients to respond to short-term opportunities or competitor activity (see [[Lean startup#Philosophy|Lean startup]]). However, an outsourcer may build in more of a premium to the rate or commission if excessive flexibility is required on a contract.

Contract sales organizations are growing in volume and influence, able to provide both tactical activity and long-term strategic support to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=B|title=Contract sales organizations (CSOs): making the transition from tactical resource to strategic partnering|journal=Journal of Medical Marketing|year=2008|volume=8|series=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1057/palgrave.jmm.5050119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salespartnerships.com/resources/articles/contract-pharmaceutical-sales-pharma-landscape|title=Contract Pharmaceutical Sales: The Changing Pharma Landscape|date=2017-09-06|work=Sales Partnerships|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speed of response is seen as a key reason to use an outsourcer. If a company was looking to enter a market it may take several months to recruit the local manager which then takes several months to find an office and build a team. With an outsourcer, a full working team can oftentimes be operational within a matter of days or weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poulter|first=Julian|title=Selling People Ltd|newspaper=Sales outsourcing alternatives|date=2005-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sales outsourcing can also be used as a [[market entry strategy]] and avoids [[permanent establishment]] risk.

==Indirect sales growth rate==
The experience of many organizations over the past several years demonstrates that indirect channels can be critical to expanding market coverage. This has been particularly true in the [[electronics]], [[communications]] and [[high tech]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=What is a Master Agent?|url=http://www.telarus.com/why-telarus.php|publisher=Telecom Channel News|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the indirect channel now accounts for 66 percent of overall technology sales, up from 53 percent in 1997.

==Examples of indirect sales companies==
Some examples of communications companies who employ indirect sales forces to their internal sales efforts include:  [[Airespring|AireSpring]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Comcast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oborn|first=Patrick|title=Comcast Solution Provider Program|url=http://www.telarus.com/carrier-information/comcast-business.html|publisher=Telecom Channel Association|accessdate=4 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128124010/http://www.telarus.com/carrier-information/comcast-business.html|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EarthLink|Earthlink Business]], [[Integra Telecom]], [[Level 3 Communications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holverson|first=Austin|title=Level 3 Debuts New Channel Partner Program; Introduces Tiered Structure and Enhanced Support Resources|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/level-3-debuts-new-channel-partner-program;-introduces-tiered-structure-and-enhanced-support-resources.html|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=Telecom Channel Updates|date=4 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407082959/http://www.telarus.com/industry/level-3-debuts-new-channel-partner-program;-introduces-tiered-structure-and-enhanced-support-resources.html|archivedate=7 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Time Warner Cable]], [[TelePacific Communications|TelePacific]], [[tw telecom]], [[XO Communications]], and [[Windstream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=Carriers in the Channel|url=http://www.telarus.com/carriers.html|publisher=Telecom Channel Updates|accessdate=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226073857/http://www.telarus.com/carriers.html|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some top sales agencies who sell voice and data services for these carriers include [[Telarus]], based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], Intelisys, based in [[Petaluma, California]], and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Agent Program|url=http://www.telarus.com/carrier-information/comcast-business.html|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=Channel Partners|date=14 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320204929/http://www.telarus.com/carrier-information/comcast-business.html|archivedate=20 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chugg|first=Justin|title=Comcast Business Services Enters Into Master Agent Agreement with Telarus|url=http://www.telarus.com/news/comcast-business-services-enters-into-master-agent-agreement-with-telarus.html|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=Telarus Industry News Briefs|date=14 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321221607/http://www.telarus.com/news/comcast-business-services-enters-into-master-agent-agreement-with-telarus.html|archivedate=21 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarao Motors, Inc.''' is a Filipino [[automotive]] [[manufacturing company]] headquartered in [[Barangay|Brgy.]] Pulang Lupa in the city of [[Las Piñas]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]].  The company designs, engineers, manufactures and distributes the [[jeepney]], the most popular form of transportation in the country, labeled as the 'king of the road' in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=lp&gt;[http://laspinascity.gov.ph/home/article?cat=ls&amp;sub=Sarao+Jeepney "Sarao Jeepney"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524011730/http://laspinascity.gov.ph/home/article?cat=ls&amp;sub=Sarao+Jeepney |date=2013-05-24 }}.

The company was first established as a small [[automotive]] shop in 1953 by starting [[entrepreneur]] [[Leonardo Sarao]], a mechanic and a former [[calesa]] driver. From an initial budget of [[Philippine peso|₱]]700, the company grew into a multimillion corporation. At its peak, the ratio of Sarao jeepneys rolling the streets of Manila outnumbered other names by nearly 7 to 1, the name ''Sarao'' became synonymous with the vehicle.&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;

Sarao promoted the jeepney as a symbol of [[Culture of the Philippines|Philippine culture]].  A Sarao was exhibited at the Philippine pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] as a national image for the Filipinos.&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Microcosm&gt;Mercado, Leonardo N.

Sarao is also a manufacturer of owner-type, custom-built jeepneys and other type of vehicles for schools, businesses and other institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21503">'''Section 121''' of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provides that:

{{Cquote|
''121. All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.''
}}

This has received a restrictive interpretation in the Canadian courts.

==Background==
[[File:Charlottetown Conference Delegates, September 1864.JPG|right|thumb|Delegates of the [[Charlottetown Conference]] on the steps of [[Government House (Prince Edward Island)|Government House]], September 1864.]]
Prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], duty-free status had already been accorded by [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Province of Canada|Canada]] to one another, each contingent on the other colonies' granting such status.{{sfn|Blue|2010|p=165}} There was also free trade between the colonies of [[British North America]] and the [[United States of America]] under the 1854 [[Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty|Reciprocity Treaty]], but the United States had served notice in December 1864 that it wished to seek changes to the Treaty, including "modify[ing] the rights of transit [of goods] from Canada through the United States." As goods from Canada were previously allowed to pass through the US in bond to ports in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for [[transshipment]] to Britain, this represented a potentially significant [[non-tariff barrier]] that was on the minds of participants during the 1865{{endash}}1867 intercolonial conferences that took place in [[Charlottetown Conference|Charlottetown]], [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec]] and [[London Conference of 1866|London]] that led to the creation of the [[Dominion of Canada]] in 1867.{{sfn|Blue|2010|pp=169{{endash}}170}}

Although the proceedings of the various conferences were not recorded, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] said later that union of all Provinces would "break down all trade barriers between us," and throw open all at once "a combined market of four millions of people." [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] said that the purpose of the Union was "free trade among ourselves."{{sfn|Blue|2010|p=171}} In February 1865, in a debate in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]], [[John A. Macdonald]] declared that Canada wanted "to establish a commercial union, with unrestricted free trade, between people of the five provinces."{{sfn|Province of Canada Debates|1865|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blue|2010|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual provision did not appear until the final draft of the British North America bill in February 1867, where it was worded thus:

{{Cquote|
''125. All Articles the Growth or Produce or Manufacture of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick, shall be admitted free into all Ports in Canada.''
}}

It was subsequently revised in March 1867 into its final form:

{{Cquote|
''121. All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.''
}}

As such, it was duly passed as part of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]]''.{{sfn|Blue|2010|pp=174{{endash}}175}}

==Canadian jurisprudence==
{{see also|Section 91(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867}}
[[File:Pierre-Basile Mignault.png|thumb|left|Justice [[Pierre-Basile Mignault]]]]
Although s. 91(2) cases have stated that the provinces cannot enact laws that inhibit the free flow of goods across provincial borders, such laws that have only incidental effects may still be constitutional. There is no general rule that prevents the [[Parliament of Canada]] from enacting such legislation.

Since 1921, the governing interpretation of s. 121 has come from ''Gold Seal Ltd. v. Alberta (Attorney-General)'', which considers that it only bars the levying of customs duties on goods moving between provinces. This interpretation has been sustained in subsequent cases.{{sfn|Blue|2010|pp=180{{endash}}182}} As noted by [[Pierre-Basile Mignault|Mignault J.]]:

{{Quotation|
I think that, like the enactment I have just quoted, the object of section 121 was not to decree that all articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of any of the provinces should be admitted into the others, but merely to secure that they should be admitted "free," that is to say without any tax or duty imposed as a condition of their admission. The essential word here is "free" and what is prohibited is the levying of custom duties or other charges of a like nature in matters of interprovincial trade.{{sfn|''Gold Seal''|1921|p=470}}
|}}

In ''Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetables Committee of Direction'', which involved a British Columbia law requiring agricultural producers to pay a levy in order to allow shipment of their produce anywhere in Canada, [[Lawrence Arthur Dumoulin Cannon|Cannon J.]] in his concurring judgment expanded on this, stating:

{{Quotation|
I, therefore, reach the conclusion that this legislation is an attempt to impose by indirect taxation and regulations an obstacle to one of the main purposes of Confederation, which was, ultimately, to form an economic unit of all the provinces in British North America with absolute freedom of trade between its constituent parts.{{sfn|''Lawson''|1930|p=373}}
}}

In ''Murphy v. C.P.R.'', [[Ivan Rand|Rand J.]], in a concurring judgment, attempted to present an alternative interpretation:

{{Quotation|
I take s. 121, apart from customs duties, to be aimed against trade regulation which is designed to place fetters upon or raise impediments to or otherwise restrict or limit the free flow of commerce across the Dominion as if provincial boundaries did not exist. That it does not create a level of trade activity divested of all regulation I have no doubt; what is preserved is a free flow of trade regulated in subsidiary features which are or have come to be looked upon as incidents of trade. What is forbidden is a trade regulation that in its essence and purpose is related to a provincial boundary.{{sfn|''Murphy''|1958|p=642}}
}}

Rand J.'s comment was referred to, and adopted by, [[Bora Laskin|Laskin C.J.]] in ''[[Reference re Agricultural Products Marketing]]'', where he said:

{{Quotation|
Accepting this view of s. 121, I find nothing in the marketing scheme here that, as a trade regulation, is in its essence and purpose related to a provincial boundary. To hold otherwise would mean that a federal marketing statute, referable to interprovincial trade, could not validly take into account patterns of production in the various Provinces in attempting to establish an equitable basis for the flow of trade. I find here no design of punitive regulation directed against or in favour of any Province.{{sfn|''Agricultural Products Marketing Reference''|1978|p=1268}}
}}

==Proliferation of internal barriers==

Because of the above, ''Gold Seal'' still governs the question of the movement of goods in Canada, although there is still debate as to whether the original case was rightly decided.{{sfn|Blue|2010|pp=182{{endash}}186}} Although customs duties and similar charges are prohibited on this activity, [[non-tariff barriers]] can still be instituted by both levels of government, such as:{{sfn|Crowley|Knox|Robson|2010|pp=8{{endash}}9}}

:* differing standards for vehicle brakes for adjoining provinces
:* requiring that margarine have a specific colour for sale in Quebec (although that has since been repealed)
:* requiring that butter sold in Quebec be wrapped in foil
:* hay from Alberta cannot be trucked to B.C. unless it is unloaded and repacked to B.C. shipping standards

In addition, federal legislation in the following areas has been held to be valid:{{sfn|Blue|2010|p=187}}

:* mandatory sale requirements under the ''Canadian Wheat Board Act'' (although that has since been repealed)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canadian Wheat Board Act (repealed)|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter = C-24|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-24/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* prohibition of interprovincial shipments under the ''Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter = I-3|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* imposition of provincial quotas and price-fixing arrangements under various agricultural marketing schemes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Agricultural Products Marketing Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter = A-6|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-6/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, there are probably greater obstacles to trade between the provinces than there are to trade between Canada and the rest of the world,{{sfn|Fraser Institute|1994|pp=xii{{endash}}xiii}} and it may explain why Canada has lower productivity than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Canada's Problem: Domestic Trade Barriers|author = Christopher Sands|url = http://www.american.com/archive/2007/may-0507/canada2019s-problem-domestic-trade-barriers|publisher = [[American Enterprise Institute]]|date = 22 May 2007|accessdate = 6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is ''Gold Seal'' still good law?==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Ivan Rand.jpg|thumb|right|Justice [[Ivan Rand]]]] --&gt;
There has been debate as to whether ''Gold Seal'' would continue to hold under the current Canadian practice for constitutional analysis, most notably in the following areas:{{sfn|Blue|2009|pp=311{{endash}}312}}

:* the ''Lawson'' observation that Canada should be viewed as a single economic unit, which has been affirmed in other areas of jurisprudence since ''[[Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye]]''
:* since 1930, the [[living tree doctrine]] requires that a constitutional provision must receive a "large and liberal interpretation" according to its terms
:* since 1982, provisions in the Constitution require a "purposive" or "purposeful" interpretation, showing that one must first consider the wording of the Act, then the legislative history, the scheme of the Act, and the legislative context

It is therefore argued that, under a purposive interpretation such as Rand J. had proposed, s. 121 requires any federal or provincial statute to meet three requirements:{{sfn|Blue|2009|p=325}}

:* It may not levy provincial customs duties and charges or impose any trade regulation that places fetters on, raises impediments to or limits the free flow of Canadian goods across Canada as if provincial boundaries did not exist
:* It may regulate a free flow of Canadian goods in subsidiary features, in the incidents of trade
:* It may not impose a trade regulation on the movement of Canadian goods that in its essence and purpose is related to a provincial boundary

This proposition has not yet been tested, but it has been suggested that the ''Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act'' could be found to be unconstitutional as a result.{{sfn|Blue|2009|pp=325{{endash}}330}}

===Current developments===
In 2015, a [[test case (law)|test case]] concerning the validity of certain portions of [[New Brunswick]]'s ''Liquor Control Act'' started trial in [[Campbellton, New Brunswick]]. The defence included a constitutional challenge based on s. 121 which was supported by the Canadian Constitution Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://theccf.ca/court-cases/r-v-comeau-interprovincial-trade/|title= R v.

The trial court judge was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[R v Comeau]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R v Comeau|link=R v Comeau|year=2018|court=scc|num=15|date=2018-04-19|parallelcite=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it stated that "[w]hile one effect of s. 134(b) is to impede interprovincial trade, this effect is only incidental in light of the objective of the provincial scheme in general. Therefore, while s. 134(b) in essence impedes cross‑border trade, this is not its primary purpose. Section 134(b) does not infringe s. 121 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''".&lt;ref&gt;''Comeau'' (SCC), par. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other measures for a Canadian common market==
{{see also|Section Six of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Agreement on Internal Trade|New West Partnership}}

Before 1982, mobility rights had existed by virtue of section 91 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', which gave the federal government full jurisdiction over citizenship.  Citizens were free to move across provincial borders and live wherever they chose to, and only the federal government could limit this right.  This was recognized by the Supreme Court in ''[[Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Winner v S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited|link=Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Limited|year=1951|court=scc|num=2|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1951] SCR 887|date=1951-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Ivan Rand|Rand J.]] observed:

{{Quotation|
:What this implies is that a province cannot, by depriving a Canadian of the means of working, force him to leave it: it cannot divest him of his right or capacity to remain and to engage in work there: that capacity inhering as a constituent element of his citizenship status is beyond nullification by provincial action. The contrary view would involve the anomaly that although British Columbia could not by mere prohibition deprive a naturalized foreigner of his means of livelihood, it could do so to a native-born Canadian. He may, of course, disable himself from exercising his capacity or he may be regulated in it by valid provincial law in other aspects. But that attribute of citizenship lies outside of those civil rights committed to the province, and is analogous to the capacity of a Dominion corporation which the province cannot sterilize.

:It follows, ''[[a fortiori]]'', that a province cannot prevent a Canadian from entering it except, conceivably, in temporary circumstances, for some local reason as, for example, health. With such a prohibitory power, the country could be converted into a number of enclaves and the "union" which the original provinces sought and obtained disrupted. In a like position is a subject of a friendly foreign country; for practical purposes he enjoys all the rights of the citizen.

:Such, then, is the national status embodying certain inherent or constitutive characteristics, of members of the Canadian public, and it can be modified, defeated or destroyed, as for instance by [[outlawry]], only by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;''Winner'', pp. 919{{endash}}920&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Since the introduction of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', mobility rights between provinces have been expanded (subject to certain limitations) by its s. 6, but there has been little jurisprudence in that area. As well, the ''[[Agreement on Internal Trade]]'' has introduced limited freedom for bidding on government tenders in various jurisdictions, and the provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] have reached a measure of economic integration through the [[New West Partnership]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7618">A '''stalking horse offer''', '''agreement''', or '''bid''' is an attempt by a bankrupt [[debtor]] to test the market for the debtor's assets in advance of an auction of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicon.ft.com/term.asp?t=stalking-horse Financial Times Lexicon] from the ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=investopedia.&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalking-Horse Bid|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stalkinghorsebid.asp|website=investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to maximize the value of its [[asset]]s or avoid low bids, as part of (or before) a [[court auction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focusmg.com/articles/stalking-horse The ‘Stalking Horse’ in a US Chapter 11 363 Sale], ''Financier Worldwide''’s May 2006 Edition &lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==

While entering a [[stalking horse]] offer, the debtor can offer [[bidding]] protections such as [[breakup fee]]s to its best bidder before the auction. These incentives enhance the value of the offering for the bidder which might lead to a better price offer before the auction begins. This higher offer is now the starting offer for the auction and may result in benefiting the debtor and its [[Estate (law)|estate]].

==Examples==
On October 22, 2007, technology company [[SCO Group|SCO]] asked a bankruptcy court to approve a deal whereby a purchaser would acquire "substantially all assets used by the Company in connection with its SCO [[UNIX]] Business and certain related claims in litigation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1102542/000095013407021831/v34793e8vk.htm |title=The SCO Group, Inc. |work=Form 8-K |publisher=SEC.gov |date= October 22, 2007|accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement included a "stalking horse" provision: If the purchaser, York Capital Management, were to be designated as a stalking horse in subsequent bidding for SCO's assets, and if others outbid York, then SCO would have to pay York a $780,000 breakup fee and reimbursement of all expenses incurred by York up to $300,000. In this way, York would earn its expenses and $780,000 by acting as the stalking horse and preventing other bidders from making lowball offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023172159177 |title= SCO Has a Bid; Would Like More - Updated |publisher= Groklaw |date= 2007-10-23 |accessdate= 2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2008, Steve and Barry's LLC, a [[retailer]] of casual apparel, filed a stalking horse agreement with the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the [[Southern District of New York]]. Their partner in this [[asset purchase agreement]] was BH S&amp;B Holding LLC, a subsidiary of [[Bay Harbor Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080804006183&amp;newsLang=en "Steve &amp; Barry’s Files “Stalking Horse” Agreement"], from Businesswire.com, 4 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2009, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson had won a stalking horse bid to acquire Nortel Networks Corp's CDMA division, for $1.13 billion.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124849670377181071#mod=djemITP "Ericsson Powers Up U.S. Presence With Nortel Deal"], from ''The Wall Street Journal'', 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2010, the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] [[Major League Baseball]] team announced a potential stalking horse deal.  "'An auction with a stalking horse, or minimum, bid is more frequently used than a so-called “naked” auction without a floor price,' William K. Snyder, the court-appointed restructuring officer, said. 'Moreover, the stalking horse bidder commonly receives a “reasonable” break-up fee if unsuccessful in the auction,' said Snyder. Under the scrapped plan, the $304 million in cash portion of the Greenberg-Ryan group’s May 24 deal with owner Tom Hicks would serve as a minimum bid, with the next bid at least $20 million higher. Greenberg-Ryan would have received $15 million if it lost."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/07/08/2323117/texas-rangers-proposed-july-16.html#ixzz0t9CX7uO2 Texas Rangers' Proposed July 16 Auction Scrapped]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2011, ''Reuters'' reported [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]'s intention to pursue a $290 million stalking horse offer with Cobalt Video Holdco. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/21/us-blockbuster-idUSTRE71K5SO20110221 "Blockbuster gets $290 million stalking horse bid"], from ''Reuters'', 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2011, ''TechCrunch'' reported [[Google]]'s intention to pursue a $900 million stalking horse bid for [[Nortel]]'s patents.&lt;ref&gt; [https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/04/google-makes-900-million-stalking-horse-bid-for-nortel-patents/ "Google Makes $900 Million Stalking-Horse Bid For Nortel Patents As It Looks To Fend Off Trolls"], from ''TechCrunch'', 4 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Hostess Brands]] used a stalking horse auction to sell off its assets in bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hostess CEO Says Stalking-Horse Bids Total $858 Million|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-31/hostess-ceo-says-stalking-horse-bids-total-858-million|author=Milford, P., McCarty, D.|publisher=Bloomberg|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2013, Designline, now known as [[Environmental Performance Vehicles]]  the Charlotte, NC bus manufacturer, used the technique but received no offers.    &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/176993715/DesignLine-Stalking-Horse-Bidders|title = DesignLine Stalking Horse Bidders|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2013, [[Eastman Kodak]] proposed a stalking horse deal of $210 million whereby [[Brother Industries]] would acquire Kodak's Document Imaging division ahead of Kodak's bankruptcy court approval slated for June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodak tentatively sells its scanning business to Brother for $210 million|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/04/15/kodak-tentatively-sells-its-scanning-business-to-brother|last=Fingus|first=Jon|publisher=AOL|work= engadget.com|date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate= 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2016, [[Ziff Davis]] proposed a stalking-horse bid of under US$90 million after [[Gawker Media]] announced it was filing for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/10/gawker-media-files-for-ch-11-bankruptcy-protection.html|title=Gawker Media auction starts with Ziff Davis bid amid bankruptcy|last=Balakrishnan|first=Anita|date=2016-06-10|website=CNBC|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/business/media/gawker-bankruptcy-sale.html|title=Gawker, Filing for Bankruptcy After Hulk Hogan Suit, Is for Sale|last=Ember|first=Sydney|date=2016-06-10|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/08/16/hogan-vs-gawker-aftermath-update-gawkers-bankruptcy-sale-unfolding-week/|title=Hogan vs. Gawker Aftermath – Univision reportedly to buy bankrupt Gawker|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2016-08-16|website=PWTorch|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suleiman Bakhit''' ([[Arabic]]: سليمان بخيت) is a [[Jordan]]ian entrepreneur who produces superhero comics in various media for [[Arab]] youth.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =Upbin| first =Bruce| title =Arab Superheroes Vs. Arab Extremism| work =Forbes| date =July 12, 2011| url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/07/12/pow-crash-blam-superheroes-vs-arab-extremism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been described as "fighting to change how the West sees Arab youth — and how Arab youth see themselves — one superhero at a time."&lt;ref name=ted&gt;{{cite web| last =Eng| first =Karen| title =POW!

==Early life and education==
Bakhit is the son of [[Marouf al-Bakhit]], who served twice as prime minister of Jordan.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Bakhit has said that when he was a child, "I once had an art teacher who refunded my parents' money and advised me never to try again."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Suleiman studied at the [[University of Minnesota-Twin Cities]].&lt;ref name=link&gt;{{cite web| title =Suleiman Bakhit | work =LinkedIn| url = http://jo.linkedin.com/pub/suleiman-bakhit/16/108/764}}&lt;/ref&gt; His original intention was to study mechanical engineering, but after "a couple years," he reportedly "found it utterly intolerable." Instead, he chose to pursue a master's degree in human resources development. His graduation thesis on this subject was "adopted by the Jordanian government."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=theac&gt;{{cite web| title =The Accidental Comic Artist| work =The Accidental Career| url = http://www.theaccidentalcareer.com/suleiman_bakhit.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at the University of Minnesota when [[9/11]] occurred. As president of the university's international student union, he began an "awareness campaign" to combat anti-Arab prejudice. The campaign received considerable media attention and shortly afterwards, Bakhit has said, "four college kids attacked me on my way home late one night. They started with racial slurs, then attacked me with beer bottles. I suffered many scars and injuries that led to surgeries." He decided, "Well, either I pack my bags and go home to Jordan, or I do something. And I decided the best way to fight racism is to start with the young. So I began talking to schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 about Middle Eastern culture and what happened to me on 9/11, spreading a very simple message: Not all Middle Easterners are terrorists, and [[Al Qaeda]] is like the [[KKK]]."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; Eventually he "started realizing that mythology and stories have such great power to bridge cultural divides"&lt;ref name=ted/&gt; and also "realized the power of empowering youth and women through positive role models in a medium they can relate to: comics."&lt;ref name=theac/&gt;

In addition, he "realized that actually, no, there aren’t any Arab equivalents to Western superheroes. Yes, there’s [[Aladdin]] and [[Sinbad]], but no one has ever done an animation or comic book based on the actual mythology from within the culture." This recognition led Bakhit to do "a couple of years of hardcore research, reading ancient texts, doing six month's archeological research in the Arab desert. I even learned [[Hebrew]]. I wanted to read Aramaic so I could read the Dead Sea Scrolls for inspiration. Meanwhile, I started to teach myself to draw, and came up with some characters based on my knowledge of Arab culture. It was a journey towards discovering my own culture more than anything else." Over time, he has said, he became convinced that his calling was to create "characters and stories based in Arab tradition to spread the culture of tolerance."

==Return to Jordan and Aranim Media Factory==
Consequently, he dropped out of the master's program in human resource development, returned to Jordan, and, in 2006, registered his company, Aranim. The name "comes from a combination of 'Arab' and 'anime.'"&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

After returning to Jordan, Bakhit was physically attacked there, too, "this time," he has said, "for being such…a voice for moderation."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; According to his account, once he had "started publishing my comic books, especially the ones that fight extremism and terrorism, I got attacked outside of my office by a couple of extremists. One of them hit me with a razor blade in my face. He was trying to take out one of my eyes. Because it was late at night and I drive a motorbike, I had to cauterize my own wound with a pocketknife before getting to a hospital. That's how I ended up with a big, massive scar on my face."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

Aranim Media Factory, based in [[Amman]], has become one of the largest producers of comics in the Arab language, it produces comic books, TV and film cartoons, digital comic strips, manga, creative media, and social-media games.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=link/&gt;&lt;ref name=theac/&gt; His goal is “to entertain but more importantly to inspire Arab boys and girls to believe that real opportunities to be leaders are well within their grasp.”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; He describes himself as "dealing in hope and tolerance" and says that he wants "to build the Arab Disney."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; He has said: "I go to a lot of poor areas and ask the kids, 'Who are your role models?' Sometimes they say Zarqawi and Bin Laden. But in one neighborhood I gave them comics and when I went back a few months later; the superheroes were now their role models. It doesn't even have to be real people they look up to. There's a huge lack of positive role models in the region. Superheroes are an aspiration for what we want to be."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Bakhit develops "the concepts, characters and stories" for his comic books, and has a team of writers and artists who translate his ideas into the final product. He also runs "focus groups to gauge what kids respond to." He and his programmers, Jordanian natives, "learned from scratch how to program games. We bought books on Amazon and literally taught ourselves how to program, using blogs and online communities for support." He has said that his firm is "the only Arab company in the entire Arab world that creates social games in-house at the quality that we do."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

As an example of the fact that his stories "have deep Middle Eastern mythologies ingrained in them," Bakhit has explained that "in ancient Arabic mythology, fire has seven types, each color corresponding to a different one. So I gave Naar — which means 'fire' — the first hero of my first comic, the power of the seven flames. The story is about a group of kids who wake up in a future post-apocalyptic Middle East to discover they have superpowers." He has created another comic "based on Jordan's real-life all-female counterterrorism team," an example of his belief "in empowering young women," and has created a character named Element Zero, "a special agent, kind of the Arabic Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, who fights terrorism locally."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

In January 2010, Bakhit founded Aranim Games.&lt;ref name=link/&gt; As of July 2011, his firms had sold 1.2 million copies of print comics. In 2011, Aranim Games launched "a FarmVille-style social game called Happy Oasis" which allows players to build a "garden in traditional Islamic style."&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; In 2012, he invented an iPhone game that he described as "combining the Arab Spring and Animal Farm." He has also produced "a web TV show based on Element Zero character."&lt;ref name=ted/&gt;

==Other activities==

[[File:'The feast of reason, and the flow of soul,' - ie - the wits of the age, setting the table in a roar by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|300px|As [[James Gillray]], the artist of this 1797 etching, died in 1815, his works are in the [[public domain]] throughout the world. However, under the "sweat of the brow" doctrine, new copyright claims could be made over mechanical reproductions of the etching, due to the skill and labor involved in the reproduction.]]

'''Sweat of the brow''' is an [[intellectual property]] [[Legal doctrine|law doctrine]], chiefly related to [[copyright]] law. According to this doctrine, an [[author]] gains rights through  simple diligence during the creation of a work, such as a database, or a directory. Substantial creativity or "originality" is not required.

Under a "sweat of the brow" doctrine, the creator of a copyrighted work, even if it is completely unoriginal, is entitled to have his effort and expense protected, and no one else may use such a work without permission, but must instead recreate the work by independent research or effort. The classic example is a [[telephone directory]]. In a "sweat of the brow" jurisdiction, such a directory may not be copied, but instead a competitor must independently collect the information to issue a competing directory. The same rule generally applies to databases and lists of facts.

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have traditionally used the similar but not identical concept of ''[[droit d'auteur]]''. [[European Union law]] tends to harmonize the protection of intellectual property throughout member states and the doctrine thus gains more influence. In the Databases Directive 96/9/EC{{emdash}}the [[Member State of the European Union|member states of the EU]] are obliged to confer protection known as the [[database right]] on non-original databases, that is on those that embody no creativity, but are a consequence of substantial investment (financial, labour etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html EU Richtlinie 96/9/EG] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621055429/http://www.bonnanwalt.de/rg/internet/law/eu/RiLi96-9-eg.html |date=2007-06-21 }} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In a traditional [[English language|English]] [[idiom]], the ''sweat of one's brow'' refers to the effort expended in labor, and the value created thereby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|page=1457|accessdate=2007-05-30|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 ed)|title=Sweat, v. t.|publisher=ARTFL Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303004057/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.page.sh?page=1457|archivedate=2006-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is famously used in English translations of {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Genesis|chapter=3|verse=19}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newlivingtranslation.com/05discoverthenlt/ssresults.asp?txtSearchString=Genesis+3|accessdate=2007-05-30|title=New Living Translation|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers, inc.|quote=By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law doctrine takes its name from this idiom.

==By country==

===United States===
{{see also|Copyright law in the United States}}
The [[United States]] rejected this doctrine in the 1991 [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|499|340|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; until then it had been upheld in a number of US copyright cases.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Under the ''Feist'' ruling in the US, mere collections of facts are considered unoriginal and thus not protected by copyright, no matter how much work went into [[collation|collating]] them. The arrangement and presentation of a collection may be original, but not if it is "simple and obvious" such as a list in [[alphabetical]] or [[chronological]] order.

===United Kingdom===
Under the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], for copyright to subsist in a work, that work must be original. However, courts have not adopted a literal reading of this requirement. For over a hundred years, English courts have held that a significant expenditure of labour is sufficient. The consequence of this is that if A makes a work, in which copyright subsists, and B subsequently adds his skill, judgement and labour, altering the form of A's work, B will potentially have a copyright in the work he produces. This suggests that copyright is not about protecting ideas, because one can acquire a copyright by expending skill, labour, and judgement, but no creativity or inventiveness.

However, in March 2012, a case was taken to the [[European Court of Justice]], in which [[Football DataCo]] claimed [[copyright infringement]] over web sites which were reproducing match schedules from several major [[association football|football]] leagues. Football DataCo asserted that these schedules were copyrighted works due to the skill and labour involved in their preparation, and that the company was given exclusive rights to license their reproduction. Based on its interpretation of British law, the court rejected the notion that labour and skill was enough to grant protection to a work, since "unless the procedures for creating the lists concerned as described by the national court are supplemented by elements reflecting originality in the selection or arrangement of the data contained in those lists, they do not suffice for those lists to be protected by the copyright laid down in the directive."&lt;ref name=bbcn-dataco&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Bill|title=Football match fixture list copyright claim rejected|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17218968|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a copyright notice on 'digital images, photographs and the internet' last updated in November 2015, the UK [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)|Intellectual Property Office]] confirmed that digital reproductions of [[public domain]] images are not protected by copyright, arguing that "according to the Court of Justice of the European Union which has effect in UK law, copyright can only subsist in subject matter that is original in the sense that it is the author’s own ‘intellectual creation’. Given this criterion, it seems unlikely that what is merely a retouched, digitised image of an older work can be considered as ‘original’."&lt;ref name=IPO-cnote&gt;{{cite web|author=UK Intellectual Property Office|title=Copyright Notice: digital images, photographs and the internet|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/481194/c-notice-201401.pdf|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====
In ''[[Walter v Lane]]'' (1900) (Pre-CDPA), reporters took shorthand notes of a speech, punctuated them, etc. and published them in the [[The Times|''Times'']] newspaper. The court held that the reporters were authors of the published speech, and, as such, owned a copyright in the published speeches, because of the considerable skill, labour, and judgement they exercised.

In ''[[University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd]]'',&lt;ref&gt;University of London Press v University Tutorial [1916] 2 Ch 601&lt;/ref&gt; the question arose as to whether certain mathematics exam papers were original literary works. The exam papers just consisted of conventional maths problems in a conventional manner. The court held that originality does not mean that the work must be an expression of individual thought. The simple fact that the authors drew on a body of knowledge common to mathematicians did not compromise originality. The requirement of originality, it was held, does not require that expression be in an original or novel form. It does, however, require that the work not be copied from another work. It must originate from the author.
As such, even though these were the same old maths problems every student is familiar with, and even though there was no creative input, the skill, labour, and judgement of the authors was sufficient to make the papers original literary works.

In ''[[Cummins v Bond]]'', a psychic in a trance claimed to have written down what spirits told her, through a process of [[automatic writing]]. In court, she accepted that she was not the creative author of the writing. The creative input, had, presumably, come from the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Patry |url=http://williampatry.blogspot.gr/2005/08/authorship-and-religion.html |title=The Patry Copyright Blog: Authorship and Religion |publisher=Williampatry.blogspot.gr |date=2005-08-10 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the court held that she had exercised sufficient labour and skill in translating and transcribing what the spirits told her, so she had a copyright in the resulting literary work.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Germany===
In certain cases, German law grants ancillary copyrights (''Leistungsschutzrecht'') due to the effort involved in the production or exploitation of creative works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nolte|first1=Georg|title=Zur Forderung der Presseverleger nach Einführung eines speziellen Leistungsschutzrechts: Eine kritische Auseinandersetzung|journal=Zeitschrift für Geistiges Eigentum|date=1 July 2010|volume=2|issue=2|pages=165–195|doi=10.1628/186723710792175149|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mohr/zge/2010/00000002/00000002/art00002|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a [[Landgericht Berlin|regional court in Berlin]] ruled that digitized versions of public domain paintings were entitled to new copyrights due to the effort and expertise necessary to create the reproductions. The case is being appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moody|first1=Glyn|title=Digitising public domain images creates a new copyright, rules German court [Updated]|url=http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/06/digitising-public-domain-images-creates-a-new-copyright-germany/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Reiss-Engelhorn Museum (REM) of the City of Mannheim v.

===Israel===
Israeli law requires that a work exhibit some [[threshold of originality|degree of originality]] in order to be copyrightable. In other words, Israeli law does not subscribe to the "sweat of the brow" doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Tempska, Urzula (2002). [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=iplr "'Originality' After the Dead Sea Scrolls Decision: Implications for the American Law of Copyright"]. ''Marquette Intellectual Property Law Review'' '''6''' (1): 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of originality required is minimal, and the transliteration or interpretation of an artifact is covered by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;Elkin-Koren, Niva (2001). [http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-2_pdf/HLR38P445.pdf "Of Scientific Claims and Proprietary Rights: Lessons from the Dead Sea Scrolls"], ''Houston Law Review'' '''38''' (2): 458, 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
Uruguayan law requires that the work should have some degree of originality to be protected by copyright. Uruguayan law, therefore, does not subscribe to the sweat of the brow doctrine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

With some $1 billion in assets, today the Foundation is one of the largest funders in New England.  The Foundation and its donors make more than $100&amp;nbsp;million in grants every year.&lt;ref name="2008 report" /&gt; Since 2001, the Boston Foundation has also served as a major civic leader by commissioning and publishing research, providing a platform for discussion related to a wide range of challenges facing Greater Boston and the region and contributing to the development of public policy. 

== History ==
The Boston Foundation was founded in 1915 by Charles E. and Charles M. Rogerson, who were father and son.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;http://www.tbf.org/uploadedFiles/tbforg/There_at_the_Beginning/There%20from%20the%20Beginning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called the Permanent Charity Fund, it was one of the first community foundations in the United States, but, thanks to a bequest of $4 million shortly after it was launched, it was the first with the resources to begin grant making.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; In 1959 another large bequest of $20 million catapulted the Foundation into an era during which it made early investments in some of the most important nonprofit institutions in Boston, from WGBH to the New England Aquarium to the clean up of Boston Harbor.  1985, the foundation was renamed the Boston Foundation, and Anna Faith Jones became the President—the first African-American woman to lead a major foundation in the United States.  Today, it is led by President and CEO, Paul S. Grogan, who is credited with transforming the Foundation into a major civic leader for the city and region.&lt;ref name="TBF-84"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/AboutTBF/AboutTBFDetail.aspx?id=84 Meet Our President].

== Mission ==
As Greater Boston’s community foundation since 1915, the Boston Foundation devotes its resources to building and sustaining a vital, prosperous city and region, where justice and opportunity are extended to everyone.  It fulfills this mission in three principal ways: 

* Making grants to nonprofit organizations and designing special funding initiatives to address this community’s critical challenges;
* Working in partnership with donors to achieve [[High impact philanthropy|high-impact philanthropy]]; and
* Serving as a civic hub and center of information, where ideas are shared, levers for change are identified, and common agendas for the future are developed.

== Grant Making ==
Over more than 100 years of grantmaking, the Foundation has been there at the beginning for numerous fresh ideas and new institutions by providing crucial seed capital and other support.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; Among its greatest accomplishments are grants that helped to launch [[WGBH-TV]], now considered the nation’s premier public television station.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made an early investment in the redevelopment of Faneuil Hall into a thriving marketplace, often credited with sparking the renewal of Boston in recent decades; and helped to shape Boston’s Longwood Medical Center area.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; The Foundation invested in the most extensive network of community health centers in the nation and made grants to a group called Save the Harbor/Save the Bay to clean up Boston Harbor.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; What was once one of the filthiest harbors in the world is now one of the cleanest.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt; It also made early grants to numerous organizations that started in Boston and spread throughout the country, like City Year, Citizen Schools and Year Up.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt;

It also provides leadership for special initiatives, such as the Success Boston College Completion Initiative and SkillWorks.

== Civic leadership ==
Through its Understanding Boston series, the Boston Foundation commissions research from universities, think tanks and other organizations and shares this information through a series of forums that are attended by thousands of people every year.&lt;ref name="UB"&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/UnderstandingBoston/Default.aspx The Boston Foundation].

In addition to providing fresh information and bringing people together to discuss findings, the Foundation also creates Task Forces and Action Agendas to produce positive change.  A number of issues have been influenced by this process.  The Commonwealth Housing Task Force created a Smart Growth housing effort to address the current shortage of housing in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbf.org/chtf The Commonwealth Housing Task Force].

The '''Trademark Clearinghouse''' is a database of validated and registered trademarks established by [[ICANN]] to assist [[trademark]] holders prevent infringing behavior in the [[Domain Name System]]. In combination with the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS), it is the second significant attempt by ICANN to handle the "Trademark Dilemma".&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt; The first attempt was the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]].

The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a trademark office. Rights holders who register their marks with the Trademark Clearinghouse must still register with their country's trademark office. The primary purpose of the Trademark Clearinghouse is to maintain a global database of verified trademarks for the [[Domain Name System]].&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

The Trademark Clearinghouse is strictly for [[second-level domain]] names. Other mechanisms exist to protect trademark in the [[Generic top-level domain|new gTLDs]] themselves.&lt;ref name=Explaining_TMCH_to_businesses /&gt; All new gTLD registries are required to use the Trademark Clearinghouse and URS for protection of Second-level domains.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;

==History==
One of the initial tasks of ICANN when it was formed was to deal with the so-called "Trademark Dilemma",&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma /&gt;&lt;ref name=TM_Dilemma_2 /&gt; which is determining the appropriate balance of rights between domain name holders and trademark owners. So in December 1999 ICANN launched the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]]. Starting in 2008&lt;ref name=ICANN_GTLD_RFP /&gt; ICANN began a new program to launch many more new [[Generic top-level domain]]s. As part of this program ICANN envisioned a replacement program for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On March 6, 2009 ICANN commissioned 18 intellectual property experts from around the world entitled the Implementation Recommendation Team (IRT). They produced a report on May 29, 2009 with numerous recommendations to protect intellectual property rights holders. Most importantly, the report recommended an Intellectual Property Clearinghouse be created in concert with a Uniform Rapid Suspension System (URS).&lt;ref name=IRT_report /&gt;

The recommendation of the Intellectual Property Clearinghouse became the basis for the Trademark Clearinghouse and together with the URS eventually replaced the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

On May 28, 2010 ICANN published the Trademark Clearinghouse Proposal.&lt;ref name=TMCH_prop /&gt; The proposal emerged from an ICANN meeting held in Nairobi between the 7th and 12 March 2010. In the proposal both the Trademark Clearinghouse and the Universal Rapid Suspension program were proposed as possible replacements for the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy.

In November 2012 ICANN organized meetings in Los Angeles and Brussels to consider the implementation of the Trademark Clearinghouse for new top level domains.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; The outcome of these meetings was a [[straw man proposal]] for the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name=strawman /&gt;

In March 2013 the Trademark Clearinghouse launched.&lt;ref name=TMCH_launch_Tuesday /&gt;

===Controversy===
The new gTLD program initially faced heavy criticism from many brand owners. Specifically, the [[Association of National Advertisers]] created an organization called Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (CRIDO)&lt;ref name=CRIDO /&gt; and began lobbying ICANN to halt the new gTLD rollout. The brand owners saw the creation of more gTLDs as a further cost to protect their trademarks from [[cybersquatting]]. They wanted strong trademark protections built into the new gTLD program.&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ANA_Letter_3 /&gt;

Milton Mueller, a professor at Syracuse University and frequent critic of ICANN, argues that the creation of the Trademark Clearinghouse was entirely hijacked by the advertising and intellectual property stakeholders, primarily by groups like the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). He argues that ICANN staff ignored its established bottom up processes when it did not suit them, and instead implemented the straw man proposal against the wishes of the Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO), Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG), and numerous other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=IGP_on_TMCH /&gt;

DNS news site DomainIncite.com has also been critical of the Trademark Clearinghouse development process.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Compromised_Beginnings /&gt;

====Brussels and Los Angeles meetings====
Many non-commercial observers have criticised ICANN for the way in which the Trademark Clearinghouse was developed. Most of this criticism has stemmed from a lack of openness concerning the proceedings at the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response to this criticism ICANN's Ombudsman opened a probe into the closed door nature of these meetings in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Ombudsman_Probe /&gt;

Robin Gross, chair of ICANN's Noncommercial Stakeholders Group (NCSG) claimed that the NCSG was largely ignored during the proceedings, while the Business Constituency and Intellectual Property Constituency were overly represented.&lt;ref name=Robin_Gross_IGP /&gt; Using ICANN's Documentary Information Disclosure Program (DIDP) process, ICANN's version of a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request, the NCSG requested all information concerning the Los Angeles and Brussels meetings. In response, the NCSG received no new information&lt;ref name=ICANN_accountable /&gt;

The NCSG criticised the Brussels meeting immediately prior to it. In response, Fadi Chehade, CEO of ICANN, explained the purpose of the meeting in Brussels as simply an informal white board brainstorming session.&lt;ref name=ICA_Brussels /&gt; After the meeting Chehade wrote a blog post detailing what happened at the Brussels meeting.&lt;ref name=Chehade_Brussels /&gt;

====Red Cross / Red Crescent====
On June 25, 2014, ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) issued a comminuque entitled, "Protection of Red Cross / Red Crescent Names". The communique exempted the 'terms and names associated with the Red Cross and Red Crescent' from trademark protection while still affording them protected status. The communique advised that the names not be subject to policy considerations relating to trademark, because they cannot receive adequate treatment under trademark law. Instead the permanent protection of these names should be confirmed.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

In response, ICANN's Generic Names Supporting Organization (GNSO) suggested the names simply be added to the Trademark Clearinghouse. The matter is still being debated.&lt;ref name=GAC_on_Red_Cross_Crescent /&gt;

==Protection services==
The Trademark Clearinghouse is not a rights protection mechanism itself. Instead, additional mechanisms coupled with the Trademark Clearinghouse help trademark owners protect their rights. There are two special time periods where trademark holders are given special treatment, ongoing notification services, and the URS. There are also differentiated services offered by specific registries. These build on the Trademark Clearinghouse to afford special treatment to trademark holders with verified trademarks in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Sunrise period===
The sunrise period is a time period immediately prior to the launching of a TLD. Trademark Clearinghouse registrants receive priority access to reserve domain names associated with their trademarks before general access.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt; New gTLD registries are required to offer a sunrise period of at least 30 days.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Claims period===
During the claims period registrants attempting to register a second-level domain name under a TLD which utilizes the Trademark Clearinghouse will receive a warning if the name matches an entry in the Trademark Clearinghouse.&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; If the registrant registers the name anyway, the rights owner will receive a notification from the Trademark Claims system.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCH_Video" /&gt; The claims period is required to last at least 90 days after the initial launch of the new gTLD.&lt;ref name="TMCH_FAQ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Basic_Intro_to_TMCH" /&gt;

===Ongoing notifications===
Rights holders with trademarks registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse can opt in to receive additional notifications after the claims period expires. Holders will be notified of exact matches to names they have registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse. This service is optional and free.&lt;ref name="ongoing" /&gt;

===Domain Protected Marks List===
Domain Protected Marks List (DPML) is a service offered by specific new gTLD registry operators based on the Trademark Clearinghouse. It is not a standard service offered to rights holders registered in the Trademark Clearinghouse, nor is it standardized by ICANN. Different registries will implement DPML differently as a means of marketplace differentiation. Typically registries will offer to defensively block registrations that are more than just exact matches.&lt;ref name=DPML /&gt;

==Uniform Rapid Suspension==

As part of the new gTLD program ICANN developed an accompanying rights protection mechanism for trademark holders called the Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS). Work on the URS started in September 2012 with an RFI issued by ICANN.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; It was finalized in January 2014.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

The URS is not meant to replace the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]], but instead complement it. In contrast to the UDRP, the URS is meant as a lightweight, inexpensive, expedited arbitration process for resolving obvious trademark rights violations.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt; Unlike the UDRP, successful URS claims only cause a domain name to be suspended and redirected, not seized.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; Also, the URS is not intended for use where facts are in question.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; URS decisions can take as little as one week to resolve.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

Registries and registrars participating in the new gTLD program are required to implement the URS. In the context of the URS, they are called providers.&lt;ref name=URS_general /&gt;

===How it works===
Every URS claim starts with a complaint filed by a trademark holder against a registrant of a domain name they believe to be infringing their trademark.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; The complainant must also pay a one time non-refundable fee of $375.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;&lt;ref name=URS_gbu /&gt; Within two days of the complaint being filed an administrative review will be held by the URS provider.

If this review determines the complaint is in proper order the domain name will be locked, preventing changes to the DNS, and the allegedly offending registrant will be notified of the complaint. The registrant then has 14 calendar days to respond to the complaint before the complaint proceeds to default.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

After the complaint has been filed and either a response has been received or the complaint has entered default, a single examiner selected by the provider determines the outcome. The examiner should then examine the evidence and issue a verdict using a standard of clear and convincing evidence.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

The examiner should find in favor of the complainant if; the registered domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a word mark, the complainant holds a valid and current national or regional registration of the mark in question, this mark is registered and validated in the Trademark Clearinghouse, the registrant has no legitimate right or interest to the domain name, and the domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. All standards must be met for the examiner to find in favor of the complainant.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

If the examiner determines that the domain name is non-infringing use, or a [[Fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]], the complaint should be dismissed.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt; However, the URS guidelines do not define "fair use", nor do they indicate which specific jurisdiction's definition of "fair use" should be used.&lt;ref name=URS_proc /&gt;

===Examples===
In October 2014 the domain names radisson.club and radissonblu.club were suspended using the URS. Saravanan Dhandapani, acting as the first examiner for the National Arbitration Forum (NAF) and the Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC), determined these two domain names infringed on the trademark of Radisson hotels.&lt;ref name=india_URS /&gt;

==Pricing==
As of October 2014 registering a single trademark can cost between $95 and $150 for one year. Three year and five year registrations are also available at reduced cost, as are bulk discounts. In general registering a single mark for one year will always be the most expensive option, while registering multiple marks for longer periods will incur greater discount.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing /&gt;

Registries pay a one time fee to register between $7,000 - $10,000.&lt;ref name=registry_cost /&gt;

===Basic fee structure===
The basic fee structure is intended for registering small numbers of marks. It is only available to actual trademark holders, and not trademark agents. No bulk discounts are available, but discounts are given for registering marks for longer periods.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Basic /&gt;

* $150 for 1 year
* $435 for 3 years
* $725 for 5 years

===Advanced fee structure===
The advanced fee structure is intended for registering large numbers of marks. It is available for trademark holders and agents, and requires the establishment of a prepayment account. Discounts are available when buying in bulk and when purchasing for longer periods.

The advanced fee structure uses a [[Loyalty program]] to encourage more trademark registrations. Registrants using it gain points for each registration. As more points are earned successive levels are reached, which decrease the cost of the next batch of registrations. In short, the more registrations a registrant makes, and the longer their duration, the cheaper they get.&lt;ref name=TMCH_Pricing_Advanced /&gt;

==Implementation==
ICANN has subcontracted out most of the functionality of the Trademark Clearinghouse to [[IBM]] and [[Deloitte]]. IBM handles the technical implementation, administration and support of the trademark database. Deloitte is responsible for authentication and validation of trademarks.&lt;ref name=TMCH_providers /&gt;

==Use==
On March 25, 2013, the Trademark Clearinghouse claimed it had "delivered over 500,000 Trademark Claims notices and prevented over 475,000 trademarked names from being registered."&lt;ref name=half_million_TM_notices_served /&gt;

Uptake on new [[Generic top-level domain|gTLDs]] has been brisk, with 426 new gTLDs introduced to the Internet as of October 17, 2014.&lt;ref name=gtld_stats /&gt;

The '''''Winding-up and Restructuring Ac''t'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Winding-up and Restructuring Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. W-11)
|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-11/index.html |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Loi sur les liquidations et les restructurations}}) ("WURA") (the ''Act'') is a statute of the [[Parliament of Canada]] that provides for the [[winding up]] of certain corporations and the restructuring of financial institutions. It was passed in 1985, and has been amended since. Predecessors of the act date back to 1882.

==History==
Following the 1880 repeal of Canadian insolvency law at the federal level,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to repeal the Acts respecting Insolvency now in force in Canada|abbr =S.C.|year =1880|chapter =1|link= https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015074701296?urlappend=%3Bseq=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Parliament of Canada returned to the field in 1882, passing legislation "for the purpose of winding-up insolvent banks, and insolvent trading companies," known as ''An Act respecting Insolvent Banks, Insurance Companies, Loan Companies, Building Societies and Trading Corporations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act respecting Insolvent Banks, Insurance Companies, Loan Companies, Building Societies and Trading Corporations|abbr =S.C.|year =1882|chapter =23|link= https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015074701197?urlappend=%3Bseq=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|p= 235}} Until the passage of the ''Bankruptcy Act'' in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Bankruptcy Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1919|chapter =36|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1919v01cana#page/n339/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was the only federal statute governing insolvency, and it only extended to corporations. The 1919 Act covered individuals and corporations, so corporations were given a choice as to how to proceed with the liquidation of their affairs.

In 1899, provision was made for [[compromise]]s and [[scheme of arrangement|arrangement]]s to be made during winding-up proceedings, subject to the approval by the creditors and the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Winding Up Amendment Act, 1899|abbr =S.C.|year =1899|chapter =43|section=3|link= https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015074723068?urlappend=%3Bseq=361}}, now [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-11/page-6.html ss. 65-66] of the current Act&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|one commentator has suggested that the provision has been largely unused since that date{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|p= 266}}}}

In 1966, bankruptcy proceedings were given precedence over winding-up proceedings,{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|p= 236}} and any of the latter instituted prior to a bankruptcy petition or assignment coming into effect had to be abated forthwith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act|abbr =S.C.|year =1966-67|chapter =32|section=21|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl196667v01cana#page/244/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Act was retitled as the ''Winding-up and Restructuring Act'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =An Act to amend, enact and repeal certain laws relating to financial institutions|abbr =S.C.|year =1996|chapter =6|section=133|link= https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1996v01cana#page/n179/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provision was made for the restructuring of insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;1996 Act, s. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

|
* insolvent,
* in liquidation or in the process of being wound up, and any interested party petitions to be brought under the act, or
* a financial institution, which is under the control, or its assets are under the control, of the Superintendent and is the subject of an application for a winding-up order,&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

A company is deemed insolvent when:&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

* it is unable to pay its debts as they become due (and a debt over $200, for which a demand in writing to pay the amount is not settled within 60 days, is deemed to be so),&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

:* is unable to arrange a transfer of a financial institution's business to a bridge institution
:* is unable to arrange a restructuring plan for such a financial institution

===Exceptions===
The Act cannot be used when proceedings have already been instituted under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'', S. 213 | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/page-108.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is the only route for insolvent financial institutions to take, as they are not covered by the ''BIA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act'', S. 2, definition of "corporation" | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-3/FullText.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also offers a little-used route for corporations (other than those governed by the ''CBCA'', ''CCoopA'' or ''CNPCA'') to seek liquidation or winding-up that does not necessarily call for being insolvent (except for provincially incorporated companies, where the insolvency requirement is mandatory).{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|loc= p.239, fn. 36}} Companies for which there is no provision for winding-up either within their native statutes or under applicable provincial legislation&lt;ref&gt;such as, in Ontario, the {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.O.|year =1990|chapter =C.38|part= VI|link= https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c38#BK235}}, the {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Business Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.O.|year =1990|chapter =B.16|part= XVI|link= https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90b16#BK179}} or the {{Cite canlaw|short title  =Co-operative Corporations Act|abbr =R.S.O.|year =1990|chapter =C.35|section= 161|link= https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c35#BK199}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprise those incorporated under:{{sfn|IIC|2000|p= 6}}

:* Special Acts of Parliament
:* Special Acts of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]
:* the ''Canada Corporations Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canada Corporations Act |abbr =R.S.C.|year =1970|chapter =C-32|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-1.8/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
:* the ''Defence Production Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Defence Production Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =D-1|section =6|subsection =1|link= http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/D-1/section-6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;''
:* the ''Pension Fund Societies Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Pension Fund Societies Act|abbr =R.S.C.|year =1985|chapter =P-8|section =3|link=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-8/section-3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Operation==
===Nature relative to the ''Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act''===
The WURA contains several provisions that stand in contrast to the BIA:

#While the BIA provides that a creditor can only petition a debtor into bankruptcy only where the latter has committed an act of bankruptcy, the WURA provides that a debtor who fails to settle a demand served by a creditor within 60 days is deemed to have committed an act of insolvency and can thus be petitioned immediately into a winding-up proceeding. This is in contrast to any other act of insolvency established under the Act.
#[[Crown immunity]] is not abolished with respect to its proceedings, and by extension Crown claims cannot be compromised in a restructuring.{{sfn|IIC|2000|p=8}}
#Provisions relating to the avoidance of preferential transactions and contracts do not contain [[limitation period]]s,&lt;ref&gt;WURA, ss. 96-99&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|IIC|2000|pp=9-10}} and payments made within thirty days of the commencement of proceedings are automatically presumed to be capable of being set aside.&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 100(2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|p=247}}
#There are only two classes of preferred claims, being the costs of administration&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 94&lt;/ref&gt; and certain wages and salaries due to employees.&lt;ref&gt;WURA, s. 72&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|IIC|2000|p=13}}
#Inspectors may be appointed by the court in WURA proceedings, although their powers are undefined.{{sfn|Telfer|Welling|2008|pp=248-251}}

===Nature of liquidator===
In ''Coopérants, Mutual Life Insurance Society (Liquidator of) v Dubois'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Coopérants, Mutual Life Insurance Society (Liquidator of) v Dubois|link=|year=1996|court=scc|num=242|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1996] 1 SCR 900|date=1996-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] held that a liquidator appointed under the ''Act'' was conceptually distinct from a [[trustee in bankruptcy]] appointed under the ''[[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]'':

{{cquote|
Contrary to what occurs in the case of bankruptcy, the company continues to own its property, which is not transferred to the liquidator. Under s. 33 of the ''Winding‑up Act'', the liquidator takes all the company's property, effects and choses in action "into his custody or under his control"...&lt;ref&gt;''Coopérants'', par. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The liquidator is an officer of the court, appointed by the court to perform the functions prescribed by the ''Act'' and exercising his powers and performing his duties under the court's supervision. The corporate state and all the powers of the corporation continue after a winding‑up order is made; but from the time of such order the corporation is to cease to carry on business, except in so far as the liquidator considers it necessary for its beneficial winding up (s. 19). Even then, the liquidator must have the court's approval to do so under s. 35.&lt;ref&gt;''Coopérants'', par. 33, citing {{cite book |last= Sutherland|first= Harry|date= 1993|title= Fraser and Stewart: Company Law of Canada|url= |location= Toronto|publisher= Carswell|page= 845|isbn=  0-459-56778-0|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
