[[File:The mmuo of a girl.jpg|thumb|An Agbogho Mmuo and two attendees]]
'''Agbogho Mmuo''', or '''Maiden [[Igbo mythology|Spirits]]''' are annual performances held during the [[dry season]] in the [[Nri-Igbo|Nri]]-[[Awka]] area in the northern part of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]s' traditional territory. Performed only by men wearing [[African traditional masks|masks]], the masquerades imitate the character of [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls, exaggerating the girls' beauty and movements. The performance is always accompanied by [[Igbo music|musicians]] who sing and play tributes to both real and spirit maidens.

The performances showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl’s features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. The chalky substance is also used in [[Uli (design)|uli design]], created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Most maiden spirit mask are decorated with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th-century ceremonial hairstyles. These hairstyles include elaborate coiffures and crests which intend to add beauty to the mask.

This art style is featured in the book [[Purple Hibiscus]] written by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]].

The '''American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society''' was created in 1895 as New York’s first organized preservation lobby. The Society operated as a national organization to protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America. &lt;ref&gt;"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society." ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no information about when the Society dissolved but there are no records of their activities after 1979.


==Projects==
The Society's primary purpose was to protect historic and/or scenic sites. In many cases, it acted as custodian for these properties, purchasing them, providing maintenance, and keeping them open to the public. Examples&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nypl.org/mss/91 NYPL Archives - Collection Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; include:
* [[Battle Island State Park|Battle Island Park]]
* [[Fort Brewerton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fort Brewerton will be restored by Historic Society||work=New York Times|issue=p. 11|date=November 23, 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Stony Point Battlefield|Stony Point Battlefield Reservation]]
* [[Watkins Glen State Park|Watkins Glen]]

==Awards==
The Society had responsibility for selecting the recipients of a number of Awards, the most prestigious being the [[Pugsley Medal]], created by [[Cornelius Amory Pugsley]] in 1928. The award honors champions of parks and conservation. After the dissolution of the Society, the Pugsley Medal was awarded by the [[National Park Foundation]]. In recent years, the Award has been presented by the American Academy for Park and Recreation Administration.

'''An Lanntair''' ({{IPA-gd|əˈl̪ˠãũn̪ˠt̪ɛɾʲ|lang}}) is an arts centre in the town of [[Stornoway]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland. The centre is home to a [[Movie theater|cinema]], and [[art gallery]]. Previously located in the Town Hall, in September 2005 An Lanntair moved to its current new building overlooking the harbour. This building features a 50-seater restaurant, art gallery, shop, and auditorium seating over two hundred. The auditorium houses the first cinema in Stornoway since 1995.

An Lanntair is the principal venue for arts and entertainment events in Stornoway and regularly hosts performances by musicians as well as plays, talks, and films. It is a key venue for the annual [[Hebridean Celtic Festival]], and has hosted events for the [[Royal National Mòd]] in 2005 and 2011.

Its name is [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] for ''the lantern''.

'''[[Archangel Michael]]''' may be depicted in [[Christian art]] alone or with other [[angels]] such as [[Gabriel]] or saints. Some depictions with Gabriel date back to the 8th century, e.g. the stone casket at [[Mortain|Notre Dame de Mortain]] church in France.&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;  He is very often present in scenes of the [[Last Judgement]], but few other specific scenes, so most images including him are devotional rather than narrative.  The angel who rescues [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]] from the "fiery furnace" in the Book of {{Bibleref2|Daniel|3|NIV|Daniel Chapter 3}} is usually regarded in Christian tradition as Michael; this is sometimes represented in [[Early Christian art]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s, but rarely in later art of the Western church. 

In most depictions Michael is represented as an angelic warrior, fully armed with helmet, sword, and shield,&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; in the style of a Byzantine officer, which is typically found even in Western depictions, though some late-medieval ones have him in contemporary knightly armour.  Like other angels, in late-medieval Western art he may have what are known as [[feather tights]], with large feathers over most of his body, as on the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]].  He may be standing over a serpent, a dragon, or the defeated figure of Satan, whom he sometimes pierces with a lance.&lt;ref name=Cathenc /&gt; The iconography of Michael slaying a serpent goes back to the early 4th century, when [[Emperor Constantine]] defeated [[Licinius]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 324 AD, not far from the ''[[Michaelion]]'', a church dedicated to Archangel Michael.&lt;ref name=Richard &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantine felt that Licinius was an agent of Satan, and associated him with the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#12:9|12:9]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine and the Christian empire'' by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 {{ISBN|0415174856}} page 315&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard [[iconography]] of Archangel Michael as a [[warrior saint]].&lt;ref name=Richard /&gt;

In other depictions Michael may be holding a pair of scales in which he weighs the [[souls]] of the departed and may hold the [[book of Life]] (as in the [[Book of Revelation]]), to show that he takes part in the [[Last judgment|judgment]].&lt;ref name=rich141 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cathenc &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10275b.htm |title=Catholic encyclopedia: '&amp;#39;St. Michael the Archangel'&amp;#39; |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this form of depiction is less common than the slaying of the dragon.&lt;ref name=rich141 &gt;''Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend'' by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 {{ISBN|1843831287}} pages 141-147&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelangelo]] depicted this scene on the altar wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |title=Vatican website: Sistine Chapel |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |accessdate=2010-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031746/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Monuments/The_Vatican_Museums/Sistine_Chapel--p--5.htm |archivedate=2010-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shield may bears the Latin inscription ''[[Quis ut Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ball, 2003 ''Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices'' {{ISBN|087973910X}} page 520&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art]] Michael was often shown wearing the formal court robes and ''[[loros]]'' that were worn by the Emperor and his bodyguard on special occasions, rather than as a normal warrior who battled Satan or with scales for weighing souls on the [[Day of Judgement]].&lt;ref&gt;''Saints in art'' by Rosa Giorgi, Stefano Zuffi 2003 {{ISBN|0892367172}} pages 274-276&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely reproduced image of ''[[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]]'', an icon of the [[Cretan school]], depicts Michael on the left carrying the lance and sponge of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], with [[Gabriel]] on the right side of [[Madonna and Child|Mary and Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;''Icons and saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church'' by Alfredo Tradigo 2006 {{ISBN|0892368454}} page 188&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] depictions, there are three icons of the Archangel Michael in whose composition he is said to have personally intervened: Archangel Michael of Mantamados in [[Mytilene]], Archangel Michael of [[Panormitis]] and Archangel Michael of [[Nenita (Greece)|Nenita]]. Each of these icons is different.

&lt;!--More typically, he is represented as the Chief Commander of the [[Heavenly hosts]], holding a sword in one hand; in the other he often carries either a shield, a date-tree branch, a spear, or a white banner (possibly with a scarlet cross). Some icons show him holding an orb in one hand and a staff in the other. Inside the orb are often the superimposed Greek letters ΧΡ, the [[ChiRho]] symbol for Christ.

Michael is also represented in icons as standing on a horizontal body and with his left arm held high, holding a small image of a "baby". The body represents a human being at the time of his death and the image of the "baby" represents the soul of the deceased. This icon came about since the belief that the Archangel Michael takes the souls of the dead to [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. This is typical of the miraculous and wonder-working Archangel Michael of Panormitis, in Symi of Greece.

In Russian iconography he is most likely to be wearing red. In many instances, Michael tramples the devil under his feet, which may be depicted as a dragon. This comes from the tradition that Michael was the main opponent of Satan in the [[War in Heaven|battle for Heaven]]. Satan, previously called Samael, was always looking to discredit [[Israelites|Israel]], while Michael was its main protector. In the end, Satan attempted to drag Michael down in his [[Fallen Angels|fall from the heights]], but Michael was rescued by God. --&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''batik'' is [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in origin. It may either come from the Javanese word ''amba'' ('to write') and ''titik'' ('dot'), or may derive from a hypothetical [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] root ''*beCík'' ('to tattoo'). The word is first recorded in English in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] of 1880, in which it is spelled ''battik''. It is attested in the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] during the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial period in various forms: ''mbatek'', ''mbatik'', ''batek'' and ''batik''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50018371?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=batik&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary: ''Batik'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=batik Dictionary.com: ''Batik'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3623057 | title=Austronesian Etymologies - IV | author=Blust, Robert | journal=Oceanic Linguistics | date=Winter 1989 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=111–180 | authorlink=Robert Blust | doi=10.2307/3623057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Niya batik.jpg|thumb|Wax-resist dyed textile from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)]], China]]
[[File:Prajnaparamita clothes detail.JPG|thumb|Pattern of clothes of 13th century East Javanese [[Prajnaparamita]] statue resembles batik]]

Wax resist dyeing of fabric is an ancient art form. It already existed in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in the 4th century BC, where it was used to wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and scratched using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the [[Nara Period]] (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] tribe in Nigeria, [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nadia Nava, ''Il batik'' - Ulissedizioni - 1991 {{ISBN|88-414-1016-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These African version however, uses [[cassava]] starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Batik in Africa |url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyAfrica.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild| accessdate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of batik is most highly developed in the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]]. In Java, all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made.&lt;ref name="BGJava"&gt;{{cite web | title=Batik in Java | url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyJava.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as [[Toraja]], [[Flores]], [[Halmahera]], and [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.my"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJVgQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=iwan+tirta Iwan Tirta, Gareth L. Steen, Deborah M. Urso, Mario Alisjahbana, 'Batik: a play of lights and shades, Volume 1', By Gaya Favorit Press, 1996] {{ISBN|979-515-313-7}} {{ISBN|978-979-515-313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rouffaer reported that the ''gringsing'' pattern was already known by the 12th century in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[East Java]]. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the ''[[canting]]'', an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax, and proposed that the ''canting'' was invented in Java around that time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.my"/&gt; The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese [[Prajnaparamita]] statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese ''jlamprang'' or ''ceplok'' batik motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Keunikan Makna Filosofi Batik Klasik: Motif Jlamprang | date=19 July 2013 | url=http://fitinline.com/article/read/keunikan-makna-filosofi-batik-klasik-motif-jlamprang| publisher=Fit in line | language=Indonesian | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif is thought to represent the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]], a sacred flower in Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the ''canting'' existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.&lt;ref name="Volkenkunde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prajnaparamita and other Buddhist deities |url=http://volkenkunde.nl/nl/node/1049 |publisher=Volkenkunde Rijksmuseum |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004644/http://volkenkunde.nl/nl/node/1049 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the technique was described for the first time in the ''History of Java'', published in London in 1817 by [[Stamford Raffles]], who had been a British governor for Bengkulu, Sumatra. In 1873 the Dutch merchant [[Van Rijckevorsel]] gave the pieces he collected during a trip to Indonesia to the ethnographic museum in Rotterdam. Today the [[Tropenmuseum]] houses the biggest collection of Indonesian batik in the Netherlands. The Dutch and Chinese colonists were active in developing batik, particularly coastal batik, in the late colonial era. They introduced new patterns as well as the use of the ''cap'' (copper block stamps) to mass-produce batiks. Displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] at Paris in 1900, the Indonesian batik impressed the public and artists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; &lt;!--After the independence of Indonesia and the decline of the Dutch textile industry, the Dutch batik production was lost. The [[Gemeentemuseum]], [[The Hague]] contains artefacts from that era.--&gt;

In the 1920s, Javanese batik makers migrating to Malaya (now Malaysia) introduced the use of wax and copper blocks to its east coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/malaysia/engelsk/0_b_side1.html Museum of Cultural History, Oslo: Malaysia - Batikktradisjoner i bevegelse]. Retrieved 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Subsaharan Africa]], Javanese batik was introduced in the 19th century by Dutch and English traders. The local people there adapted the Javanese batik, making larger motifs with thicker lines and more colours. In the 1970s, batik was introduced to Australia, where aboriginal artists at Erna Bella have developed it as their own craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.republika.co.id/berita/breaking-news/seni-budaya/11/02/09/163234-antropolog-australia-beri-ceramah-soal-batik Antropolog Australia Beri Ceramah Soal Batik].

==Technique==
[[File:Women Making Batik, Ketelan crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Batik craftswomen in Java drawing intricate patterns using ''canting'' and wax that are kept hot and liquid in a heated small pan.]]

Firstly, a cloth is washed, soaked and beaten with a large mallet. Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of [[Alkane|paraffin]] or [[beeswax]], sometimes mixed with plant resins, which functions as a dye-resist. The wax can be applied with a variety of tools. A pen-like instrument called a ''[[canting]]'' ({{IPA-jv|tʃantiŋ}}, sometimes spelled with [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|old Dutch orthography]] ''tjanting'') is the most common. A ''tjanting'' is made from a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. For larger patterns, a stiff brush may be used.&lt;ref name="rita"&gt;Trefois, Rita (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4O8cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 Fascinating Batik]''. {{ISBN|978-90-815246-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a copper block stamp called a ''cap'' ({{IPA-jv|tʃap}}; old spelling ''tjap'') is used to cover large areas more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Batik Nomination for inscription on the Representative List in 2009 (Reference No. 00170)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Making Batik in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|Applying wax using ''cap'' (copper plate stamps).]]

After the cloth is dry, the resist is removed by boiling or scraping the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed the contrast between the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern.&lt;ref name="charan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Charan | title=Indian batik: Another Ancient Art of Printing on Textiles | url=http://charancreations.blogspot.in/2011/09/indian-batik-another-ancient-art-of.html | accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.

The most traditional type of batik, called batik ''tulis'' (written batik), is drawn using only the ''canting''. The cloth needs to be drawn on both sides, and dipped in a dye bath three to four times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Culture==

===Indonesia===
Many Indonesian batik patterns are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols designed to bring the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, as well as their families.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Batik-The-Forbidden-Designs-of-Java|title=Batik: The Forbidden Designs of Java - Australian Museum|work=australianmuseum.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/11/batik-patterns-hold-deep-significance.html |title=Batik patterns hold deep significance |work=thejakartapost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005919/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/11/batik-patterns-hold-deep-significance.html |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of [[fractal]] [[geometry]] in traditional designs.&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, Hokky; Dahlan, Rolan; Surya, Yohanes.

Batik garments play a central role in certain Javanese rituals, such as the ceremonial casting of royal batik into a volcano. In the Javanese [[tujuh bulanan|''naloni mitoni'']] ceremony, the mother-to-be is wrapped in seven layers of batik, wishing her good things. Batik is also prominent in the ''tedak siten'' ceremony when a child touches the earth for the first time.&lt;!--Batik is also part of the [[labuhan]] ceremony when people gather at a beach to throw their problems away into the sea.--&gt;&lt;ref name="batik days"&gt;{{cite web | title = Batik Days | newspaper = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 2 October 2009 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/10/02/batik-days.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[UNESCO]] designated Indonesian batik as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. As part of the acknowledgment, UNESCO insisted that Indonesia preserve its heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00170|title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention :|author=UNESCO - Intangible Heritage Section|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day, October 2, 2009 has been stated by Indonesian government as National [[Batik Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://setkab.go.id/berita-10487-ingat-besok-hari-batik-nasional-wajib-pakai-batik.html |title = Ingat, Besok Hari Batik Nasional, Wajib Pakai Batik |website = setkab.go.id |access-date = 1 October 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131003214201/http://setkab.go.id/berita-10487-ingat-besok-hari-batik-nasional-wajib-pakai-batik.html |archivedate = 3 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as also at the time the map of Indonesian batik diversity by [[Hokky Situngkir]] was opened for public for the first time by the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surya.ac.id/viewarticle/0/0/76/Mengupas.Center.for.Complexity.Surya.University|title=Mengupas Center for Complexity Surya University |access-date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Popularity====
The popularity of batik in [[Indonesia]] has varied. Historically, it was essential for ceremonial costumes and it was worn as part of a ''[[kebaya]]'' dress, commonly worn every day. The use of batik was already recorded in the 12th century, and the textile has become a strong source of identity for Indonesians crossing religious, racial and cultural boundaries. It is also believed the motif made the batik famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesialogue.com/destinations/book-review-batik-creating-an-identity.html|title=Book Review – Batik: Creating an Identity|work=WhyGo Indonesia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713030220/http://www.indonesialogue.com/destinations/book-review-batik-creating-an-identity.html|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The batik industry of Java flourished from the late 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; With increasing preference of western clothing, the batik industry further declined following the Indonesian independence. Batik has somewhat revived at the turn of the 21st century, through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers to innovate batik by incorporating new colours, fabrics, and patterns. Batik has become a fashion item for many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or scarves for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions. Traditional batik [[sarong]]s are still used in many occasions.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

After the UNESCO recognition for Indonesian batik on 2 October 2009, the Indonesian administration asked Indonesians to wear batik on Fridays, and wearing batik every Friday has been encouraged in government offices and private companies ever since.&lt;ref name=batikday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/09/29/administration-calls-allin-batik-day-friday.html|title=Administration calls for all-in batik day this Friday|work=thejakartapost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 October is also celebrated as National Batik Day in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=batikday/&gt; Batik had helped improve the [[small business]] local economy, batik sales in Indonesia had reached Rp 3.9 trillion (US$436.8 million) in 2010, an increase from Rp 2.5 trillion in 2006. The value of batik exports, meanwhile, increased from $14.3 million in 2006 to $22.3 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/28/let%E2%80%99s-use-batik-diplomatic-tool-sby.html |title=Let’s use batik as diplomatic tool: SBY |work=thejakartapost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001182019/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/28/let%E2%80%99s-use-batik-diplomatic-tool-sby.html |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik is also popular in the neighbouring countries of Singapore and Malaysia. It is produced in Malaysia with similar, but not identical, methods to those used in Indonesia. Prior to UNESCO's recognition and following the [[2009 Pendet controversy]], Indonesia and Malaysia disputed the ownership of batik culture. However, Dr Fiona Kerlogue of the [[Horniman museum]] argued that the Malaysian printed wax textiles, made for about a century, were quite a different tradition from the "very fine" traditional Indonesian batiks produced for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6251806/Indonesians-tell-Malaysians-Hands-off-our-batik.html Indonesians tell Malaysians 'Hands off our batik'] Telegraph.co.uk, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik is featured in the national airline uniforms of the three countries, represented by batik prints worn by flight attendants of [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]] and [[Malaysian Airline System|Malaysian Airlines]]. The female uniform of Garuda Indonesia flight attendants is a modern interpretation of the Kartini style ''[[kebaya]]'' with ''parang gondosuli'' motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://female.kompas.com/read/xml/2010/09/26/11502730/terbang.bersama.kebaya | title=Terbang Bersama Kebaya | accessdate=24 October 2011 | author = Indriasari, Lusiana | author2=Yulia Sapthiani | date=26 September 2010 | publisher=Female Kompas.com| language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.garuda-indonesia.com/news/2010/06/02/garuda-indonesia-launches-new-uniform |title=Garuda Indonesia Launches New Uniform |accessdate=24 October 2011 |author=Pujobroto, PT |date=2 June 2010 |publisher=Garuda Indonesia.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929225218/http://www.garuda-indonesia.com/news/2010/06/02/garuda-indonesia-launches-new-uniform |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminology====
[[File:Naming the parts of a kain batik.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Terminology of Indonesian batik]]
Batik is traditionally sold in 2.25-metre lengths used for ''kain panjang'' or [[sarong]]. It is worn by wrapping it around the hip, or made into a hat known as [[blangkon]]. The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections.

Certain patterns are only used in certain sections of the cloth. For example, a row of [[isosceles triangle]]s, forming the ''pasung'' motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called ''dhlorong'', are commonly used for the head. However, ''pasung'' and ''dhlorong'' are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as ''buketan'' (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

* The head is a rectangular section of the cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at the middle of the cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The ''papan'' inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is ''kain panjang'' or sarong.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;
* The body is the main part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two alternating patterns and colours called ''pagi-sore'' ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;
* Margins are often plain, but floral and lace-like patterns, as well as wavy lines described as a dragon, are common in the area beside ''seret''.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

====Types====
As each region has its own traditional pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik [[Surakarta|Solo]], batik [[Pekalongan]], and batik [[Madura]]. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into ''batik pedalaman'' (inland batik) or ''batik pesisir'' (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly into one of these two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://compsoc.bandungfe.net/kartografi-indonesia/motif-EN.html | title=Phylomemetic Tree of Indonesian Traditional Batik | author=Hokky Situngkir | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Javanese Batik=====

======Inland Batik======
[[File:Batik pedalaman banner.jpg|thumb|centre|1110px|A typical inland batik has deep earthy colours with various indigenous patterns (contemporary ''kain panjang'' with ''sidha'' pattern from Solo).]]
Inland batik or ''batik kraton'' (Javanese court batik) is the oldest form of batik tradition known in Java. Inland batik has earthy colour&lt;ref name=pameran&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL62_56.pdf Reichle, Natasha (2012). "Batik: Spectacular Textiles of Java" ''The Newsletter''. International Institute for Asian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; such as black, indigo, brown, and ''sogan'' (brown-yellow colour made from the tree ''[[Peltophorum pterocarpum]]''), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence. Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other are worn on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batik-indo.com/ |title=Arti dan Cerita di balik Motif Batik Klasik Jawa |author=Nunuk Pulandari |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925134318/http://www.batik-indo.com/ |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy }} (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; Noted inland batiks are produced in [[Surakarta|Solo]] and [[Jogjakarta]], cities traditionally regarded as the centre of [[Javanese culture]]. ''Batik Solo'' typically has ''sogan'' background and is preserved by the [[Susuhunan]] and [[Mangkunegaran|Mangkunegaran Court]]. ''Batik Jogja'' typically has white background and is preserved by the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and [[Pakualaman|Pakualaman Court]].&lt;ref name="batik days"/&gt;

======Coastal Batik======
[[File:Batik pesisir1 banner.jpg|thumb|centre|1110px|In contrast, a typical coastal batik has vibrant colours with patterns drawn from numerous cultures (''kain panjang'' with lotus motifs from Semarang, 1880).]]
Coastal batik is produced in several areas of northern [[Java]] and [[Madura]]. In contrast to inland batik, coastal batiks have vibrant colours and patterns inspired by a wide range of cultures as a consequence of maritime trading.&lt;ref name=pameran/&gt; Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, [[Chinese phoenix]], and Persian peacocks.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Noted coastal batiks are produced in [[Pekalongan]], [[Cirebon]], [[Lasem]], [[Tuban]], and [[Madura]]. Pekalongan has the most active batik industry.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

A notable sub-type of coastal batik called ''Jawa Hokokai'' is not attributed to a particular region. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages. The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called ''Jawa Hokokai''.&lt;ref name=br&gt;Sumarsono, Hartono; Ishwara, Helen; Yahya, L.R. Supriyapto; Moeis, Xenia (2013). ''Benang Raja: Menyimpul Keelokan Batik Pesisir''.  Jakarta: Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia. {{ISBN|978-979-9106-01-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Common motifs of ''Hokokai'' includes Japanese [[cherry blossoms]], butterflies, and chrysanthemums.

Another coastal batik called ''tiga negeri'' (batik of three lands) is attributed to three regions: Lasem, Pekalongan, and Solo, where the batik would be dipped in red, blue, and ''sogan'' dyes respectively. As of 1980, batik ''tiga negeri'' was only produced in one city.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

=====Sundanese Batik=====
[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] or Priangan Batik is the term for batik from the [[Priangan]] region of [[West Java]] and [[Banten]].&lt;ref&gt;Pradito, Didit; Jusuf, Herman; Atik, Saftyaningsih Ken (2010). ''The Dancing Peacock: Colours and Motifs of Priangan Batik''. Jakarta: Gramedia Pustaka Utama. {{ISBN|978-979-22-5825-7}}. Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Although Priangan batiks can use a wide range of colours, a preference for [[indigo]] is seen in some of its variants. Natural [[indigo dye]] made from ''[[Indigofera]]'' is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name ''tarum'' has lent its name to the [[Citarum river]] and the [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan batik is produced in [[Ciamis]], [[Garut]], and [[Tasikmalaya]]. Other traditions include Batik [[Kuningan]] influenced by batik Cirebon, batik [[Banten]] that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik [[Baduy people|Baduy]].

Batik [[Banten]] employs bright [[pastel colours]] and represents a revival of a lost art from the [[Sultanate of Banten]], rediscovered through archaeological work during 2002–2004. Twelve motifs from locations such as Surosowan and several other places have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haki.lipi.go.id/utama.cgi?cetakfenomena&amp;1113177052 Uke Kurniawan, Memopulerkan Batik Banten], haki.lipi.go.id, accessed 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik [[Baduy people|Baduy]] only employs [[indigo]] colour in shades ranged from bluish black to deep blue. It is traditionally worn as ''iket'', a type of [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] headress similar to [[Balinese people|Balinese]] ''udeng'', by Outer Baduy people of [[Lebak Regency]], [[Banten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/316176/batik-baduy-diminati-pengunjung-jakarta-fair |title=Batik Baduy diminati pengunjung Jakarta Fair |date=15 June 2012 |publisher=Antara News.com |language=Indonesian |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729004247/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/316176/batik-baduy-diminati-pengunjung-jakarta-fair |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sumatran Batik=====
Trade relations between the [[Melayu Kingdom]] in [[Jambi]] and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century. Therefore, coastal batik from northern Java probably influenced Jambi. In 1875, Haji Mahibat from Central Java revived the declining batik industry in Jambi. The village of Mudung Laut in Pelayangan district is known for producing batik Jambi. Batik Jambi, as well as Javanese batik, influenced the [[Malaysian batik]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Traveller Indonesia, Vol 1, No 6, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people also produce batik called ''batiak tanah liek'' (clay batik), which use clay as dye for the fabric. The fabric is immersed in clay for more than 1 day and later designed with motifs of animal and flora.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Batik from [[Bengkulu]], a city on west coast of Sumatra, is called ''Batik Besurek'', which literary means "batik with letters" as they draw inspiration from [[Arabic calligraphy]].

=====Balinese Batik=====
Batik making in the island of [[Bali]] is relatively new, but a fast-growing industry. Many patterns are inspired by local designs, which are favoured by the local [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and domestic tourists.&lt;ref&gt;http://batikasliindonesia.blogdetik.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Objects from nature such as [[frangipani]] and [[hibiscus]] flowers, birds or fishes, and daily activities such as [[Balinese dance]]r and ''[[ngaben]]'' processions or religious and mythological creatures such as ''[[Barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Kāla (time)|kala]]'' and winged lion are common. Modern batik artists express themselves freely in a wide range of subjects.&lt;ref name="balibatik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balibatiku.com/balibatik.html|title=Bali Batik, Bali Sarong, Kimono - Bali Textiles, Bali Garment, Clothing - balibatiku.com|work=balibatiku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary batik is not limited to traditional or ritual wearing in Bali. Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant fabric that can be used to make casual or formal cloth. Using high class batik, like hand made ''batik tulis'', can show social status.&lt;ref name="balibatik"/&gt;

===Malaysia===
[[File:Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|A batik craftsman making batik. [[Malaysian batik]] are usually patterned with floral motifs with light colouring.]]
{{main article|Malaysian batik}}
Batik was mentioned in the 17th century [[Malay Annals]]. The legend goes when [[Laksamana Hang Nadim]] was ordered by [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of ''serasah'' cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dewan sastra| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVkAAAAMAAJ| year=2001| publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: 1952| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZlhAAAAMAAJ|year=1953 | publisher=The Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Today, [[Malaysian batik]] can be found on the east coast of Malaysia such as om [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]], while batik in [[Johor]] clearly shows [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Sumatra]]n influences since there are a large number of Javanese and Sumatran immigrants in southern Malaysia.{{cn|date=May 2014}}--&gt;

The method of Malaysian batik making is different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the ''canting'' to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on [[brush]] painting to apply colours&lt;!--colors or resist? If it's colours, then this is not a batik technique--&gt; to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm|title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.&lt;!-- The Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals.{{cn|date=May 2014}}--&gt;

===India===
Indians are known to use resist method of printing designs on cotton fabrics, which can be traced back 2000 years. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern batik is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, household linen, and scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns.&lt;ref name="charan"/&gt; Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of [[Delhi]], these women are fluent in [[Indian Sign Language]] and also work in other vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Burch, Susan |author2=Kaferq, Alison | title=Deaf and Disability Studies | year=2010 | publisher=GU Press | location=Washington D.C | isbn=1-56368-464-0 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
{{main article|Batik industry in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Woman with brush painting batik Sri Lanka.JPG|thumb|A batik craftswoman brush painting with wax in [[Kandy]], Sri Lanka]]
&lt;!--Batik was brought to Sri Lanka from [[Java]] by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]],{{cn|date=May 2014}}&lt;Sunday Observer ref states "it is said that... Portuguese merchants"&gt; and --&gt;Over the past century, batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The Sri Lankan batik industry is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along [[Hikkaduwa]]'s Galle Road strip. [[Mahawewa Divisional Secretariat|Mahawewa]], on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lanka.com/about/interests/sri-lankan-batik/ | title=Sri Lankan Batik Textiles | publisher=Lakpura Travels | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SundayObserver&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/10/fea05.asp | title=Brighter future for batik industry | publisher=Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka) | date=10 June 2012 | accessdate=1 May 2014 | author=Kannangara, Ananda | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003257/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/10/fea05.asp | archivedate=2 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Batik is done by the ethnic people in the South-West of China. The [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Bouyei people|Bouyei]] and [[Gejia people]] use a dye resist method for their traditional costumes. The traditional costumes are made up of decorative fabrics, which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Like the Javanese, their traditional patterns also contain symbolism, the patterns include the dragon, phoenix, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyChina.asp, Batik in China]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905031019/http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyChina.asp%2C |date=5 September 2011  }} The Batik Guild, 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, where batik was originally imported by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants from [[Indonesia]] (then the [[Netherlands East Indies]]), paste made from starch or mud is used as a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills are to be found in Nigeria where the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] make [[Adire (textile art)|adire]] cloths. Two methods of resist are used: ''adire eleso'' which involves tied and stitched designs and ''adire eleko'' that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

'''Blue Scholars''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], created in 2002 while the members, [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Sabzi (musician)|Sabzi]] (Saba Mohajerjasbi) and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] Geologic (George Quibuyen), were students at [[University of Washington]].

The name "Blue Scholars" is a play on the term "[[blue-collar worker|blue collar]]," an [[idiom]] for workers who often earn hourly wages for manual labor. Their music and lyrics frequently focus on struggles between socioeconomic classes, challenging authority and youth empowerment. These themes are often specifically addressed in relation to the Seattle region ("Southside Revival", "North by Northwest", "50 Thousand Deep", "Joe Metro", "Slick Watts" and "[[The Ave]]"), and heavily draw upon Geologic's history as an activist within the [[Filipino American]] community dealing with issues of immigration, racism, and U.S. imperialism in [[the Philippines]]. Recent music has begun to extend even further outward, reflecting the group's greater [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and Pacific roots including an album devoted to exploring Geo's [[Hawaiian people|Hawaiian]] heritage on the ''[[OOF! EP]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://02cd02a.netsolhost.com/blog/releases/oof-ep/|title=OOF!

==History==
Since 2002, Blue Scholars have been based in southeast Seattle. The hip hop group first came to be in 2002 because, "two students skipped a class, went and crafted an album", as it says in the track Bayani. The two students, George Quibuyen and Alexei Saba Mohajerjasbi, were attending the [[University of Washington]] at the time. The two met at a meeting for S.H.O.W. (the Student HipHop Organization of Washington) which was organized by classmate and future manager Marc Matsui.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Scholars Bio and Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had set out to revive an authentic interest in hip hop within Seattle which, at the time, had become a solely rock town. This was a result of a series of incidents including a shooting at an [[Ice Cube]] concert in the early 1990s as well as the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]]. George and Alexei soon joined forces and formed their own duo that utilized Geo's raps and Sabzi's beats and became known as the Blue Scholars.

Since then the duo has performed in over 400 shows together across the [[United States]] including the [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]] in 2005, 2006, and 2008, and [[Bumbershoot]] opening for [[Kanye West]] in 2006. They have opened for and shared stages with such artists as [[De La Soul]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Wordsworth (rapper)|Wordsworth]], [[Kanye West]], [[Hieroglyphics (band)|Hieroglyphics]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[The Coup]] and [[Masta Ace]].&lt;ref name=sasquatch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hob.com/tickets/festivals/sasquatch/2006/artists/bluescholars.asp |title=House Of Blues |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813161727/http://www.hob.com/tickets/festivals/sasquatch/2006/artists/bluescholars.asp |archivedate=2006-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threeimaginarygirls.com/bluescholars05dec.asp|title=The Long March|work=Three Imaginary Girls}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Blue Scholars received top honors in the hip hop category of the [[Seattle Weekly]]'s Music Awards Poll, and were also the top vote-getters overall; in earlier years, they had been recognized in the categories of Best Hip-hop Artist, Best Local Single, and Best Album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0619/winners.php |title=Seattle News and Events - News |work=Seattle Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819142104/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0619/winners.php |archivedate=2006-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0519/050511_music_awards.php |title=Seattle News and Events - News |work=Seattle Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316001534/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0519/050511_music_awards.php |archivedate=2006-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/arts/0531/050803_bestof_arts_critics.php |title=Seattle News and Events - News |work=Seattle Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716071445/http://www.seattleweekly.com/arts/0531/050803_bestof_arts_critics.php |archivedate=2006-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0419/040512_musicawards_winners.php |title=Seattle News and Events - News |work=Seattle Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234246/http://www.seattleweekly.com/music/0419/040512_musicawards_winners.php |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years the duo has continued to use their music as a tool for social change and DIY activism.  Since those formative years in S.H.O.W. at the University of Washington, Geo has continued to promote youth empowerment and support for political groups that include, but are not limited to, BAYAN-USA, isangmahal arts kollective, and [[Youth Speaks Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Jess Kroll, [http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/blue-scholars-bring-activist-hip-hop-back-to-hawaii/ Blue Scholars bring activist hip-hop back to Hawai’i] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804215634/http://thehawaiiindependent.com/story/blue-scholars-bring-activist-hip-hop-back-to-hawaii/ |date=August 4, 2010 }}, ''The Hawaiian Independent''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Geologic, representing Blue Scholars, went on tour with Hip Hop artist, Kiwi, to promote the '''Stop the Killings Tour''' to bring awareness to the deaths of regular people in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isangmahal.org/|title=DOMAIN ERROR|publisher=|access-date=2011-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008095210/http://isangmahal.org/|archive-date=2011-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==

===Geologic===
Geologic (born George Quibuyen; also known as Prometheus Brown, Geo) is the vocalist for the Blue Scholars and has also performed as a [[spoken word]] poet. In the 2007–08 citywide election for Seattle's Poet Populist, Quibuyen placed sixth with ninety-six write-in votes, the highest total for a [[write-in candidate]] in the nine-year history of the competition;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepoetpopulist.org/vote.htm 2007-2008 Poet Populist vote totals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130075953/http://www.seattlepoetpopulist.org/vote.htm |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although, the record was subsequently broken by Seattle poet Ananda Osel in the 2008-2009 election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetpopulist.org/current-poet.php 2008-2009 vote totals]&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of [[Philippines|Filipino]] immigrants, Quibuyen lived in various locations along the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Hawaii]] as a child until his family settled in [[Bremerton, Washington]]. Geo feels rooted in his Filipino heritage and that there is an unfinished revolution among his people.&lt;ref name="Blue Scholars Bio and Press"&gt;Blue Scholars Bio and Press&lt;/ref&gt; His lyrics are drawn from experience, crafted for a connection to community, and working to uplift communities in general.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Ishisaka and LaDessa Cobb, [http://naomiishisaka.wordpress.com/writing/cover-story-blue-scholars-class-is-in-session/ Blue Scholars-Class Is In Session], 10/8/11&lt;/ref&gt;  He remains a strong advocate for the Filipino community all over the world, as an outspoken critic of US foreign policy, including its tough immigration laws and unfair corporate practices by Western business.

In 2011, Prometheus Brown released the album "Prometheus Brown and Bambu Walk Into A Bar" with [[Los Angeles]] rapper [[Bambu (rapper)|Bambu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silencenogood.net/prometheus-brown-bambu-walk-into-a-bar/|title=Prometheus Brown &amp; Bambu ·· Walk Into a Bar|work=Silence Nogood}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, they released a second album, titled "Barkada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2dopeboyz.com/2014/03/15/the-bar-bambu-prometheus-brown-barkada-album-stream/|title=The Bar (Bambu &amp; Prometheus Brown) - Barkada (Album Stream)|work=2DOPEBOYZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geo's side project includes Hood Famous Bakery in Seattle.

===Sabzi===
[[Image:Blue Scholars 01A.jpg|thumb|Sabzi of Blue Scholars.]]
[[DJ Sabzi|Sabzi]] (born Alexei Saba Mohajerjasbi; also known as Saba) is of [[Iranian American]] heritage and is a [[jazz]]-trained [[pianist]]. He holds a background in [[punk rock|punk]] and [[ska]] before he turned to [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[Turntablism|turntables]] with the Blue Scholars.&lt;ref name=sasquatch/&gt;  A Seattle area native himself, [[DJ Sabzi|Sabzi]] is rooted in his own Iranian culture and practices [[Bahá'í Faith]] which is grounded in diversity, economic conservation, and other social justice practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/faq/facts/bahai_faith |title=The Bahá'í Faith |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026002751/http://www.bahai.org/faq/facts/bahai_faith |archivedate=2011-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[album]] Bayani contains a Bahá'í prayer chanted by Behnam Khoshkhoo as the first track. Similar to Geo, [[DJ Sabzi|Sabzi]] believes in organizing communities together in order to create change.  He is inspired by the youth that he works with in high school and college workshops as well as the community and finds their thoughts and opinions on music and society today to be one of the most influential factors in his music.

==Record label==
Opting to create their own record label rather than sign with an existing company, Blue Scholars members Geologic and Sabzi, along with MCs RA Scion of [[Common Market (band)|Common Market]] and [[Gabriel Teodros]], launched [http://www.masslinemedia.com  MassLine Media] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=37586|title=We Got Next|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The label's mission statement includes the goal of using hip hop as a means of grassroots community organizing and youth outreach. MassLine entered a joint venture with legendary{{Peacock term|date=June 2014}} hip hop label [[Rawkus Records]] in 2007 for the June 12, 2007 release of their new album [[Bayani (album)|Bayani]]; the name derives its meaning from two different languages. In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] it literally means "heroes of the people" and in [[Persian language|Persian]] "Bayan" means "the Word." The June 12 release also commemorated the anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from [[Spain]] in 1898. In July, 2009, Blue Scholars worked out a distribution relationship with Seattle coffee chain Cafe Vita and a record deal with Duck Down Records in which the label signed to the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | accessdate = 2009-08-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2011, the Blue Scholars made a further move away from the traditional music label structure, beginning a campaign of "signing to the people" where fans, supporters, and listeners will be the primary financial capital for their new record, [[Cinemetropolis]]. The project had already been more than 150% funded by over 1400 backers via Kickstarter just ten days after beginning. On April 22, the Kickstarter campaign ended making the Blue Scholars the first hip-hop artists to "Sign to the People." In total, the campaign raised $62,391 with the help of 2243 backers each pitching in an average of roughly $28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bluescholars/cinemetropolis-blue-scholars-signs-to-the-people?ref=live|title="CINEMETROPOLIS": BLUE SCHOLARS SIGNS TO THE PEOPLE|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==

The Blue Scholars plan on continuing to make music that empowers the youth and communities of [[Seattle]], the West Coast, the United States, and eventually the world.  They continue to experiment with different multi-media elements in their music and transcend what is considered "traditional" in the hip hop world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rebelfrequencies.blogspot.com/2009/10/blue-scholars-beating-back-boundaries.html Blue Scholars: Beating Back Boundaries], 10/7/11&lt;/ref&gt;

Front man Geo hopes to appeal to a culturally diverse audience. As the son of Filipino immigrants, he says he hopes to see more Filipino and Asian fans as well as more people of color in general at their shows.&lt;ref name="Blue Scholars Bio and Press"/&gt;

==Popular culture==
In [[Valve Corporation]]'s games ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' and in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', the Blue Scholars' name can be seen on the front of several radio boxes throughout the game along with the radio station "FM 89.50". It is also on an audio receiver in Kleiner's lab, above the camera screens. This is because Sabzi is the cousin of Dhabih Eng, an artist for Valve. 89.5 FM is a reference to the frequency of Seattle, WA radio station [[KNHC-FM]]. It is one of the few radio stations in the country that is run entirely by high school students, in this case the students of [[Nathan Hale High School (Washington)|Nathan Hale High School]].
	
The song "Sagaba Remix" is featured in the [[Xbox 360]] video game, ''[[Project Gotham Racing 4]]''.

'''Explorative strategies''' are used in drama to explore a theme or a text. They are associated with Edexcel GCSE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Types of strategies==
*''' Forum Theatre''' - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest.
*'''Thought Tracking''' - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc.
*'''Still Image''' - Also known as a "[[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]" or "tableau" or "snapshot" or "qais", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage.
*'''Hot Seating''' - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an "in class" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc.
*'''Cross Cutting''' - When time in a scene changes to show  what happens before or after a scene.
*'''Narrating''' - A character, normally called the "Narrator", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot
*'''Marking the moment''' - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc..
*'''Role-play''' - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character.

'''Fedoskino miniature''' ({{lang-ru|федоскинская миниатюра}}) is a traditional Russian lacquer miniature painting on ''[[papier-mache]]'', named after its original center Fedoskino (Федоскино), an old village near [[Moscow]] widely known from the late 18th century. The contemporary Fedoskino painting preserves the typical features of Russian folk art. 

The use of [[oil paint]], typically applied in many layers, is a distinctive feature of a Fedoskino miniature, as well as the use of [[mother-of-pearl]], pure [[gold]] or [[silver]] leaf under segments of the background to create the effect of a shimmering glow or silvery sparkle. Many boxes are painted inside and outside in imitation [[tortoiseshell]], birch bark, [[mahogany]] or [[tartan]].

The heyday of Fedoskino miniature fell on the second half of the 19th century, and the works of that time are known as 'lukutins', named after the merchants Lukutins, who owned the Fedoskino factory at that time. Some of the factory craftsmen had artistic education, and lots of them had come from icon painting studios. 

The popular motifs used in Fedoskino miniature are all sorts of tea-drinking with [[samovar]], [[Troika (driving)|troikas]] (carriage-and-three), and scenes from Russian peasant life.

}}
'''''Five Modern Nō Plays''''' is a collection of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] writer [[Yukio Mishima]]. Mishima wrote these plays between 1950 and 1955 and presented them as modern plays in [[Tokyo]]. Of these five, only The Damask Drum was expressed in the traditional Nō fashion. ''[[The Lady Aoi]]'' was expressed as a Western-style [[Opera]]. The plays take older Nō plots or traditional and foreign fairy tales and bring them to a modern setting. 

Famed Japan scholar [[Donald Keene]] translated "Five Modern Nō Plays."

==Plays==

*[[Sotoba Komachi (Mishima)|Sotoba Komachi]]:
A poet meets Komachi, a repulsive-looking old woman, at a Tokyo park in the night. She expresses the memory of when she had been lovely 80 years ago. She reminisces on a night in the 1880s, and together with the help of the poet (who acts the part of the Military Officer with whom she fell in love), they relive that night. The poet realizes that she is still beautiful, and sees past her ragged clothes and wretched body. But expressing her beauty can only result in death.  

*The Damask Drum:
An old man becomes enamored with a neighbor. The neighbor and her associates play a trick on the man by challenging him to sound a drum. If he can make the drum sound, he will earn a kiss. However, this drum is made of [[damask]], and is only a [[Theatrical property|prop]], incapable of making any sound. 

*Kantan:
A youth who see no meaning in anything, wonders what will happen if he sleeps on a magical pillow which makes the dreamer realize what he already understands, the futility of existence. 

*Hanjo
*[[The Lady Aoi]]

==Reception==

Mishima received the illustrious [[Kunio Kishida|Kishida]] Prize for Drama from [[Shinchosha|Shinchosha Publishing]], 1955.

'''''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''''' ({{lang-de|'''wie man dem toten Hasen die Bilder erklärt''' |italic=yes}}) was a [[performance art|performance piece]] enacted by the [[Germans|German]] artist [[Joseph Beuys]] on 26 November 1965 at the Galerie Schmela in [[Düsseldorf]]. While it was only Beuys’s first solo exhibition in a private gallery, it is sometimes referred to as his best known action.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Irving. ''Art Of The Postmodern Era: From The Late 1960s To The Early 1990s'' 2nd edition. Westview Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8133-3433-0}} P.89 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOGYJd1kcgC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=how+to+explain+pictures+to+a+dead+hare&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
At the beginning of the performance Beuys locked the gallery doors from the inside, leaving the gallery-goers outside. They could observe the scene within only through the windows. With his head entirely coated in honey and [[gold leaf]], he began to explain pictures to a dead [[hare]]. Whispering to the dead animal on his arm in an apparent dialog, he processed through the exhibit from artwork to artwork. Occasionally he would stop and return to the center of the gallery, where he stepped over a dead fir tree that lay on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Stachelhaus, ''Joseph Beuys'', Abbeville Press, New York, 1987, (Translated by David Britt), p. 135.  Cited [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~stam/suomi/stam/beuys.html here], retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After three hours the public was let into the room. Beuys sat upon a stool in the entrance area with the hare on his arm and his back to the onlookers.

==Interpretation and context==
The performance was the high point of Beuys' development of a [[Social sculpture|broadened definition of art]], which had already begun in his drawings of the 1950s. He celebrated the ritual of "[[Art criticism|explaining art]]" with an action that was, for his viewers, effectively silent. 

The relationship between thought, speech, and form in this performance was also characteristic of Beuys. In his last speech ''Speaking about Germany'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Sprechen über Deutschland'', 1985) he emphasized that he was essentially a man of words. In another instance he is quoted as saying: "When I speak, I try to guide that power's impulse so that it flows into a more fully descriptive language, which is the spiritual perception of growth."&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{lang-de|„Wenn ich spreche (…), versuche ich die Impulse dieser Kraft einzuführen, die aus einem volleren Sprachbegriff fließen, welcher der geistige Begriff der Entwicklung ist.“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Müller, ''Wie man dem toten Hasen die Bilder erklärt. Schamanismus und Erkenntnis im Werk von Joseph Beuys.'' (Dissertation) VDG Weimar 1994, {{ISBN|3-9803234-8-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Entwicklung: history? development? growth? --&gt; The integration of speech and conversation into his visual works plays a meaningful role in ''How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare''.

The hare is an animal with broad, centuries-old symbolic meaning in many religions. In [[Greek mythology]] it was associated with the love goddess [[Aphrodite]], to the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Germanic tribes]] it was a symbol of fertility, and in [[Christianity]] it came to be connected with [[Resurrection of Christ|the Resurrection]]. This interpretation is also supported by the "mask" that Beuys wore during his performance: [[Gold#Symbolism|gold]] as a symbol for the power of the sun, wisdom, and purity, and [[Honey#Honey_in_history.2C_culture.2C_and_folklore|honey]] as a Germanic symbol for rebirth. 

Beuys explained:
{{cquote|For me the Hare is a symbol of incarnation, which the hare really enacts- something a human can only do in imagination. It burrows, building itself a home in the earth. Thus it incarnates itself in the earth: that alone is important. So it seems to me. Honey on my head of course has to do with thought. While humans do not have the ability to produce honey, they do have the ability to think, to produce ideas. Therefore the stale and morbid nature of thought is once again made living. Honey is an undoubtedly living substance- human thoughts can also become alive. On the other hand  intellectualizing can be deadly to thought: one can talk one's mind to death in politics or in academia.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;{{lang-de|„Für mich ist der Hase das Symbol für die Inkarnation, Denn der Hase macht das ganz real, was der Mensch nur in Gedanken kann. Er gräbt sich ein, er gräbt sich einen Bau. Er inkarniert sich in die Erde, und das allein ist wichtig. So kommt er bei mir vor. Mit Honig auf dem Kopf tue ich natürlich etwas, was mit denken zu tun hat. Die menschliche Fähigkeit ist, nicht Honig abzugeben, sondern zu denken, Ideen abzugeben. Dadurch wird der Todescharakter des Gedankens wieder lebendig gemacht. Denn Honig ist zweifelslos eine lebendige Substanz. Der menschliche Gedanke kann auch lebendig sein. Er kann aber auch interellektualisierend tödlich sein, auch tot bleiben, sich todbringend äußern etwa im politischen Bereich oder der Pädagogik.“}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieberknecht, 1971, cited by Adriani / Konnertz / Thomas , 1984, P.155&lt;/ref&gt;}}

 Ebenso kann die Beziehung Mensch – Hase betrachtet werden: „So vermute ich, dass eher der tote Hase die Bedeutung der Kunst begreift, als der sogenannte gesunde Menschenverstand. Der menschliche Betrachter zeigt sich ohne jedes Verständnis, da er schon immer alles verstanden hat, noch bevor er überhaupt richtig hingeschaut hat, d.h. im Wettlauf mit dem Hasen gefällt er sich in der Rolle des Igels.“ (Marcel Chromik).

Mit dem Dadaismus hatten die Aktionen der Fluxusbewegung die Vergänglichkeit und Zufälligkeit gemein, neu war die Einbeziehung von alltäglichen Handlungen, der Person des Künstlers oder des Künstlerkollektivs in das Kunstwerk als solches. --&gt;

The performance is considered a key work, and was re-created by [[Marina Abramović]] in 2005 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of her series ''[[Seven Easy Pieces]]''. 

Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey was the product of bees who, for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemy, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for the masculine principles of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," though Beuys did not agree with that. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Marina Abramovic |author=Robert Ayers |publisher=ARTINFO |date=November 9, 2005 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1537/marina-abramovic/ |accessdate=2008-04-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204082357/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1537/marina-abramovic/ |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Implementation''' is the realization of an application, or execution of a [[plan]], idea, [[scientific modelling|model]], [[design]], [[specification]], [[Standardization|standard]], [[algorithm]], or [[policy]].

==Industry-specific definitions==

===Computer science===
{{see|Software implementation (disambiguation)}}
In [[computer science]], an implementation is a realization of a [[technical specification]] or algorithm as a [[computer program|program]], [[software component]], or other [[computer system]] through [[computer programming]] and [[Software deployment|deployment]].  Many implementations may exist for a given specification or standard.  For example, [[web browser]]s contain implementations of [[World Wide Web Consortium]]-recommended specifications, and software development tools contain implementations of [[programming languages]].

A special case occurs in [[object-oriented programming]], when a [[concrete class|concrete]] [[class (object-oriented programming)|class]] implements an [[interface (object-oriented programming)|interface]]; in this case the concrete class is an ''implementation'' of the interface and it includes methods which are ''implementations'' of those [[method (object-oriented programming)|method]]s specified by the interface.

===Information technology===
{{AP|Information technology}}
In the [[information technology]] [[industry]], implementation refers to post-sales process of guiding a client from purchase to use of the software or hardware that was purchased. This includes requirements analysis, scope analysis, customizations, systems integrations, user policies, user training and delivery. These steps are often overseen by a project manager using [[project management]] methodologies. Software Implementations involve several professionals that are relatively new to the knowledge based economy such as [[Business analysis|business analysts]], [[Technical analysis|technical analysts]], [[solutions architect]]s, and project managers.

To implement a system successfully, a large number of inter-related tasks need to be carried out in an appropriate sequence. Utilising a well-proven implementation methodology and enlisting professional advice can help but often it is the number of tasks, poor planning and inadequate resourcing that causes problems with an implementation project, rather than any of the tasks being particularly difficult. Similarly with the cultural issues it is often the lack of adequate consultation and two-way communication that inhibits achievement of the desired results.

===Political science===
{{AP|Political science}}
In [[political science]], implementation refers to the carrying out of [[public policy]].  [[Legislatures]] pass laws that are then carried out by [[public servants]] working in [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic agencies]].  This process consists of rule-making, rule-administration and rule-adjudication.  Factors impacting implementation include the legislative intent, the administrative capacity of the implementing bureaucracy, interest group activity and opposition, and presidential or executive support.

In international relations, implementation refers to a stage of international treaty-making. It represents the stage when international provisions are enacted domestically through legislation and regulation. The implementation stage is different from the ratification of an international treaty.

===Social and health sciences===
Implementation is defined as a specified set of activities designed to put into practice an activity or program of known dimensions.  According to this definition, implementation processes are purposeful and are described in sufficient detail such that independent observers can detect the presence and strength of the "specific set of activities" related to implementation.  In addition, the activity or program being implemented is described in sufficient detail so that independent observers can detect its presence and strength."&lt;ref name="NIRN2014"&gt;The National Implementation Research Network&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and natural resources===
In water and natural resources, implementation refers to the actualization of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.

====Types====
* [[Direct changeover]]
* [[Parallel running]], also known as parallel
* [[Phased implementation]]
* [[Pilot introduction]], also known as pilot
* [[Well-trade]]

==Role of end users==
System implementation generally benefits from high levels of user involvement and management support. User participation in the design and operation of information systems has several positive results. First, if users are heavily involved in systems design, they move opportunities to mold the system according to their priorities and business requirements, and more opportunities to control the outcome.  Second, they are more likely to react positively to the change process. Incorporating user knowledge and expertise leads to better solutions.

The relationship between users and information systems specialists has traditionally been a problem area for information systems implementation efforts.  Users and information systems specialists tend to have different backgrounds, interests, and priorities.  This is referred to as the user-designer communications gap.  These differences lead to divergent organizational loyalties, approaches to problem solving, and vocabularies.&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt; Examples of these differences or concerns are below:

===User concerns===
* Will the system deliver the information I need for my work?
* How quickly can I access the data?
* How easily can I retrieve the data?
* How much clerical support will I need to enter data into the system?
* How will the operation of the system fit into my daily business schedule?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"&gt;Laudon, K., &amp; Laudon, J. (2010). "Management Information Systems: Managing the Digital Firm." Eleventh  Edition (11 ed.). New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Designer concerns===
* How much disk storage space will the master file consume?
* How many lines of program code will it take to perform this function?
* How can we cut down on CPU time when we run the system?
* What are the most efficient ways of storing this data?
* What database management system should we use?&lt;ref name="Laudon2010"/&gt;

==Etymology==
Jericho's name in [[Modern Hebrew language|Hebrew]], {{transl|he|''Yeriẖo''}}, is generally thought to derive from the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] word ''reaẖ'' ("fragrant"), but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word for "[[moon]]" (''Yareaẖ'') or the name of the lunar [[deity]] [[Yarikh]] for whom the city was an early centre of worship.&lt;ref name=Schreiberp141&gt;Schreiber, 2003, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jericho's Arabic name, {{transl|ar|DIN|''ʼArīḥā''}}, means "fragrant" and also has its roots in Canaanite ''Reaẖ''.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp1136&gt;Bromiley, 1995, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Waltke_CreationIV_BSac.pdf|title=The Creation Account in Genesis 1:1-3|work=Bibliotheca Sacra 132|year=1975|pages=327–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of excavations===
The first excavations of the site were made by [[Charles Warren]] in 1868. [[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]] excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and [[John Garstang]] excavated between 1930 and 1936. Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] between 1952 and 1958. [[Lorenzo Nigro]] and [[Nicolò Marchetti]] conducted excavations in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome "La Sapienza" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015.&lt;ref name="lasapienzatojericho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasapienzatojericho.it|website=lasapienzatojericho.it|title=Tell es-Sultan/Jericho|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.

===Stone Age: Tell es-Sultan and its spring===
{{See also|Tell es-Sultan}}
The earliest settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and Hebrew, ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' means "mound" – consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and [[Anatolia]]. Jericho is the [[type site]] for the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB) periods.

====Natufian hunter-gatherers, {{circa}} 10,000 BC====
[[Epipaleolithic]] construction at the site appears to predate the invention of [[agriculture]], with the construction of [[Natufian culture]] structures beginning earlier than 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch in geologic history.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;

Jericho has evidence of settlement dating back to 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. During the [[Younger Dryas]] period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for [[Natufian]] hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen |first=Steven |title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000–5000 BC |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-01999-7 |page=57 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9600&amp;nbsp;BC, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas [[stadial]] had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)=====
The first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mama.org/exhibits/ancient/prehistoric/ |title=Prehistoric Cultures |publisher=Museum of Ancient and Modern Art |year=2010 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5704/ |title=Ancient Jericho: Tell es-Sultan |year=2012 |accessdate=5 September 2013 |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed "[[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]" (abbreviated as PPNA). Its cultures lacked  pottery, but featured the following:
* small circular dwellings
* burial of the dead under the floor of buildings
* reliance on hunting of wild game
* cultivation of wild or domestic cereals

At Jericho, circular dwellings were built of [[Adobe|clay and straw]] bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about {{convert|5|m}} across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen|first=Steven|title=After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000–5000 BC|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-01999-7|page=54|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 9400&amp;nbsp;BC, the town had grown to more than 70 modest dwellings.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, a period of about 1.4 millenia)=====
The following are Pre-Pottery Neolithic B cultural features, for the period from 7220 to 5850&amp;nbsp;BC (though [[carbon-14]]-dates are few and early):
* Expanded range of domesticated plants
* Possible [[Domestic sheep|domestication of sheep]]
* Apparent [[cult (religion)|cult]] involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using [[plaster]], and eyes set with shells in some cases

After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800&amp;nbsp;BC, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; These represent either [[teraphim]] or the first example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]],{{dubious|reason=see [[Tell Awad]] and discussion on Jericho's talk page|date=August 2013}} and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;Janson and Janson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}{{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}){{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

In the late 4th millennium BC, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2{{dubious|Neol. 2 seems to be equivalent with PPNB, which ends long before M4 BC. Unless pottery appeared at Jericho later than M4, this is a mistake AND THIS BELONGS EITHER UNDER CHALCOLITHIC OR BRONZE AGE.|date=February 2016}} and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.

===Bronze Age===
A succession of settlements followed from 4500&amp;nbsp;BC onward.

====Early Bronze Age====
In the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

During Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.

====Middle Bronze Age====
{{for|the Biblical battle|Battle of Jericho}}
Jericho was continually occupied into the Middle [[Bronze Age#Near East|Bronze Age]]; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.{{sfn|Kuijt|2012|p=167}}

During the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the [[Canaan]] region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550&amp;nbsp;BC. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north. [[Kathleen Kenyon]] reported "the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period" and there was "a massive stone [[revetment]] ... part of a complex system" of defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyon|first1=Kathleen Mary|authorlink1=Kathleen Kenyon|title=Digging Up Jericho|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/DIGGING_UP_JERICHO.html?id=_z33N1QsSHEC|publisher=[[Ernest Benn Limited]]|date=1957|location=[[London, England]]|isbn=978-0510033118|pages=213–218|accessdate=26 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530&amp;nbsp;BC. Notably this carbon dating {{circa}} 1573&amp;nbsp;BC confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating {{circa}} 1550 by Kenyon.

====Late Bronze Age====
There was evidence of a small settlement in the Late Bronze Age ({{circa}} 1400s BC) on the site, but erosion and destruction from previous excavations have erased significant parts of this layer.&lt;ref name="Davis 2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam C Davis|title=Dame Kathleen Kenyon: Digging Up the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq0YDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1315430673|page=121,126, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jr.2009"/&gt;

===Persian and Early Hellenistic periods===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century,{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the [[Return to Zion#The return to Zion|Restoration]] after the [[Babylonian captivity]], left only very few remains.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}}

Jericho went from being an administrative centre of [[Yehud Medinata]] ("the Province of Judah") under [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian rule]] to serving as the private estate of [[Alexander the Great]] between 336 and 323&amp;nbsp;BC after his conquest of the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the middle of the 2nd century BC Jericho was under [[Hellenistic]] rule of the [[Seleucid Empire]], when the [[Syrian]] General [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the [[Macabees]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Maccabees 9:50&lt;/ref&gt; One of these forts, built at the entrance to [[Wadi Qelt]], was later refortified by [[Herod the Great]], who named it ''Kypros'' after his mother.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, 1998, pp. 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean and Herodian periods===
{{Further|Jericho royal winter palaces}}
After the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean]] and Early Roman or Herodian periods, was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq''' and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of [[Wadi Qelt]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group ([[Kohen|kohanim]]) from the [[tribe of Levi]], who ruled over Judea following the success of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus (1977). ''Archaeology of the Bible''. New York: Simon and Schuster. p. 219. {{ISBN|9780671240103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and [[Mount of Temptation|Jabal Quruntul]] in Jericho and were used between 100&amp;nbsp;BCE and 68&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;

====Herodian period====
[[File:Jerycho50.jpg|thumb|right|Remains from [[Herod the Great|Herod's]] palace]]
Herod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from [[Cleopatra]], after [[Mark Antony]] had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Octavian]] assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a [[hippodrome]]-theatre (''Tell es-Samrat'') to entertain his guests and new [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of ''Tulul Abu el-Alaiq'' (also written '''Alayiq'').&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; In 2008 the [[Israel Exploration Society]] published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Rozenberg; Ehud Netzer (2008).

The dramatic murder of [[Aristobulus III]] in a swimming pool at the winter palaces near Jericho, as described by the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]], took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for [[Jerusalem]]'s aristocracy.&lt;ref name="STF"&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html Jericho - (Ariha)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307205816/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html |date=7 March 2016 }} Studium Biblicum Franciscum - Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herod was succeeded in [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Judea]] by his son, [[Herod Archelaus]], who built a village in his name not far to the north, [[Archelaïs]] (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

First-century Jericho is described in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' as follows:
{{quote|Jericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 [[stadia (length)|stadia]] in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;}}

====In the New Testament====
[[File:El Greco - Christ Healing the Blind - WGA10420.jpg|thumb|250px|''Christ Healing the Blind in Jericho'', El Greco]]
The Christian [[Gospels]] state that [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 20:29}}), and inspired a local chief tax-collector named [[Zacchaeus]] to [[repent]] of his dishonest practices ({{Bibleref2|Luke 19:1–10}}). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10&amp;version=NIV |title=The Parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 10:25 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], in his New Testament Notes on this section of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]], claimed that "about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple".&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, J., [http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/john-wesleys-notes-on-the-bible/notes-on-the-gospel-according-to-st-luke/#Chapter+X ''Notes on The Gospel According to St Luke'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]]'s ''Bible Names Dictionary'' suggests that on the arrival of Jesus and his entourage, "Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of [[Rahab]] did not disdain the hospitality of Zaccaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/smiths-bible-names-dictionary/Jericho Smith's Bible Names Dictionary: Jericho], accessed 6 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman province===
After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70&amp;nbsp;AD, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100&amp;nbsp;AD it was but a small Roman garrison town.&lt;ref name=Loschp117/&gt; A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] in 133.

===Byzantine period===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15003 Jericho synagogue mosaic.JPG|thumb|250px|Copy of Mosaic of the Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, 6th–7th century AD]]
[[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Accounts]] of Jericho by a Christian [[pilgrim]] are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Jericho, ''Ericha'', was built 1600 metres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered.&lt;ref name=Loschp117&gt;Losch, 2005, p. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|St George of Koziba]] in 340&amp;nbsp;AD and a domed church dedicated to [[Elisha|Saint Eliseus]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; At least two [[synagogue]]s were also built in the 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; The monasteries were abandoned after the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem|invasion of 614]].&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

The [[Jericho Synagogue]] in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70–50&amp;nbsp;BC.

A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century AD was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]], or "peace unto Israel", after the central [[Hebrew]] motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the Six Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=377&amp;PID=1852&amp;IID=1923 |title=The Palestinian Authority and the Jewish Holy Sites |publisher=JCPA |date = |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jewishjericho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjericho.org.il/english/places/shalomalyisrael.html |title=Jewish life in Jericho |publisher=Jewishjericho.org.il |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naaran|Na'aran]] synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition.&lt;ref name=jewishjericho/&gt;

===Early Muslim period===
{{Further|Hisham's Palace}}
[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Arab]]ic [[Umayyad]] [[mosaic]] from [[Hisham's Palace]] in Jericho]]

Jericho, by then named "Ariha" in Arabic variation, became part of [[Jund Filastin]] ("Military District of Palestine"), part of the larger province of [[Bilad al-Sham]]. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that [[caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] exiled the Jews and Christians of [[Khaybar]] to Jericho (and Tayma).&lt;ref&gt;Several hadith collections: e.g. Bukhari, ''Sahih'' as translated Muḥammad Muḥsin Khân, ''The Translation of the Meanings of Sahih al-Bukhari'' (India: Kitab Bhavan, 1987) 3.39.531 and 4.53.380, and Muslim ''Sahih'' trans. Abdul Hamid Siddiqui (Lahore: Kazi Publications, 1976) 10.3763.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 659, that district had come under the control of [[Mu'awiya]], founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]]. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;''The Maronite Chronicle'', written during Mu'awiya's caliphate. Note that for propaganda reasons it dates the earthquake to the wrong year: Andrew Palmer, ''The Seventh Century in the West-Syrian Chronicles'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1993), 30, 31, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its "miserable Canaanite" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pilgrimage of Arculf in the Holy Land", De Locis Sanctis as translated by Rev. James Rose MacPherson (W. London: BD. 24, Hanover Square, 1895), ch. I.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 724–743) and thus known as [[Hisham's Palace]], is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This [[Desert castle|"desert castle" or ''qasr'']] was more likely built by Caliph [[Al-Walid II|Walid ibn Yazid]] (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'', Oxford University Press 2008, pp. 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen ''in situ'' today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.

Umayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the [[Arab]] caliphates of the [[Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile "City of the Palms".&lt;ref name=Shahinp285&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Muqaddasi|Al-Maqdisi]], the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that "the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all [[Islam]]. [[Banana]]s are plentiful, also [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and flowers of fragrant odor".&lt;ref name=Shahinp283&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.&lt;ref&gt;al-Muqaddasi quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/39/mode/1up 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city flourished until 1071 with the invasion of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Turks]], followed by the upheavals of the [[Crusades]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Crusader period===
In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 kilometres (6&amp;nbsp;mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], and are credited with introducing [[sugarcane]] production to the city.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;Hull, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. "sugar mills") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the [[Ayyubid]] forces of [[Saladin]] after their victory in the [[Battle of Hattin]], and the town slowly went into decline.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
[[File:Map of Jericho in 14c Farhi Bible by Elisha ben Avraham Crescas.jpg|thumb|14th century map of Jericho in Farchi Bible]]
In 1226, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] said of Jericho, "it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the ''[[Ghaur]]'' land is made here." In the 14th century, [[Abu al-Fida]] writes there are [[sulfur]] mines in Jericho, "the only ones in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;al-Hamawi and Abu-l Fida quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/397/mode/1up 397]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
[[File:Jerico1.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard image depicting Jericho in the late 19th or early 20th century]]
Jericho  was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 [[Akçe]] was recorded, destined for the new [[Waqf]]  for the [[Haseki Sultan Imaret]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp52&gt;Singer, 2002, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA50  50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA52  52]&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers processed [[indigo]] as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp120&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA120  120]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.&lt;ref name=Singerp126&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA126  126]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596 Jericho  appeared in the  [[daftar|tax registers]]  under the name of ''Riha'', being in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Al-Quds in the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'' of [[Al-Quds]]. It had a population of 51 household, all [[Muslim]]s. They paid a fixed  tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 [[Akçe]]. All of the revenue still  went to a [[Waqf]].&lt;ref name=HA114&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The French traveler [[Laurent d'Arvieux]] described the city in 1659 as "now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 1836, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_0ZYCAAAAQAAJ#page/n136/mode/1up 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts.&lt;ref name=benarieh&gt;Ben-Arieh, Yehoshua.

Hershberg, ''In the Land of the East'', Vilna 1899, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called ''Ein al-Sultan'' in Arabic and ''Elisha Spring'' in Hebrew, and springs in [[Wadi Qelt]].&lt;ref name=benarieh/&gt;

An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]  village list from around 1870 showed that  ''Riha'', Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men, only.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/159/mode/1up 159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n932/mode/1up  124], noted  34 houses&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867, and the monasteries of St. George of Koziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
During [[World War II]] The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company [[Solel Boneh]], and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.&lt;ref name=Frilingp65&gt;Friling and Cummings, 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of [[World War I]], Jericho came under the rule of the [[Mandatory Palestine]].

According to the [[1922 census of Palestine]], Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants, consisting of 931 Muslims, 6 Jews and 92 Christians;&lt;ref name=Census1922a&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jericho, p.

In 1927, an [[1927 Jericho earthquake|earthquake struck]] and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2013/10/22/israel-hit-by-fifth-minor-quake-in-a-week/ |title=Israel hit by fifth minor quake in a week |publisher=[[Ya Libnan]] |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but by the  [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants, in 347 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p.[https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas   45]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordanian period===
Jericho came under [[Jordan]]ian control after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The [[Jericho Conference]], organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed "His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine" and called for "the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full [[Arab]] unity". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.&lt;ref name=Benvenistip27&gt;Benvenisti, 1998, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the population of Jericho was  10,166,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Jordan, 1964, p.

===1967, aftermath===
Jericho has been [[military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] since the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] control in accordance with the [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0914/p01s04-wome.html|title=At 10th anniversary, a far poorer Palestinian Authority|first=Ilene R.|last=Prusher|date=14 September 2004|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] of 4 May 1994.

==Demographics==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1536 Jericho municipality עיריית יריחו.jpg|thumb|Municipality of Jericho, 1967]]
In the first census carried out by the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. [[Palestinian refugee]]s constituted a significant 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118181551/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx |date=18 November 2008 }} [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality, Sex and Age Groups in Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614231532/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx |date=14 June 2008 }} (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.&lt;ref name="PCBS"/&gt;

Demographics have varied widely depending on the dominant ethnic group and rule in the region over the past three thousand years. In a 1945 land and population survey by [[Sami Hadawi]], 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hadawi, 1970, [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Jerusalem/Page-057.jpg p.57]&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{Citation|first=Dan|last=Fisher|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-02/news/mn-142_1_beit-jala/2|title=World's Oldest City Retains Lure : Biblical Jericho: Winter Oasis for the West Bank|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestinian Christians|Christian]] community makes up around 1% of the population.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/English-Spoken-Here/From-the-World/2012/5/24/HOLY-LAND-Jericho-A-small-Christian-community-and-their-school/283382/|title=HOLY LAND/ Jericho: A small Christian community and their school|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large community of black Palestinians is present in Jericho.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1539 The market of Jericho השוק ביריחו.jpg|thumb|250px|Jericho marketplace, 1967]]
In 1994, Israel and the Palestinians signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/30/world/gaza-jericho-economic-accord-signed-by-israel-and-palestinians.html|title=Gaza-Jericho Economic Accord Signed by Israel and Palestinians|first=Marlise|last=Simons|date=30 April 1994|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
In 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7214355/Palestinians-aim-to-push-tourism-beyond-Bethlehem.html|title=Palestinians aim to push tourism beyond Bethlehem|first=By Gavin Rabinowitz, in Bethlehem for|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a $150&amp;nbsp;million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-07-26/news/1998207031_1_casinos-austria-play-in-casinos-jericho|title=Walls going up in Jericho -- construction of casino-hotel Palestinians, Israelis have role in project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.

====Biblical and Christian tourism====
Christian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.
* [[Mount of Temptation]], topped by a Greek Orthodox monastery with panoramic views of the region. A cable car runs up to the monastery.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;
* the Spring of Elisha, as the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring is known to Jews and Christians
* the Sycamore tree of [[Zacchaeus]] (two such trees are venerated at different locations as being related to the original tree mentioned in the Gospels)
* the nearby traditional site of the [[baptism of Jesus]] at [[Qasr el Yahud|Qasr el-Yahud]]/[[Al-Maghtas]] on the Jordan River
* the Monastery of [[Gerasimus of the Jordan|Saint Gerasimos]] known as [[Deir Hajla]]; in the Jordan Valley near Jericho
* the [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|Saint George Monastery]] in [[Wadi Qelt]] above Jericho.

====Archaeological tourism====
The archaeological sites in and near Jericho have a high potential for attracting tourists. These are dealt with in detail in the [[Jericho#History and archaeology|History and archaeology]] paragraph:
* the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at '''Tell es-Sultan'''
* the [[Hasmonean royal winter palaces|Hasmonean and Herodian winter palaces]] at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq'''
* the Byzantine-period synagogues at Jericho ([[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]]) and [[Naaran|Na'aran]]
* the Umayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as [[Hisham's Palace]]
* the Crusader sugar production facility at '''Tawahin es-Sukkar''' (lit. "sugar mills")
* [[Nabi Musa]], the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] shrine dedicated to Moses ("Prophet Musa" to the Muslims)

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/jericho-business-park-palestine-sustainability|title=Jericho business park aims to inch Palestine towards sustainability|first=Liz|last=Ford|date=18 June 2012|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and religious institutions==
In 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"/&gt;

==Health care==
In April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in funding for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|title=USAID to Renovate the Jericho Governmental Hospital|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318001142/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|archivedate=18 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The sports team [[Hilal Areeha]] plays [[association football]] in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000 spectator [[Jericho International Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/middle_east/countries/palestine.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadiums in Palestine|website=www.worldstadiums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Scott Dance''', formerly the '''Irish Modern Dance Theatre''', is a [[Dublin]] based [[modern dance]] company. It was founded by '''John Scott''' in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishplayography.com/search/company.aspx?la=en&amp;companyID=43 Irish Playography Member Page]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of creating, commissioning and expanding dance experience in Ireland.

==Background==
The Irish Modern Dance Theatre (IMDT) was founded in 1991 by Dublin born choreographer John Scott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danceireland.ie/members/member.php?id=200&amp;PHPSESSID=bb8a1d012378c9320da24e9328870438 Dance Ireland Member John Scott] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123240/http://www.danceireland.ie/members/member.php?id=200&amp;PHPSESSID=bb8a1d012378c9320da24e9328870438 |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the company launched its first production, a piece called ''Beneath the Storm''.

Many IMDT works have premiered in Dublin's [[Project Arts Centre]], including ''Next to Skin''. ''Next to Skin'' was described as an attempt to take dancers of different backgrounds and languages including Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], French, German and Kabaye, and produce a "stream of consciousness, describing what the other dancers are doing,".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Foley,[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0119/1200605137440.html Straying Far From The Hearth], Irish Times, 19/01/08&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 90's IMDT had a number of shows that featured in the [[Dublin Theatre Festival]] such as ''Dance for Another Place'' in 1994, followed by ''Ruby Red'' in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublintheatrefestival.com/programme/display.asp?EventID=358 Dublin Theatre Festival Programme Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dance for the Bees'' in 1997. In the 2000s IMDT's continue to feature in festivals all over Ireland, making appearances in the '''International Dance Festival of Ireland''' in 2003 with ''Last Supper'' and 2006 with ''Close-Ups'', and the '''Eigse Carlow Arts Festival''' in 2007 with ''Rhythmic Space'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0303/1224265484845.html Carlow's New Ty Vision], Irish Times, 3/3/10&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''[[Kilkenny Arts Festival]]''' that same year with ''This Dancing Life''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/0810/breaking42.html Kilkenny Festival Goes Cosmopolitan], Irish Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/0810/1186425040399.html Power Set To Be Talk of the Town], Irish Times, 10/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;

''This Dancing Life'' had a performance time of 4 hours, the aim being to have audience members leave the performance and come back later, with one reviewer saying "I've never walked out of a performance that I liked, but Sara Rudner's This Dancing Life is as much about not being there as being there. She doesn't really want audiences to sit through the four hours of dance".&lt;ref&gt;MIchael Seaver [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/0822/1187332287312.html], Irish Times, 22/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company's name was changed to "John Scott Dance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.johnscottdance.com/about "About"] John Scott Dance website&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Touring==
As well touring nationwide across Ireland IMDT is also extremely active in taking its work to international audiences with some notable appearances including ''The Ramallah Dance Festival'' in Palestine where the company performed its production of ''The White Piece'', and '''Tanzmesse NRW, Düsseldorf, Germany'''. IMDT has also visited [[Sweden]], France, [[Brazil]], and [[Estonia]].

==Films==
IMDT has worked extensively with Steve Woods, a film-maker based in the National Film School [Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology]. In conjunction with Camel Productions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dandelionproductions.com/camel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521094812/http://www.dandelionproductions.com/camel/ |archivedate=21 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMDT has collaborated in the production three short dance films:

* Buaill (2006)
* Eternal (2008)
* Admit One (2010)

Buaill was set in the newly constructed Dublin City Council offices in Wood Quay, Dublin, while Eternal was filmed in Palestine using a mixture of local amateur dancers and Irish professionals. Admit One's setting was the Lighthouse Cinema in Dublin's Smithfield. All of these productions were done in conjunction with the [RTE] Dance on the Box&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/danceonthebox/films.html#watch RTE Dance on the Box] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223042454/http://www.rte.ie/danceonthebox/films.html |date=23 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; programme. In November 2010 Admit One was selected to screen in the [Cork Film Festival].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corkfilmfest.org/pages/short-films-selected-as-of-october-12th Cork Film Festival News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110185508/http://www.corkfilmfest.org/pages/short-films-selected-as-of-october-12th |date=10 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010–2016==
In 2010 IMDT took its production of ''Actions'' to New York's [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://culturebot.net/2010/06/6616/ny-international-lamama-moves/ La Mama Moves]&lt;/ref&gt; a show that includes music by [[Meredith Monk]]. IMDT's production ''Fall &amp; Recover'' will visit La Mama ETC in March 2011, a venture that saw IMDT receive government support through [[Culture Ireland]]'s initiative to promote Irish artistic work abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Falvey [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0112/1199917931040.html], Irish Times, 12/01/08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Belinda McKean [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0115/1224262369287.html], Irish Times, 15/01/10&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Fall &amp; Recover'' IMDT worked closely with The Irish Centre For Survivors of Torture&lt;ref&gt;Arminta Wallace [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2009/0512/1224246310798.html Making Moves to Survive Torture], Irish Times, 12/05/09&lt;/ref&gt; and Rossa Ó Snodaigh, a member of the Irish folk band [[Kíla|Kila]], to produce a piece that examines the emotional effect that torture can have on people across the globe. Photographer Bryan O'Brien received awards for his photography of the show.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Carroll [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0206/1224263887707.html Prayer Matt Finish], ''Irish Times'', 06/02/10{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 IMDT premiered ''In This Moment'' in the Project Arts Centre, a collaboration [[Charles Atlas (Media Dance)|Charles Atlas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creativedialogueireland.com/channel/discussion/9/irish-modern-dance-theatres-many-bodies/ Irish Modern Dance Theatre's Many Bodies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708201437/http://www.creativedialogueireland.com/channel/discussion/9/irish-modern-dance-theatres-many-bodies/ |date=8 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a video artist who has worked with [[Merce Cunningham]] and [[Antony and the Johnsons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Kumu Kahua Theatre''' is a community theater located in the city of [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] on the island of [[Oahu]] in the state of [[Hawaii]].  Kumu Kahua Theatre is best known for producing [[Play (theatre)|plays]] by local Hawaii-based [[playwrights]], especially plays featuring themes and stories of the people of Hawaii.  (Their motto, as seen on their T-shirts and Web site, is "Plays about life in Hawai{{okina}}i.  Plays by Hawai{{okina}}i's playwrights.  Plays for Hawai{{okina}}i's people.")  Therefore, actors are often featured utilizing their natural local [[dialect]] or respective ethnic [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], and many plays have incorporated or are solely written in [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawaiian Creole English]], an English dialect commonly known in the Hawaiian islands as ''pidgin''.  Their productions are also known for involving local actors, designers, [[theatre director|directors]], and theater technicians.  Appropriately the [[Hawaiian language]] words ''kumu kahua'' translate to "original stage."  People familiar with the theatre often call it affectionately by its nickname of ''Kumu''.

Kumu Kahua Theatre was founded in 1971 by graduate students of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] [http://manoa.hawaii.edu/], with the goal of producing locally-written experimental works.  The experimental nature of the theatre gradually disappeared in later years.  In 1982, the group was granted [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]] status, and in 1994, the [[Hawaii Legislature|Hawaii State Legislature]] awarded the group its current 100-seat playhouse located in downtown Honolulu at [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=46+Merchant+Street,+Honolulu,+HI&amp;layer=&amp;sll=21.310056,-157.863343&amp;sspn=0.004668,0.01075&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=21.310366,-157.863343&amp;spn=0.009336,0.021501&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr 46 Merchant Street].  Dennis Carroll served as its artistic director for many years.  Kumu Kahua's current artistic director is Harry Wong III.

Kumu Kahua Theatre also offers classes in acting and writing, as well as sponsoring an annual playwrighting contest in conjunction with the University of Hawaii at Manoa theatre department.  The playwrighting contest categories are as follows:
:*'''Hawaii Prize''': This award is open to Hawaii residents and nonresidents, and the play must be set in Hawaii or involve some aspect of the Hawaii experience.
:*'''Pacific/Rim Prize''': This award is open to Hawaii residents and nonresidents, and the play must be set in or involve the Pacific Islands, the Pacific Rim or the Pacific/Asian-American experience.
:*'''Resident Prize''': This award is open only to residents of Hawaii at the time of submission, and the topic of the play is unrestricted.

[[File:Danse Carpeaux.jpg|thumb|A copy of ''La Danse'' on the façade of the [[Paris Opera]], the original was moved to the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1986]]
'''''La Danse''''' is an 1868 sculpture by the French artist [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]].  It was one of four sculptural groups made from Echaillon marble that decorate the façade of the [[Opera Garnier]] in Paris, two to either side of the entrance at ground level.  The work was installed in 1869, and widely criticised as obscene.  It was [[Vandalism of art|attacked]] in August 1869 when an anonymous vandal threw black ink over it.  The scandal subsided after the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, and the original statue remained on the façade at the opera until it was transferred to the [[Louvre Museum]] in 1964 and replaced by a copy.  The original was moved to the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1986.

Carpeaux was commissioned by his friend [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] to make a group based on the dance of [[Bacchus]].  The sculpture comprises several human figures, for which Carpeaux made numerous sketches over three years, using actresses and dancers from the [[Palais-Royale]] as models.   At the centre of the group, a garlanded young man with wings smiles as he holds aloft a tambourine while several women dance around him.  It includes sculptural groups ''[[L'Amour à la folie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Carpeaux's Dance | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/carpeauxs-dance.html | accessdate = September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpeaux left out certain ideas, including a bacchante with lowered eyes (model held by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/11.10|title=Bacchante with lowered eyes - Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux - 11.10 - Work of Art - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpeaux completed a final model and the full-size statue in 1868, and it was unveiled at the Opera in July 1869.  The unashamed nakedness of the figures, situated outdoors in full public view, provoked an immediate negative reaction, with some saying it would now be impossible for respectable women and girls to come to the Opera.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Ferrier, S. Monneret, ''L'Aventure de l'Art au XIXe siècle'', p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was [[Vandalism of art|attacked]] on the night of 27-28 August 1869, when black ink was thrown over the statue.  The Opera considered moving the statue inside, but that was opposed by the [[corps de ballet]]. The scandal reached such a level [[Charles Gumery]] was commissioned to make a replacement (his gilded sculptures of ''L'Harmonie'' and '' La Poésie'' already crown the Opera's end pavilions).  The issue was forgotten after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out in July 1870, and Gumery died in Paris during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]].  Carpeaux's work remained in place after his death in 1875, and Gumery's replacement is held by the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Angers]].

A 42-inch bronze cast reproduction of Carpeaux's ''Genius of the Dance'', the central figure of ''La Danse'', was acquired by the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1983 for the museum's French galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VM displays bronze sculpture|publisher=News-Herald, Suffolk, Va.|date=May 25, 1983|page=8 (with photo)|quote="This format, lacking only the dancing figures which encircle the genius figure in the full scale version, is the most successful of all the reductions" said chief curator Pinkney Near.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpeaux's original sculpture was moved to the Louvre Museum in 1964 to protect it from pollution, and it was replaced on the façade of the Opera Garnier by a copy made by [[Jean Juge]]. The original was moved to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.

'''''Laughing Boy with a Flute''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1620s.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote "31. A LAUGHING BOY WITH A FLUTE. M. 240. Half-length, in profile to the left. The head is three-quarters left. The long hair falls in disorder. The lips are parted, showing the teeth. On the left the flute is held upright in the right hand. The eyes look to the 
left and slightly upward. Lifelike colour in the face. Circular panel, n| inches across the grain of the wood running diagonally. A copy is in the [[Museum Boucher de Perthes|Boucher de Perthes Museum]], [[Abbeville]]. In the collection of the late [[Alfred Beit]], London. In the collection of [[Otto Beit]], London."&lt;ref&gt;* [https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/12/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on A Laughing Boy with a Flute; catalog number 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofstede de Groot noted several laughing boys by Hals along with this one (catalogue numbers 11 through to 39). This painting was also documented by [[W.R. Valentiner]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/franshalsdesmeis00valeuoft#page/34/mode/1up Laughing boy with Flute, number 34 right]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band drew controversy with its fourth album, ''[[Supercharger (album)|Supercharger]]'' (2001), which was released three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]] and resulted in their songs and music video for the song "Crashing Around You" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label [[Roadrunner Records]] as a result of the controversy, however the band would eventually re-sign with the label.

After experimenting with elements of [[groove metal]] and [[nu metal]] in their early releases, Machine Head changed to a more traditional [[thrash metal]] sound with its sixth album, ''[[The Blackening]]'' (2007), which drew critical acclaim and was chosen as Album of the Decade by ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/albums-of-the-decade-machine-head-the-blackening/|title=Blog Archive » Albums Of The Decade: Machine Head – 'The Blackening'|work=Metal Hammer|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's first single, "[[Aesthetics of Hate]]", also earned the band its first [[Grammy Award]] nomination. The band would continue to experiment with genres in later releases.

Machine Head has released nine studio albums, two live albums, one video album, 13 singles and 15 music videos. Four of the band's albums have been [[Music recording sales certification|certified silver]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and the band's highest peak on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] came with its eighth album, ''[[Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds]]'' (2014), at number 21. To date, the band has sold over three million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3348284 |title=Tickets for Robb Flynn Of Machine Head : Acoustic Performance &amp;#124; Roxy Theatre at TicketWeb |publisher=Ticketweb.com |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation and ''Burn My Eyes'' (1991–1996)===
Machine Head were formed on October 12, 1991, in [[Oakland, California]] by vocalist/guitarist [[Robb Flynn]] and bassist [[Adam Duce]]. Flynn had recently parted ways with [[Vio-lence]] after a physical fight between the band members and a local gang. He still had a desire to write music and along with Duce recruited guitarist [[Logan Mader]] and drummer Tony Costanza to form Machine Head.&lt;ref name="Revolver"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wiederorn, Jon |date=May 2007 |title=Machine Head: Through the Ashes |journal=[[Revolver Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's name was thought of by Flynn because it "sounded cool", despite the popular belief that it came from the [[Deep Purple]] album of the [[Machine Head (album)|same name]].&lt;ref name="TNN"&gt;{{cite web |author=Neff, Troy |url=http://www.theentertainmentnexus.com/interviews/rag/mcclainDave.htm |title=Dave McClain interview by Troy Neff |publisher=The Entertainment Nexus |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120003637/http://www.theentertainmentnexus.com/interviews/rag/mcclainDave.htm |archivedate=2015-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band started [[Jam (music)|jamming]] in a local warehouse shared with four [[punk rock]] bands.&lt;ref name="MH1 bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machinehead1.com/bio.html |title=Machine Head – Bio |publisher=Machinehead1.com |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020331/http://www.machinehead1.com/bio.html |archivedate=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine Head recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] in a friend's bedroom, funded with US$800.&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MH1 bio"/&gt; A record executive representing [[Roadrunner Records]] listened to the demo and signed the band.&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt;

Machine Head entered Fantasy Studios in [[Berkeley, California]] to record its debut album ''[[Burn My Eyes]]''.&lt;ref name="Burn My Eyes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes| others=Machine Head |title=Burn My Eyes |date=1994-08-09 |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |id=9016 |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long into production, Constanza left the band and was replaced by [[Chris Kontos (musician)|Chris Kontos]]. Most of the songs on the album were songs written by Flynn and Duce during the time Flynn was not in a band, about "being pissed off" from his previous struggles in Vio-lence, as well as both of their battles with illegal drugs.&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt; Produced by [[Colin Richardson]], the album was released on August 9, 1994. The album shipped nearly 400,000 copies worldwide, becoming Roadrunner Records' best selling debut album.&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt; [[Allmusic]] reviewer John Franck stated "''Burn My Eyes'' is a bone-shattering exercise in brutality".&lt;ref name="BME AMG"&gt;{{cite web| author=Franck, John |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r206602|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Burn My Eyes'' review |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after ''Burn My Eyes'''s release Machine Head started touring heavily in support of the album, opening for [[Slayer]] in Europe in the latter half of 1994, a tour which ended with their own headline show at the [[London Astoria]]. Following the success of the support tour the band returned to Europe for a headline tour in early 1995, performing in the same venues they opened for Slayer.&lt;ref name="Abslut Adam"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.absolutmetal.com/AdamInterview.htm |title=Machine Head interview with Adam Duce |publisher=Absolutmetal.com |date=1997-10-23 |accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band would return to Europe for the summer festival season but Kontos refused to tour and the band drafted Walter Ryan for the festival dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0R9wfEPxeE |title=Machine Head - 02 BLOOD FOR BLOOD live @ Donington Park, Donington, England 1995-08-26 - YouTube |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the band's return to the US Kontos was fired because he was not keeping to touring commitments. Kontos went on to play drums with [[Testament (band)|Testament]], and was replaced by [[Dave McClain (drummer)|Dave McClain]].

===''The More Things Change...'' and ''The Burning Red'' (1997–2000)===
After touring for ''Burn My Eyes'', Machine Head entered the studio to record its second studio album, ''[[The More Things Change...]]'', with Richardson producing and mixing for a second time. The album was released on March 25, 1997, and debuted at number 138 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=machine head|chart=all}} |title=Artist chart history |publisher=[[Billboard charts]] |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628212934/http://www.billboard.com/artist/276909/machine%2Bhead/chart |archivedate=June 28, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine Head toured in Europe with [[Napalm Death]], [[Coal Chamber]] and [[Skinlab]], then went on the first [[Ozzfest]] for the first tours in support of the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |title=Ozzfest alumini |publisher=Ozzfest.com |accessdate=2008-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103010421/http://www.ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mader showed up to a practice session late, high on [[methamphetamine]], cursing at and insulting the band members; and quit the band later that day. [[Ahrue Luster]] replaced him and finished touring,&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luster leaves"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-machine-head-guitarist-says-his-dictatorship-comment-was-a-misquote/|title=Former Machine Head guitarist says his "dictatorship" comment was a misquote |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2003-02-12 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Mader toured with [[Soulfly]] in support of their [[Soulfly (album)|self-titled debut album]].

After three years of touring and working with producer [[Ross Robinson]], Machine Head released its third studio album, ''[[The Burning Red]]'', on August 10, 1999. The band added new elements to its music, including [[rapping]] vocals, a move which some believe to have been influenced by [[Ahrue Luster]] himself.&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt; This album, along with the band's change in image and musical direction was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of "[[selling out]]".&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt; Nevertheless, McClain stated they weren't trying to sound like popular bands but "wanted to sound different".&lt;ref name="Revolver"/&gt; Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically than they have in the past".&lt;ref name="TBR AMG"&gt;{{cite web| author=Anderson, Rick |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r424189|pure_url=yes}} |title=''The Burning Red'' overview |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Burning Red'' became Machine Head's top selling album for a number of years, and debuted at number 88 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=3145 |title=Metal/Hard Rock Album Sales In The US As Reported By SoundScan |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2002-04-30 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225912/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=3145 |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Supercharger'' and ''Through the Ashes of Empires'' (2001–2005)===
Machine Head finished touring for ''The Burning Red'', and entered a studio with producer [[Johnny K]] to record ''[[Supercharger (album)|Supercharger]]''. Debuting at number 115 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the album was released on October 2, 2001.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; The album met the same criticism as ''The Burning Red'', especially for the ever-present rapping vocals. [[Blabbermouth.net]] reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated ''Supercharger'' "is likely to disappoint everyone who is expecting the Bay Area quartet to return to the ultra-testosterone-charged sounds of their first two albums".&lt;ref name="SC BMN"&gt;{{cite web |author=Krgin, Borivoj |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=51 |title=CD reviews – Machine Head ''Supercharger'' |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=2008-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017232045/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=51 |archivedate=2008-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Phil Demmel 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Guitarist Phil Demmel performing with Machine Head in 2009.]]
Machine Head released a single for "[[Crashing Around You]]" as well as a music video. The video was released several weeks after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and was banned from [[MTV]] for the depictions of falling buildings. Roadrunner Records, expecting to make a fair profit from album promotions, dropped the band's funding, causing Machine Head to leave the label.&lt;ref name="Metalunderground"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=9004 |title=Interview With Machine Head's Phil Demmel |publisher=Metalunderground.com |date=2007-08-12 |accessdate=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the band was leaving Roadrunner, Luster departed from the band for musical differences.

By 2002, Machine Head had sold over 1.3 million albums worldwide, and overall ''Supercharger'' (mixed by Colin Richardson) would go on to sell 250,000 copies worldwide, which was their lowest selling album to date. Once the tour for the album had been completed, Machine Head and Roadrunner Records mutually decided to sever ties with regards to distribution in North America and around the world, however to fill the ties, the band released ''[[Hellalive]]'' (also mixed by Colin Richardson) which was a recording of a Brixton Academy, London set.

In 2002 Ahrue Luster left the band and was temporarily replaced by Phil Demmel, who played in thrash band Vio-lence alongside Flynn. Demmel played some festival shows with Machine Head (including a headlining slot at the With Full Force festival in Germany). Then with Phil not being able to commit to the band, he and Machine Head parted ways. The remainder of the band starting writing songs for the next album (eventually ''Through the Ashes...''), and hoping to get signed to a record label. They recorded a short demo, including a radio-style song called "Pins and Needles", and an Electronic Press Kit for the companies, also hoping they can get signed on the strength of their previous efforts. Nearly every record label in the music industry rejected the four track demo.

After Machine Head's European tour, Ahrue Luster returned to his family business and the band started writing together as a three-piece, while leaving a position open for Demmel. In March 2003, Demmel joined Machine Head as a full-time guitarist and started writing with the band. By June 2003, Machine Head entered a studio with Flynn producing.&lt;ref name="lambgoat"&gt;{{cite web|author=Unrest, Kirby |date=January 2005 |url=http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/machine_head.aspx |title=Machine Head interview |publisher=Lambgoat.com |accessdate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226174652/http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/machine_head.aspx |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2003, Machine Head released ''[[Through the Ashes of Empires]]'' in Europe.

The band was turned down by multiple record labels in the United States, until Roadrunner USA, interested in the new album, offered Machine Head another record contract. Machine Head accepted the offer on the grounds that the band owns 100% of the music. On April 20, 2004, ''Through the Ashes of Empires'' was released in the United States with a bonus track for the Americans' long wait for the album's release.&lt;ref name="lambgoat"/&gt; The album debuted at number 88 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="Billboard"/&gt; The band released a single for "Imperium", the video for which received heavy rotation on MTV. Eduardo Rivadavia of [[AllMusic]] stated ''Through the Ashes of Empires'' "marked a return to form in no uncertain terms".&lt;ref name="TTAOF"&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r678309|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Through the Ashes of Empires'' overview |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine Head headlined the True Metal stage at the 2005 [[Wacken Open Air]] festival to 40,000 fans—the band's largest headlining crowd at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Flynn, Robb |url=http://www.machinehead1.com/diary.html |title=Machine Head diary |publisher=Machinehead1.com |accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band released a DVD containing a full sold-out concert held at the [[Brixton Academy]] in December 2004, a documentary, and music videos. The DVD debuted at number 13 on the U.S. music video charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=383&amp;cfgn=Videos&amp;cfn=Billboard+Comprehensive+Music+Videos&amp;ci=3062015&amp;cdi=8462966&amp;cid=10%2F29%2F2005 |title=Billboard Comprehensive Music Videos – ''Elegies'' |publisher=Billboard charts |accessdate=2008-02-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211170854/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=383&amp;cfgn=Videos&amp;cfn=Billboard%2BComprehensive%2BMusic%2BVideos&amp;ci=3062015&amp;cdi=8462966&amp;cid=10%2F29%2F2005 |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also played in Dubai for the annual [[Dubai Desert Rock Festival]] in 2005. This was their first show in the Middle East. The band also played at the farewell concert of [[Böhse Onkelz]] on the Euro Speedway Lausitz.

===''The Blackening'' (2006–2009)===
Machine Head's sixth studio album, titled ''[[The Blackening]]'', was released in North America on March 27, 2007. It entered the ''Billboard'' 200 at number 53, the highest charting position for the band at that time, with first-week sales of 15,000.&lt;ref name="MACHINE HEAD: 'The Blackening' Enters Italian Chart At No.&amp;nbsp;55"&gt;{{cite web |title=Machine Head: ''The Blackening'' enters Italian chart at No.&amp;nbsp;55 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2007-04-23 |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=71033 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000000/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=71033 |archivedate=2007-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made the top 20 in several European countries. Robb Flynn stated during an interview that the band are fans of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and received a great deal of influence from their album ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' while creating ''The Blackening''.

The album received positive reviews from music critics, with some labeling it the best metal album of 2007. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album a 9.5 out of 10, saying ''The Blackening'' is "one of the purest, finest, most powerful expressions of modern heavy metal released" and compared it to the 1986 [[Metallica]] album ''[[Master of Puppets]]'',&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth - The Blackening"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth - ''The Blackening'' review |author=Kaye, Don |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1066 |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015224258/http://roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1066 |archivedate=2007-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Allmusic editor Thom Jurek described the album as "an over the top rage and pummelfest with all the qualities that earned the group its enormous fan base by touring and recording", praising the songs "Beautiful Mourning", "[[Halo (Machine Head song)|Halo]]", and "[[Now I Lay Thee Down]]".&lt;ref name="Allmusic - The Blackening"&gt;{{cite web |title=Allmusic - ''The Blackening'' |author=Jurek, Thom |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1023773|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Andy Greene, however, responded negatively as he was displeased with the songs running over ten minutes.&lt;ref name="The Blackening - Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web |title=''The Blackening'' - ''Rolling Stone'' |author=Greene, Andy |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-03-21 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/13885770/review/13891164 |accessdate=2007-08-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014060825/http://rollingstone.com/reviews/album/13885770/review/13891164|archivedate=14 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their early albums ''[[Burn My Eyes]]'' and ''[[The More Things Change...]]'' show a groove metal and thrash metal approach, similar to bands like [[Pantera]] and [[Exhorder]].

Machine Head returned to the groove metal and thrash metal sound of the first two albums with the album ''[[Through the Ashes of Empires]]'', which proved a success.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015|reason=True, but we need a citation here to meet quality}}

Machine Head increased the complexity and technicality in their sound for the next album, ''[[The Blackening]]'', which partially changes the sound of their first 5 albums in favor of a more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures and guitar riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/machine_head/the_blackening/index.html |title=The Blackening Review &amp;#124; Machine Head &amp;#124; Compact Discs &amp;#124; Reviews @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarmasterclass.net/wiki/index.php/Machine_Head#Discography |title=Machine Head |publisher=Guitarmasterclass.net |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Unto the Locust]]'' features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and [[Phil Demmel]], influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain.

==Sourcing==

In March 2012, the [[Poynter Institute]] published an article criticising the MailOnline for failing to give proper attribution to the sources of some article content, and often reprinting paragraphs without permission or attribution. The article said that when the MailOnline is called out for stealing content, it will sometime removes the text in question without acknowledging or apologising for the problem.&lt;ref name="poynter"/&gt;

Martin Clarke, editor of MailOnline, said, "We will soon be introducing features that will allow us to link easily and prominently to other sites when further recognition of source material is needed."&lt;ref name="poynter"&gt;{{cite web|title=Editor of Daily Mail’s website defends attribution practices in face of growing criticism|url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/regret-the-error/167767/editor-of-daily-mails-website-defends-attribution-policy-in-face-of-growing-crticisim|publisher=poynter.org|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, by July 2013, MailOnline articles, including main articles, still did not contain any links to original sources or tips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinmaz|first=Emine|title=MailOnline article showing no links|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2377154/Eight-ton-orca-leaps-15ft-air-finally-capture-dolphin-hour-chase.html|publisher=MailOnline|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, James King, who left the MailOnline after a year as a reporter, said that the editorial model of the Mail depended on "dishonesty, theft of copyrighted material, and sensationalism so absurd that it crosses into fabrication".  King worked as a contractor, and declined a full-time job because he did not want to put his byline on his stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tktk.gawker.com/my-year-ripping-off-the-web-with-the-daily-mail-online-1689453286 My Year Ripping Off the Web With the Daily Mail Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905103217/http://tktk.gawker.com/my-year-ripping-off-the-web-with-the-daily-mail-online-1689453286 |date=5 September 2015 }}, James King, Gawker, 4 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

'''Mythopoeia''' (also '''mythopoesis''', after [[Koine Greek|Hellenistic Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυθοποιία, μυθοποίησις}} "myth-making") is a narrative [[genre]] in modern [[literature]] and [[film]] where a fictional or artificial [[mythology]] is created by the writer of [[prose fiction|prose]] or other fiction. This meaning of the word ''mythopoeia'' follows its use by [[#Tolkien | J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the 1930s. The authors in this genre integrate traditional [[mytheme|mythological themes]] and [[archetypes]] into fiction.

==Introduction and definition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Mythopoeia is also the act of making (creating) mythologies. Notable mythopoeic authors include [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Blake]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]], [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Mervyn Peake]] and [[George MacDonald]]. While many literary works carry mythic [[Theme (literature)|themes]], only a few approach the dense self-referentiality and purpose of mythopoeia. It is invented [[mythology]] that, rather than arising out of centuries of oral tradition, are penned over a short period of time by a single author or small group of collaborators.

As distinguished from [[fantasy world]]s or [[fictional universe]]s aimed at the evocation of detailed worlds with well-ordered histories, geographies, and laws of nature, mythopoeia aims at imitating and including real-world mythology, specifically created to bring mythology to modern readers, and/or to add credibility and literary depth to fictional worlds in [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] books and movies.

Mythopoeia are almost invariably created entirely by an individual, like the world of [[Middle-earth]].

==Etymology==
The term '''mythopoeia''' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μυθοποιία}}, "myth-making".&lt;ref&gt;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In early uses, it referred to the making of myths in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "The first two, the most remote stages, are purely linguistic germs of mythology: the third is in the domain of mythopoeia, or myth-building."  {{cite book| last = Bunsen| first = C.

==Place in society==
Works of mythopoeia are often categorized as [[fantasy]] or [[science fiction]] but fill a niche for mythology in the modern world, according to [[Joseph Campbell]], a famous student of world mythology. Campbell spoke of a [[Nietzsche]]an world which has today outlived much of the mythology of the past. He claimed that new myths must be created, but he believed that present culture is changing too rapidly for society to be completely described by any such mythological framework until a later age.

==Critics of the genre==
Mythopoeia is sometimes called ''artificial mythology'', which emphasizes that it did not evolve naturally and is an artifice comparable with [[artificial language]], so should not be taken seriously as mythology. For example, the noted folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] argued that "any novel cannot meet the cultural criteria of myth. A work of art, or artifice, cannot be said to be the narrative of a culture's sacred tradition...[it is] at most, artificial myth."&lt;ref name="adcox"&gt;Dundes, quoted by Adcox, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==

===Lord Dunsany===
[[Lord Dunsany]]'s book "[[The Gods of Pegana]]", published in 1905, is a series of short stories linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Pegāna. It was followed by a further collection Time and the Gods and by some stories in The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories and in Tales of Three Hemispheres. In 1919 Dunsany told an American interviewer "In The Gods of Pegana I tried to account for the ocean and the moon. I don't know whether anyone else has ever tried that before".&lt;ref&gt;[[M. K. Wisehart]], "Ideals and Fame: A One-Act Conversation With Lord Dunsany," ''[[The Sun (New York)|New York Sun]] Book World'', 19 October 1919, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Dunsany's work influenced J. R. R. Tolkien's later writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dilworth|first=Dianna|url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/what-did-j-r-r-tolkien-read/37585|title=What Did J.R.R.

===J. R. R. Tolkien===
{{anchor|Subcreation}}{{anchor|Tolkien}}
{{further|Tolkien's legendarium|Mythopoeia (poem)}}
[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote a poem titled ''[[Mythopoeia (poem)|Mythopoeia]]''  following a discussion on the night of 19 September 1931 at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] with [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Hugo Dyson]] in order to explain and defend creative myth-making.&lt;ref name=adcox/&gt;
The poem refers to the creative human author as "the little maker" wielding his "own small golden sceptre" ruling his "subcreation" (understood as genuine creation within [[God]]'s primary [[Creation myth|creation]]).
 
[[Tolkien's legendarium]] includes not only [[origin myth]]s, [[creation myth]]s and an [[epic poetry]] cycle, but also fictive [[linguistics]], [[geology]] and [[geography]].

Tolkien discusses his views on myth-making, "subcreation"  and "[[faery]]" in the essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', written in 1939 for presentation by Tolkien at the [[Andrew Lang lecture]] at the [[University of St Andrews]] and published in print in 1947. At about the same time, he addressed the same topics in the form of a short story, ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]''. ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' (1967), a novella designed to explain the theme of "faery".

In ''On Fairy-Stories'', Tolkien emphasizes the importance of [[language]] (the human linguistic faculty in general as well as the specifics of the language used in a given tradition):
{{quote|Mythology is not a disease at all, though it may like all human things become diseased. You might as well say that thinking is a disease of the mind. It would be more near the truth to say that languages, especially modern European languages, are a disease of mythology. But Language cannot, all the same, be dismissed. The incarnate mind, the tongue, and the tale are in our world coeval. The human mind, endowed with the powers of generalization and abstraction, sees not only green-grass, discriminating it from other things (and finding it fair to look upon), but sees that it is green as well as being grass. But how powerful, how stimulating to the very faculty that produced it, was the invention of the adjective: no spell or incantation in Faerie is more potent. And that is not surprising: such incantations might indeed be said to be only another view of adjectives, a part of speech in a mythical grammar. The mind that thought of light, heavy, grey, yellow, still, swift, also conceived of magic that would make heavy things light and able to fly, turn grey lead into yellow gold, and the still rock into a swift water. If it could do the one, it could do the other; it inevitably did both. When we can take green from grass, blue from heaven, and red from blood, we have already an enchanter's power—upon one plane; and the desire to wield that power in the world external to our minds awakes. It does not follow that we shall use that power well upon any plane. We may put a deadly green upon a man’s face and produce a horror; we may make the rare and terrible blue moon to shine; or we may cause woods to spring with silver leaves and rams to wear fleeces of gold, and put hot fire into the belly of the cold worm. But in such "fantasy," as it is called, new form is made; Faerie begins; Man becomes a sub-creator.}}

===C. S. Lewis===
At the time that Tolkien debated the usefulness of myth and mythopoeia with C. S. Lewis in 1931, Lewis was a [[theist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Lewis|1946|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- note: theist and not atheist: [[C. S. Lewis]] states he converted in "the Trinity Term of 1929" and converted to Christianity in 1931 --&gt; and liked but was skeptical of [[mythology]], taking the position that myths were "lies and therefore worthless, even though 'breathed through silver{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=adcox/&gt;&lt;ref name="menion"&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; However Lewis later began to speak of Christianity as the one "true myth". Lewis wrote, "The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/forum/3505/LewisJoy.html|title=Real Joy and True Myth|first=Dave|last=Brown|work=Geocities.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026222931/http://www.geocities.com/athens/forum/3505/LewisJoy.html|archivedate=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, his ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'' is regarded as mythopoeia, with storylines referencing that Christian mythology, namely the narrative of a great [[king]] who is sacrificed to save his people and is resurrected.
Lewis's mythopoeic intent is often confused with allegory, where the characters and world of Narnia would stand in direct equivalence with concepts and events from Christian theology and history, but Lewis repeatedly emphasized that an allegorical reading misses the point (the mythopoeia) of the Narnia stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abate|first1=Michelle Ann|last2=Weldy|first2=Lance|title=C.S. Lewis|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=9781137284976|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi8dBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;ots=ySqExtF1f0&amp;dq=I%20don%E2%80%99t%20say.%20%E2%80%98Let%20us%20represent%20Christ%20as%20Aslan.%E2%80%99%20I%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98Supposing%20there%20was%20a%20world%20like%20Narnia%2C%20and%20supposing%2C%20like%20ours%2C%20it%20needed%20redemption%2C%20let%20us%20imagine%20what%20sort%20of%20Incarnation%20and%20Passion%20and%20Resurrection%20Christ%20would%20have%20there&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20don%E2%80%99t%20say.%20%E2%80%98Let%20us%20represent%20Christ%20as%20Aslan.%E2%80%99%20I%20say,%20%E2%80%98Supposing%20there%20was%20a%20world%20like%20Narnia,%20and%20supposing,%20like%20ours,%20it%20needed%20redemption,%20let%20us%20imagine%20what%20sort%20of%20Incarnation%20and%20Passion%20and%20Resurrection%20Christ%20would%20have%20there&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] also created a mythopoeia in his neo-medieval representation of extra-planetary travel and planetary "bodies" in the Cosmic or [[Space Trilogy]].

===William Blake===
{{main|William Blake's mythology}}
[[File:Spectre over Los from William Blake's Jeruesalem.jpg|thumb|250px|Because William Blake worked in multiple artistic mediums, printing and illustrating extensive [[art books]], [[William Blake's mythology|his own extensive mythological community]] is both written about and illustrated. Here, [[Los (Blake)|Los]] is tormented at his smithy by the characteristic part of human nature [[Spectre (Blake)|Spectre]] in an illustration to Blake's poem [[Jerusalem: The Emanation of the Giant Albion|''Jerusalem'']]. This image comes from Copy E. of that work, printed in 1821 and in the collection of the [[Yale Center for British Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=jerusalem.e.illbk.06&amp;java=no|title = Copy Information for Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion | publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| accessdate = Sep 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Object description for "Jerusalem The Emanation of The Giant Albion, copy E, object 15 (Bentley 15, Erdman 15, Keynes 15)"| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/illusdesc.xq?objectid=jerusalem.e.illbk.06&amp;objectdbi=jerusalem.e.p6|editor1=Morris Eaves |editor2=Robert N. Essick |editor3=Joseph Viscomi |accessdate= September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[William Blake]]'s "prophetic works" (e.g. ''[[Vala, or The Four Zoas]]'') contain a [[William Blake's mythology|rich panoply]] of original gods, such as [[Urizen]], [[Orc (William Blake)|Orc]], [[Los (Blake)|Los]], [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]], [[Rintrah]], [[Ahania]] and [[Enitharmon]]. Blake was an important influence on [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Thelema|Thelemic]] writings, whose dazzling pantheon of 'Godforms' and radically re-cast figures from [[Egyptian mythology]] and the [[Book of Revelation]] constitute an allegorical mythology of their own.

===Collaborative efforts===
The [[Cthulhu Mythos]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was likewise taken up by numerous collaborators and admirers.

Current attempts to produce a new mythology through collaborative means include the movement known as New or [[Metamodernism|Metamodern]] Classicism. According to its website, metamodern classicism seeks to create "a vast, collaborative cultural project, uniting Painters, Poets, Musicians, Architects, and all Artists in one mythopoeic endeavor. Our goal is none other than a living mythological tradition: interactive, dynamic, evolving—and relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newclassicism.weebly.com/about.html|title=Metamodern Classicism|work=weebly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other modern literature===
Stories by [[George MacDonald]] and [[H. Rider Haggard]] are in this category. C. S. Lewis praised both for their "mythopoeic" gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Lobdell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) was a deliberate attempt to model a 20th-century mythology patterned after the birth-rebirth motif described by Frazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oser|first=Lee|date=Winter 1996|title=Eliot, Frazer, and the Mythology of Modernism|url=|journal=The Southern Review|volume=32:1|pages=183|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repeated motifs of [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s fictional works ([[mirror]]s, [[labyrinths]], [[tiger]]s, etc.) tantalizingly hint at a deeper underlying [[mythos]] and yet stealthily hold back from any overt presentation of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[pulp magazine|pulp]] works of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] (from 1912) and [[Robert E. Howard]] (from 1924) contain imagined worlds vast enough to be universes in themselves,{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} as did the [[science fiction]] of [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]], [[Frank Herbert]], and [[Michael Moorcock]] one or two generations later.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Fritz Leiber]] (from the 1930s) also created a vast world, similar to that of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s; vast enough to be a universe, and indeed was a fictional [[Multiverse|omniverse]]. It is stated that the two main protagonists, [[Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser]] "travelled through universes and lands" and eventually going on to say they ended up back in the fictional city of Lankhmar.

[[Star Maker]] (1937) by [[Olaf Stapledon]] is a rare attempt at a cohesive science fiction mythos.

In the 1960s through the 1990s, [[Roger Zelazny]] authored many mythopoetic novels, such as [[Lord of Light]]. Zelazny's [[Chronicles of Amber]] is a ten-volume series of particular note for its mythic and metaphysical themes. Zelazny cited the [[World of Tiers]] series by [[Philip Jose Farmer]] as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;"...And Call Me Roger": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power &amp; Light, NESFA Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greg Stafford]] created the world and attendant mythology of [[Glorantha]] (from 1975), which formed the basis for a role-playing game (see [[Runequest]] and [[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|Heroquest]]), though its literary scope far exceeds its genre.{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

[[Stephen King]]'s novels and short stories form an intricate and highly developed [[mythos]], drawing in part on the Lovecraftian, with characters such as the demonic [[Crimson King]] and [[Randall Flagg]] appearing in several (otherwise unrelated) works, as well as a supernatural force known only as "The White". ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' series serves as a linchpin for this mythos, connecting with practically all of King's various storylines in one way or another.

[[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series, as well as the [[Harry Potter (film series)|series of films]] adapted from her work, exist within a mythopoetic [[Harry Potter universe|universe]] Rowling created by combining elements from various mythologies with her own original fantasy.

[[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Camp Half-Blood chronicles]]'', which include three pentological book series, ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' and ''[[The Trials of Apollo]]'' series, as well as [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|their film adaptations]], exist within a mythopoetic recreation of the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythologies and chronicles the lives of modern American-born, Graeco-Roman demigods and their interactions with Gods. His other mythopoetic works, ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'' and ''[[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]]'' are also similar except the fact that they revolve around [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythologies. Riordan's works amalgamate elements of day-to-day life of teenagers like [[coming of age]], [[ADHD]], [[love]] and teenage [[angst]] into modern interpretations of Egyptian and Graeco-Roman mythologies and his own fantasy.

The novels of [[Neil Gaiman]], especially ''[[Neverwhere]]'', ''[[American Gods]]'' and ''[[Anansi Boys]]'', function similarly.

[[Phillip Pullman]] created an alternate version of the Judeo-Christian mythology in ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', and its sequel series ''[[The Book of Dust]]'', where the Angels have more or less created a facade to fool the mortals.

[[The Elder Scrolls]] and its associated literature present a world where mythic visions of the world have mystical power, where archetypal myths are seen as playing out over and over again throughout history, where one can take on the identity of another by assuming ("mantling") the place that other has as a figure in the mythology of the world, and where the creation of myths can be seen as an act of mystically rewriting reality.

Indian author [[Amish Tripathi]]'s [[Amish Tripathi|''Shiva'' trilogy]] and its prequel series, [[Amish Tripathi|''Ram Chandra'' series]] chronicle the life and exloits of Hindu Gods, [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] recast as Great, historical human figures. It carefully blends traditional Indian characters into a mythopoetic recreation of the original tale.&lt;ref name="IJELLH, April 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezhil|first1=Thogai|title=IJELLH, April 2014– Myth Maker|journal=International Journal of English Language, Literature and Humanities|date=April 2014|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages=377–385|issn =2321-7065|url=http://ijellh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Modernising-the-Indian-Myths-Amish-Tripathi%E2%80%99sShiva-Trilogy-By-Thogai-Ezhil.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tripathi|first1=Amish|title=Shiva-Trilogy|url=http://www.authoramish.com/|website=authoramish.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of "myth retelling" was initiated by [[South Indian]] veteran, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, whose [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]] classic, ''[[Randamoozham]]'', and its many translations (including "''The Lone Warrior''" in English) follow a similar pattern of plot-crafting. Other works like [[Shivaji Sawant]]'s ''Mrityunjaya'' and ''Yugandhar'', [[Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni]]'s ''[[The Palace of Illusions: A Novel|The Palace of Illusions]]'', [[Anand Neelakantan]]'s ''[[Asura: Tale of the Vanquished]]'', [[Ashok Banker]] and [[Devdutt Pattanaik]]'s various retellings and [[Krishna Udayasankar]]'s ''Aryavarta Chronicles'' have also followed this lead.

==Modern usage==
{{further|Worldbuilding|Fictional universe}}Frank McConnell, author of ''Storytelling and Mythmaking'' and professor of English, [[University of California]], stated film is another "mythmaking" art, stating: "Film and literature matter as much as they do because they are versions of mythmaking."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:6&lt;/ref&gt; He also thinks film is a perfect vehicle for mythmaking: "FILM...strives toward the fulfillment of its own projected reality in an ideally associative, personal world."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:5, 99: "film is a perfect model of the epic paradigm: the founder of the land, the man who walls in and defines the human space of a given culture..."&lt;/ref&gt; In a broad analysis, McConnell associates the American [[western movie]]s and romance movies to the [[Arthurian]] mythology,&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:15.&lt;/ref&gt; adventure and action movies to the "[[epic poetry|epic world]]" mythologies of founding societies,&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:21.&lt;/ref&gt; and many romance movies where the hero is allegorically playing the role of a knight, to "quest" mythologies like ''[[Sir Gawain]]'' and the ''[[Holy Grail|Quest for the Holy Grail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McConnell 1979:13, 83–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filmmaker [[George Lucas]] speaks of the cinematic storyline of ''[[Star Wars]]'' as an example of modern myth-making. In 1999 he told [[Bill Moyers]], "With ''Star Wars'' I consciously set about to re-create myths and the classic mythological motifs."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, 2002. Evidently quoting Moyers quoting Lucas in ''Time'', 26 April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ''Star Wars'' as "mythological" has been met with mixed reviews. On the one hand, Frank McConnell says "it has passed, quicker than anyone could have imagined, from the status of film to that of legitimate and deeply embedded popular mythology."&lt;ref&gt;McConnell, 1979:18.&lt;/ref&gt; John Lyden, the Professor and Chair of the Religion Department at Dana College, argues that ''Star Wars'' does indeed reproduce religious and mythical themes; specifically, he argues that the work is [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] in concept and scope.&lt;ref&gt;Lyden, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D. Greydanus of ''The Decent Film Guide'' agrees, calling ''Star Wars'' a "work of epic mythopoeia".&lt;ref name="greydanus"&gt;Greydanus 2000–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Greydanus argues that ''Star Wars'' is ''the'' primary example of American mythopoeia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Force, the Jedi knights, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan, Princess Leia, Yoda, lightsabers, and the Death Star hold a place in the collective imagination of countless Americans that can only be described as mythic. In my review of ''A New Hope'' I called ''Star Wars'' 'the quintessential American mythology,' an American take on [[King Arthur]], Tolkien, and the samurai/wuxia epics of the East&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=greydanus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Roger Ebert]] has observed regarding ''Star Wars'', "It is not by accident that George Lucas worked with Joseph Campbell, an expert on the world's basic myths, in fashioning a screenplay that owes much to man's oldest stories."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, 2002. Quoting Ebert on ''Star Wars'' in his series ''The Great Movies''.&lt;/ref&gt;
The "mythical" aspects of the Star Wars franchise have been challenged by other film critics. Regarding claims by Lucas himself, Steven Hart observes that Lucas didn't mention [[Joseph Campbell]] at the time of the original ''Star Wars''; evidently they met only in the 1980s. Their mutual admiration "did wonders for [Campbell's] visibility" and obscured the tracks of Lucas in the "despised genre" science fiction; "''the epics'' make for an infinitely classier set of influences".&lt;ref&gt;Hart 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Mythos of the Superheroes and the Mythos of the Saints'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Thomas, ''The Mythos of the Superheroes and the Mythos of the Saints''&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Roberts observes that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"To the student of myth, the mythos of the [[comics superheroes]] is of unique interest."&lt;br /&gt;"Why do human beings want myths and how do they make them? Some of the answers to those questions can be found only sixty years back. Where did Superman and the other superheroes come from? In his Encyclopedia of the Superheroes, Jeff Rovin correctly observes, "In the earliest days, we called them 'gods'."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Superman]], for example, sent from the "heavens" by his father to save humanity, is a messiah-type of character in the [[Bible|Biblical]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Knowles (comics)|KNOWLES, Christopher]], ''[[Our Gods Wear Spandex]]'', Weiser, pp. 120–2&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, along with the rest of [[DC Comic]]'s [[Justice League of America]], Superman watches over humanity from the [[Watchtower]] in the skies; just like the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] do from [[Mount Olympus]].&lt;ref&gt;''International Journal of Comic Art'', [[University of Michigan]], pp. 280&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]]" series, with the cosmic struggle between [[Darkseid]]'s [[Apokolips]] and the gods of [[New Genesis]] and [[Mister Miracle]] and Orion as [[messiah]]-figures is another good example. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]]'' series created a mythology around [[Endless (comics)|the Endless]], a family of god-like embodiments of natural forces like [[death]] and [[dream]]ing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==In music==
In classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas were a deliberate attempt to create a new kind of ''Gesamtkunstwerk'' ("total work of art"), transforming the legends of the Teutonic past nearly out of recognition into a new monument to the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] project.

In popular music, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]-[[Funkadelic]] collective produced numerous [[concept album]]s which tied together in what is referred to as [[P-Funk mythology]].

While ostensibly known for improvised jamming, the rock group [[Phish]] first cemented as a group while producing leading member [[Trey Anastasio]]'s senior project in college, called ''The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday''. The song cycle features narration of major events in a mythical land called [[Gamehendge]], containing types of imaginary creatures and primarily populated by a race called the "Lizards". It is essentially a postmodern pastiche, drawing from Anastasio's interest in musicals or rock operas as much as from reading philosophy and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Puterbaugh, Parke. Phish: The Biography. Philadelphia: Da Capo Press, 65–67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the myth is considered by many fans the thesis statement of the group, musically and philosophically, as Gamehendge's book of lost secrets (called the "Helping Friendly Book") is summarized as an encouragement to improvisation in any part of life: "the trick was to surrender to the flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/song/the-lizards/lyrics|title=Phish.Net: The Lizards Lyrics|work=phish.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[musical collective]] NewVillager constructed a mythology from Joseph Campell's [[Monomyth]] of which all their music, art, and videos serve to express.

The band [[Rhapsody of Fire]] have created and tell the stories of a full-developed fantasy world with tales of epic wars between good and evil, although many elements are taken directly from Tolkien and other authors.

The black metal band [[Immortal (band)|Immortal's]] lyricist [[Harald Nævdal]] has created a mythological realm called [[Blashyrkh]] – described by the band as a northern "Frostdemon" realm&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-223|title=CoC : Immortal : Interview : 5/19/1999|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; – filled with demons, battles, winter landscapes, woods, and darkness which is the primary subject on their albums. A mythology forming a greater whole that has been in development from the start of their career in 1991.

The '''''Pesaro Madonna''''' ({{lang-it|Pala Pesaro}}) (better known as the Madonna di Ca' Pesaro) is a painting by the late Italian Renaissance master [[Titian]], commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in the [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Frari]] Basilica in [[Venice]] for which the work was painted, and where it remains today.  Jacopo was Bishop of [[Paphos]], in [[Cyprus]], and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the [[Borgia]] pope, [[Alexander VI]].&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings ''[[Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter]]'', c. 1510-11&lt;ref name="smart1"&gt;{{cite web | title =Titian's Madonna of the Pesaro Family | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/titian-madonna-of-the-pesaro-family.html | accessdate =March 11, 2013 }}, text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by [[Saint Peter]].  Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo.  The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as ''Madonna della Scala ''(Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/venice-santa-maria-gloriosa-dei-frari Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice], accessed March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory.  An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned [[Turkish people|Turk]] and a [[Moors|Moor]], probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  At the right, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved.  Just behind Saint Francis is [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] - both, like [[Saint Bernardino]], are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.

The members of the donor's family are motionless.  All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space.  Infant angels appear on the cloud above.  One seen in rear view holds the Cross.  The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze.  The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes.  This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky.  The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting.

==Composition==

When Titian painted this [[altarpiece]], he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques.
The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; 

The architectural setting, involving the two large columns (which have been cropped to fit the altarpiece) draw emphasis vertically and to the height of the work; which draws the eye Heavenwards. These columns in the center of the painting are unprecedented in Renaissance painting, and are the subject of some controversy. X-rays reveal that Titian painted several other architectural elements in their place before settling on the columns.  Some critics have even speculated that Titian did not paint the columns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venice.umwblogs.org/exhibit/titians-altarpieces-color-innovation-and-invention/assumption/ Titian: Madonna di Ca’ Pesaro], Venice an online exhibit, the University of Mary Washington. Accessed March 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;  The outdoors setting suggests that the activity is taking place in a portico, in which the grandeur of the columns somehow belittles the human beings which leave the figures and the viewer almost in awe of the greater implied force.

A '''recipe''' is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary [[dish (food)|dish]]. It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] with ''recipe'', Latin for ''take'', usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol (℞).

==History==

===Early examples===
[[File:Apicius 1541.jpg|thumb|right|Apicius, ''De re culinaria'', an early collection of recipes.]]
The earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] tablet from southern [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro, ''Textes culinaires Mésopotamiens'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-931464-92-7}}; commentary at [http://www.semeia.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=703 Society of Biblical Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also works in [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]s depicting the preparation of food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian cuisine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient Greek recipes are known. [[Mithaecus]]'s cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; [[Athenaeus]] quotes one short recipe in his [[Deipnosophistae]]. [[Athenaeus]] mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.&lt;ref name=dalby&gt;[[Andrew Dalby]], ''Food in the Ancient World from A to Z'', 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-23259-7}} p. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with [[Cato the Elder]]'s [[De Agri Cultura]]. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; Some [[Punic]] recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt;

The large collection of recipes ''De re coquinaria'', conventionally titled [[Apicius]], appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Roman food in Britain | accessdate =  2007-05-10 | url = http://romans-in-britain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipe begins with the Latin command "Take...," "Recipe...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Colquhoun |first1=Kate |title=Taste: The Story of Britain through its Cooking |date=2008 |origyear=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-747-59306-5 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq|al-Warraq]] and [[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]].

The earliest recipe in [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of [[Safavid]]s, including ''Karnameh'' (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and ''Madat-ol-Hayat'' (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-of-music.net/ppdf/nppdf/2835/p0283539930101.pdf Jaam-e Jam]&lt;/ref&gt; Recipe books from the [[Qajar]] period are numerous, the most notable being ''Khorak-ha-ye Irani'' by prince Nader Mirza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=کتاب خوراک های ایرانی | website=مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | date=December 3, 2016 | url=http://foodculture.ir/food-culture/%da%a9%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d8%ae%d9%88%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9-%d9%87%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86%db%8c-%d8%af%d8%b1-%d8%b2%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%ac%d8%a7%d8%b1/ | language=fa | ref={{sfnref | مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | 2016}} | access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called ''[[Forme of Cury]]'' in 1390,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = COMDA Calendar Co. | title = 2007 Recipe Calendar | publisher = COMDA, Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; and around the same time, another book was published entitled ''[[Curye on Inglish]]'', "cury" meaning cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hicatt | first = Constance B | author2 = Sharon Butler | title = English Culinary Manuscripts of the 14C | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served [[English cuisine|in England]] at that time. The luxurious taste of the [[aristocracy]] in the [[Early Modern Period]] brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including [[coriander]], parsley, basil and [[rosemary]], many of which had been brought back from the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Austin | first = Thomas | title = Ashmole and other Manuscripts | year = 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern recipes and cooking advice===
[[Image:ActonFish.jpg|thumb|from ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' by Eliza Acton (London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1871. p.48.)]]
With the advent of the [[printing press]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sieben | first = Ria Jansen | title = Een notable boecxtken van cokeryen | year = 1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = anon | title = The good Huswifes handmaid for Cookerie | year = 1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many families published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = May | first = Robert | title = The accomplifht Cook |  year = 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books have been translated and are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medieval Cookbooks | author = Judy Gerjuoy | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/food_bibliography.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by [[Isabella Beeton]], the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was [[Eliza Acton]]. Her pioneering cookbook, ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for [[Brussels sprouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, ''Food For Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World'', (2004) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chef [[Delia Smith]] called Acton "the best writer of recipes in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-uk.com/interesting/delia-british-library.htm Interview].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Cookery'' long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.

[[File:Isabella Beeton - Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management - title page.jpg|thumb|left|270x270px|Titlepage of ''Beeton's Book of Household Management'']]
Acton's work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton,&lt;ref name=Acton&gt;{{cite book|title=Acton, Eliza (1799–1859)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591300080.html|work=[[Women in World History|Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=January 2002}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] household, with advice on fashion, [[child care]], [[animal husbandry]], [[poison]]s, the management of [[Domestic worker|servants]], science, religion, and industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter16.html:''General Observations on the Common Hog'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracingpaper.org.uk/2007/04/21/food-in-season-in-1861/''Food in season in April 1861'']&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.

The American cook [[Fannie Farmer]] (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work ''The Boston Cooking School Cookbook'' which contained some 1,849 recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham | first = Marion | title = The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (revised) | publisher = Bantam Books, New York | year = 1979 | isbn = 978-0-553-56881-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pistachio cake.png|thumb|250px|right|Recipe with ingredients integrated into the method]]
Modern culinary recipes normally consist of several components
* The name of the recipe (Origins/History of the dish)
* Yield: The number of servings that the dish provides.
* List all ingredients in the order of its use. Describe it in step by step instructions.
* Listing ingredients by the quantity (Write out abbreviations. Ounces instead of oz).
* How much time does it take to prepare the dish, plus cooking time for the dish.
* Necessary equipment used for the dish.
* Cooking procedures. Temperature and bake time if necessary.
* Serving procedures (Served while warm/cold).
* Review of the dish (Would you recommend this dish to a friend?).
* Photograph of the dish (Optional).
* Nutritional Value: Helps for dietary restrictions. Includes number of calories or grams per serving.


Earlier recipes often included much less information, serving more as a reminder of ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paradowski|first1=Michał B.|title=Through catering college to the naked chef – teaching LSP and culinary translation.

Recipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.

==Internet and television recipes==
By the mid 20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in England was [[Fanny Cradock]] with a show on the BBC. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of [[CEEFAX]] text on screen, they became available on television.

The first Internet [[Usenet newsgroup]] dedicated to cooking was ''net.cooks'' created in 1982, later becoming ''[news:///rec.food.cooking rec.food.cooking]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victor |last=Sack |title=rec.food.cooking FAQ and conversion file |at=sec. 6.1 |url=http://vsack.homepage.t-online.de/rfc_faq0.html#6.1 |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.

In the early 21st century, there has been a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124148676424885935|title=Web Recipes Are Cooking With Gas |last= Holmes |first=Elizabeth |date=2009-05-05 |publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television networks such as the [[Food Network]] and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], [[Nigella Lawson]] and [[Rachael Ray]] having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as [[Top Chef]] or [[Iron Chef]], and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cookbooks surge to top category at libraries | author=Andriani, Lynn | accessdate=2013-10-14| url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/cooking/article/46214-cookbooks-surge-to-top-category-at-libraries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe design tools==
[[Molecular gastronomy]] provides [[chef]]s with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this discipline also provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by [[chef]]s, [[foodie]]s, home cooks and even [[Bartender|mixologists]] worldwide to improve or design recipes.

Saint Peter's church was built at the end of the fifth century within the walls of the (Gallo-) Roman city, situated at a cemetery which replaced a former residential area. It was dedicated to saint Peter and Paul and used as a funerary Basilica. The church housed, over time, the remains of most the bishops of Vienne, starting with [[Mamertus]] (died c. 475). Most of the early bishops of the city buried here are considered saints.

== Abbaye de Saint Pierre ==
In the 6th century a community of monks settled there, of which Leonianus was the first abbot. During the Middle Ages this abbey was the most influential of all of Vienne's monasteries. The church houses an important variety of relics, one of which is the water dish of the last supper.
During the late Middle Ages and the early modern period the competition of the mendicant orders and then the [[Wars of Religion]] permanently weakened the abbey. The monks became canons and between 1780 and 1791 the former abbey was in union with the Abbey of Saint-Chef.

Initially transformed into a museum in 1809, building was restorated during the 1860s. In 1872 the building was converted into a lapidary museum. The presentation of the collections has remained almost unchanged to the present day.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Mus%C3%A9e_arch%C3%A9ologique_%C3%89glise_de_Saint-Pierre.jpg|thumb|Interior of the nave today]]
The apse and the decor of the nave wall arches were likely built at the end of the 5th century and, as such are among the oldest remains. During the Carolingian era changes were made concerning the windows in the upper part of the nave.

The first important transformations took place at the end of the 11th century and the 12th century: the nave was divided into three parts by large arches. The bell tower porch is added to the West; the Notre-Dame Chapel, in the form of a Greek cross, is barrel-vaulted and outfitted with a dome; the South Portal is decorated with sculptures.

The remains of the 12th century murals can still be seen. In the 15th century several chapels were furnished but have disappeared since then. Few changes took place between the 15th century and 1780, when the whole of the building was covered in neo-classical stucco décor. The stucco was removed during the restoration in the 1860s.

Many fragments of the stone fence between the sanctuary for the clergy and the nave have been reused during the building of the bell tower in the 12th century, high up the front of the ancient façade. A monolithic altar from the 10th or 11th century is preserved in one of the museums of Vienne.

==Relics==

Among the many preserved relics are those of the following saints:

* Saint [[Ado (bishop)|Ado of Vienne]]
* Saint [[Avitus of Vienne]]
* Saint [[Crescens]]
* Saint [[Desiderius of Vienne|Desiderius]]
* Saint [[Mamertus]]

[[File:Jean_Siméon_Chardin_-_The_Prayer_before_Meal_-_WGA04768.jpg|thumb|Louvre version]]
'''''Saying Grace''''' or '''''The Prayer Before a Meal''''' (French - ''Le Bénédicité'') is the title of several paintings by [[Jean Simeon Chardin]], showing a middle class French family saying [[grace (prayer)|grace]] before a meal.

==Hermitage version==
The only work of this title by Chardin signed and dated in his own hand dates to 1744. It is signed in the bottom left hand corner. Chardin was presented to [[Louis XV]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]] on 27 November 1740 by [[Philibert Orry]], the king's superintendent of buildings and controller general of finances - Chardin's only meeting with the monarch. This was one of two paintings the artist presented to Louis on that occasion - the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' reported that the king "received [the paintings] very favourably; these two little works are already well known, having been exhibited at the Salon in the Louvre last August. We mentioned them in the October ''Mercure'', under the title ''The Laborious Mother'' and ''Saying Grace''." The work is now in the [[Hermitage Museum]], which it entered between 1763 and 1774 under [[Catherine II of Russia]].

==Variants==
The [[Louvre]] holds a variant exhibited at the 1740 [[Paris Salon]]. There are other variants in the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in Rotterdam (with a small boy added on the left) and the [[Nationalmuseum]] in Stockholm.

'''Scented water''', [[odoriferous]] water&lt;ref name="Baer43"&gt;Baer, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; or sweet water,&lt;ref&gt;Ponce de León, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallowglass.org"&gt;[http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/oil&amp;water.html Making Medieval Style Scented Oils &amp; Waters]&lt;/ref&gt; is a water with a sweet [[aromatic]] smell.&lt;ref&gt;Tietz, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of flowers or herbs and is the precursor of the modern day perfume.&lt;ref name="middleagescents"&gt;[http://www.gallowglass.org/jadwiga/herbs/scents.html Scents of the Middle Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; Scented waters are also used in making other products such as [[pomander]]s and body care products.&lt;ref name="gallowglass.org"/&gt;

== Ingredients ==
Some of the flowers and herbs used to make scented water are:

* [[jasmine]]&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;  Largely used in Indonesia for charmed bath. Also used to cleanse a curse from another shaman or demon. 
* [[lemon]]&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt; 
* [[lavender]] – from the Latin word ''lavare'', meaning to wash.&lt;ref&gt;Phaneuf, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Myrtus|myrtle]] – one of the original types.&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;
* [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] [[blossom]]s – one of the best known waters. [[Orange flower water]] is also used in various cuisines, to flavor desserts and to mask the taste of [[hard water]].&lt;ref name="middleagescents"/&gt;
* [[rose]]s – distilled are used in cosmetics. [[Rose water]], a byproduct of traditional [[rose oil]] production, is prominently used in desserts in [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and [[North Indian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="Gladstar123"&gt;Gladstar, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[rosemary]] – believed to refuse to grow in flower gardens of evil people.&lt;ref&gt;Books, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hygiene ==

In Medieval times a scented water was used for hygiene by a person washing their hands with it before meals, since many meals were forkless.&lt;ref name="Adamson161"&gt;Adamson, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bober, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmorton.ca/blog/2009/04/food-in-the-middle-ages/ Food in the Middle Ages: Eight Things You Probably Didn’t Know]&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy of Medieval times had their linen clothes boiled in scented water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookit.e2bn.org/historycookbook/27-316-normans-medieval-Health-facts.html Normans / Medieval]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varahamihira]] (6th century) was using scented water to clean his toothbrushes.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to [[Marie Antoinette]]'s execution in 1793 one of her servants was able to smuggle her some minimal need requests, one being some scented water for her teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Feydeau, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===

[[Hippocrates]] mentions scented water in his medical practice:
{{cquote|
''Then dipping (BAPTW) into oil of roses or Egyptian oil, apply it through the day, and, as soon as it stings, take it away, and baptize (BAPTIDZO) it, again, into woman's milk and Egyptian oil, and apply during the night and rinse with sweet scented water and apply tallow.'' Hippocrates , ii, 710&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.living-hope-press.com/BAPTIDZO-Envelopment-for-Influence.html History of Baptism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Washing waters ===
[[Boccaccio]] in his [[Decameron]] mentions scented washing waters:
{{cquote| 
''Without permitting anyone else to lay a hand on him, the lady herself washed Salabaetto all over with soap scented with musk and cloves. She then had herself washed and rubbed down by the slaves. This done, the slaves brought two fine and very white sheets, so scented with roses that they seemed like roses; the slaves wrapped Salabaetto in one and the lady in the other and then carried them both on their shoulders to the bed... They then took from the basket silver vases of great beauty, some of which were filled with rose water, some with orange water, some with jasmine water, and some with lemon water, which they sprinkled upon them.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://rosaliegilbert.com/cleanliness.html Bathing and cleansing of the medieval woman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://calontir.info/artsci/calonscrolls/Calon_Scrolls_Jan_08_Home.pdf Beauty Aids in Renaissance Italy, page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Refreshment ==

It was a custom in the [[Roman Empire]] for [[amphitheatre]]s to be furnished with scented water jet fountain sprays for refreshing the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Langmead, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Papillon200"&gt;Papillon, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuniczak, p. 452 ''High in the rear were sprinklers to cool the spectators and mists of saffon and verbena water.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Middleton, p. 86 ''...and fountains poured forth jets of perfumed water. Ref: cf. Suet. Nero, 31.'' footnote 2: ''It appears to have been the custom, under the Empire, for all theatres and other places of amusement to be provided with perfumed fountains and concealed jets for cooling the air with a fine spray of scented water.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0062:entry=amphitheatrum-harpers&amp;highlight=scented Amphitheātrum] ''There were in the amphitheatre concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience, and which sometimes issued from statues placed in different parts of the building.'' (Lucan, ix. 808; Spect. 3.)&lt;/ref&gt; The overhead awning ([[velarium]]) shielding the spectators for the [[Colosseum]] was saturated with scented water for dripping fragrant water on spectators' heads to keep them cool.&lt;ref&gt;Papillon, p. 200   ''The awning shielding the amphitheatre was saturated with scented water which dripped, like a fragrant rain, on the spectators' heads.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DICTIONARY OF GREEK AND ROMAN ANTIQUITIES, p. 53 ''There were in the amphitheatres concealed tubes, from which scented liquids were scattered over the audience...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Amphitheatrum.html Amphitheatrum] 
''They were protected from the sun and the rain by an ample canopy, occasionally drawn over their heads. The air was continually refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Amphitheatrum.html Amphitheatrum] ''but the velarium, or awning, by which the spectators were sheltered from the sun, requires some explanation, which will be found under Velum. The space required for the working of the velarium, and the height necessary for keeping it from bending down by its own weight so low as to obstruct the view from the upper benches, are probably the reasons for the great disproportion between the height of the upper part of the amphitheatre, and the small number of spectators accommodated in that part. The luxurious appliances of fountains of scented water to refresh the spectators, and so forth, are sufficiently described in the passage already quoted from Gibbon (cf. Lucan IX.808).º''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perfume ==

[[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland]] in 1511-12 had various scented waters made for him, which consisted of his usage of over a gallon each week for the year.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1571 estate inventory of John Brodocke, an apothecary in [[Southampton]], lists 32 types of scented water that he had as some of the items in his shop.&lt;ref&gt;Woolgar, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 17th century [[Constantinople]] the Venetians and Genoese had apothecary shops that had merchants of scented water including rose water.&lt;ref&gt;Donkin, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Scented waters were still being used into the 19th century of the wealthy nobles in Egypt as a type of perfume. It was an Egyptian custom then to sprinkle guests with rose water or orange-flower water after dinner just before they were to go home.&lt;ref name="Baer43"/&gt;

Even though it is said by scholars that the art of perfumery has it roots in antiquity, the city of [[Montpellier]] has self established itself as the birthplace of [[perfumery]]. In the 18th century they honored guests of the city with scented water and other 'gifts of fragrance'. There are even perfume manuals that describe Montpellier perfumes as being "a la mode de Montpellier" because of extra ingredients used that enhance their fragrances.&lt;ref&gt;Feydeau, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooking ==
Scented rose water is and has been used from time to time for cooking and flavoring foods in various recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Rose water is used in Greek cuisine.&lt;ref name="Gladstar123"/&gt;

== Sensual ==

In Medieval times scented water was used for sensual pleasures.&lt;ref name="Adamson161"/&gt;

== Religious ==
In Medieval times scented water was used at baptisms.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttelton, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formulas ==

=== Rose water ===
Mary Hooper in her book called ''Petals in the Ashes'' about the [[Great Fire of 1666]] explains that the first step in making "rose water" is to gather together 3 or 4 full roses. These roses should not have been treated in any way with toxic pesticide for obvious reasons. One is to then take a pint of water and put into a [[saucepan]]. Then heat the water with the roses in it gently, not allowing it to boil. You are to cook the rose petals until they become transparent. After that happens, allow the cooked rose water to cool. Then drain through a [[sieve]] forcing the water to go through the rose petals. The resulting "rose water" is to be refrigerated. The scented water then is used as a cooling agent on the body as well as the face.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scented bath water ===
Hooper explains that scented water to bathe in can be made of dried herbs.  She explains the idea of making such a scented water is to put 8 tablespoons of dried herbs in a pan of 1 pint of water and simmer for 10 minutes. This water then is to be allowed to cool. Then it is to be strained to remove all the herb pieces. For the actual bath then a quarter of this scented water is to be put into your bath, highlighted with fresh flower petals on top of the bath water. She explains [[rose]]s and [[lovage]] have a cleansing and deodorising effect. For a refreshing effect she recommends to use rosemary and [[hyssop]].  For a relaxing effect to use [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] flowers and [[lavender]]. For a soothing effect use [[chamomile]] and [[lemon balm]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Engravers''' was founded in London in 1802 to promote British [[printmaking]], largely because [[engraver]]s were not allowed (unless they were also painters or sculptors) to join the [[Royal Academy]], and also to enable "each individual to act with more firmness in opposing the pretensions ... of booksellers and publishers".&lt;ref&gt;Raimbach, Memoirs, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;  The first President was [[Francesco Bartolozzi]], himself in fact an R.A..  The [[Royal Watercolour Society]] (as it later became) was founded in 1804 for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McCalman (ed), ''An Oxford Companion to the Romantic Age: British Culture, 1776-1832'', p.189, [[OUP]], 1999, {{ISBN|0-19-924543-6}}.  Though most other sources say 1803.&lt;/ref&gt;  The society is described as "short-lived".

Later Presidents included [[William Bond (engraver)|William Bond]], and [[James Parker (engraver)|James Parker]], [[James Pastorini]] and [[Thomas Milton]] were Governors.

'''''Takka Takka''''' is a 1962 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] in his [[comic book]] style of using [[Ben-Day dots]] and a story panel. This work is held in the collection of the [[Museum Ludwig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/coll1.htm|title=Lichtensteins in Museums|accessdate=June 22, 2013|publisher=LichtensteinFoundation.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606073129/http://lichtensteinfoundation.org/coll1.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title comes from the [[onomatopoeic]] graphics that depict the sound that comes from a [[machine gun]].&lt;ref name="FoS"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Takka Takka source.jpg|thumb|left|The source of ''Takka Takka'' is ''Battlefield Action'' #40 (c), February 1962, Charlton Comics Group.]]

Lichtenstein was a trained [[United States Army]] pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a [[World War II]] (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat.&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lfchron1.htm|title=Chronology|accessdate=June 9, 2013|publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606071341/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lfchron1.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HWaW"&gt;{{cite book| author = David McCarthy|author2=Horace Clifford Westermann | title = H.C.

The image shows [[shell casing]]s and a [[grenade]] in mid flight. An explosion is stylized with the titular phrase.&lt;ref name="FoS"&gt;{{cite book| last = Weisenburger| first = Steven| title = Fables of Subversion: Satire and the American Novel| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tIDNu7Lr0d4C&amp;pg=PA112| accessdate = June 23, 2013| date = 1995| publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]]| isbn = 0820316687| pages = 112–113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of ''Takka Takka'' is the comic book ''Battlefield Action'' #40 (February 1962, Charlton Comics Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?decade=60&amp;year=62&amp;work_id=81#|title=''Takka Takka''|accessdate=June 26, 2013|publisher=LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenstein's reinterpretation of the original comic image eliminates the [[horizon]] line and other indications of [[depth of field]].&lt;ref name=FoS/&gt; He also eliminates the human element by removing a hand, a helmet and the Japanese rising sun emblem.&lt;ref name=FoS/&gt;

When the characters in some of his works, e.g. ''Takka Takka'', ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'', were criticised for being militaristic, Lichtenstein responded: "the heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don't take them seriously in these paintings—maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point. I use them for purely formal reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Naremore| first = James| title = Modernity and Mass Culture| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CeEfBGnsbkwC&amp;pg=PA208| accessdate = June 23, 2013| year = 1991| publisher = [[Indiana University Press]]| isbn = 0253206278| page = 208| editor = Naremore, James and Patrick M.

''[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'' critic Sophie Gilbert, regards ''Takka Takka'' (along with ''[[Bratatat!]]'') as exemplary of Lichtenstein's "aggressive, hyper-masculine war paintings" due to the depiction of the guns creating sound effects and the use of onomatopoeic words during military conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/blogs/afterhours/art/art-preview-roy-lichtenstein-a-retrospective-at-the-national-gallery-of-art.php|title=Art Preview: “Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective” at the National Gallery of Art|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=October 11, 2012|work=[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]|author=Gilbert, Sophie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Takka Takka'', with its disruption of the primary narrative clause by text focused on absent details about the past or omitted present, is described as "the most unlikely conjunction of picture and story".&lt;ref name="PoR"&gt;{{cite book| last = Steiner| first = Wendy| title = Pictures of Romance: Form against Context in Painting and Literature| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lFxCRvrm9zAC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=takka+takka+lichtenstein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QBEBJssFsR&amp;sig=LdroRvDeYWX-JkbqtRxOiBRtC-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yAjHUYjzN43O9gT07oFY&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=takka%20takka%20lichtenstein&amp;f=false| date = 1987| publisher = [[University Of Chicago Press]]| isbn = 0226772292| page = 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is regarded as one in which Lichtenstein exaggerated comic book sound effects in common pop art style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brooker| first = Will| title = Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GNRreYO91ogC&amp;pg=PA182| accessdate = June 23, 2013| date = 2001| publisher = [[Bloomsbury Academic]]| isbn = 0826413439| page = 182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of critic [[Steven Weisenburger]], Lichtenstein's reimagining creates a tension between the narrative and graphical content because the "exhausted soldiers" are absent. ''Takka Takka'' is a subversion of the interpretive conventions of "pop" culture, "but more important, it interrogates a shared idea about war, that war's sublime violence heroizes."&lt;ref name=FoS/&gt; Implicitly comparing ''Takka Takka'' to Picasso's [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']], art historian [[Klaus Honnef]] states that the work's use of the "cartoon idiom in combination with elements of written language" demonstrates that art does not have to present the horrors of war graphically in order to be forceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Honnef| first = Klaus| title = Pop Art| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KRtCl1nFSV8C&amp;pg=PA50| accessdate = June 23, 2013| date = 2004| publisher = [[Taschen]]| isbn = 3822822183| page = 50| editor = Grosenick, Uta }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fingernail Test''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]] or [[Judith Leyster]], painted in 1626 and now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]. 

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] is also known as ''Boy with a glass and a lute'' and shows a young lute-player wearing a beret and a draped cloak over his chest, tilting his glass to show it is empty while facing the viewer in order to say "time is up". It was attributed to Hals for centuries until [[Claus Grimm]] called it a product of his circle. According to Hofrichter, the positioning of a figure sitting behind a table is a typical Leyster theme, and the upward glance is reminiscent of her ''Violin player'', while the application of paint is similar to her ''Two children with a cat''.&lt;ref&gt;''Judith Leyster: A Woman Painter in Holland's Golden Age'', by Frima Fox Hofrichter, Doornspijk, 1989, Davaco Publishers, {{ISBN|90-70288-62-1}}, catalog #32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th-century, the gesture of tipping the glass down to see if a drop of wine appears on a fingernail was a method to show one wanted a refill. The scene is often shown with figures in theatrical costumes.

In his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works [[Hofstede de Groot]] noted this painting may be the same one as a painting sold in Rotterdam in 1825 and wrote: "86. THE FINGER-NAIL TEST (or, The Mandoline-Player with a Wine-Glass). M. 210. Half-length. A mandoline-player sits at a table, with his body turned three-quarters right, but facing the spectator. In his uplifted right hand, with the little finger erect, he holds a green goblet downwards ; under it is his left hand, also with the little finger erect. 
The top of his orange-yellow mandoline rests on his left arm ; the bottom of it lies on the table. He has long hair, and wears a cap on the back of his head, to the right. He has a bright red costume with a greyish-purple cloak, white frills at his wrists, and a white band at the throat. An olive- green curtain hangs behind him. [Compare 74.] 

Canvas, 28 inches by 23 inches. Exhibited at Dublin, 1857. In the collection of J. Napper of Lough Crew Castle, Oldcastle, Meath. Sale. Dublin, autumn of 1906 (3990, Sulley). In the possession of the London dealers Dowdeswell. In the possession of the London dealer C. Wertheimer. In the possession of the Paris dealers Kleinberger and Wildenstein. In the collection of B. Altman, New York. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/23/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on The Fingernail Test; catalog numbers 74 and 86&lt;/ref&gt; 

This painting could be related to ''[[Young Man with a Skull]]'' in which a boy is also wearing a beret and draped cloak, and is also similar to a painting with the same alternate name, ''[[Boy with a Glass and a Lute]]''.

'''''The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld''''' is an American [[non-fiction]] book by [[Herbert Asbury]], first published in 1927 by Garden City Publishing Company.

==Description==
{{Further|List of identities in The Gangs of New York (book)}}
The book details the rise and fall of 19th century [[gang]]s in [[New York City]], prior to the domination of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] during [[Prohibition]] in the 1920s. Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens, and winding alleys of the [[Bowery]] and the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] district of [[Lower Manhattan]], the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era, when colorfully named criminals like "Dandy" [[Johnny Dolan]], [[William Poole]] (also known as Bill the Butcher), and [[Hell-Cat Maggie]] lurked in the shadows, and infamous gangs including the [[Plug Uglies]], [[Dead Rabbits]], and [[Bowery Boys]] ruled the streets. It includes a [[rogues' gallery]] of [[prostitutes]], [[pimps]], poisoners, [[pickpockets]], murderers, and thieves.

==Adaptation==
The book was loosely adapted into the [[epic film|epic]] [[historical drama]] film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) by director [[Martin Scorsese]].

'''''The Old Plantation''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[folk art]] [[watercolor]] likely painted in the late 18th century on a [[South Carolina]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]].&lt;ref name=raiments&gt;{{Harvnb|Foster|1997| p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lmNF158DvrMC&amp;pg=RA3-PA374&amp;sig=rg3aZAyQ6wDj8ip9IpPFpjDbSZY 314]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Epstein|1975|p=354}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;{{Harvnb|Epstein|1 975|p=351}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable for its early date, its credible, non-stereotypical depiction of slaves on the North American mainland, and the fact that the slaves are shown pursuing their own interests. The [[artist]] has been identified as [[South Carolina]] [[slaveholder]] John Rose, and the painting may depict his plantation in what is now [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort County]].

==Description and interpretation==
{{Further|Stick dance (African-American)}}
The painting depicts [[Slavery in the United States|African American slaves]] between two small outbuildings of a plantation sited on a broad river.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Old Plantation'' is the only known painting of its era that depicts African Americans by themselves, concerned only with each other,&lt;ref name=punished&gt;{{Harvnb|Bontemps|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kAA5ehSLwTcC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=2ZEen9h4Cfh4DRbw4FZ-R9NHmNw 7]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though its central activity remains obscure. Some writers have speculated that the painting depicts a marriage ceremony, with the attendant tradition of [[jumping the broom]]. However, scholars have suggested that the subjects are performing a secular dance: western African dance patterns traditionally include sticks and a variety of body positions. The headdresses pictured are of [[West Africa]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features two male musicians, one of whom is playing a stringed instrument that resembles a Yoruba [[xalam|molo]];&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{Harvnb|Epstein|1963|p=202}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the body of this instrument seems to be a hollow [[gourd]].&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The molo is a precursor to the [[banjo]], and this is the earliest known American painting to picture a banjo-like instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mazow|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=r6eGxpIbsqUC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;sig=PWUbuRvkmhAye02T5sWn8h6VK4Q 23]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second musician is playing a percussion instrument that may be a Yoruba [[gudugudu]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; The two women hold what look like scarves, but are actually sheguras, rattles made of a gourd enclosed in a net of variable length into which hard objects have been woven.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist and provenance==
For decades the identity of the artist was unknown, as was the painting's [[provenance]] prior to 1935, when it was purchased by [[Holger Cahill]] from Mary E. Lyles of [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Stillinger&gt;Stillinger, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010, Susan P. Shames, a librarian at [[Colonial Williamsburg]], published a book titled ''The Old Plantation: The Artist Revealed'' in which she argues the artist was South Carolina plantation owner John Rose.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shames further suggests that the image depicts slaves on Rose's plantation in what is now [[Beaufort County, South Carolina]], or one nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775, Rose was named Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in Beaufort District, an appointment implying his educated status and familiarity with governing officials.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; By 1795, he owned a lot in the town of [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], as well as a rural, 813-acre tract on the Coosaw River in Prince William Parish.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; He employed slave labor to farm the latter property. At least fifty of these slaves have been identified by name, and he likely owned others.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.56-60&lt;/ref&gt; Shames suggests the slaves and plantation depicted in the image were Rose's own. However, the broad river in the middle ground raises questions about whether Rose owned property on both sides of this natural boundary and, thus, whether he depicted his own dwelling and outbuildings in the background, or a neighbor's.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; Rose moved to the [[Dorchester, South Carolina|Dorchester]] area in present-day [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton County]] in 1795, and he died in 1820 in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] after a fall from a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

In his will, Rose left his watercolor of dancing slaves to his son-in-law, Thomas Davis Stall (1770–1848).&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shames, it remained in the family for more than a hundred years, until it was finally sold at an auction of the estate of Rose Rowan Ellis Copes (1846–1927) of [[Orangeburg, South Carolina]], probably in 1928 or 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought either by an unidentified interim dealer or by Mary Earle Lyles (b. 1878) of Columbia. It was certainly in Lyles' possession by 1935, when it was purchased by Holger Cahill, acting as agent for [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. According to Lyles, however, it was painted on a plantation between Charleston and Orangeburg.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; A [[watermark]] on the paper has been identified as that used by the English papermaker [[James Whatman (papermaker)|James Whatman]] II (1741–1798) between 1777 and 1794.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockefeller and Cahill transferred the painting to [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] to be part of the Rockefeller collection at the Ludwell-Paradise House.&lt;ref name=Stillinger/&gt; It was later gifted to [[Colonial Williamsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Shames, p.21&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is currently held by the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]] in Williamsburg.&lt;ref name=raiments/&gt;

[[File:Etty Cleopatra.jpg|right|upright=1.8|thumb|''The Triumph of Cleopatra'', 1821, {{convert|106.5|by|132.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}|alt=Bare-breasted woman on a boat, surrounded by naked and semi-naked people]]
'''''The Triumph of Cleopatra''''', also known as '''''Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia'''''{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=29}} and '''''The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia''''',{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=161}} is an [[oil painting]] by English artist [[William Etty]]. It was first exhibited in 1821, and is now in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]] in [[Port Sunlight]] across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. During the 1810s Etty had become widely respected among staff and students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones. Despite having exhibited at every [[Summer Exhibition]] since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest. In 1820 he exhibited ''The Coral Finder'', which showed nude figures on a [[gilded]] boat. This painting attracted the attention of [[Francis Freeling|Sir Francis Freeling]], who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale.

''The Triumph of Cleopatra'' illustrates a scene from [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Antony]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] in [[Cilicia]] aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general [[Mark Antony]]. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge group of people in various states of undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade to creating further [[history paintings]] containing [[nude (art)|nude]] figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.

==Background==
[[File:Etty – Male Nude with Staff.jpeg|left|thumb|upright|''Male Nude with Staff'' (1814–16). Despite limited success in the 1810s, Etty was admired for his ability to paint flesh tones.|alt=Nude man holding a long pole]]
[[William Etty]] was born in [[York]] in 1787, the son of a miller and baker.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=2}} He showed artistic promise from an early age,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=4}} but his family were financially insecure,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=2}} and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=5}} On completing his seven-year [[indenture]] he moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours",{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=31}} with the aim of emulating the [[Old Masters]] and becoming a [[history painting|history painter]].{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=86}} Etty gained acceptance to the [[Royal Academy Schools]] in early 1807.{{sfn|Myrone|2011|p=47}} After a year spent studying under the renowned portrait painter [[Thomas Lawrence]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}} Etty returned to the [[Royal Academy]], drawing in the [[life class]] and copying other paintings.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}}{{sfn|Green|2011|p=61}} He was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions, and every painting he submitted for the [[Summer Exhibition]] was rejected.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=15}}

In 1811, one of his paintings, ''Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar'', was finally accepted for the Summer Exhibition.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=21}}{{efn-ua|As with every painting exhibited by Etty at the Summer Exhibition before 1819, ''Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar'' has not survived.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=17}}}} Etty was becoming widely respected at the Royal Academy for his painting, particularly his use of colour and his ability to produce realistic flesh tones,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=32}} and from 1811 onwards had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=21}} However, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=19}}

[[File:William Etty -The Coral Finder Venus and her Youthful Satellites.jpg|upright=1.3|right|thumb|''The Coral Finder'' (1820) led [[Francis Freeling|Sir Francis Freeling]] to commission ''Cleopatra''.|alt=Naked woman on a boat, surrounded by naked children]]
At the 1820 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited ''The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos''.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} Strongly inspired by [[Titian]], ''The Coral Finder'' depicts [[Venus Victrix]] lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily-clad attendants.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=29}} It was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer Thomas Tomkinson&lt;!-- Don't link unless someone writes an article on him, this isn't the famous Thomas Tomkinson --&gt; for £30 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|30|1820|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=142}}

[[Francis Freeling|Sir Francis Freeling]] admired ''The Coral Finder'' at its exhibition, and learning that it had been sold he commissioned Etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale, for a fee of 200&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|210|1820|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}}{{efn-ua|The transaction is not recorded, and there is some suggestion that Freeling did not pay the full amount agreed.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=283}}}} Etty had for some time been musing on the possibility of a painting of [[Cleopatra]], and took the opportunity provided by Freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on the composition of ''The Coral Finder''.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=29}}

==Composition==
''The Triumph of Cleopatra'' is based loosely on [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Antony]]'' as repeated in Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] in [[Cilicia]] aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general [[Mark Antony]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=29}}

{{quote|text=Therefore when she was sent unto by divers letters, both from Antonius himself and also from his friends, she made so light of it and mocked Antonius so much that she disdained to set forward otherwise but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poop whereof was of gold, the sails of purple, and the oars of silver, which kept stroke in rowing after the sound of the music of flutes, howboys, cithernes, viols, and such other instruments as they played upon in the barge. And now for the person of herself: she was laid under a pavilion of cloth of gold of tissue, apparelled and attired like the goddess Venus commonly drawn in picture; and hard by her, on either hand of her, pretty fair boys apparelled as painters do set forth god Cupid, with little fans in their hands, with the which they fanned wind upon her. Her ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest of them were apparelled like the nymphs Nereides (which are the mermaids of the waters) and like the Graces, some steering the helm, others tending the tackle and ropes of the barge, out of which there came a wonderful passing sweet savour of perfumes, that perfumed the wharf's side, pestered with innumerable multitudes of people.|sign=Plutarch, ''Life of Anthony'', translated by [[Thomas North|Sir Thomas North]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=North|first1=Thomas|editor-last1=James|editor-first1=Eirian|title=An Anthology of English Prose 1400–1900|year=1956|chapter=The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans, compared together by that Learned Philosopher and Historiographer Plutarch of Chaeronea|pages=11–13|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn= 978-1-107-55425-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While superficially similar to ''The Coral Finder'', ''Cleopatra'' is more closely related to the style of [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], with its deliberately cramped and crowded composition.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} The individual figures are intentionally out of proportion to each other and to the ship, while a large number of figures are tightly positioned within a relatively small section of the painting.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}}

[[File:William Etty - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|left|upright|thumb|William Etty, self-portrait, 1823|alt=Bearded man in his 30s]]
As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, [[Rubens]] and classical sculpture.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} The figures are painted as groups, and while each figure and group of figures is carefully arranged and painted, the combination of groups gives the appearance of a confused mass surrounding the ship when the painting is viewed as a whole.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} (Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr comments that {{nowrap|"[''Cleopatra'']}} contains elements enough for three or four paintings no less ambitious but more maturely planned."){{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} The scene includes a number of images based on drawings Etty had sketched while out and about in London, such as the mother holding up her baby to see the view and the crowd on the roof of a temple in the background.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} It also includes elements of European painting that Etty had learned while copying Old Master artworks as a student, such as the [[putto|putti]] in the sky.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} Etty greatly admired the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], and the painting includes obvious borrowings from Titian and other Venetian artists. It also contains a number of elements from the paintings of Rubens, such as the [[Nereid]]s and [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] in the sea in front of the ship.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}}

Unusually for an English painting of the period in its representation of a queen of an African country&lt;!-- "Queen of an African country", not "African queen", Cleopatra was a Greek ruler of an African country and wasn't of Egyptian descent --&gt; the group of Cleopatra's attendants includes both dark- and light-skinned figures shown on equal terms and with equal prominence.{{sfn|Turner|2011b|p=78}} From the earliest days of his career Etty had been interested in depicting variations in skin colour, and ''The Missionary Boy'', believed to be his oldest significant surviving painting, shows a dark-skinned child.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=8}}{{efn-ua|The attribution of ''The Missionary Boy'' to Etty is unconfirmed, and it was possibly painted c.&amp;nbsp;1820 by Etty's then assistant George Franklin.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=9}} A damaged inscription on the back reads "I well remember [...] missionary boy at Hull painted York by W. Etty R.A.".{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=9}} No record of a dark-skinned child preacher appears in contemporary newspaper reports, and the picture possibly depicts a child convert educated by missionaries.{{sfn|Farr|1958|pp=8–9}} The painting is signed "W. Etty" in the lower left corner, but the signature may not be authentic; no other Etty painting is signed on the front.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=9}}}}

==Reception==
''Cleopatra'' caused an immediate sensation; Etty later claimed that the day after the Summer Exhibition opened he "awoke famous".{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} The May 1821 issue of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' hailed ''Cleopatra'' as "belonging to the highest class",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1821|title=Royal Academy|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|publisher=J. B. Nichols and Son|location=London|volume=XCI|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Robert Leslie]] described it as "a splendid triumph of colour".{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=30}} The painting did not meet with universal approval. ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' conceded that the painting had been "seen and admired at the Royal Academy" but condemned Etty's taking a mythological approach to a historical subject:
{{quote|text=The effect of this picture would have been much more intense had the painter treated it as a mere fact, and had not brought upon the scene those flying Cupids who turn the thing into a mythological fable. Real boys dressed like Cupids would have been proper, but aerial beings are impertinences, and put one out when one is thinking of the sex. If this amorous pageant had been a mere fiction, instead of having actually taken place, still the power of its delineation would have consisted in its probability.|sign=''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', March 1822&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 March 1822|title=London Chit-Chat|journal=Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine|publisher=William Blackwood|location=Edinburgh|volume=XI|issue=62|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center | align= right  | direction = horizontal | total_width=400 | image1= Etty Youth 1822.png |width1=706|height1=900| alt1= Gold boat full of naked people | caption1= ''A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)'' (1822) | image2= Etty Youth 1832.jpg |width2=1131|height2=1536| caption2= ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm]]'' (1832)|alt2=Naked people on a boat, naked people in the water around the boat, and a flying naked child blowing on the sails of the boat|footer=Etty's ''Youth on the Prow'' pictures were condemned by some newspapers for their supposed indecency. The 1832 version became one of his best known works.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=63}}}}
Etty attempted to replicate the success of ''Cleopatra'', and his next significant exhibited work was ''[[Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm#Versions|A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)]]'', exhibited at the [[British Institution]] in January 1822.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} As with ''The Coral Finder'' and ''Cleopatra'', this painting showed a gilded boat filled with nude figures, and its exhibition provoked condemnation from ''[[The Times]]'':
{{quote|We take this opportunity of advising Mr. Etty, who got some reputation for painting "Cleopatra's Galley", not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste. Naked figures, when painted with the purity of Raphael, may be endured: but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent, and on Mr.&amp;nbsp;Etty's {{sic|hide=y|canvass}} is mere dirty flesh. Mr.&amp;nbsp;Howard,{{efn-ua|[[Henry Howard (artist)|Henry Howard]], one of Etty's rivals in the field of history painting.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=31}}}} whose poetical subjects sometimes require naked figures, never disgusts the eye or mind. Let Mr.&amp;nbsp;Etty strive to acquire a taste equally pure: he should know, that just delicate taste and pure moral sense are synonymous terms.|''The Times'', 29 January 1822&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Gwydyr |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=29 January 1822 |page_number=3 |issue=11466 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite the tone, Etty was pleased to be noticed by a newspaper as influential as ''The Times'', and much later confessed how delighted he was that the "''Times'' noticed me. I felt my chariot wheels were on the right road to fame and honour, and I now drove on like another Jehu!"&lt;ref name="Autobiography"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etty|first=William|date=1 February 1849|title=Autobiography in Letters Addressed to a Relative|journal=The Art Journal|publisher=George Virtue|location=London|volume=1|pages=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly as a result of the criticism in ''The Times'', Freeling asked Etty to overpaint the figures in the foreground of ''Cleopatra''. In 1829, after Etty had become a respected artist, Freeling allowed the restoration of the figures to their original condition.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=31}}

==Legacy==
The criticism did little to dissuade Etty from attempting to reproduce the success of ''Cleopatra'', and he concentrated on painting further history paintings containing [[nude (art)|nude]] figures.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=106}} He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including ''Cleopatra''), and all but one contained at least one nude figure.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=32}}{{efn-ua|The sole exception was ''Guardian Cherubs'', a commissioned portrait of the children of [[Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=52}}}} In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=57}}

[[Image:Etty - The World Before the Flood (Southampton).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The World Before the Flood]]'' (1828) reuses some elements from ''The Triumph of Cleopatra''.|alt=Large number of semi-naked people]]
In 1823–24 Etty made an extended trip to study in France and Italy,{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}} and returned a highly accomplished artist.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=46}} His monumental 304 by 399&amp;nbsp;cm (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 13&amp;nbsp;ft 1&amp;nbsp;in) 1825 painting ''[[The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished]]'' was extremely well-received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 June 1825|title=The Fifty-Seventh Annual Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=The European Magazine, and London Review|publisher=Sherwood, Jones and Co.|location=London|volume=87|issue=May 1825|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Etty began to be spoken of as one of England's finest painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=31 May 1825|title=Fine Arts|journal=The Lady's Magazine|publisher=S Robinson|location=London|volume=6|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1828 Etty soundly defeated [[John Constable]] by eighteen votes to five to become a full [[Royal Academician]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=52}} at the time the highest honour available to an artist.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}{{efn-ua|In Etty's time, honours such as knighthoods for artists were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}}} On occasion he would re-use elements from ''Cleopatra'' in his later paintings, such as the black soldier who squats on the side of the ship in ''Cleopatra'' and who also sits watching dancers in his 1828 ''[[The World Before the Flood]]''.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=53}}

Etty continued to produce paintings ranging from [[still life]]s to formal portraits,{{sfn|Turner|2011a|p=9}} and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed obscenity, until his death in 1849.{{sfn|Burnage|Hallett|2011|p=14}} In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion,{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=26}} and by the end of the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}}

Despite its technical flaws, ''Cleopatra'' remained a favourite among many of Etty's admirers during his lifetime; in 1846 [[Elizabeth Rigby]] described it as a "glorious confusion of figures" and "that wonderful 'Cleopatra' of Etty's".{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=93}}

Following Freeling's death in 1836, ''Cleopatra'' was sold for 210 guineas, around the same price Freeling had paid for it, and entered the collection of [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton|Lord Taunton]].{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}} While in Taunton's ownership it was shown at a number of important exhibitions, including a major 1849 Etty retrospective, the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857]] and the [[1862 International Exhibition]]. Following Taunton's death in 1869 it was sold to a succession of owners for a variety of prices, peaking at 500&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|525|1880|r=-3}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) in 1880 and dropping in price on each subsequent resale.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}} In 1911 it was bought for 240&amp;nbsp;guineas (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|252|1911|r=-3}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) by [[William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme]], who was a great admirer of Etty and had a number of his paintings hanging in the entrance hall of his home.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=447}} It has remained in the collection Leverhulme assembled, housed from 1922 in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], ever since.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=141}}

The '''three-volume novel''' (sometimes ''three-Decker'' or ''triple Decker'') was a standard form of [[publishing]] for British [[fiction]] during the nineteenth century. It was a significant stage in the development of the modern Western [[novel]] as a form of popular literature.

==History==
[[file:1885 Punch three-volume-novel-parody Priestman-Atkinson.png|thumb|right|An 1885 cartoon from the magazine [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']], mocking the cliched language attributed to three-volume novels]]
Three volume novels began to be produced by the Edinburgh-based publisher [[Archibald Constable]] in the early 19th century. Constable was one of the most significant publishers of the 1820s and made a success of publishing expensive, three-volume editions of the works of [[Walter Scott]], the first being Scott's historical novel [[Kenilworth (novel)|''Kenilworth'']], published in 1821.&lt;ref name="BrantlingerThesing2008-p16"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Brantlinger|author2=William Thesing|title=A Companion to the Victorian Novel|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99720-8|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continued until Constable's company
collapsed in 1826 with large debts, bankrupting both him and Scott.&lt;ref name="KucichTaylor2012-4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Kucich|author2=Jenny Bourne Taylor|title=The Oxford History of the Novel in English: Volume 3: The Nineteenth-Century Novel 1820-1880|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956061-5|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Constable's company collapsed, the publisher [[Henry Colburn]] quickly adopted the format. The number of three-volume novels he issued annually rose from six in 1825 to 30 in 1828 and 39 in 1829. Under Colburn's influence, the published novels adopted a standard format of three volumes in [[octavo]], priced at 31 shillings and sixpence. The price and format remained unaltered for nearly 70 years, until 1894.&lt;ref name="KucichTaylor2012-6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Kucich|author2=Jenny Bourne Taylor|title=The Oxford History of the Novel in English: Volume 3: The Nineteenth-Century Novel 1820-1880|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-956061-5|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-volume novels quickly disappeared after 1894, when both Mudie's and [[W. H. Smith]] stopped purchasing them.&lt;ref name="draznin2001"&gt;{{cite book | title=Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (#179) | publisher=Greenwood Press | author=Draznin, Yaffa Claire | year=2001 | series=Contributions in Women's Studies | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=151 | isbn=0-313-31399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The format of the three-volume novel does not correspond closely to what would now be considered a [[trilogy]] of novels. In a time when books were relatively expensive to print and bind, publishing longer works of fiction had a particular relationship to a reading public who borrowed books from commercial [[Circulating library|circulating libraries]]. A novel divided into three parts could create a demand (Part I whetting an appetite for Parts II and III). The income from Part I could also be used to pay for the printing costs of the later parts. Furthermore, a commercial librarian had three volumes earning their keep, rather than one. The particular style of mid-Victorian fiction, of a complicated plot reaching resolution by distribution of marriage partners and property in the final pages, was well adapted to the form.

The standardized cost of a three volume novel was equivalent half the weekly income of a modest, middle-class household.&lt;ref name="David2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deirdre David|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Victorian Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXQXzUbCSygC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64619-2|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost was enough to deter even comparatively well-off members of the public from buying them. Instead, they were borrowed from commercial circulating libraries, the most well known being owned by [[Charles Edward Mudie]].&lt;ref name="victorianweb"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/economics/mudie.html |title=Mudie's Select Library and the Form of Victorian Fiction |date=2001 |access-date=August 11, 2016 |publisher=Victorian Web |last=Landow |first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudie was able to buy novels for stock at round half the retail price - five shilling per volume.&lt;ref name="victorianweb" /&gt; He charged his subscribers one guinea (21 shillings) a year for the right to borrow one volume at a time. A subscriber who wished to borrow three volumes, in order to read the complete novel without having to make two additional trips to the library, had to pay a higher annual fee.&lt;ref name="David2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deirdre David|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Victorian Novel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-49564-7|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their high price meant both publisher and author could make a profit on the comparatively limited sales of such expensive books - three volume novels were typically printed in editions of under 1000 copies, which were often pre-sold to subscription libraries before the book was even published.&lt;ref name="BrantlingerThesing2008-p16" /&gt; It was very unusual for a three-volume novel to sell more than 1000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/costofproduction00inco |title=The cost of production : being specimens of the pages and type in more common use, with estimates of the cost of composition, printing, paper, binding, etc., for the production of a book |last=Incorporated Society of Authors (Great Britain) |publisher=[London] : Printed for the Incoporated Society of Authors |year=1891 |page=17 |oclc=971575827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system encouraged publishers and authors to produce as many novels as possible, due to the almost-guaranteed, but limited, profits that would be made on each.&lt;ref name="BrantlingerThesing2008-p16" /&gt;

The normal three-volume novel was around 900 pages in total at 150–200,000 words; the average length was 168,000 words in 45 chapters. It was common for novelists to have contracts specifying a set number of pages to be filled. If they ran under, they could be made to produce extra, or break the text up into more chapters — each new chapter heading would fill a page. In 1880, the author [[Rhoda Broughton]] was offered £750 by her publisher for her two-volume novel ''Second Thoughts''. However, he offered her £1200 if she could add a third volume.&lt;ref name="David2012" /&gt;

==Other forms of Victorian publication==
Outside of the subscription library system's three-volume novels, the public could access literature in the form of [[partworks]] - the novel was sold in around 20 monthly parts, costing one shilling each. This was a form used for the first publications of many of the works of [[Charles Dickens]], [[Anthony Trollope]] and [[William Thackery]]. Many novels by authors such as [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[George Eliot]] were first published in serial form in weekly and monthly magazines that began to become popular in the middle of the 19th century. Publishers also offered cheap, reprint editions of many works, priced at one to two shillings.&lt;ref name="BrantlingerThesing2008-p17"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrick Brantlinger|author2=William Thesing|title=A Companion to the Victorian Novel|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-99720-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was often a lengthy delay before reprint editions were released. Those who wished to access the latest books had no choice but to borrow three volume editions from a subscription library.&lt;ref name="victorianweb" /&gt; 

The cheapest, popular form of fiction were sometimes referred to pejoratively as [[Penny Dreadful]]s. These were popular with young, working-class men.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite book|last= James |first= Louis |year=1974 |title= Fiction for the Working Man, 1830-50 |location= Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin University Books |isbn= 0-14-060037-X}} p.20&lt;/ref&gt; and often had sensationalist stories featuring, criminals, detectives, pirates or the supernatural.

==20th-century==
Though the era of the three volume novel effectively ended in 1894, works were still on occasion printed in more than one volume in the 20th-century. Two of [[John Cowper Powys]]'s novels, ''[[Wolf Solent]]'' (1929) and ''[[Owen Glendower]]'' (1940) were published, in a two volume edition, by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in the USA.

The ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' is a three-volume novel, rather than a [[trilogy]], as [[Tolkien]] originally intended the work to be the first of a two-work set, the other to be ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.&lt;ref name="tale"&gt;{{cite web |first=Pat |last=Reynolds |url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/tale.html |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text |publisher=The Tolkien Society |accessdate=5 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218100018/http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/tale.html |archivedate=18 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|#126.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For economic reasons ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955.&lt;ref name="tale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A672022|title=The Life and Works for JRR Tolkien|publisher=BBC|date=7 February 2002|accessdate=4 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three volumes were entitled ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'', and ''[[The Return of the King]]''.

Japanese novelist [[Haruki Murakami]] has written several books in this format, such as ''[[The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]]'' and ''[[1Q84]]''. However, many translations of the novel, such as into English, combine the three volumes of these novels into a single book.

'''Touring theatre''' is independent [[theatre]] that travels—often internationally—being presented at a different location in each [[city]].

Touring theatre is produced by a [[theater company]], called the producing entity, often based in one location, and sold, as a show, by a booking agent to presenters. The presenters are responsible for arranging the venue, local crew, and any other considerations needed and specified in the [[rider (theater)|rider]]. The presenter pays a set amount of money to the producing entity, and the producing entity then pays the traveling crew by check or direct deposit. The show could be in for one performance on one day, or for a "sit" of a week or longer. Extended engagements can last six weeks or more.

The contract between the presenter and the producing entity often includes stipulations on ''[[force majeure]]'', labor actions, and schedule of compensations and when each payment is due. It can be split between a pre-[[performance fee]], and a fee paid on the day of the performance, once complete. The contract will often stipulate the venue, venue contact information, and technical contacts. Also, the contract may state a minimum stage size, in order to ensure that the production will occur as envisioned. As with any contract, negotiations are possible, and can mean modifications to the set, staging, or responsibilities to the Presenter.

Riders proscribe the needed support the touring company requires. They include, but are not limited to, local crew staffing, dressing room access, equipment to be provided by the presenter, minimum turn around time between shows, meals, lodging, parking, and [[loading dock]] requirements. The rider is a legal document that is part of the agreement with the presenter and is treated as part of the contract.

Provisions in the rider specify hotel rooms based on "room night", which is 1 person, per room, per night. A theatre company can stretch the use of these room nights by double occupancy, though [[Trade union|union]] and/or contractual agreements with the performers may prohibit this practice for some or all of the touring company.

"'''Venus of the Hardsell'''" is a song from the [[DC Comics]]/[[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comic book series ''[[Hellblazer]]''. The song was written by [[Jamie Delano]] and has since been recorded as a song by the musical group Spiderlegs. The song is notable for being fictionally part of the ''Hellblazer'' stories, and was said to be written by [[John Constantine]] and his band Mucous Membrane.

==Overview==
The lyrics and video for the song were printed in ''Hellblazer Annual 1'', written by [[Jamie Delano]] with art by [[Dean Motter]]. In the story, the song was the only single that Mucous Membrane, [[John Constantine]]'s punk band, ever released. It was written by John Constantine and Gary Lester and released in 1978, by "Snot Music" record label.

It has gained a cult following, and many fan-made recordings were made. In 2006, fans of Hellblazer (including the music group Spiderlegs)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/spiderlegs |title=''Venus of the Hardsell''|accessdate=Dec 21, 2012 |date=Dec 21, 2012 |publisher=Spiderlegs}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a rough version of the song. It is unmixed and unmastered, and the vocals were never properly recorded; nevertheless, it can be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/69402440/Mucous%20Membrane%20-%20Venus%20of%20the%20Hardsell%20%282012%29.mp3]&lt;/ref&gt; The song took another recording with a better quality and was released soon after. Spiderlegs sang the song with a fake accent. Spiderlegs said, "The goal was to try to make something so bad it was good."

==Music style==
[[Jamie Delano]] wrote the lyrics. The setting of the story which the song is written&lt;ref&gt;''Hellblazer Annual 1''&lt;/ref&gt; is in the 1970-80. And so the lyrics is based much on history formed in that era, such as the [[Cold War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. President Nixon and the [[Apollo missions]] were also referenced. But as this being a DC imprint, many of its elements are incorporated, such as a reference of [[Superman]] in the song. The lyrics itself contains elements of [[anarchy]], [[pessimism]], and violence by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insanerantings.com/hell/characters/mm/video.html |title=''Venus of the Hardsell'' lyrics|accessdate=Feb 24, 2013 |date=Feb 24, 2013 |publisher=Straight To Hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
A video was created to accompany the music and was released on [[YouTube]]. The video is composed of layers from ''Hellblazer Annual 1'', with panels from the story including the supposed to be composer John Constantine and the Mucous Membrane, and their concert in The Casanova Club in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].

==Reception==

'''William Bradford''' (April 30, 1823 &amp;ndash; April 25, 1892) was an American romanticist painter, [[photographer]] and [[explorer]], originally from [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], near [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  His early work focused on portraits of the many ships in New Bedford Harbor.  In 1858, his painting ''New Bedford Harbor at Sunset'' was included in [[Albert Bierstadt]]'s landmark New Bedford Art Exhibition.&lt;ref name="Blasdale1990"/&gt;

==Career==
He is known for his paintings of ships and Arctic seascapes. He went on several Arctic expeditions with Dr. [[Isaac Israel Hayes]], and was the first American painter to portray the frozen regions of the north. In 1862, Boston, he was an art teacher to [[Charles Dormon Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Harper1913"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harper|first=Franklin|title=Who's who on the Pacific Coast: a biographical compilation of notable living contemporaries west of the Rocky Mountains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vV4DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483|accessdate=29 January 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1913|publisher=Harper Pub. Co.|pages=483–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
                                                          
With funds provided by [[LeGrand Lockwood]], Bradford traveled to the Arctic aboard the steamship ''Panther'' in 1869, accompanied by photographers John L. Dunmore and George Critcherson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Solbert|editor1-first=Oscar N.|editor2-last=Newhall|editor2-first=Beaumont|editor3-last=Card|editor3-first=James G.|title=The Arctic Regions|journal=Image, Journal of Photography of George Eastman House|date=November 1952|volume=1|issue=8|page=1|url=http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1952_01_08.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House Inc.|location=Rochester, N.Y.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909224010/http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1952_01_08.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Bradford spent two years in London, where he published an account of his trips to the north, entitled ''The Arctic regions, illustrated with photographs taken on an art expedition to Greenland; with descriptive narrative by the artist.''(London, 1873)&lt;ref name="Blasdale1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blasdale|first=Mary Jean|title=Artists of New Bedford:  a Biographical Dictionary|year=1990|publisher=Old Dartmouth Historical Society|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Bradford|title=The Arctic Regions: Illustrated With Photographs Taken on an Art Expedition to Greenland|accessdate=|date=15 May 2013|publisher=David R.

He was associated with the [[Hudson River School]], not an institution but rather an informal group of like-minded painters.  He adopted their techniques and became highly interested in the way light touches water and how it affects the appearance of water surfaces and the general atmospherics of a painting. He compositionally balanced many of his paintings by creating a counter-subject and by placing darker colors around the edges, framing and counteracting the center's better-lit subject.
