[[File:HL Tau protoplanetary disk.jpg|thumb|[[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] image of [[HL Tauri]], a [[protoplanetary disk]] ]]
In [[astrophysics]], '''accretion''' is the accumulation of particles into a massive object by [[gravity|gravitationally]] attracting more matter, typically [[gas]]eous matter, in an [[accretion disk]].&lt;ref name="eso20080808"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters 2010"/&gt; Most [[astronomical object]]s, such as [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[star]]s, and [[planet]]s, are formed by accretion processes.

==Overview==

The accretion model that Earth and the other [[terrestrial planet]]s formed from meteoric material was proposed in 1944 by [[Otto Schmidt]], followed by the ''protoplanet theory'' of [[William McCrea (astronomer)|William McCrea]] (1960) and finally the ''capture theory'' of [[Michael Woolfson]].&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993&gt;{{cite journal|last= Woolfson|first= M.M.|title= Solar System&amp;nbsp;– its origin and evolution|journal= Q. J. R. Astron. Soc.|volume= 34| pages= 1–20|date= 1993|bibcode= 1993QJRAS..34....1W}} For details of Kant's position, see Stephen Palmquist, "Kant's Cosmogony Re-Evaluated", ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' 18:3 (September 1987), pp.255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978 [[Andrew Prentice]] resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the ''modern Laplacian theory''.&lt;ref name=Woolfson1993 /&gt; None of these models proved completely successful, and many of the proposed theories were descriptive. 

The 1944 accretion model by Otto Schmidt was further developed in a quantitative way in 1969 by [[Viktor Safronov]].&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite web |last= Henbest |first= Nigel |url= https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100|title= Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table|publisher= New Scientist|date= 1991|accessdate= 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calculated, in detail, the different stages of terrestrial planet formation.&lt;ref name="Papaloizou 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Safronov1972/&gt; Since then, the theory has been further developed using intensive numerical simulations to study [[planetesimal]] accumulation. It is now accepted that stars form by the gravitational collapse of [[Interstellar medium|interstellar gas]]. Prior to collapse, this gas is mostly in the form of molecular clouds, such as the [[Orion Nebula]]. As the cloud collapses, losing potential energy, it heats up, gaining kinetic energy, and the conservation of [[angular momentum]] ensures that the cloud forms a flatted disk—the [[accretion disk]].

==Accretion of galaxies==
{{further information|Protogalaxy}}

A few hundred thousand years after the [[Big Bang]], the [[Universe]] cooled to the point where atoms could form. As the Universe continued to [[Metric expansion of space|expand]] and cool, the atoms lost enough kinetic energy, and [[dark matter]] coalesced sufficiently, to form [[Protogalaxy|protogalaxies]]. As further accretion occurred, [[galaxy|galaxies]] formed.&lt;ref name="Kereš 2010"/&gt; Indirect evidence is widespread.&lt;ref name="Kereš 2010"/&gt; Galaxies grow through [[Galaxy merger|mergers]] and smooth gas accretion. Accretion also occurs inside galaxies, forming stars.

==Accretion of stars==
{{Main article|Protostar}}

[[File:Ssc2005-02b.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The visible-light (left) and infrared (right) views of the [[Trifid Nebula]], a giant star-forming cloud of gas and dust located {{convert|5400|ly|pc|lk=on}} away in the constellation Sagittarius]]

[[Star]]s are thought to form inside [[molecular cloud|giant clouds]] of cold [[molecular hydrogen]]—[[giant molecular cloud]]s of roughly {{Solar mass|300,000|link=y}} and {{convert|20|pc|ly|order=flip|lk=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Montmerle2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pudritz2002"/&gt; Over millions of years, giant molecular clouds are prone to [[gravitational collapse|collapse]] and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Clark2005"/&gt; These fragments then form small, dense cores, which in turn collapse into stars.&lt;ref name=Pudritz2002 /&gt; The cores range in mass from a fraction to several times that of the Sun and are called protostellar (protosolar) nebulae.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; They possess diameters of {{convert|0.01|-|0.1|pc|AU|sigfig=1|order=flip|lk=on}} and a [[particle number density]] of roughly {{convert|10000|to|100000|/cm3|/cuin|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Compare it with the particle number density of the air at the sea level—{{convert|2.8e19|/cm3|/cuin|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Pudritz2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Motte1998"/&gt;

The initial collapse of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pudritz2002 /&gt; Every nebula begins with a certain amount of [[angular momentum]]. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot [[hydrostatic]] (non-contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum dictates that the rotation of the infalling envelope accelerates, which eventually forms a disk.

[[File:Embedded Outflow in Herbig-Haro object HH 46 47.jpg|thumb|left|Infrared image of the molecular outflow from an otherwise hidden newborn star HH 46/47]]
As the infall of material from the disk continues, the envelope eventually becomes thin and transparent and the [[young stellar object]] (YSO) becomes observable, initially in [[far-infrared]] light and later in the visible.&lt;ref name=Motte1998 /&gt; Around this time the protostar begins to [[nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[deuterium]]. If the protostar is sufficiently massive (above {{Jupiter mass|80|link=y}}), hydrogen fusion follows. Otherwise, if its mass is too low, the object becomes a [[brown dwarf]].&lt;ref name="Stahler1988"/&gt; This birth of a new star occurs approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;years after the collapse begins.&lt;ref name=Montmerle2006 /&gt; Objects at this stage are known as Class I protostars, which are also called young [[T Tauri star]]s, evolved protostars, or young stellar objects. By this time, the forming star has already accreted much of its mass; the total mass of the disk and remaining envelope does not exceed 10–20% of the mass of the central YSO.&lt;ref name=Motte1998 /&gt;

[[File:Accretion Disk Binary System.jpg|thumb|When the lower-mass star in a binary system enters an expansion phase, its outer atmosphere may fall onto the compact star, forming an accretion disk]]

At the next stage, the envelope completely disappears, having been gathered up by the disk, and the protostar becomes a classical T Tauri star.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2005"/&gt;  The latter have accretion disks and continue to accrete hot gas, which manifests itself by strong emission lines in their spectrum. The former do not possess accretion disks. Classical T Tauri stars evolve into weakly lined T Tauri stars.&lt;ref name="Martin1994"/&gt; This happens after about 1&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="Montmerle2006" /&gt; The mass of the disk around a classical T Tauri star is about 1–3% of the stellar mass, and it is accreted at a rate of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; to {{Solar mass|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;}} per year.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1998"/&gt; A pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well. The accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical T Tauri stars: strong [[flux]] in the [[emission line]]s (up to 100% of the intrinsic [[luminosity]] of the star), [[magnetic]] activity, [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] [[variable star|variability]] and jets.&lt;ref name="Muzerolle2001"/&gt; The emission lines actually form as the accreted gas hits the "surface" of the star, which happens around its [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]].&lt;ref name="Muzerolle2001" /&gt; The jets are byproducts of accretion: they carry away excessive angular momentum. The classical T Tauri stage lasts about 10&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref name="Montmerle2006" /&gt;  The disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto the central star, planet formation, ejection by jets, and [[photoevaporation]] by [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the central star and nearby stars.&lt;ref name="Adams2004"/&gt; As a result, the young star becomes a [[Weak-lined T Tauri star|weakly lined T Tauri star]], which, over hundreds of millions of years, evolves into an ordinary Sun-like star, dependent on its initial mass.

==Accretion of planets==
{{further information|Protoplanetary disk}}
[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a [[protoplanetary disk]] showing a young star at its center]]
Self-accretion of [[cosmic dust]] accelerates the growth of the particles into boulder-sized [[planetesimal]]s. The more massive planetesimals accrete some smaller ones, while others shatter in collisions. Accretion disks are common around smaller stars, or stellar remnants in a [[binary star|close binary]], or [[black hole]]s surrounded by material, such as those at the centers of [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Some dynamics in the disk, such as [[dynamical friction]], are necessary to allow orbiting gas to lose [[angular momentum]] and fall onto the central massive object. Occasionally, this can result in [[stellar surface fusion]] (see [[Bondi accretion]]).

In the formation of terrestrial planets or [[planetary core]]s, several stages can be considered. First, when gas and dust grains collide, they agglomerate by microphysical processes like [[van der Waals force]]s and [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic forces]], forming micrometer-sized particles; during this stage, accumulation mechanisms are largely non-gravitational in nature.&lt;ref name="Ward 1996"/&gt;  However, planetesimal formation in the centimeter-to-meter range is not well understood, and no convincing explanation is offered as to why such grains would accumulate rather than simply rebound.&lt;ref name="Ward 1996"/&gt;{{rp|341}} In particular, it is still not clear how these objects grow to become {{convert|0.1|-|1|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} sized planetesimals;&lt;ref name="Papaloizou 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers 2004"/&gt; this problem is known as the "meter size barrier":&lt;ref name="astrobites20150403"/&gt; As dust particles grow by coagulation, they acquire increasingly large relative velocities with respect to other particles in their vicinity, as well as a systematic inward drift velocity, that leads to destructive collisions, and thereby limit the growth of the aggregates to some maximum size.&lt;ref name="Birnstiel2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dust retention in protoplanetary disks |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |last=Birnstiel |first=T. |last2=Dullemond |first2=C. P. |last3=Brauer |first3=F. |volume=503 |number=1 |pages=L5-L8 |date=August 2009 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/200912452 |bibcode=2009A&amp;A...503L...5B |arxiv=0907.0985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward (1996) suggests that when slow moving grains collide, the very low, yet non-zero, gravity of colliding grains impedes their escape.&lt;ref name="Ward 1996"/&gt;{{rp|341}} It is also thought that grain fragmentation plays an important role replenishing small grains and keeping the disk thick, but also in maintaining a relatively high abundance of solids of all sizes.&lt;ref name="Birnstiel2009"/&gt;

A number of mechanisms have been proposed for crossing the 'meter-sized' barrier. Local concentrations of pebbles may form, which then gravitationally collapse into planetesimals the size of large asteroids. These concentrations can occur passively due to the structure of the gas disk, for example, between eddies, at pressure bumps, at the edge of a gap created by a giant planet, or at the boundaries of turbulent regions of the disk.&lt;ref name="Protostars_and Planets_2014" /&gt; Or, the particles may take an active role in their concentration via a feedback mechanism referred to as a [[streaming instability]]. In a streaming instability the interaction between the solids and the gas in the protoplanetary disk results in the growth of local concentrations, as new particles accumulate in the wake of small concentrations, causing them to grow into massive filaments.&lt;ref name="Protostars_and Planets_2014"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Multifaceted Planetesimal Formation Process |title=Protostars and Planets VI |publisher=University of Arizona Press |last1=Johansen |first1=A. |last2=Blum |first2=J. |last3=Tanaka |first3=H. |last4=Ormel |first4=C. |last5=Bizzarro |first5=M. |last6=Rickman |first6=H. |editor1-last=Beuther |editor1-first=H. |editor2-last=Klessen |editor2-first=R.

The low density of these objects allows them to remain strongly coupled with the gas, thereby avoiding high velocity collisions which could result in their erosion or fragmentation.&lt;ref name=Johansen_Jacquet_2015&gt;{{cite book |chapter=New Paradigms For Asteroid Formation |title=Asteroids IV |series=Space Science Series |publisher=University of Arizona Press |last1=Johansen |first1=A. |last2=Jacquet |first2=E. |last3=Cuzzi |first3=J.

Grains eventually stick together to form mountain-size (or larger) bodies called planetesimals.  Collisions and [[Gravity|gravitational interactions]] between planetesimals combine to produce Moon-size planetary embryos ([[protoplanet]]s) over roughly 0.1–1 million years. Finally, the planetary embryos collide to form planets over 10–100 million years.&lt;ref name="Chambers 2004"/&gt; The planetesimals are massive enough that mutual gravitational interactions are significant enough to be taken into account when computing their evolution.&lt;ref name="Papaloizou 2005"/&gt; Growth is aided by orbital decay of smaller bodies due to gas drag, which prevents them from being stranded between orbits of the embryos.&lt;ref name="Weidenschilling1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kary1993"/&gt;  Further collisions and accumulation lead to terrestrial planets or the core of giant planets.

If the planetesimals formed via the gravitational collapse of local concentrations of pebbles their growth into planetary embryos and the cores of giant planets is dominated by the further accretions of pebbles. [[Pebble accretion]] is aided by the gas drag felt by objects as they accelerate toward a massive body. Gas drag slows the pebbles below the escape velocity of the massive body causing them to spiral toward and to be accreted by it. Pebble accretion may accelerate the formation of planets by a factor of 1000 compared to the accretion of planetesimals, allowing giant planets to form before the dissipation of the gas disk.&lt;ref name=Lewin_2015&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/30292-gas-giant-planet-formation-pebbles.html |title=To Build a Gas Giant Planet, Just Add Pebbles |work=Space.com |first=Sarah |last=Lewin |date=19 August 2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lambrechts_Johansen_2012&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid growth of gas-giant cores by pebble accretion |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |last1=Lambrechts |first1=M. |last2=Johansen |first2=A. |volume=544 |page=A32 |date=August 2012 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201219127 |bibcode=2012A&amp;A...544A..32L |arxiv=1205.3030}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, core growth via pebble accretion appears incompatible with the final masses and compositions of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="helled_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Formation of Uranus and Neptune: Challenges and Implications for Intermediate-mass Exoplanets |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first=Ravit |last1=Helled |first2=Peter |last2=Bodenheimer |volume=789 |issue=1 |at=69 |date=July 2014 |arxiv=1404.5018 |bibcode=2014ApJ...789...69H |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of [[terrestrial planet]]s differs from that of giant gas planets, also called [[Jovian planet]]s. The particles that make up the terrestrial planets are made from metal and rock that condense in the inner [[Solar System]]. However, Jovian planets begin as large, icy planetesimals, which then capture hydrogen and helium gas from the [[solar nebula]].&lt;ref name="ddl2011"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Giant Planet Formation |title=Exoplanets |publisher=University of Arizona Press |first1=Gennaro |last1=D'Angelo |first2=Richard H. |last2=Durisen |first3=Jack J. |last3=Lissauer |editor-first=Sara |editor-last=Seager |pages=319–346 |date=December 2010 |isbn=978-0-8165-2945-2 |bibcode=2010exop.book..319D |arxiv=1006.5486}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differentiation between these two classes of planetesimals arise due to the [[frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]] of the solar nebula.&lt;ref name="Bennett2014"/&gt;

==Accretion of asteroids==
[[Image:Chondrules grassland 1.jpg|Chondrules in the chondrite Grassland|200px|thumb|[[Chondrule]]s in a [[chondrite]] meteorite. A millimeter scale is shown.]]

[[Meteorite]]s contain a record of accretion and impacts during all stages of [[asteroid]] origin and evolution; however, the mechanism of asteroid accretion and growth is not well understood.&lt;ref name="asteroids"/&gt; Evidence suggests the main growth of asteroids can result from gas-assisted accretion of [[chondrule]]s, which are millimeter-sized spherules that form as molten (or partially molten) droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids.&lt;ref name="asteroids"/&gt; In the inner Solar System, chondrules appear to have been crucial for initiating accretion.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt; The tiny mass of asteroids may be partly due to inefficient chondrule formation beyond 2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], or less-efficient delivery of chondrules from near the protostar.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt; Also, impacts controlled the formation and destruction of asteroids, and are thought to be a major factor in their geological evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt;

Chondrules, metal grains, and other components likely formed in the [[solar nebula]]. These accreted together to form parent asteroids. Some of these bodies subsequently melted, forming [[Planetary core|metallic cores]] and [[olivine]]-rich [[Mantle (geology)|mantles]]; others were aqueously altered.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt; After the asteroids had cooled, they were eroded by impacts for 4.5 billion years, or disrupted.&lt;ref name="Asteroids III"/&gt;

For accretion to occur, impact velocities must be less than about twice the escape velocity, which is about {{convert|140|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|lk=on}} for a {{convert|100|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} radius asteroid.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt; Simple models for accretion in the [[asteroid belt]] generally assume micrometer-sized dust grains sticking together and settling to the midplane of the nebula to form a dense layer of dust, which, because of gravitational forces, was converted into a disk of kilometer-sized planetesimals. But, several arguments{{Which|date=January 2016}} suggest that asteroids may not have accreted this way.&lt;ref name="Scott 2011"/&gt;

==Accretion of comets==
[[File:Comets Kick up Dust in Helix Nebula (PIA09178).jpg|thumb|The [[Helix Nebula]] has a cometary Oort cloud]]

[[Comet]]s, or their precursors, formed in the outer Solar System, possibly millions of years before planet formation.&lt;ref name="Comets 2015"/&gt; How and when comets formed is debated, with distinct implications for Solar System formation, dynamics, and geology. Three-dimensional computer simulations indicate the major structural features observed on [[Comet nucleus|cometary nuclei]] can be explained by pairwise low velocity accretion of weak cometesimals.&lt;ref name="Cometary accretion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weidenschilling1997b"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Origin of Comets in the Solar Nebula: A Unified Model |journal=Icarus |last=Weidenschilling |first=S.

Astronomers think that comets originate in both the [[Oort cloud]] and the [[scattered disk]].&lt;ref name="Levison2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |chapter=Comet Populations and Cometary Dynamics |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |last1=Levison |first1=Harold F. |first2=Luke |last2=Donnes |editor1-first=Lucy-Ann Adams |editor1-last=McFadden |editor2-first=Paul Robert |editor2-last=Weissman |editor3-first=Torrence V. |editor3-last=Johnson |pages=575–588 |date=2007 |isbn=0-12-088589-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scattered disk was created when [[Neptune]] migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the [[Kuiper belt]] proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disk). Because the scattered disk is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disk is now seen as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.&lt;ref name="Levison2007"/&gt; The classic Oort cloud theory states that the Oort cloud, a sphere measuring about {{convert|50000|AU|pc|abbr=on}} in radius, formed at the same time as the solar nebula and occasionally releases comets into the inner Solar System as a giant planet or star passes nearby and causes gravitational disruptions.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1985"/&gt; Examples of such comet clouds may already have been seen in the [[Helix Nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/events/astrophysics-lunch-12.html |title=Evaporation and Accretion of Extrasolar Comets Following White Dwarf Kicks |publisher=Cornell University Department of Astronomy |date=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' mission]] to comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] determined in 2015 that when Sun's heat penetrates the surface, it triggers evaporation (sublimation) of buried ice. While some of the resulting water vapour may escape from the nucleus, 80% of it recondenses in layers beneath the surface.&lt;ref name="cycling water 2016"/&gt; This observation implies that the thin ice-rich layers exposed close to the surface may be a consequence of cometary activity and evolution, and that global layering does not necessarily occur early in the comet's formation history.&lt;ref name="cycling water 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filacchione2016"/&gt; While most scientists thought that all the evidence indicated that the structure of nuclei of comets is processed [[rubble pile]]s of smaller ice planetesimals of a previous generation,&lt;ref name="Krishna1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics of Comets |series=World Scientific Series in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 2 |publisher=World Scientific |edition=2nd |last=Krishna Swamy |first=K.

[[Piracicaba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], Brazil.]]

'''Alternative fuels''', known as non-conventional and  advanced [[fuel]]s, are any materials or [[Chemical substance|substances]] that can be used as [[fuel]]s, other than conventional fuels like; ''[[fossil fuel]]s'' ([[petroleum]] (oil), [[coal]], and [[natural gas]]), as well as nuclear materials such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], as well as artificial [[radioisotope]] fuels that are made in [[nuclear reactors]].

Some well-known alternative [[fuel]]s include [[biodiesel]], [[bioalcohol]] ([[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[n-Butanol|butanol]]), [[refuse-derived fuel]], chemically stored [[electricity]] (batteries and [[fuel cell]]s), [[hydrogen]], non-fossil [[methane]], non-fossil [[natural gas]], [[Vegetable oil fuel|vegetable oil]], [[propane]] and other [[biomass]] sources.

==Background==
The main purpose of fuel is to store energy, which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use.

Almost all fuels are chemical fuels. The user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work, such as powering an engine. It may also be used to generate electricity, which is then used for heating, lighting, or other purpose.

==Biofuel==
{{Main|Biofuel}}

[[File:Biofuel pumps DCA 07 2010 9834.JPG|thumb|Alternative fuel dispensers at a regular gasoline station in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. [[B20 (biodiesel)|B20]] [[biodiesel]] at the left and [[E85]] [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] at the right.]]
Biofuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels.
Research is ongoing into finding more suitable biofuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage.

===Biomass===
{{Main|Biomass}}
Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead [[biotic material|biological material]] which can be used as fuel or for industrial production.
It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass.[2] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel.

===Algae-based fuels===
{{Main|Algae fuel}}

Algae-based biofuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/ |title= Is Algae Based Biofuel a Great Green Investment Opportunity |publisher=Green World Investor |date= 2010-04-06 |accessdate=2010-07-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100617064204/http://greenworldinvestor.com/2010/06/04/is-algae-based-biofuel-a-great-green-investment-opportunity/| archivedate= 17 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMIX/2010oct00223.html |title= Navy demonstrates alternative fuel in riverine vessel |publisher=Marine Log |date= 2010-10-22 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/technology/blog/science-scope/can-algae-based-plastics-reduce-our-plastic-footprint/1605/ |title= Can algae-based plastics reduce our plastic footprint? |publisher=Smart Planet |date= 2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiesel===

[[Biodiesel]] is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life{{Clarify|date=October 2013}} from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=21|date=2008|publisher=ABDO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol fuels==
{{Main|Alcohol fuel|Butanol fuel|Ethanol fuel|Methanol fuel}}

Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy.  These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels.

==Propane autogas==
{{Main|Autogas}}
[[Propane]] is a cleaner burning, high performance fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family.

Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall. Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/Search_and_Explore/Technologies_and_Fuel_Types/Propane.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/propane.html&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an "intercooler" effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141214141910/http://wlpga.org/glotec/57/265/Direct-Injection-Liquid-Propane |archivedate=2014-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion.

Propane lacks additives, detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil.

Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market.

Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly {{convert|5|bar|psi|abbr=on}} of pressure. Fueling vehicles is similar to gasoline in speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment. Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and does not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to [[compressed natural gas]] which is usually kept at over {{convert|3000|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.

In a vehicle format, propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles.

==Natural gas vehicles==
[[Compressed natural gas]] (CNG) and [[liquified natural gas]] (LNG) are two cleaner combusting alternatives to conventional liquid [[automobile]] fuels.

=== Compressed natural gas fuel types ===
Compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles can use both renewable CNG and non-renewable CNG.&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W.

New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources,  appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |title=Study of Opportunities for natural gas in the transportation sector |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |author=Marbek |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411134857/http://www.cngva.org/media/4302/marbek_ngv_final_report-april_2010.pdf |archive-date=2012-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable natural gas or biogas is a methane‐based gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel.  Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills,  sewage,  and animal/agri‐waste.  Based on the process type,  biogas can be divided into the following:  biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, [[landfill gas]] collected from landfills,  treated to remove trace contaminants, and synthetic natural gas (SNG).&lt;ref name="Frick, Martin, Kay W. Axhausen, Gian Carle, and Alexander Wokaun. 2007 10–22"/&gt;

=== Practicality ===
Around the world, this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles, and just over 150,000 of these are in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Jill|title=Alternative Cars|isbn=978-1-59928-803-1|page=26|date=2008|publisher=ABDO}}&lt;/ref&gt; American usage is growing at a dramatic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/09/17-Pedersen.pdf |title=Association of Taxicab Operators, USA v.

=== Environmental analysis ===
Because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted, cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goyal |first=P |title=Present scenario of air quality in Delhi: a case study of CNG implementation |journal=Atmospheric Environment |date=2003 |url=http://eprint.iitd.ac.in:8080/bitstream/2074/1487/1/goyalpre2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2003.09.005 |volume=37 |pages=5423–5431 |bibcode=2003AtmEn..37.5423G }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tailpipe {{CO2}} can be reduced by 15–25% compared to gasoline, diesel.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236105003303 |title=An experimental investigation of CNG as an alternative fuel for a retrofitted gasoline vehicle |journal=Fuel |first=M.U. |last=Aslam |first2=H.H. |last2=Masjuki |first3=M.A. |last3=Kalam |first4=H. |last4=Abdesselam |first5=T.M.I. |last5=Mahlia |first6=M.A. |last6=Amalina  |volume=85 |issue=5–6 |date=March–April 2006 |pages=717–724 |accessdate=2013-02-19 |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2005.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty, light duty and refuse truck segments.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

'''Similarities to hydrogen '''
Natural gas, like hydrogen, is another fuel that burns cleanly; cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines. Also, none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted.  Hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathai |first=Reji |title=Comparative evaluation of performance, emission, lubricant and deposit characteristics of spark ignition engine fueled with CNG and 18% hydrogen-CNG |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |date=2012 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319912001796 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.01.083 |volume=37 |pages=6893–6900|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear power and radiothermal generators==
{{Main|Nuclear power|radiothermal generator}}

=== Nuclear reactors ===
Nuclear power is any [[nuclear technology]] designed to extract usable energy from [[atomic nuclei]] via controlled [[nuclear reactions]]. The only controlled method now practical uses [[nuclear fission]] in a [[fissile]] fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent [[radioactive decay]]). Use of the nuclear reaction [[nuclear fusion]] for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research.

Nuclear power is usually used by using a [[nuclear reactor]] to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear-powered naval vessels have been built.

In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for [[nuclear propulsion|propulsion]] in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]], are built to minimize moving parts, and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from [[nuclear fission]] has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in [[RORSAT]] military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the [[SNAP-10A]] mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988.

===Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors===

[[Thorium-based nuclear power]] reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at [[NASA]] Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, “After studying [[climate change]] for over four decades, it’s clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace [[fossil fuels]]. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/about/endorsements/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorium]] is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than [[uranium]], and its ore, [[monazite]], is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"&gt;{{cite web|author=International Atomic Energy Agency|title=Thorium fuel cycle — Potential benefits and challenges|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhasz|first1=Albert J.|last2=Rarick|first2=Richard A.|last3=Rangarajan|first3=Rajmohan|title=High Efficiency Nuclear Power Plants Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Technology|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090038711.pdf|website=NASA|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As an alternative to uranium fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces [[radioactive waste]] for [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] like [[technetium-99]] (half-life over 200,000 years),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/thorium2009factsheet.pdf Thorium fuel No panacea for nuclear power]&lt;/ref&gt; and has a longer fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="www-pub.iaea.org"/&gt;

For a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors, see [[thorium fuel cycle#List of thorium fueled reactors]].

=== Radiothermal generators ===
In addition, [[radioisotope]]s have been used as alternative fuels, on both land and in space. Their use on land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. [[Radiothermal generator]]s (RTGs) which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has (in turn) been produced on Earth as a concentrated power source (fuel) using energy from an Earth-based [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space4peace.org/ianus/npsm2.htm |title=Nuclear Powered Space Missions - Past and Future |first=Regina |last=Hagen |publisher=Space4peace.org |date=1998-08-11 |accessdate=2013-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied ecology''' is a subfield within [[ecology]], which considers the [[applied science|application]] of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions.  It is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management.  It is also called ecological or environmental technology.  Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.

The '''architecture of Mesopotamia''' is ancient architecture of the region of the Tigris–Euphrates river system (also known as [[Mesopotamia]]), encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC, when the first permanent structures were built, to the 6th century BC. Among the Mesopotamian architectural accomplishments are the development of [[urban planning]], the [[courtyard house]], and [[ziggurat]]s. No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty.

==Building materials==
Sumerian masonry was usually mortarless although [[bitumen]] was sometimes used. Brick styles, which varied greatly over time, are categorized by period.&lt;ref&gt;Harmansah, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

*Patzen 80×40×15&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Riemchen 16×16&amp;nbsp;cm: Late [[Uruk period]] (3600&amp;ndash;3200 BC)
*Plano-convex 10x19x34 cm: [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]] (3100&amp;ndash;2300 BC)

The favored design was rounded bricks, which are somewhat unstable, so Mesopotamian bricklayers would lay a row of bricks perpendicular to the rest every few rows. The advantages to plano-convex bricks were the speed of manufacture as well as the irregular surface which held the finishing plaster coat better than a smooth surface from other brick types.

Bricks were sun baked to harden them. These types of bricks are much less durable than oven-baked ones so buildings eventually deteriorated. They were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This planned structural life cycle gradually raised the level of cities, so that they came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resulting mounds are known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]s, and are found throughout the ancient Near East. Civic buildings slowed decay by using cones of colored stone, terracotta panels, and [[clay nail]]s driven into the adobe-brick to create a protective sheath that decorated the façade. Specially prized were imported building materials such as cedar from [[Lebanon]], [[diorite]] from [[Arabia]], and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[India]].

Babylonian temples are massive structures of crude brick, supported by [[buttress]]es, the rain being carried off by drains. One such drain at [[Ur]] was made of lead. The use of brick led to the early development of the [[pilaster]] and column, and of [[fresco]]es and enamelled tiles. The walls were brilliantly colored, and sometimes plated with [[zinc]] or gold, as well as with tiles. Painted ''[[terra-cotta]]'' cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster. Assyria, imitating Babylonian architecture, also built its palaces and temples of brick, even when stone was the natural building material of the country&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; faithfully preserving the brick platform, necessary in the marshy soil of Babylonia, but little needed in the north.

[[File:Human headed winged bull facing.jpg|thumb|right|An Assyrian [[lamassu]], [[Bas-relief]] c. 713–716 BC]]
As time went on, however, later Assyrian architects began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influence, and to use stone as well as brick. The walls of Assyrian palaces were lined with sculptured and coloured slabs of stone, instead of being painted as in [[Chaldea]]. Three stages may be traced in the art of these ''bas-reliefs'': it is vigorous but simple under [[Ashurnasirpal II]], careful and realistic under [[Sargon II]], and refined but wanting in boldness under [[Ashurbanipal]].

In Babylonia, in place of the ''bas relief'', there is greater use of three-dimensional figures in the round&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; the earliest examples being the statues from [[Girsu]], that are realistic if somewhat clumsy. The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious, and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting. Two seal-cylinders from the age of [[Sargon of Akkad]] are among the best examples of their kind. One of the first remarkable specimens of early [[metallurgy]] to be discovered by archaeologists is the silver vase of [[Entemena]]. At a later epoch, great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as earrings and bracelets of gold. Copper, too, was worked with skill; indeed, it is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working.

The people were famous at an early date for their embroideries and rugs. The forms of Assyrian pottery are graceful; the porcelain, like the glass discovered in the palaces of [[Nineveh]], was derived from Egyptian models. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of Sargon. Stone, clay and glass were used to make vases, and vases of hard stone have been dug up at Girsu similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt.

The study of ancient Mesopotamian architecture is based on available [[archaeological]] evidence, pictorial representation of buildings, and texts on building practices. According to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive pictograms of the [[Uruk period]] era suggest that "Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. ... Demons were feared who had wings like a bird, and the foundation stones&amp;nbsp;– or rather bricks&amp;nbsp;– of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them."&lt;ref name="Sayce"&gt;[[Archibald Sayce|Sayce, Rev. A. H.]], Professor of Assyriology, Oxford, [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologyofcun00sayc/archaeologyofcun00sayc_djvu.txt "The Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions"], Second Edition-revised, 1908, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London, Brighton, New York; at pages 98–100 [https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcun00sayc Not in copyright]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly literature usually concentrates on the architecture of temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sally|last=Dunham|chapter=Ancient Near Eastern architecture|title=A Companion to the Ancient Near East|editor=Daniel Snell|location=Oxford|publisher=Blackwell|year=2005|pages=266–280|isbn=0-631-23293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.

==Urban planning==
{{Main|Urban history}}
The Sumerians were the first society to construct the city itself as a built form. They were proud of this achievement as attested in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] which opens with a description of [[Uruk]]—its walls, streets, markets, temples, and gardens. Uruk itself is significant as the center of an urban culture which both colonized and urbanized western Asia.

The construction of cities was the end product of trends which began in the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. The growth of the city was partly planned and partly organic. Planning is evident in the walls, high temple district, main canal with harbor, and main street. The finer structure of residential and commercial spaces is the reaction of economic forces to the spatial limits imposed by the planned areas resulting in an irregular design with regular features. Because the Sumerians recorded real estate transactions it is possible to reconstruct much of the urban growth pattern, density, property value, and other metrics from cuneiform text sources.

The typical city divided space into residential, mixed use, commercial, and civic spaces. The residential areas were grouped by profession.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 2004, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the city was a high temple complex always sited slightly off of the geographical center. This high temple usually predated the founding of the city and was the nucleus around which the urban form grew. The districts adjacent to gates had a special religious and economic function.

The city always included a belt of irrigated agricultural land including small hamlets. A network of roads and canals connected the city to this land. The transportation network was organized in three tiers: wide processional streets (Akkadian:''sūqu ilāni u šarri''), public through streets (Akkadian:''sūqu nišī''), and private blind alleys (Akkadian:''mūṣû''). The public streets that defined a block varied little over time while the blind-alleys were much more fluid. The current estimate is 10% of the city area was streets and 90% buildings.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"&gt;Baker, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The canals; however, were more important than roads for good transportation.

==Houses==
The materials used to build a Mesopotamian house were similar but not exact as those used today: mud brick, mud plaster and wooden doors, which were all naturally available around the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nicholas Postgate, J N Postgate|title=Early Mesopotamia: Society and Economy at the Dawn of History|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; although wood was not common in some cities of Sumer. Most houses had a square center room with other rooms attached to it, but a great variation in the size and materials used to build the houses suggest they were built by the inhabitants themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/282/5393/1442 |title=The first cities: Why Settle Down?

Residential design was a direct development from [[Ubaid house]]s. Although Sumerian [[cylinder seal]]s depict [[Mudhif|reed house]]s, the [[courtyard house]] was the predominant typology, which has been used in Mesopotamia to the present day. This house called ''[[É (temple)|é]]'' ([[Cuneiform]]: {{cuneiform|&amp;#x1208D;}}, {{transl|Xsux|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; {{lang-akk|bītu}}) faced inward toward an open courtyard which provided a cooling effect by creating convection currents. This courtyard called ''tarbaṣu'' (Akkadian) was the primary organizing feature of the house, all the rooms opened into it. The external walls were featureless with only a single opening connecting the house to the street. Movement between the house and street required a 90° turn through a small antechamber. From the street only the rear wall of the antechamber would be visible through an open door, likewise there was no view of the street from the courtyard. The Sumerians had a strict division of public and private spaces. The typical size for a Sumerian house was 90 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baker, 2009"/&gt;

==Palace==
The [[palace]] came into existence during the Early Dynastic I period. From a rather modest beginning the palace grows in size and complexity as power is increasingly centralized. The palace is called a 'Big House' (Cuneiform: E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.GAL Sumerian e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-gal Akkdian: ''ekallu'') where the [[lugal]] or [[Ensí|ensi]] lived and worked.

The palaces of the early Mesopotamian elites were large-scale complexes, and were often lavishly decorated. Earliest known examples are from the [[Diyala River]] valley sites such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar. These third millennium BC palaces functioned as large-scale socio-economic institutions, and therefore, along with residential and private functions, they housed craftsmen workshops, food storehouses, ceremonial courtyards, and are often associated with shrines. For instance, the so-called "giparu" (or Gig-Par-Ku in Sumerian) at Ur where the Moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]'s priestesses resided was a major complex with multiple courtyards, a number of sanctuaries, burial chambers for dead priestesses, and a ceremonial banquet hall. A similarly complex example of a Mesopotamian palace was excavated at [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]], dating from the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] period.

Assyrian palaces of the Iron Age, especially at Kalhu/[[Nimrud]], Dur Sharrukin/[[Khorsabad]] and Ninuwa/[[Nineveh]], have become famous due to the [[Assyrian palace reliefs]], extensive pictorial and textual narrative programs on their walls, all carved on stone slabs known as [[orthostat]]s. These pictorial programs either incorporated cultic scenes or the narrative accounts of the kings' military and civic accomplishments. Gates and important passageways were flanked with massive stone sculptures of apotropaic mythological figures, ''[[lamassu]]'' and [[winged genie]]s. The architectural arrangement of these Iron Age palaces were also organized around large and small courtyards. Usually the king's throne room opened to a massive ceremonial courtyard where important state councils met and state ceremonies were performed.

Massive amounts of [[Nimrud Ivories|ivory furniture pieces]] were found in some Assyrian palaces pointing to an intense trade relationship with North Syrian [[Neo-Hittite]] states at the time. Bronze repousse bands decorated the wooden gates of major buildings, but were mostly looted at the fall of the empire; the [[Balawat Gates]] are the principal survivors.

==Temples==
{{see|É (temple)}}
Temples often predated the creation of the urban settlement and grew from small one room structures to elaborate multiacre complexes across the 2,500 years of Sumerian history. Sumerian temples, fortifications, and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[wiktionary:recess|recesses]], and [[Column|half column]]s. Chronologically, Sumerian temples evolved from earlier [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] temples. As the temple decayed it was ritually destroyed and a new temple built on its foundations. The successor temple was larger and more articulated than its predecessor temple. The evolution of the [[É (temple)|E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.abzu]] temple at [[Eridu]] is a frequently cited case-study of this process. Many temples had inscriptions engraved into them, such as the one at [[Tell Uqair]]. Palaces and city walls came much later after temples in the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer|Early Dynastic Period]].

The form of a Sumerian temple is manifestation of Near Eastern [[cosmology]], which described the world as a disc of land which was surrounded by a salt water ocean, both of which floated on another sea of fresh water called [[apsu]], above them was a hemispherical firmament which regulated time. A world mountain formed an [[axis mundi]] that joined all three layers. The role of the temple was to act as that axis mundi, a meeting place between gods and men.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, 1983 p205-208&lt;/ref&gt; The sacredness of 'high places' as a meeting point between realms is a pre-Ubaid belief well attested in the Near East back the Neolithic age. The plan of the temple was rectangular with the corners pointing in cardinal directions to symbolize the four rivers which flow from the mountain to the four world regions. The orientation also serves a more practical purpose of using the temple roof as an observatory for Sumerian timekeeping. The temple was built on a low terrace of [[rammed earth]] meant to represent the sacred mound of primordial land which emerged from the water called dukug, 'pure mound' (Sumerian: du&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-ku&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Cuneiform:) during creation.

The doors of the long axis were the entry point for the gods, and the doors of the short axis the entry point for men. This configuration was called the bent axis approach, as anyone entering would make a ninety degree turn to face the cult statue at the end of the central hall. The bent axis approach is an innovation from the Ubaid temples which had a linear axis approach, and is also a feature of Sumerian houses. An offering table was located in the center of the temple at the intersection of the axes.

Temples of the Uruk Period divided the temple rectangle into tripartite, T-shaped, or combined plans. The tripartite plan inherited from the Ubaid had a large central hall with two smaller flanking halls on either side. The entry was along the short axis and the shrine was at the end of the long axis. The T-shaped plan, also from the Ubaid period, was identical to the tripartite plan except for a hall at one end of the rectangle perpendicular to the main hall. Temple C from the Eanna district of [[Uruk]] is a case-study of classical temple form.

There was an explosion of diversity in temple design during the following Early Dynastic Period. The temples still retained features such as cardinal orientation, rectangular plans, and buttresses. Now however they took on a variety new configurations including courtyards, walls, basins, and barracks. The [[É (temple)|Sin Temple]] in [[Khafajah]] is typical of this era, as it was designed around a series of courtyards leading to a [[cella]].

The high temple was a special type of temple that was home to the patron god of the city. Functionally, it served as a storage and distribution center as well as housing the priesthood. The [[É (temple)|White Temple]] of [[Anu]] in [[Uruk]] is typical of a high temple which was built very high on a platform of adobe-brick. In the Early Dynastic period high temples began to include a [[ziggurat]], a series of platforms creating a stepped pyramid. Such ziggurats may have been the inspiration for the Biblical [[Tower of Babel]].

===Ziggurats===

[[Ziggurat]]s were huge pyramidal temple towers which were first built in Sumerian City-States and then developed in Babylonia and Assyrian cities as well. There are 32 ziggurats known at, or near, Mesopotamia&amp;mdash;28 in [[Iraq]] and 4 in [[Iran]]. Notable ziggurats include the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]] near [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq, the [[Ziggurat of Aqar Quf]] near [[Baghdad]], Iraq, [[Chogha Zanbil]] in [[Khūzestān Province|Khūzestān]], Iran (the most recent to be discovered), and the [[Tappeh Sialk|Sialk]] near [[Kashan]], Iran. Ziggurats were built by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Elam]]ites, and [[Assyria]]ns as monuments to local religions. The earliest examples of the ziggurat were raised platforms that date from the [[Ubaid period]]&lt;ref name="Crawford, page 73"&gt;Crawford, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; during the fourth [[millennium]] BC, and the latest date from the 6th century BC. The top of the ziggurat was flat, unlike many pyramids. The step pyramid style began near the end of the Early Dynastic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, pp. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Built in receding tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a [[pyramid]]al structure. Sun-baked bricks made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had [[astrology|astrological]] significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven, with a shrine or temple at the summit. Access to the shrine was provided by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit. It has been suggested that ziggurats were built to resemble mountains, but there is little textual or archaeological evidence to support that hypothesis.

Classical ziggurats emerged in the Neo-Sumerian Period with articulated buttresses, vitreous brick sheathing, and [[entasis]] in the elevation. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best example of this style. Another change in temple design in this period was a straight as opposed to bent-axis approach to the temple.

Ur-Nammu's ziggurat at Ur was designed as a three-stage construction, but today only two of these survive. This entire mudbrick core structure was originally given a facing of baked brick envelope set in [[bitumen]], 2.5&amp;nbsp;m on the first lowest stage, and 1.15&amp;nbsp;m on the second. Each of these baked bricks were stamped with the name of the king. The sloping walls of the stages were buttressed. The access to the top was by means of a triple monumental staircase, which all converges at a portal that opened on a landing between the first and second stages. The height of the first stage was about 11&amp;nbsp;m while the second stage rose some 5.7&amp;nbsp;m. Usually, a third stage is reconstructed by the excavator of the ziggurat ([[Leonard Woolley]]), and crowned by a temple. At the C[[Dur-Untash|hogha Zanbil]] ziggurat, archaeologists have found massive reed ropes that ran across the core of the ziggurat structure and tied together the mudbrick mass.

The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at [[Uruk]] from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer#Early Dynastic period|Early Dynastic]] period sites in the [[Diyala River]] valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] remains at [[Nippur]] (Sanctuary of [[Enlil]]) and [[Ur]] (Sanctuary of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]), Middle [[Bronze Age]] remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Alalakh]], [[Aleppo]] and [[Kultepe]], Late Bronze Age palaces at [[Bogazkoy]] (Hattusha), [[Ugarit]], [[Ashur]] and [[Nuzi]], Iron Age palaces and temples at [[Assyria]]n ([[Kalhu]]/Nimrud, [[Khorsabad]], [[Nineveh]]), [[Babylonia]]n ([[Babylon]]), [[Urartian]] ([[Tushpa]]/Van, [[Haykaberd]], Ayanis, [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]], [[Bastam]]) and [[Neo-Hittite]] sites ([[Carchemish|Karkamis]], [[Tell Halaf]], [[Karatepe]]). Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur. Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the [[Iron Age]].

==Design of Assyrian buildings, fortifications and temples==
[[File:Mesopotamia male worshiper 2750-2600 B.C.jpg|thumb|[[Tell Asmar]] "Standing man" votive sculpture 2750-2600 B.C]]
The plans of all the Assyrian buildings are rectangular, and we know that long ago, as now, the Eastern architects used this outline almost invariably, and upon it reared some of the most lovely and varied forms ever devised. They gather over the angles by graceful curves, and on the basis of an ordinary square hall carry up a minaret or a dome, an octagon or a circle. That this was sometimes done in Assyria is shown by the sculptures. Slabs from [[Kouyunjik]] show domes of varied form, and tower-like structures, each rising from a square base. The resemblance between the ancient form of the dome and those still used in the Assyrian villages is very striking. Whether sloping roofs were used is uncertain. Mr. Bonomi believes that they were, and a few sculptures seem to support his view. Of the private houses nothing, of course, remains; but they are represented on the slabs as being of several stories in height, the ground floor as usual having only a door and no windows. All have flat roofs, and we gather from one of the bas-reliefs, which represents a town on fire, that these roofs were made, just as they now are, with thick layers of earth on strong beams. These roofs are well-nigh fireproof, and the flames are represented as stopped by them, and coming out of the windows. No remains of a window, or, so far as we are aware, of an internal staircase, have been found.

Of the fortifications we know much more. In the north wall of Nimroud fifty-eight towers have been traced, and at [[Kouyunjik]] there are large remains of three walls, the lower part being of stone, and the upper of sun-dried bricks. At [[Khorsabad]] there are the remains of a wall, still {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, built of blocks of stone 3 to {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick, and the evidences wanting as to finishing of these is completely supplied by the sculptures, which show an extraordinary resemblance to medieval works of the same class. Tier upon tier of walls are represented, enclosing a great tower or keep in the centre. The entrances are great arched gateways flanked by square towers. These and the other towers have overhanging parapets just like the mediaeval machicolations, and are finished at top with battlements, remains of which have been found at [[Kalhu|Nimrud]] and [[Kouyunjik]], and at [[Assur]], the capital of Assyria before Nineveh.

Of temples distinct from the palace we have a few supposed remains, but little is absolutely known as to their general form.

But in Chaldea there are some enormous masses of ruins, evidently remains of the vast mounds which formed the substructure of their temples. The grandest of all these and the most interesting is the temple of [[Nabu|Nabû]] at [[Borsippa]] (now Birs Nimrod), near [[Babylon]], which has been identified as the temple of the Seven Spheres. This was reconstructed by Nebuchadnezzar, as appears by a well-known inscription. Another example is at [[Ur|Mugheir]], which was {{convert|198|ft|m}} by {{convert|133|ft|m}} at the base, and is even now {{convert|70|ft|m}} high, and it is clear that both it and the Birs were built with diminishing stages, presenting a series of grand platforms, decreasing in length as they ascended, and leaving a comparatively small one at top for the temple cell. This has been found, it is supposed, at the Birs Nimroud, of vitrified brick made in ancient ovens.

==Landscape architecture==
Text sources indicate open space planning was a part of the city from the earliest times. The description of [[Uruk]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' tells of one third of that city set aside for orchards. Similar planned open space is found at the one fifth enclosure of [[Nippur]]. Another important landscape element was the vacant lot (Akkadian: ''kišubbû'').

External to the city, Sumerian irrigation agriculture created some of the first garden forms in history. The garden (sar) was 144 square cubits with a perimeter canal.&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, [[Sumer]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the enclosed quadrangle was the basis for the later paradise gardens of [[Persia]].

In Mesopotamia, the use of [[fountain]]s date as far back as the 3rd millennium BC. An early example is preserved in a carved [[Babylonia]]n basin, dating back to ''circa'' 3000 B.C., found at [[Girsu]], [[Lagash]]. An ancient Assyrian fountain "discovered in the gorge of the Comel River consists of basins cut in solid rock and descending in steps to the stream." The water was led from small [[Channel (geography)|conduit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=fountain|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain|accessdate=2010-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100502072841/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/214794/fountain| archivedate= 2 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Attack of the Killer App'''" is the third episode of the [[Futurama (season 6)|sixth season]]&lt;!-- Please do not change. Production order, not airing order, is used here. --&gt; of the American animated sitcom ''[[Futurama]]''. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on July 1, 2010. The episode focuses on the release of the new eyePhone, resulting in [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] posting a [[viral video]] of [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] on the Internet. [[Craig Ferguson]], host of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', guest stars as Leela's singing [[boil]], Susan.

==Plot==
The episode opens with the Planet Express crew recycling their old electronics. [[Hubert J. Farnsworth]] announces that they will be delivering all the Earth’s [[e-waste]] to the Third World of the [[Antares]] system. After dropping them off, they decide it would be better to keep using their old electronics. This changes when they see a commercial for MomCorp’s new [[iPhone|eyePhone]]. The crew all buy eyePhones, which feature a wide variety of applications, including the [[Twitter|Twitcher]] application. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] and [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] get into a competition to get the most followers, wagering a dollar and stating that the loser must jump into a tub of two-headed alien goat vomit and diarrhea.

Meanwhile, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] reveals to her sons that the eyePhones allow her to direct market to the users, based on what they post on Twitcher. She also reveals her evil plan wherein the “twit worm” will be transmitted as soon as someone has one million followers. The twit worm will work as a virus infecting the human brain and making people into mindless zombies that follow her every whim.

Fry decides he needs to have more interesting twits in order to beat Bender. He soon discovers that [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] has a boil, named Susan, which sings show tunes. Fry shares video of the boil on his eyePhone, in spite of his promise not to. The video is a hit and Leela is ridiculed wherever she goes. Fry and Bender both reach one million followers simultaneously and Mom transmits the twit worm to all of their followers, including [[Hermes Conrad]], [[Amy Wong]] and Pro. Farnsworth.

Leela discovers that her humiliation is old news and that a new video has everyone’s attention. She forgives Fry and he reveals to her that he posted a video of himself completing the loser’s side of the bet in order to make up for the humiliation he caused her. Meanwhile, Mom's virus activates turning Fry and Bender's followers to zombies who get in line to buy the eyePhone 2.0 while Mom looks on satisfied.

==Continuity==
Bender's good twin [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Flexo|Flexo]] makes a brief cameo in one of the recycling bins.&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; The cell phone [[Amy (Futurama)|Amy]] throws away before getting an eyePhone is the same as in "[[Amazon Women in the Mood]]". The chairs at the pizza restaurant are the same ones the Cygnoids had in "[[A Leela of Her Own]]".

==Cultural references==
Most of the episode focuses on parodies of the [[iPhone]] and [[Twitter]], renamed the eyePhone and Twitcher respectively.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html |title=Futurama: "Attack of the Killer App" Review |author=Canning, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2010-06-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704042349/http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1103550p1.html| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyePhone is placed directly in the eye, hence the name ''eye''Phone.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

In the original American broadcast, "Attack of the Killer App" was viewed by an estimated 2.159 million households receiving a 1.3 rating/2% share in the [[Nielsen ratings]] and 1.1 rating/4% share in the 18-49 demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051 |title=Thursday Cable Ratings: USA’s Royal Pains &amp; Burn Notice lead Thursday cable pack; Bethenny Lags Futurama |author=Seidman, Robert |date=July 2, 2010 |work=TVbythenumbers |accessdate=2010-07-04 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100704143202/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/02/thursday-cable-ratings-usas-royal-pains-bethenny-lags-futurama/56051| archivedate= 4 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Canning of [[IGN]] in his review gave the episode an 8.5 calling it "Great" and also stated in his review ""Attack of the Killer App" had more than enough great laughs to outweigh this weak bit", in reference to the Susan Boyle joke. He also praised the references to iPhone and Twitter jokes.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Zack Helden gave the episode a B saying "This was funny, generally, and I'm glad the series hasn't lost its teeth. It's just, I miss the writers' habit of biting off just a little more than they could chew."&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; He also found the Susan Boyle jokes to be "mean-spirited" but clever and so "bizarre that it worked".&lt;ref name="a.v.club"/&gt; Darren Franich of [[Entertainment Weekly|EW]] Popwatch said the episode was "as good as anything the show produced in its prime" particularly commenting on the speed of the episode and the precision of its satire. He also noted that the episode benefited from good timing, coming right on the heels of recent iPad and iPhone releases which kept the episode from feeling "outdated".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/ |title='Futurama' has returned: Well, IS it still good? |first=Darren |last=Franich |date=July 2, 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100705101625/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/02/futurama-has-returned-well-is-it-still-good/| archivedate= 5 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Gandert of [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] rated the episode a 7.1.

'''CALIPSO''' is a joint [[NASA]] (USA) and [[CNES]] (France) environmental satellite, built in the [[Cannes Mandelieu Space Center]], which was launched atop a [[Delta II]] rocket on April 28, 2006.  Its name stands for '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations'''.

Passive and active remote sensing Instruments on board the CALIPSO satellite monitor aerosols and clouds 24 hours a day. CALIPSO is part of the "[[A-train (satellite)|A Train]]", flying in formation with several other satellites ([[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]], [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] and [[CloudSat]]).

==Mission==
Three instruments:
* '''Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)''' - a [[lidar]] that provides high-resolution vertical profiles of [[aerosol]]s and [[cloud]]s.
* '''Wide Field Camera (WFC)''' - a modified version of the commercial off-the-shelf [[Ball Aerospace]] [http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=104 CT-633] [[star tracker camera]]. It was selected to match band 1 of the [[MODIS]] instrument on the Aqua satellite.
* '''Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR)''' - used to detect [[cirrus cloud]] emissivity and particle size. The CALIOP laser beam is aligned with the center of the IIR image to optimize joint CALIOP/IIR observations.

In February 2009, CALIPSO switched over to the redundant laser as scheduled. The primary laser achieved its mission goal of three years of successful operation, and the redundant laser has been performing beyond expectations.

The CALIPSO mission was granted extended mission status in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |title=CALIPSO - INSTRUMENT UPDATE |publisher=NASA LARC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316180550/http://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/ |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kontakt Spannungsoptik.JPG|290px|thumb|Stresses in a contact area loaded simultaneously with a normal and a tangential force. Stresses were made visible using [[photoelasticity]].]]

'''Contact mechanics''' is the study of the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[solids]] that touch each other at one or more points.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson, K. L, 1985, '''Contact mechanics''', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Popov&gt;Popov, Valentin L., 2010,  ''Contact Mechanics and Friction. Physical Principles and Applications'', Springer-Verlag, 362 p., {{ISBN|978-3-642-10802-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A central distinction in contact mechanics is between [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] acting [[perpendicular]] to the contacting bodies' surfaces (known as the [[normal vector|normal direction]]) and [[friction]]al stresses acting [[Tangential and normal components|tangentially]] between the surfaces. This page focuses mainly on the normal direction, i.e. on frictionless contact mechanics. [[Frictional contact mechanics]] is discussed separately.  Normal stresses are caused by applied forces and by the [[adhesion]] present on surfaces in close contact even if they are clean and dry.

Contact mechanics is part of mechanical [[engineering]].  The physical and mathematical formulation of the subject is built upon the [[mechanics of materials]] and [[continuum mechanics]] and focuses on computations involving [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]], and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]] bodies in [[Statics|static]] or [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamic]] contact. Contact mechanics provides necessary information for the safe and energy efficient design of technical systems and for the study of [[tribology]], [[normal contact stiffness|contact stiffness]], [[Contact resistance|electrical contact resistance]] and [[indentation hardness]]. Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, [[coupling]] devices, [[Brake|braking]] systems, [[tire]]s, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engines]], [[Linkage (mechanical)|mechanical linkage]]s, [[gasket]] seals, [[metalworking]], metal forming, [[ultrasonic welding]], [[Electrical connector|electrical contacts]], and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include [[stress analysis]] of contact and coupling members and the influence of [[lubrication]] and material [[design]] on [[friction]] and [[wear]]. Applications of contact mechanics further extend into the [[Microtechnology|micro]]- and [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] realm.

The original work in contact mechanics dates back to 1882 with the publication of the paper "On the contact of elastic solids"&lt;ref&gt;H. Hertz, Über die berührung fester elastischer Körper (On the contact of rigid elastic solids). In: ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924012500306 Miscellaneous Papers]''. Jones and Schott, Editors, ''J. reine und angewandte Mathematik'' 92, Macmillan, London (1896), p. 156 English translation: Hertz, H.&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=251917 "Ueber die Berührung fester elastischer Körper"]) by [[Heinrich Hertz]]. Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked [[lens (optics)|lenses]] might change with the [[force]] holding them together. Hertzian contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the imposed loads. This amount of deformation is dependent on the [[modulus of elasticity]] of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress as a function of the normal contact force, the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies. Hertzian contact stress forms the foundation for the equations for load bearing capabilities and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] life in bearings, gears, and any other bodies where two surfaces are in contact.

== History ==
[[File:Hertz contact animated.gif|290px|thumb|widthpx|When a sphere is pressed against an elastic material, the contact area increases.]]
Classical contact mechanics is most notably associated with Heinrich Hertz.&lt;ref name=Hertz&gt;Hertz, H. R., 1882, ''Ueber die Beruehrung elastischer Koerper (On Contact Between Elastic Bodies),'' in '''Gesammelte Werke''' (Collected Works), Vol. 1, Leipzig, Germany, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Hertz solved the contact problem of two elastic bodies with curved surfaces. This still-relevant classical solution provides a foundation for modern problems in contact mechanics. For example, in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[tribology]], ''Hertzian contact stress'' is a description of the stress within mating parts. The Hertzian contact stress usually refers to the stress close to the area of contact between two spheres of different radii.

It was not until nearly one hundred years later that [[Kenneth L. Johnson|Johnson]], Kendall, and Roberts found a similar solution for the case of [[Adhesion|adhesive]] contact.&lt;ref name=jkr&gt;K. L. Johnson and K. Kendall and A. D. Roberts, Surface energy and the contact of elastic solids, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 324 (1971) 301-313&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory was rejected by [[Boris Derjaguin]] and co-workers&lt;ref name=Maugis&gt;D. Maugis, Contact, Adhesion and Rupture of Elastic Solids, Springer-Verlag, Solid-State Sciences, Berlin 2000, {{ISBN|3-540-66113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed a different theory of adhesion&lt;ref name=DMT&gt;Derjaguin, BV and Muller, VM and Toporov, Y.P., 1975, ''Effect of contact deformations on the adhesion of particles'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 53(2), pp. 314-326&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s. The Derjaguin model came to be known as the DMT (after Derjaguin, Muller and Toporov) model,&lt;ref name=DMT/&gt; and the Johnson et al. model came to be known as the JKR (after Johnson, Kendall and Roberts) model for adhesive elastic contact. This rejection proved to be instrumental in the development of the Tabor&lt;ref name=Tabor&gt;D. Tabor, The hardness of solids, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 58 (1977) 145-179&lt;/ref&gt; and later Maugis&lt;ref name=Maugis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maugis1&gt;D. Maugis, Adhesion of spheres: The JKR-DMT transition using a Dugdale model, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 150 (1992) 243--269&lt;/ref&gt; parameters that quantify which contact model (of the JKR and DMT models) represent adhesive contact better for specific materials.

Further advancement in the field of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as [[Frank Philip Bowden|Bowden]] and [[David Tabor|Tabor]]. Bowden and Tabor were the first to emphasize the importance of surface roughness for bodies in contact.&lt;ref name=bowden1939&gt;, Bowden, FP and Tabor, D., 1939, ''The area of contact between stationary and between moving surfaces'', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, 169(938), pp. 391--413.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bowden2001&gt;Bowden, F.P. and Tabor, D., 2001, '''The friction and lubrication of solids''', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Through investigation of the surface roughness, the true contact area between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent contact area. Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in tribology. The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.

The contributions of Archard (1957)&lt;ref name=archard1957&gt;Archard, JF, 1957, ''Elastic deformation and the laws of friction'',  Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, 243(1233), pp.190--205.&lt;/ref&gt; must also be mentioned in discussion of pioneering works in this field. Archard concluded that, even for rough elastic surfaces, the contact area is approximately proportional to the [[normal force]]. Further important insights along these lines were provided by Greenwood and Williamson (1966),&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, JA and Williamson, JBP., 1966, ''Contact of nominally flat surfaces'', Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, pp. 300-319.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Bush, AW and Gibson, RD and Thomas, TR., 1975, ''The elastic contact of a rough surface'', Wear, 35(1), pp. 87-111.&lt;/ref&gt; and Persson (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Persson, BNJ and Bucher, F. and Chiaia, B., 2002, ''Elastic contact between randomly rough surfaces: Comparison of theory with numerical results'', Physical Review B, 65(18), p. 184106.&lt;/ref&gt; The main findings of these works were that the true contact surface in rough materials is generally proportional to the normal force, while the parameters of individual micro-contacts (i.e., pressure, size of the micro-contact) are only weakly dependent upon the load.

== Classical solutions for non-adhesive elastic contact ==
The theory of contact between elastic bodies can be used to find contact areas and indentation depths for simple geometries.  Some commonly used solutions are listed below.  The theory used to compute these solutions is discussed later in the article.

=== Contact between a sphere and a half-space ===
[[File:Contact sphere-plane.jpg|thumb|Contact of an elastic sphere with an elastic half-space]]
An elastic [[sphere]] of [[radius]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; indents an elastic [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] to depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and thus creates a contact area of radius 
:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{Rd}&lt;/math&gt; 
The applied force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is related to the displacement &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; by&lt;ref name ="contmech"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D. A. H.| last2=Gan| first2=Y.| last3=Einav| first3=I.| title= Contact mechanics of fractal surfaces by spline assisted discretisation| journal= International Journal of Solids and Structures| year=2015| volume=59| pages=121–131| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020768315000323| doi=10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2015.01.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  F=\tfrac{4}{3} E^*R^{1/2}d^{3/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{1}{E^*}=\frac{1-\nu^2_1}{E_1}+\frac{1-\nu^2_2}{E_2}
&lt;/math&gt;
and  &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elastic modulus|elastic moduli]] and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\nu_2&lt;/math&gt; the [[Poisson's ratio]]s associated with each body.

The distribution of normal pressure in the contact area as a function of distance from the center of the circle is&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  p(r) = p_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum contact pressure given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   p_0 = \cfrac{3F}{2\pi a^2} = \cfrac{1}{\pi}\left(\cfrac{6F{E^*}^2}{R^2}\right)^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The radius of the circle is related to the applied load &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by the equation
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3 F R}{4 E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The depth of indentation &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is related to the maximum contact pressure by
:&lt;math&gt;
   d = \cfrac{a^2}{R} = \left(\cfrac{9F^2}{16{E^*}^2R}\right)^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The maximum shear stress occurs in the interior at &lt;math&gt;z\approx 0.49a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\nu = 0.33&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Contact between two spheres ===
[[File:Kontakt Kugel Kugel.jpg|120px|thumb|Contact between two spheres.]]
[[File:Kontakt gekreuzter Zylinder.jpg|thumb|Contact between two crossed cylinders of equal radius.]]
For contact between two spheres of radii &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, the area of contact is a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. The equations are the same as for a sphere in contact with a half plane except that the effective radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref name="contmech"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

===Contact between two crossed cylinders of equal radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;===
This is equivalent to contact between a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].

=== Contact between a rigid cylinder with flat-ended and an elastic half-space ===
[[File:Kontakt Zylindrischer Indenter Ebene.jpg|thumb|Contact between a rigid cylindrical indenter and an elastic half-space.]]

If a rigid [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] is pressed into an elastic half-space, it creates a pressure distribution described by&lt;ref name=Sneddon&gt;Sneddon, I. N., 1965, ''The Relation between Load and Penetration in the Axisymmetric Boussinesq Problem for a Punch of Arbitrary Profile.'' Int. J. Eng. Sci. v. 3, pp. 47–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r)=p_0\left(1-\frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-1/2}
  &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the cylinder and
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_0=\frac{1}{\pi}E^*\frac{d}{a}
&lt;/math&gt;
The relationship between the indentation depth and the normal force is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  F=2aE^*d\,
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Contact between a rigid conical indenter and an elastic half-space===
[[File:Kontakt Kegel Ebene.jpg|thumb|Contact between a rigid conical indenter and an elastic half-space.]]
In the case of [[Indentation hardness|indentation]] of an elastic half-space of Young's modulus &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; using a rigid [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] indenter, the depth of the contact region &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and contact radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are related by&lt;ref name=Sneddon/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \epsilon=a\tan\theta
    &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; defined as the angle between the plane and the side surface of the cone.  The total indentation depth &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is given by:&lt;math&gt;
d=\frac{\pi}{2}\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

The total force is
:&lt;math&gt;
  F =\frac{\pi E}{2 \left(1-\nu^2\right)} a^2 \tan \theta=\frac{2E}{\pi\left(1-\nu^2\right)}\frac{d^2}{\tan \theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure distribution is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  p {\left( r \right)}=\frac{Ed}{\pi a\left(1-\nu^2\right)}\ln\left(\frac{a}{r}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)^2-1}\right)
= \frac{Ed}{\pi a\left(1-\nu^2\right)} \cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{r}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
The stress has a [[logarithm]]ic [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the tip of the cone.

===Contact between two cylinders with parallel axes===
[[File:Kontakt paralleler Zylinder.jpg|thumb|Contact between two cylinders with parallel axes]]
In contact between two cylinders with parallel axes, the force is linearly proportional to the length of cylinders ''L'' and to the indentation depth ''d'':&lt;ref name=Popov4&gt;Popov, V.L., "Contact Mechanics and Friction: Physical Principles and Applications"&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  F\approx\frac{\pi}{4}E^*Ld
&lt;/math&gt;
The radii of curvature are entirely absent from this relationship. The contact radius is described through the usual relationship
:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{Rd}
&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
as in contact between two spheres. The maximum pressure is equal to
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_0=\left(\frac{E^*F}{\pi LR}\right)^{1/2}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bearing contact ===

{{main|Bearing pressure}}

The contact in the case of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] is often a contact between a convex surface (male cylinder or sphere) and a concave surface (female cylinder or sphere: [[Boring (manufacturing)|bore]] or [[Spherical bearing|hemispherical cup]]).

=== The Method of Dimensionality Reduction ===
[[File:WikipediabilderKap 4.jpg|thumb|Contact between a sphere and an elastic half-space and one-dimensional replaced model.]]
Some contact problems can be solved with the Method of Dimensionality Reduction (MDR).
In this method, the initial three-dimensional system is replaced with a contact of a body with a linear elastic or viscoelastic foundation (see Fig). The properties of one-dimensional systems coincide exactly with those of the original three-dimensional system, if the form of the bodies is modified and the elements of the foundation are defined according to the rules of the MDR.
&lt;ref name=Popov2&gt;Popov, V.L., ''Method of reduction of dimensionality in contact and friction mechanics: A linkage between micro and macro scales,'' Friction, 2013, v.1, N. 1, pp.41–62.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Popov3&gt;Popov, V.L. and Heß, M., '''Methode der Dimensionsreduktion in Kontaktmechanik und Reibung''', Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, for exact analytical results, it is required that the contact problem is axisymmetric and the contacts are compact.

== Hertzian theory of non-adhesive elastic contact ==
The classical theory of contact focused primarily on non-adhesive contact where no tension force is allowed to occur within the contact area, i.e., contacting bodies can be separated without adhesion forces.  Several analytical and numerical approaches have been used to solve contact problems that satisfy the no-adhesion condition.  Complex forces and [[moment (physics)|moments]] are transmitted between the bodies where they touch, so problems in contact mechanics can become quite sophisticated.  In addition, the contact stresses are usually a nonlinear function of the deformation.  To simplify the solution procedure, a [[frame of reference]] is usually defined in which the objects (possibly in motion relative to one another) are static. They interact through surface tractions (or pressures/stresses) at their interface.

As an example, consider two objects which meet at some surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;)-plane with the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis assumed normal to the surface. One of the bodies will experience a normally-directed [[pressure]] distribution &lt;math&gt;p_z=p(x,y)=q_z(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and in-plane [[surface traction]] distributions &lt;math&gt;q_x=q_x(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_y=q_y(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; over the region &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In terms of a [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] force balance, the forces:
:&lt;math&gt;
  P_z = \int_S p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ Q_x = \int_S q_x(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ Q_y = \int_S q_y(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A
 &lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to the forces established in the other body. The moments corresponding to these forces:
:&lt;math&gt;
  M_x = \int_S y~p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ M_y = \int_S x~p(x,y)~ \mathrm{d}A ~;~~ M_z = \int_S [x~q_y(x,y) - y~q_x(x,y)]~ \mathrm{d}A
  &lt;/math&gt;
are also required to cancel between bodies so that they are [[kinematics|kinematically]] immobile.

=== Assumptions in Hertzian theory===
The following assumptions are made in determining the solutions of '''Hertzian''' contact problems:
* The strains are small and within the elastic limit.
* The surfaces are continuous and non-conforming (implying that the area of contact is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the contacting bodies).
* Each body can be considered an elastic half-space.
* The surfaces are frictionless.
Additional complications arise when some or all these assumptions are violated and such contact problems are usually called '''non-Hertzian'''.

=== Analytical solution techniques ===
[[File:Hertz.svg|right|thumb|290px|Contact between two spheres.]]
Analytical solution methods for non-adhesive contact problem can be classified into two types based on the geometry of the area of contact.&lt;ref name=Shigley&gt;Shigley, J.E., Mischke, C.R., 1989, '''Mechanical Engineering Design''', Fifth Edition, Chapter 2, McGraw-Hill, Inc, 1989, {{ISBN|0-07-056899-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''conforming contact''' is one in which the two bodies touch at multiple points before any deformation takes place (i.e., they just "fit together").  A '''non-conforming contact''' is one in which the shapes of the bodies are dissimilar enough that, under zero load, they only touch at a point (or possibly along a line). In the non-conforming case, the contact area is small compared to the sizes of the objects and the [[stress (physics)|stresses]] are highly concentrated in this area. Such a contact is called ''concentrated'', otherwise it is called ''diversified''.

A common approach in [[linear elasticity]] is to [[Superposition principle|superpose]] a number of solutions each of which corresponds to a point load acting over the area of contact.  For example, in the case of loading of a [[half-plane]], the [[Flamant solution]] is often used as a starting point and then generalized to various shapes of the area of contact.  The force and moment balances between the two bodies in contact act as additional constraints to the solution.

==== Point contact on a (2D) half-plane ====
{{Main|Flamant solution}}
[[File:Point contact fig.svg|thumb|right|290px|Schematic of the loading on a plane by force P at a point (0,0).]]
A starting point for solving contact problems is to understand the effect of a "point-load" applied to an isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic half-plane, shown in the figure to the right. The problem may be either [[plane stress]] or [[plane strain]]. This is a [[boundary value problem]] of linear elasticity subject to the traction [[boundary condition]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xz} (x,0)=0 ~;~~ \sigma_z (x,z)=-P\delta (x,z)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta(x,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]].  The boundary conditions state that there are no shear stresses on the surface and a singular normal force P is applied at (0,0). Applying these conditions to the governing equations of elasticity produces the result
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{x^2z}{(x^2+z^2)^2} \\
  \sigma_{zz} &amp;=-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{z^3}{(x^2+z^2)^2} \\
  \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2P}{\pi}\frac{xz^2}{(x^2+z^2)^2}
  \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
for some point, &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, in the half-plane. The circle shown in the figure indicates a surface on which the maximum shear stress is constant. From this stress field, the [[strain (materials science)|strain]] components and thus the [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacements]] of all material points may be determined.

==== Line contact on a (2D) half-plane ====

===== Normal loading over a region &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;=====
Suppose, rather than a point load &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, a distributed load &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is applied to the surface instead, over the range &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of linear superposition can be applied to determine the resulting stress field as the solution to the [[integral]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2z}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')(x-x')^2\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} ~;~~
    \sigma_{zz} =-\frac{2z^3}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} \\
    \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2z^2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{p(x')(x-x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2}
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

===== Shear loading over a region &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;=====
The same principle applies for loading on the surface in the plane of the surface. These kinds of tractions would tend to arise as a result of friction. The solution is similar the above (for both singular loads &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and distributed loads &lt;math&gt;q(x)&lt;/math&gt;) but altered slightly:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \sigma_{xx} &amp; =-\frac{2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')^3\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} ~;~~
    \sigma_{zz} =-\frac{2z^2}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2} \\
    \sigma_{xz} &amp; =-\frac{2z}{\pi}\int_a^b\frac{q(x')(x-x')^2\, dx'}{[(x-x')^2+z^2]^2}
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
These results may themselves be superposed onto those given above for normal loading to deal with more complex loads.

====  Point contact on a (3D) half-space ====
Analogously to the Flamant solution for the 2D half-plane, fundamental solutions are known for the linearly elastic 3D half-space as well. These were found by [[Joseph Valentin Boussinesq|Boussinesq]] for a concentrated normal load and by Cerruti for a tangential load. See the section on this in [[Linear elasticity#Solutions for elastostatic cases|Linear elasticity]].

=== Numerical solution techniques ===
Distinctions between conforming and non-conforming contact do not have to be made when numerical solution schemes are employed to solve contact problems. These methods do not rely on further assumptions within the solution process since they base solely on the general formulation of the underlying equations
&lt;ref name=Kalker&gt;Kalker, J.J. 1990, ''Three-Dimensional Elastic Bodies in Rolling Contact''. (Kluwer Academic Publishers: Dordrecht).&lt;/ref&gt;

.&lt;ref name=Popov1&gt;Popov, Valentin L., 2009, ''Kontaktmechanik und Reibung. Ein Lehr- und Anwendungsbuch von der Nanotribologie bis zur numerischen Simulation'', Springer-Verlag, 328 S., {{ISBN|978-3-540-88836-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the standard equations describing the deformation and motion of bodies two additional inequalities can be formulated. The first simply restricts the motion and deformation of the bodies by the assumption that no penetration can occur. Hence the gap &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; between two bodies can only be positive or zero
:&lt;math&gt;h \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h = 0&lt;/math&gt; denotes contact. The second assumption in contact mechanics is related to the fact, that no tension force is allowed to occur within the contact area (contacting bodies can be lifted up without adhesion forces). This leads to an inequality which the stresses have to obey at the contact interface. It is formulated for the normal stress  &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n  = \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

At locations where there is contact between the surfaces the gap is zero, i.e. &lt;math&gt;h = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, and there the normal stress is different than zero, indeed, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. At locations where the surfaces are not in contact the normal stress is identical to zero; &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, while the gap is positive, i.e., &lt;math&gt;h &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This type of complementarity formulation can be expressed in the so-called [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Kuhn–Tucker]] form, viz.
:&lt;math&gt;h \ge 0\,, \quad \sigma_n \le 0\,, \quad \sigma_n\,h = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;
These conditions are valid in a general way. The mathematical formulation of the gap depends upon the kinematics of the underlying theory of the solid (e.g., linear or nonlinear solid in two- or three dimensions, [[beam theory|beam]] or [[plate theory|shell]] model). By restating the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_n &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the contact pressure, &lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;p=-\sigma_n &lt;/math&gt;the Kuhn-Tucker problem can be restated as in standard complementarity form, i.e.&lt;math display="block"&gt;h \ge 0\,, \quad p \ge 0\,, \quad p\,h = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;In the linear elastic case the gap can be formulated as &lt;math display="block"&gt;{h} = h_0+{g} + u, &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;h_0 &lt;/math&gt;is the rigid body separation, &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the geometry/topography of the contact (cylinder and roughness) and &lt;math&gt;u &lt;/math&gt; is the elastic deformation/deflection. If the contacting bodies are approximated as linear elastic half spaces, the Boussinesq-Cerruti integral equation solution can be applied to express the deformation (&lt;math&gt;u &lt;/math&gt;) as a function of the contact pressure (&lt;math&gt;p &lt;/math&gt;), i.e.,&lt;math display="block"&gt;u=\int_\infty^\infty K(x-s)p(s)ds,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="block"&gt;K(x-s) = \frac{2}{\pi E^*}\ln|x-s|&lt;/math&gt;for line loading of an elastic half space and&lt;math display="block"&gt;K(x-s) = \frac{1}{\pi E^*}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x_1-s_1)^2+(x_2-s_2)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;for point loading of an elastic half-space.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

After discretization the linear elastic contact mechanics problem can be stated in standard Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719000|title=The Linear Complementarity Problem|last=Cottle|first=R.|last2=Pang|first2=J.|last3=Stone|first3=R.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|isbn=9780898716863|series=Classics in Applied Mathematics|doi=10.1137/1.9780898719000}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{c}
  \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{h_0 + g + Cp}, \\

 \end{array} &lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a matrix, whose elements are so called influence coefficients relating the contact pressure and the deformation. The strict LCP formulation of the CM problem presented above, allows for direct application of well-established numerical solution techniques such as [[Lemke's algorithm|Lemke's pivoting algorithm]]. The Lemke algorithm has the advantage that it finds the numerically exact solution within a finite number of iterations. The MATLAB implementation presented by [http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/41485-a-pivoting-algorithm-solving-linear-complementarity-problems Almqvist et al.] is one example that can be employed to solve the problem numerically. In addition, an example code for an LCP solution of a 2D linear elastic contact mechanics problem has also been made public at MATLAB file exchange by [http://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/43216-an-lcp-solution-of-the-linear-elastic-contact-mechanics-problem Almqvist et al.]

== Contact between rough surfaces ==
When two bodies with rough surfaces are pressed into each other, the true contact area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than the apparent contact area &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;. The mechanics of contacting rough surfaces are discussed in terms of normal contact mechanics and static frictional interactions. Natural and engineering surfaces typically exhibit roughness features, known as asperities, across a broad range of length scales down to the molecular level, with surface structures exhibiting self affinity, also known as [[fractal|surface fractality]]. It is recognized that the self affine structure of surfaces is the origin of the linear scaling of true contact area with applied pressure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; Assuming a model of shearing welded contacts, this linearity between contact area and pressure can also be considered the origin of the  linearity of the relationship between static friction and applied normal force.

In contact between a "random rough" surface and an elastic half-space, the true contact area is related to the normal force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; by&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mikic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hyun&gt;Hyun, S., and M.O. Robbins, 2007, ''Elastic contact between rough surfaces: Effect of roughness at large and small wavelengths.'' Tribology International, v.40, pp. 1413-1422.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   A=\frac{\kappa}{E^*h'}F
 &lt;/math&gt;
with  &lt;math&gt;h'&lt;/math&gt;  equal to the root mean square (also known as the quadratic mean) of the surface slope and &lt;math&gt;\kappa \approx2&lt;/math&gt; . The median pressure in the true contact surface
:&lt;math&gt;
  p_{\mathrm{av}} =\frac{F}{A}\approx\frac{1}{2}E^*h'
 &lt;/math&gt;
can be reasonably estimated as half of the effective elastic modulus &lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; multiplied with the root mean square of the surface slope &lt;math&gt;h'&lt;/math&gt; .

== An overview of the GW model ==
Greenwood and Williamson in 1966 (GW)&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; proposed a theory of elastic 
contact mechanics of rough surfaces which is today the foundation of many theories 
in tribology (friction, adhesion, thermal and electrical conductance, wear, etc.).
They considered the contact between a smooth rigid plane and a nominally flat 
deformable rough surface covered with round tip asperities of the same radius R.
Their theory assumes that the deformation of each asperity is independent of that of its neighbours and is described by the Hertz model.
The heights of asperities have a random distribution. The probability that asperity height
is between &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z + dz&lt;/math&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\phi(z)dz&lt;/math&gt;.
The authors calculated the number of contact spots n, the total contact area 
&lt;math&gt;A_r&lt;/math&gt; and the total load P in general case. They gave those formulas in two forms: in the basic and using standardized variables.
If one assumes that N asperities covers a rough surface, then the expected number of contacts is

:&lt;math&gt;
n=N\int_d^\infty \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

The expected total area of contact can be calculated  from the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a=N\pi R \int_d^\infty (z-d) \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

and the expected total force is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{4}{3}N E_r \sqrt{R} \int_d^\infty (z-d)^{3/2} \phi(z) dz
&lt;/math&gt;

where: R - radius of curvature of the microasperity,
z - height of the microasperity measured from the profile line,
d - close the surface,
&lt;math&gt;E_r=(\frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1}+\frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; - composite Young’s modulus of elasticity,
&lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; - modulus of elasticity of the surface,
&lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt; - Poisson's surface coefficients.

They introduced standardized separation  
&lt;math&gt;h=d/\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and  standardized height distribution &lt;math&gt;\phi^*(s)&lt;/math&gt;
whose standard deviation is equal to one. Below are presented the formulas in the standardized form.

:&lt;math&gt;
F_n(h)=\int_h^\infty (s-h)^n \phi^*(s) ds
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
n=\eta A_n F_0(h)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a=\pi \eta A R \sigma F_1(h)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{4}{3} \eta A E_r \sqrt{R} \sigma^{3/2} F_{3/2}(h) 
&lt;/math&gt;

where: d is the separation, 
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the nominal contact area,
&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the surface density of asperities,
&lt;math&gt;E^*&lt;/math&gt; is the effective Young modulus.

Recently the exact approximants to &lt;math&gt;A_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; were published by Jedynak&lt;ref name=Jedynak&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301679X18304493] Jedynak, R., (2019), ''Exact and approximate solutions of the infinite integrals of the asperity height distribution for the Greenwood-Williamson and the Greenwood-Tripp asperity contact models'', Tribology International, 130, pp. 206-215.&lt;/ref&gt;. They are given by the following rational formulas, which are very exact approximants to integrals &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt;. They are calculated for the Gaussian distribution of asperities

&lt;/math&gt; 

The maximum relative error is &lt;math&gt;1.91*10^{-7}% &lt;/math&gt;. The paper&lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt; also contains the exact expressions for &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt;
F_1(h)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi }} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}h^2\right)-\frac{1}{2} h\,

&lt;/math&gt;

where erfc(z) means the complementary error function and &lt;math&gt;K_{\nu}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.

For the situation where the asperities on the two surfaces have a Gaussian height distribution and the peaks can be assumed to be spherical,&lt;ref name=Greenwood&gt;Greenwood, J. A. and Williamson, J. B. P., (1966), ''Contact of nominally flat surfaces,'' Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, vol. 295, pp. 300--319.&lt;/ref&gt; the average contact pressure is sufficient to cause yield when &lt;math&gt; p_{\mathrm{av}} = 1.1\sigma_y \approx 0.39 \sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; is the uniaxial [[yield stress]] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the indentation hardness.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;  Greenwood and Williamson&lt;ref name=Greenwood/&gt; defined a dimensionless parameter &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; called the '''plasticity index''' that could be used to determine whether contact would be elastic or plastic.

The Greenwood-Williamson model requires knowledge of two statistically dependent quantities; the standard deviation of the surface roughness and the curvature of the asperity peaks.  An alternative definition of the plasticity index has been given by Mikic.&lt;ref name=Mikic&gt;Mikic, B. B., (1974), ''Thermal contact conductance; theoretical considerations'', International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 17(2), pp. 205-214.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yield occurs when the pressure is greater than the uniaxial yield stress.  Since the yield stress is proportional to the indentation hardness &lt;math&gt;\sigma _0&lt;/math&gt;, Mikic defined the plasticity index for elastic-plastic contact to be
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \frac{E^*h'}{\sigma _0}&gt; \tfrac{2}{3}~.&lt;/math&gt;
In this definition &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the micro-roughness in a state of complete plasticity and only one statistical quantity, the rms slope, is needed which can be calculated from surface measurements. For &lt;math&gt;\Psi &lt;\tfrac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, the surface behaves elastically during contact.

In both the Greenwood-Williamson and Mikic models the load is assumed to be proportional to the deformed area.  Hence, whether the system behaves plastically or elastically is independent of the applied normal force.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

== An overview of the GT model ==

The model proposed by Greenwood and Tripp (GT),&lt;ref name=Greenwood1&gt;Greenwood, J. A. and Tripp, J.H., (1970-71), The contact of two nominally flat rough surfaces,'' Proc. Instn Mech. Engrs., vol. 185, pp. 625--634.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the GW model to contact between two rough surfaces. The GT model is widely used in the field of elastohydrodynamic analysis.

The most frequently cited equations given by the GT model are for the asperity contact area

:&lt;math&gt;
A_a =\pi ^2( {\eta \beta \sigma } )^2AF_2 (\lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

and load carried by asperities 

:&lt;math&gt;
P =\frac{8\sqrt 2 }{15}\pi ( {\eta \beta \sigma } )^2\sqrt{\frac{\sigma }{\beta }} E' AF_{5/2}(\lambda),
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt; \eta   \beta  \sigma &lt;/math&gt; - roughness parameter,
&lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; - nominal contact area,
&lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; - Stribeck oil film parameter, first defined by 
Stribeck \cite{gt} as &lt;math&gt; \lambda = h/ \sigma &lt;/math&gt;,  
&lt;math&gt; E' &lt;/math&gt; - effective elastic modulus,
&lt;math&gt; F_2, F_{5/2}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; - statistical functions introduced
to match the assumed Gaussian distribution of asperities.

The exact solutions for &lt;math&gt;A_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are firstly presented by Jedynak &lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt;. They are expressed by &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; as follows

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{2}=\frac{1}{2}  (h^2+1)\text{erfc}\left(\frac{h}{\sqrt{2}}\right)-\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 \pi }}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
F_{5/2}=\frac{1}{8 \sqrt{\pi }}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{4}\right) h^{3/2} \left( (2 h^2+3)
 K_{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{h^2}{4}\right)- (2 h^2+5) K_{\frac{1}{4}}\left(\frac{h^2}{4}\right)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where erfc(z) means the complementary error function and &lt;math&gt;K_{\nu}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.  

In paper &lt;ref name=Jedynak/&gt; one can find comprehensive review of existing approximants to &lt;math&gt;F_{5/2}&lt;/math&gt;. New proposals give the most accurate approximants to &lt;math&gt;F_{5/2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;,  which are reported in the literature. They are given by the following rational formulas, which are very exact approximants to integrals &lt;math&gt;F_n(h)&lt;/math&gt;. They are calculated for the Gaussian distribution of asperities

:&lt;math&gt; 
F_{n}(h)= \frac{a_0+a_1 h+a_2 h^2+a_3 h^3}{1+b_1 h+b_2 h^2+b_3 h^3+b_4 h^4+b_5 h^5+b_6 h^6}\exp\left(-\frac{h^2}{2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt; 

For &lt;math&gt;F_2(h)&lt;/math&gt; the coefficients are

:&lt;math&gt; 
[a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3]=[0.5, 0.182536384941, 0.039812283118, 0.003684879001]

== Adhesive contact between elastic bodies==
When two solid surfaces are brought into close proximity, they experience attractive [[van der Waals force]]s.  Bradley's van der Waals model&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, RS., 1932, ''The cohesive force between solid surfaces and the surface energy of solids'', Philosophical Magazine Series 7, 13(86), pp. 853--862.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a means of calculating the tensile force between two rigid spheres with perfectly smooth surfaces.  The Hertzian model of contact does not consider adhesion possible.  However, in the late 1960s, several contradictions were observed when the Hertz theory was compared with experiments involving contact between rubber and glass spheres.

It was observed&lt;ref name=jkr/&gt; that, though Hertz theory applied at large loads, at low loads
* the area of contact was larger than that predicted by Hertz theory,
* the area of contact had a non-zero value even when the load was removed, and
* there was strong adhesion if the contacting surfaces were clean and dry.
This indicated that adhesive forces were at work.  The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) models were the first to incorporate adhesion into Hertzian contact.

=== Bradley model of rigid contact ===
It is commonly assumed that the surface force between two atomic planes at a distance &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; from each other can be derived from the [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. With this assumption
:&lt;math&gt;
   F(z) = \cfrac{16\gamma}{3 z_0}\left[\left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-9} - \left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-3}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the force (positive in compression), &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the total surface energy of ''both'' surfaces per unit area, and &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium separation of the two atomic planes.

The Bradley model applied the Lennard-Jones potential to find the force of adhesion between two rigid spheres. The total force between the spheres is found to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_a(z) = \cfrac{16\gamma\pi R}{3}\left[\cfrac{1}{4}\left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-8} - \left(\cfrac{z}{z_0}\right)^{-2}\right] ~;~~  \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_1,R_2&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the two spheres.

The two spheres separate completely when the ''pull-off force'' is achieved at &lt;math&gt;z = z_0&lt;/math&gt; at which point
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_a = F_c = -4\gamma\pi R .
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model of elastic contact===
[[File:JKRModel.svg|400px|thumb|Schematic of contact area for the JKR model.]]
[[File:JKR-full-cycle.gif|thumb|right|JKR test with a rigid bead on a deformable planar material: complete cycle]]
To incorporate the effect of adhesion in Hertzian contact, Johnson, Kendall, and [[Alan D. Roberts (physicist)|Roberts]]&lt;ref name=jkr/&gt; formulated the JKR theory of adhesive contact using a balance between the stored [[elastic energy]] and the loss in [[surface energy]].  The JKR model considers the effect of contact pressure and adhesion only inside the area of contact. The general solution for the pressure distribution in the contact area in the JKR model is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p(r) = p_0\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2} + p_0'\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note that in the original Hertz theory, the term containing &lt;math&gt;p_0'&lt;/math&gt; was neglected on the ground that tension could not be sustained in the contact zone.  For contact between two spheres
:&lt;math&gt;
   p_0 = \cfrac{2 a E^*}{\pi R} ~;~~
   p_0' = -\left(\cfrac{4\gamma E^*}{\pi a}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the area of contact, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the applied force, &lt;math&gt;2\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the total surface energy of '''both''' surfaces per unit contact area,
&lt;math&gt;R_i, E_i, \nu_i,~~i=1,2&lt;/math&gt; are the radii, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratios of the two spheres, and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} ~;~~ \frac{1}{E^*} = \frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The approach distance between the two spheres is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   d = \cfrac{\pi a}{2 E^*}(p_0 + 2p_0') = \cfrac{a^2}{R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The Hertz equation for the area of contact between two spheres, modified to take into account the surface energy, has the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 6\gamma\pi R + \sqrt{12\gamma\pi R F + (6\gamma\pi R)^2}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
When the surface energy is zero, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the Hertz equation for contact between two spheres is recovered.  When the applied load is zero, the contact radius is
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\gamma\pi}{E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The tensile load at which the spheres are separated, i.e., &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, is predicted to be
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -3\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
This force is also called the '''pull-off force'''.
Note that this force is independent of the moduli of the two spheres.  However, there is another possible solution for the value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; at this load.  This is the critical contact area &lt;math&gt;a_c&lt;/math&gt;, given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   a_c^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\gamma\pi}{4E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we define the '''work of adhesion''' as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Delta\gamma = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2 - \gamma_{12}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1,\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; are the adhesive energies of the two surfaces and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is an interaction term, we can write the JKR contact radius as
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 3\Delta\gamma\pi R + \sqrt{6\Delta\gamma\pi R F + (3\Delta\gamma\pi R)^2}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The tensile load at separation is
:&lt;math&gt;
   F = -\cfrac{3}{2}\Delta\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the critical contact radius is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   a_c^3 = \cfrac{9R^2\Delta\gamma\pi}{8E^*}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The critical depth of penetration is
:&lt;math&gt;
   d_c = \cfrac{a_c^2}{R} = \left(\cfrac{9}{4}\right)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}(\Delta\gamma)^{\tfrac{2}{3}}\left(\cfrac{\pi^{\tfrac{2}{3}}~R^{\tfrac{1}{3}}}{{E^*}^{\tfrac{2}{3}}}\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model of elastic contact ===
The Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model&lt;ref name=DMT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muller, VM and Derjaguin, BV and Toporov, Y.P., 1983, ''On two methods of calculation of the force of sticking of an elastic sphere to a rigid plane'', Colloids and Surfaces, 7(3), pp. 251-259.&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative model for adhesive contact which assumes that the contact profile remains the same as in Hertzian contact but with additional attractive interactions outside the area of contact.

The radius of contact between two spheres from DMT theory is
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 4\gamma\pi R\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the pull-off force is
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -4\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;
When the pull-off force is achieved the contact area becomes zero and there is no singularity in the contact stresses at the edge of the contact area.

In terms of the work of adhesion &lt;math&gt;\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   a^3 = \cfrac{3R}{4E^*}\left(F + 2\Delta\gamma\pi R\right)
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   F_c = -2\Delta\gamma\pi R\,
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Tabor parameter ===
In 1977, Tabor&lt;ref name=Tabor1&gt;Tabor, D., 1977, ''Surface forces and surface interactions'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 58(1), pp. 2-13.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the apparent contradiction between the JKR and DMT theories could be resolved by noting that the two theories were the extreme limits of a single theory parametrized by the '''Tabor parameter''' (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mu := \cfrac{d_c}{z_0} \approx \left[\cfrac{R(\Delta\gamma)^2}{{E^*}^2 z_0^3}\right]^{1/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium separation between the two surfaces in contact.  The JKR theory applies to large, compliant spheres for which &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is large.  The DMT theory applies for small, stiff spheres with small values of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Subsequently, Derjaguin and his collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Muller V M, Yuschenko V S &amp; Derjaguin B V.,1980, "On the influence of molecular forces on the deformation of an elastic sphere and its sticking to a rigid plane", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 77 pp. 91-101.&lt;/ref&gt; by applying Bradley's surface force law to an elastic half space, confirmed that as the Tabor parameter increases, the pull-off force falls from the Bradley value &lt;math&gt; 2\pi R\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to the JKR value &lt;math&gt; (3/2)\pi R\Delta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. More detailed calculations were later done by Greenwood &lt;ref&gt;Greenwood J A.,1997, "Adhesion of elastic spheres", Proceedings of the Royal Society, 453 pp. 1277-1297.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the S-shaped load/approach curve which explains the jumping-on effect. A more efficient method of doing the calculations and additional results were given by Feng &lt;ref&gt;Feng J Q.,2000, "Contact behaviour of spherical elastic particles", Colloids and Surfaces A, 172 pp. 175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maugis-Dugdale model of elastic contact===
[[File:MaugisDugdale.svg|400px|thumb|Schematic of contact area for the Maugis-Dugdale model.]]
Further improvement to the Tabor idea was provided by Maugis&lt;ref name=Maugis1/&gt; who represented the surface force in terms of a Dugdale [[cohesive zone]] approximation such that the work of adhesion is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Delta\gamma = \sigma_0~h_0
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum force predicted by the Lennard-Jones potential and &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum separation obtained by matching the areas under the Dugdale and Lennard-Jones curves (see adjacent figure).  This means that the attractive force is constant for &lt;math&gt;z_0 \le z \le z_0 + h_0&lt;/math&gt;.  There is not further penetration in compression.  Perfect contact occurs in an area of radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and adhesive forces of magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; extend to an area of radius &lt;math&gt;c &gt; a&lt;/math&gt;.  In the region &lt;math&gt;a &lt; r &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;, the two surfaces are separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;h(r)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(a) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(c) = h_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The ratio &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; m := \cfrac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Maugis-Dugdale theory,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, KL and Greenwood, JA, 1997, ''An adhesion map for the contact of elastic spheres'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 192(2), pp. 326-333.&lt;/ref&gt; the surface traction distribution is divided into two parts - one due to the Hertz contact pressure and the other from the Dugdale adhesive stress.  Hertz contact is assumed in the region &lt;math&gt;-a &lt; r &lt; a&lt;/math&gt;.  The contribution to the surface traction from the Hertz pressure is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   p^H(r) = \left(\cfrac{3F^H}{2\pi a^2}\right)\left(1 - \cfrac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{1/2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the Hertz contact force &lt;math&gt;F^H&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   F^H = \cfrac{4E^*a^3}{3R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The penetration due to elastic compression is
:&lt;math&gt;
   d^H = \cfrac{a^2}{R}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The vertical displacement at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u^H(c) = \cfrac{1}{\pi R} \left[a^2(2 - m^2)\sin^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + a^2\sqrt{m^2-1}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the separation between the two surfaces at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   h^H(c) = \cfrac{c^2}{2R} - d^H + u^H(c)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The surface traction distribution due to the adhesive Dugdale stress is
:&lt;math&gt;
   p^D(r) = \begin{cases}
               -\cfrac{\sigma_0}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left[\cfrac{2-m^2-\cfrac{r^2}{a^2}}{m^2\left(1-\cfrac{r^2}{m^2a^2}\right)}\right] &amp; \quad \mathrm{for} \quad r \le a\\
               -\sigma_0 &amp; \quad \mathrm{for} \quad a \le r \le c
            \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The total adhesive force is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   F^D = -2\sigma_0 m^2a^2\left[\cos^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + \frac{1}{m^2}\sqrt{m^2 - 1}\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The compression due to Dugdale adhesion is
:&lt;math&gt;
  d^D = -\left(\cfrac{2\sigma_0 a}{E^*}\right)\sqrt{m^2-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the gap at &lt;math&gt;r = c&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   h^D(c) = \left(\cfrac{4\sigma_0 a}{\pi E^*}\right)\left[\sqrt{m^2-1}\cos^{-1}\left(\cfrac{1}{m}\right) + 1-m\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
The net traction on the contact area is then given by &lt;math&gt;p(r) = p^H(r) + p^D(r)&lt;/math&gt; and the net contact force is &lt;math&gt;F = F^H + F^D&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;h(c) = h^H(c) + h^D(c) = h_0&lt;/math&gt; the adhesive traction drops to zero.

Non-dimensionalized values of &lt;math&gt;a, c, F, d&lt;/math&gt; are introduced at this stage that are defied as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{a} = \alpha a ~;~~ \bar{c} := \alpha c ~;~~ \bar{d} := \alpha^2 R d ~;~~ \alpha := \left(\cfrac{4E^*}{3\pi\Delta\gamma R^2}\right)^{1/3} ~;~~ \bar{A} := \pi c^2 ~;~~ \bar{F} = \cfrac{F}{\pi\Delta\gamma R}
 &lt;/math&gt;

In addition, Maugis proposed a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to the Tabor parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; .  This parameter is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda := \sigma_0\left(\cfrac{9R}{2\pi\Delta\gamma{E^*}^2}\right)^{1/3} = 1.16\mu
 &lt;/math&gt;
where the step cohesive stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; equals to the theoretical stress of the Lennard-Jones potential
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{th} = \cfrac{16\Delta\gamma}{9\sqrt{3}z_0} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Zheng and Yu &lt;ref name=Zheng&gt;Zheng, Z.J. and Yu, J.L., 2007, Using the Dugdale approximation to match a specific interaction in the adhesive contact of elastic objects'', Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 310(1), pp. 27-34.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested another value for the step cohesive stress
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{0} = \exp\left(-\cfrac{223}{420}\right)\cdot\cfrac{\Delta\gamma}{z_0} \approx 0.588\cfrac{\Delta\gamma}{z_0}
&lt;/math&gt;
to match the Lennard-Jones potential, which leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda \approx 0.663\mu
&lt;/math&gt;
Then the net contact force may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{F} = \bar{a}^3 - \lambda \bar{a}^2\left[\sqrt{m^2 -1} + m^2 \sec^{-1} m\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the elastic compression as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \bar{d} = \bar{a}^2 - \cfrac{4}{3}~\lambda \bar{a}\sqrt{m^2-1}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the cohesive gap between the two bodies takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\lambda \bar{a}^2}{2}\left[(m^2-2)\sec^{-1} m + \sqrt{m^2-1}\right] + \cfrac{4\lambda\bar{a}}{3}\left[\sqrt{m^2-1}\sec^{-1} m - m + 1\right] = 1
 &lt;/math&gt;
This equation can be solved to obtain values of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for various values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  For large values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; and the JKR model is obtained.  For small values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the DMT model is retrieved.

=== Carpick-Ogletree-Salmeron (COS) model ===
The Maugis-Dugdale model can only be solved iteratively if the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is not known a-priori.  The Carpick-Ogletree-Salmeron approximate solution &lt;ref name=COS&gt;Carpick, R.W. and Ogletree, D.F. and Salmeron, M., 1999, ''A general equation for fitting contact area and friction vs load measurements'', Journal of colloid and interface science, 211(2), pp. 395-400.&lt;/ref&gt; simplifies the process by using the following relation to determine the contact radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
  a = a_0(\beta) \left(\cfrac{\beta + \sqrt{1 - F/F_c(\beta)}}{1 + \beta}\right)^{2/3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is the contact area at zero load, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a transition parameter that is related to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \lambda = -0.924 \ln(1-1.02\beta)
 &lt;/math&gt;
The case &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds exactly to JKR theory while &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to DMT theory.
For intermediate cases &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; the COS model corresponds closely to the Maugis-Dugdale solution for &lt;math&gt;0.1 &lt; \lambda &lt; 5&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Influence of contact shape ===
Even in the presence of perfectly smooth surfaces, geometry can come into play in form of the macroscopic shape of the contacting region. When a rigid punch with flat but oddy shaped face is carefully pulled off his soft counterpart, its detachment occurs not instantaneously but detachment fronts start at pointed corners and travel inwards, until the final configuration is reached which for macroscopically isotropic shapes is almost circular. The main parameter determining the adhesive strength of flat contacts occurs to be the maximum linear size of the contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Valentin L.|last2=Pohrt|first2=Roman|last3=Li|first3=Qiang|date=2017-09-01|title=Strength of adhesive contacts: Influence of contact geometry and material gradients|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|journal=Friction|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=308–325|doi=10.1007/s40544-017-0177-3|issn=2223-7690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of detachment can as observed experimentally can be seen in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Friction Physics|title=Science friction: Adhesion of complex shapes|date=2017-12-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV2W91d8vwQ|accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the legal doctrine|Judicial deference}}
{{hatnote|"Deferential" and "Submission" redirect here. Not to be confused with [[Difference (disambiguation)]] or [[Differential (disambiguation)]].}}
{{redirect-distinguish|Reverence (attitude)|Reverence (emotion)}}
'''Deference''' (also called '''submission''' or '''passivity''') is the condition of submitting to the espoused, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] influence of one's superior or superiors.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Kirbya, "Early American Politics—The Search for Ideology: An Historiographical Analysis and Critique of the Concept of 'Deference,'" ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 32, Issue 04, November 1970 pp 808–838&lt;/ref&gt; Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by [[political scientists]], sociologists, and psychologists.

==Politics==
Smolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the "colonial speech economy," that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Smolenski, "From Men of Property to Just Men," ''Early American Studies, An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' Fall 2005, Vol. 3 Issue 2, pp 253–285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
[[Erving Goffman]], a Canadian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay "The Nature of Deference and Demeanor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erving Goffman|year=1967|title=Interaction Ritual|location=New York, NY|publisher=Anchor House|isbn=0-394-70631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.

==Psychology==
There is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate [[personality type]] or is the result of a person's experiences and [[classical conditioning|conditioning]]. In [[interpersonal relationships]], a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=James J. Gross|title=Handbook of Emotion Regulation|publisher=Guilford Publications|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59385-148-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as [[Domestic violence|partner abuse]]. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.

In interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise [[conventional sex]] life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.

::''This article is about electronics.  For the adjustment of engines for longer engine life see [[engine tuning]].''
In electronics, '''derating''' (or de-rating) is the operation of a [[electronic device|device]] at less than its rated maximum capability in order to prolong its life.  Typical examples include operation below the maximum power rating, current rating, or voltage rating.

==In electronics==
[[Image:Derating curve.gif|thumb|right|245px|Derating curve of a hypothetical power device.]]
Power semiconductor devices have a maximum power dissipation rating usually quoted at a case temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}}. The datasheet for the device also includes a ''derating curve'' which indicates how much a device will dissipate without getting damaged at any given case temperature and this must be taken into account while designing a system. 

As can be seen from the derating curve image for a hypothetical [[bipolar junction transistor]], the device (rated for 100 W at {{convert|25|C|F}}) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after [[heat sink|heat-sinking]]) is {{convert|65|C|F}}. This final case temperature is a function of the [[Thermal resistance in electronics|thermal resistance]] between the device's case and the heat-sink; and the heat-sink and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics).

Some capacitors' voltage capability is reduced at higher temperatures because the softened dielectric (e.g., a polymer) is softened further by the heat and its breakdown field strength is reduced.  Derating curves are included in data sheets for such capacitors.

Derating can also be used to provide a safety margin for transient voltages or currents (spikes) that exceed normal operation, or simply to prolong life.  For example the life of electrolytic capacitors is dramatically increased by operating them below their maximum temperature rating.

==In electrical installations==
All [[dimmer]]s rely on heat conduction and convection to keep the electronic components cool.  Similarly, power wiring (e.g., house wiring) not surrounded by an air space (e.g., inside a conduit) needs to have its current-limiting device (e.g. circuit breaker or fuse) adjusted so as not to carry as much current through that circuit. Derating is the reduction of the maximum capacity (load) a unit can reliably handle when [[Heat_sink#Fin_arrangements|fin]]s/side sections are removed.

'''Distance measures''' are used in [[physical cosmology]] to give a natural notion of the [[distance]] between two objects or events in the [[universe]].  They are often used to tie some ''observable'' quantity (such as the [[luminosity]] of a distant [[quasar]], the [[redshift]] of a distant [[galaxy]], or the angular size of the acoustic peaks in the [[CMB]] power spectrum) to another quantity that is not ''directly'' observable, but is more convenient for calculations (such as the [[comoving coordinates]] of the quasar, galaxy, etc.). The distance measures discussed here all reduce to the common notion of [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] distance at low redshift.

In accord with our present understanding of cosmology, these measures are calculated within the context of [[general relativity]], where the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] solution is used to describe the universe.

==Overview==

There are a few different definitions of "distance" in cosmology which all coincide for sufficiently small [[redshift]]s. The expressions for these distances are most practical when written as functions of redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, since redshift is always the observable. They can easily be written as functions of [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a=1/(1+z)&lt;/math&gt;, [[cosmic time]] &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; or [[conformal time]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; as well by performing a simple transformation of variables. By defining the dimensionless [[Hubble parameter]] and the Hubble distance &lt;math&gt; d_H = c/H_0 &lt;/math&gt;, the relation between the different distances becomes apparent.

&lt;math&gt;E(z)=\sqrt{\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_k(1+z)^2+\Omega_\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m&lt;/math&gt; is the total matter density, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dark energy]] density, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k = 1-\Omega_m-\Omega_\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; represents the curvature, &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble parameter today and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]. The [[Hubble parameter]] at a given redshift is then &lt;math&gt;H(z) = H_0 E(z)&lt;/math&gt;.

To compute the distance to an object from its redshift, we must integrate the above equation. Although for some limited choices of parameters (e.g. matter-only: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m = \Omega_\mathrm{total} = 1&lt;/math&gt;) the comoving distance integral defined below has a closed analytic form, in general—and specifically for the [[Lambda-CDM model|parameters of our Universe]]—we can only find a solution [[Numerical integration|numerically]]. Cosmologists commonly use the following measures for distances from the observer to an object at redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; along the line of sight:&lt;ref name=Hogg&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=Distance measures in cosmology |author=David W. Hogg |year=2000 |arxiv=astro-ph/9905116v4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comoving distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_C(z)  = d_H \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Transverse comoving distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_M(z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{d_H}{\sqrt{\Omega_k}} \sinh\left(\sqrt{\Omega_k}d_C(z)/d_H\right) &amp; \text{for } \Omega_k&gt;0\\
d_C(z) &amp; \text{for }\Omega_k=0\\
\frac{d_H}{\sqrt{|\Omega_k}|} \sin\left(\sqrt{|\Omega_k|}d_C(z)/d_H\right) &amp; \text{for }\Omega_k&lt;0\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
'''Angular diameter distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt; d_A(z)  = \frac{d_M(z)}{1+z}&lt;/math&gt;
'''Luminosity distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;  d_L(z)  = (1+z) d_M(z)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Light-travel distance:'''
:&lt;math&gt;d_T(z) = d_H \int_0^z \frac{d z'}{(1+z')E(z')} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the comoving distance is recovered from the transverse comoving distance by taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k \to 0&lt;/math&gt;, such that the two distance measures are equivalent in a [[flat universe]].

Age of the universe is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\rightarrow\infty} d_T(z)/c&lt;/math&gt;, and the time elapsed since redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; until now is
:&lt;math&gt; t(z) = d_T(z)/c &lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative terminology==

Peebles (1993) calls the transverse comoving distance the "angular size distance", which is not to be mistaken for the angular diameter distance.&lt;ref name="peebles1993"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Physical Cosmology |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |first=P. J. E. |last=Peebles |pages=310–320 |year=1993 |bibcode=1993ppc..book.....P |isbn=978-0-691-01933-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though it is not a matter of nomenclature, the comoving distance is equivalent to the proper motion distance, which is defined as the ratio of the transverse velocity and its proper motion in radians per time. Occasionally, the symbols &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are used to denote both the comoving and the angular diameter distance. Sometimes, the light-travel distance is also called the "lookback distance".

==Details==

===Comoving distance===
{{Main article|Comoving distance}}

The comoving distance between fundamental observers, i.e. observers that are both moving with the [[Hubble's law|Hubble flow]], does not change with time, as comoving distance accounts for the expansion of the universe. Comoving distance is obtained by integrating the proper distances of nearby fundamental observers along the line of sight ('''LOS'''), where the proper distance is what a measurement at constant cosmic time would yield.

In [[Big Bang|standard cosmology]], '''comoving distance''' and '''proper distance''' are two closely related distance measures used by cosmologists to measure distances between objects; the comoving distance is the proper distance at the present time.

=== Proper distance ===
Proper distance roughly corresponds to where a distant object would be at a specific moment of [[cosmological time]], which can change over time due to the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. ''Comoving distance'' factors out the expansion of the universe, which gives a distance that does not change in time due to the expansion of space (though this may change due to other, local factors, such as the motion of a galaxy within a cluster); the comoving distance is the proper distance at the present time.

===Transverse comoving distance===

Two comoving objects at constant redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that are separated by an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the sky are said to have the distance &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta d_M(z)&lt;/math&gt;, where the transverse comoving distance &lt;math&gt;d_M&lt;/math&gt; is defined appropriately.

===Angular diameter distance===
{{Main article|Angular diameter distance}}

An object of size &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at redshift &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; that appears to have angular size &lt;math&gt;\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt; has the angular diameter distance of &lt;math&gt;d_A(z)=x/\delta\theta&lt;/math&gt;. This is commonly used to observe so called [[standard ruler]]s, for example in the context of [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

===Luminosity distance===
{{Main article|Luminosity distance}}

If the intrinsic [[luminosity]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a distant object is known, we can calculate its luminosity distance by measuring the flux &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and determine &lt;math&gt;d_L(z)=\sqrt{L/4\pi S}&lt;/math&gt;, which turns out to be equivalent to the expression above for &lt;math&gt;d_L(z)&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity is important for measurements of [[standard candles]] like [[type Ia supernovae]], which were first used to discover the acceleration of the [[Dark Energy|expansion of the universe]].

===Light-travel distance===

This distance is the time (in years) that it took light to reach the observer from the object multiplied by the [[speed of light]]. For instance, the radius of the [[observable universe]] in this distance measure becomes the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light (1 light year/year) i.e. 13.8 billion light years. Also see [[Observable universe#Misconceptions on its size|misconceptions]] about the size of the visible universe.

===Etherington's distance duality===
{{Main article|Etherington's reciprocity theorem}}

The Etherington's distance-duality equation &lt;ref&gt;I.M.H. Etherington, “LX. On the Definition of Distance in
General Relativity”, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 15, S. 7 (1933), pp. 761-773.&lt;/ref&gt; is the relationship between the luminosity distance of standard candles and the angular-diameter distance. It is expressed as follows: &lt;math&gt;d_L=(1+z)^2 d_A &lt;/math&gt;

In [[physical cosmology]], the '''electroweak epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early universe when the temperature of the universe had fallen enough that the [[strong force]] separated from the [[electroweak]] interaction, but was high enough for [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak interaction]] to remain merged into a single [[electroweak interaction]] (above energies of about 246&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]]&lt;!-- IF THIS IS CHANGED, PLEASE ALSO UPDATE THE SAME INFO AT [[Chronology of the universe]], [[Electroweak scale]], [[Electroweak interaction]]. THANK YOU. --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the [[vacuum expectation value]] &lt;math&gt;v = (G_F \sqrt{2})^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Higgs field]] (where &lt;math&gt;G_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fermi coupling constant]]).&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=March 2018}}). Some cosmologists place this event at the start of the [[inflationary epoch]], approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden B: "Introduction to Cosmology", pg. 196 Addison-Wesley 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Allday | first = Jonathan | title = Quarks, Leptons and the Big Bang | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0806-9 |page = 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciexplorer.blogspot.com/2011/01/our-universe-part-6-electroweak-epoch.html Our Universe Part 6: Electroweak Epoch], Scientific Explorer&lt;/ref&gt; Others place it at approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds after the Big Bang when the potential energy of the [[inflaton]] field that had driven the [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] of the universe during the inflationary epoch was released, filling the universe with a dense, hot [[quark–gluon plasma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nicadd.niu.edu/~bterzic/PHYS652/Lecture_13.pdf Lecture 13: History of the Very Early Universe], Dr. Balša Terzić, Northern Illinois Center for Accelerator and Detector Development&lt;/ref&gt; Particle interactions in this phase were energetic enough to create large numbers of [[exotic particle]]s, including [[W and Z bosons]] and [[Higgs boson]]s. As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic and when the universe was about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds old, W and Z bosons ceased to be created. The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force in the following [[quark epoch]].

The physics of the electroweak epoch is less speculative and much better understood than the physics of previous periods of the early universe. The existence of W, Z, and Higgs bosons has been demonstrated, and other{{Which|date=April 2012}} predictions of electroweak theory have been experimentally verified.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">The '''English Broadside Ballad Archive''' ('''EBBA''') is a [[digital library]] of 17th-century English [[Broadside (music)#Broadside ballads|Broadside Ballads]], a project of the English Department of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. The project archives ballads in multiple accessible digital formats.

==History==

The English Broadside Ballad Archive was created in 2003 by Patricia Fumerton, Professor of English at [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] to digitize broadside ballads of the heyday of the 17th century. Many of these ballads are currently held in difficult to access libraries in both North America and the United Kingdom, often in fragile condition, and EBBA’s aim is to make them accessible to users in a variety of digital formats. Since then, EBBA has received six Collections and Resources grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant, and Faculty Research Grants and Instructional Improvement Grants from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As of August 2015, the project has archived over 7000 of the estimated 11,000 extant broadside ballads.

==Scope==

As of August 2015, '''EBBA''' has archived 7,124 broadside ballads, from 20 different collections held at six different libraries worldwide. The collections range from the very well-known and recognized by name - such as those housed at the [[Pepys Library]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] - to the relatively unknown. The project has currently archived ballads from the following libraries, with partnerships in place to begin archiving ballads from several other libraries in the next two years.

===Holding Libraries and Named Collections===

* [[British Library]]
** [[Roxburghe Ballads]]
* [[Glasgow University Library]]
** Euing Collection
* [[Houghton Library]] of [[Harvard University]]
** [[Alfred Henry Huth|Huth]] Collection
* [[Huntington Library]]
** [[James Bindley|Bindley]] Collection
** Bridgewater Collection
** Britwell Collection
* [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]
** [[Pepys Library|Pepys Ballads]]
* [[National Library of Scotland]]
** Crawford Collection
** Rosebery Collection

==Archival Formats==

In addition to cataloging all of its holdings exhaustively, '''EBBA''' archives ballads in up to five different formats, all designed to make the ballads more accessible to modern scholars and members of the public.

===Ballad Facsimile===

All ballads are archived on the website as a high quality, 600 dpi image of the ballad sheet, trimmed with a 2mm margin.

===Album Facsimile===

Those ballads that were pasted into albums or archived in any format other than loose-leaf are also archived on the website in another high quality photograph of the ballad sheet on its surrounding album page.

===Transcriptions===

All ballads, often originally rendered in difficult to read [[black letter]], or Gothic font, and other early modern typefaces, are transcribed into Times New Roman using a diplomatic double-keyed transcription process, and those transcriptions are included in the archive.

===Facsimile Transcriptions===

All ballads are archived in Facsimile Transcriptions, in which the original blocks of text from the Ballad Facsimile have been replaced with blocks of text from the modern transcription, resulting in an image that preserves the visual experience of the original ballad, including woodcut impression illustrations, yet is easily readable by a modern audience.

===Ballad Recording===

Many broadside ballads include a tune imprint, indicating to which well-known tune they were meant to be sung. For those ballads for which '''EBBA''' has been able to identify the tune, recordings of the sung ballad are available on the archive.

==Examples of Notable Holdings==

* [[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]
* [[The Ballad of Chevy Chase|Chevy Chase]]
* Unexpected Perspectives such as [[Lady Isabel's Tragedy]]
* Many Robin Hood Ballads including [[Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham]]
* Examples of the [[Titus Andronicus (ballad)|Titus Andronicus]] tradition

'''Enterprise cognitive systems''' ('''ECS''') are part of a broader shift in computing, from a programmatic to a probabilistic approach, called [[cognitive computing]]. An Enterprise Cognitive System makes a new class of complex [[decision support]] problems computable, where the business context is ambiguous, multi-faceted, and fast-evolving, and what to do in such a situation is usually assessed today by the business user. An ECS is designed to synthesize a business context and link it to the desired outcome. It recommends evidence-based actions to help the [[end-user]] achieve the desired outcome. It does so by finding past situations similar to the current situation, and extracting the repeated actions that best influence the desired outcome.

While general-purpose cognitive systems can be used for different outputs, prescriptive, suggestive, instructive, or simply entertaining, an enterprise cognitive system is focused on action, not insight, to help in assessing what to do in a complex situation.

==Key characteristics==
ECS have to be:
# '''Adaptive''': They must learn as information changes, and as goals and [[requirement]]s evolve. They must resolve [[ambiguity]] and tolerate unpredictability. They must be engineered to feed on dynamic data in [[Real-time (computing)|real time]], or near real time. In the Enterprise, near-real time learning from data requires an agile information federation approach to ingest incremental data updates as they occur, and an unsupervised learning approach to ensure that new best practice is leveraged across the organization in a timely manner. 
# '''Interactive''': They must interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and Cloud services, as well as with people. In the Enterprise, interactions are controlled via existing workflows and UIs. Therefore, embedding best practices directly into these existing interfaces, in the context of a specific step, is critical to ensure maximum end-user adoption. 
# '''Iterative and [[stateful]]''': They must aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete. They must “remember” previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time. In the Enterprise, business context is often structured by a [[business process]], and therefore sufficiently data-rich to make relevant recommendations without significant iterations from the end-user. A stateful memory of overall interactions across communication channels is critical for understanding of context, as a static profile will not capture intent and outcome potential the way behavior does. 
# '''Contextual''': They must understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location, appropriate [[knowledge domain|domain]], regulations, [[user profile|user’s profile]], process, task and goal. They may draw on multiple sources of information, including both structured and [[unstructured information|unstructured digital information]], as well as sensory inputs (visual, gestural, auditory, or sensor-provided). In the Enterprise, Context is fragmented and must be aggregated across [[data type]]s, sources, and locations. In most business environments, such data is captured in existing [[enterprise information system]]s, and the effort is linked to quickly source and unify such information. It is rare to have to directly process sensor, audio or visual data in real-time as direct input into the enterprise cognitive system. Instead, these data types are captured by Enterprise Applications and pre-processed into a binary or [[Formatted text|text format]] prior to consumption by the System.

'''Epidemic dropsy''' is a form of [[edema]] of extremities due to [[poisoning]] by ''' ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' ''' (Mexican prickly poppy).&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Sharma, B.

Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' seed oil.

[[Sanguinarine]] and [[dihydrosanguinarine]] are two major toxic alkaloids of argemone oil, which cause widespread capillary dilatation, proliferation and increased capillary permeability. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidentally with argemone oil, [[proteinuria]] (specifically loss of [[human serum albumin|albumin]]) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in [[nephrotic syndrome]].

Other major symptoms are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] [[pitting edema]] of extremities, [[headache]], [[nausea]], loose bowels, [[erythema]], [[glaucoma]] and [[dyspnea|breathlessness]].

Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of [[edema]]. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative [[hypovolemia]] with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and [[orthopnoea]], progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure, are seen.

Mild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal [[azotemia]], retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''Epidemic dropsy''' occurs as  an [[epidemic]] in places where use of [[mustard oil]], (from the seeds of Brassica ''juncea'' commonly known as [[Indian mustard]] ) as cooking medium is common.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

==Cause==
===''Argemone mexicana''===
[[File:Argemone_mexicana_flower_2.jpg|thumb|''[[Argemone mexicana]]'']]

''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' (family Papaveraceae), a native of West Indies and naturalized in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and are similar to the dark coloured mustards seeds (''[[Brassica juncea]]'') in shape and size. Adulteration of argemone seeds in light yellow colored mustard seeds (''Brassica compestris'') can easily be detected, but these seeds are rather difficult to visualize when mixed with dark coloured mustard seeds.

Argemone seeds yield approximately 35% oil. Alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0.44% to 0.50%.  Argemone seeds find use as a substitute because of the easy availability, low cost and their complete miscibility of their oil with mustard oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

== Mechanism of toxicity ==

Mortality is usually due to heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or renal failure and is around 5%. Long-term follow-up studies are scanty so the long-term effects of argemone oil toxicity have not been documented. It has been reported that 25% of cases will have oedema beyond 2 months and 10% beyond 5 months. Pigmentation of skin and excessive loss of hair, which lasted 4–5 months following the disease. The majority of patients completely recover in about 3 months.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''[[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] and [[Oxidative stress]]''' : Studies in the blood of dropsy patients has revealed that there is extensive ROS production (singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) in the argemone oil intoxication leading to depletion of total antioxidants in the body and especially lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and A (tocopherol and retinol).&lt;ref name="pmid15715957"/&gt; There is an extensive damage to the anti-oxidant defense system (anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-oxidants) of blood. Prior, in vitro studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in AO induced toxicity causing peroxidative damage of lipids in various hepatic sub-cellular fractions including microsomes and mitochondria of rats. The damage in hepatic microsomal membrane causes loss of activity of cytochrome P-450 and other membrane bound enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism which leads to delayed bioelimination of sanguinarine and enhances its cumulative toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddy | first1 = N.

'''Pulmonary Toxicity''': The decrease in glycogen levels following argemone oil intoxication  could be due to enhanced glycogenolysis leading to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the glycoltic pathway resulting in accumulation of pyruvate in the blood of experimental animals and dropsy patients. The enhancement of glycogenolysis can further be supported by the interference of sanguinarine in the uptake of glucose through blocking of sodium pump via Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase and thereby inhibiting the active transport of glucose across intestinal barrier. It is well established that increased pyruvate concentration in blood uncouples oxidative phosphorylation,  and this may be responsible for thickening of interalveolar septa and disorganized alveolar spaces in lungs of argemone oil-fed rats and the breathlessness as has been observed in human victims.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;
      
'''Cardiac Failure''':The inhibition of [[NaKATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase]] activity of heart by sanguinarine is due to interaction with the cardiac glycoside receptor site of the enzyme, which may be responsible for producing degenerative changes in [[cardiac muscle]] fibers in the auricular wall of rats fed argemone oil and could be related to tachycardia and cardiac failure in Epidemic Dropsy patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Seifen | first1 = E. | last2 = Adams | first2 = R.

==Diagnosis==
Nitric acid test and paper chromatography test are used in the detection of argemone oil.Paper chromatography test is the most sensitive test.

== Treatment ==
Withdrawal of the contaminated cooking oil is the most important initial step. Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein-rich diet are useful. Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E), and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used. Corticosteroids and antihistaminics such as promethazine have been advocated by some investigators, but demonstrated efficacy is lacking. Diuretics are used universally but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present, as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability. Cardiac failure is managed by bed rest, salt restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Pneumonia is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Renal failure may need dialysis therapy and complete clinical recovery is seen. Glaucoma may need operative intervention, but generally responds to medical management.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Brassica juncea - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-168.jpg|thumb|''[[Brassica juncea]]'']]

Besides India, widespread epidemics have been reported from Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Northwest Cape districts of South Africa, Madagascar and also from Nepal. Apart from a South African study, where the epidemic occurred through contamination in wheat flour, all the epidemics occurred through the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

In these populations mustard oil is the prime edible oil by culture.

The earliest reference to argemone oil poisoning was made by Lyon,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Lyon, I. B. | title = Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence for India | edition = 1st | year = 1889 | page = 214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported four cases of poisoning in Calcutta in 1877 from the use of this oil in food.

Since then, epidemic dropsy has been reported from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam, J&amp;K, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, mainly due to consumption of food cooked in argemone oil mixed with mustard oil or occasionally by body massage with contaminated oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

The epidemic in [[1998 Delhi oil poisoning|1998 at New Delhi]], India is the largest so far, in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt; Few studies reported the findings in patients affected with this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kar HK, Jain RK, Sharma PK, Gautam RK, Kumar P, Bhardwaj M | year = 2001 | title = Epidemic dropsy: A study of cutaneous manifestations with histopathological correlation | url = | journal = Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 178–9 | pmid = 17664732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after that the epidemics occurred at alarming frequency in Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005) cities of India.&lt;ref name=pmid15715957&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Das | first1 = M. | last2 = Babu | first2 = K. | last3 = Reddy | first3 = N.

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

The '''finite strip method''' is a technique of [[structural analysis]] used for [[bridge]] and [[skyscraper|tall structure]] design as well and in the design of construction components such as steel beams. The technique was first introduced in 1968 and is less powerful and versatile than the [[finite element method]] but is more efficient in terms of computation power in some situations.

The '''Fort de Châtillon''' was a fortification located about {{convert|5|km|mi}} south of [[Paris]] in the communes of [[Châtillon (Hauts-de-Seine)|Châtillon-sous-Bagneux]] and [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. It was built in 1874 and was razed beginning in 1957, making way for expansion of the French nuclear research facility at Fontenay-aux-Roses.

The fort was named for the town it was designed to protect, Châtillon-sous-Bagneux, but the greater portion of the site is actually within Fontenay-aux-Roses. The main entry and the portions in Châtillon were destroyed at the end of the [[Second World War]].

== History ==
The site was first fortified during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, when the redoubt of Châtillon was built by the inhabitants of the town. The works allowed the French to slow the Prussian advance on the capital and was the scene of violent combat. After the war the site was selected for further fortification as part of the [[Séré de Rivières system]] ring of fortifications around Paris. Construction on the new pentagonal fort started in 1874, not far from the old redoubt. Unlike other Parisian fortifications, the new fort was designed for action in all directions, as the location commanded much of the surrounding region.  The barracks, believed to have been in three levels, were located at the center, surrounded by walls defended by a ditch and [[caponier]]s. The fort featured a number of internal traverses, mounded dikes intended as shelters against low-angle shellfire from a variety of directions.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?p=1046|title=Châtillon (fort de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearby was the ''Coupure de Châtillon'', a fortified ditch about {{convert|150|m|ft}} to the northeast of the Fort de Châtillon, defended by artillery batteries. With the Fort de Châtillon, the defenses denied the use of the Châtillon hill to an enemy who might dominate the nearby Forts de [[Fort de Montrouge|Montrouge]], [[Fort d'Issy|Issy]] and [[Fort de Vanves|Vanves]]. The ''coupure'' consisted of eighteen traverses covered by artillery and defended by [[caponier]]s in the ditch. The entire fortification has vanished with the encroachment of urbanization.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?p=1045|title=Châtillon (coupure de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort saw no particular action during the Second World War. After the [[French Liberation]], convicted collaborators  [[Joseph Darnand]] and [[Jean Hérold-Paquis]] were executed by firing squad at the fort.&lt;ref name="CRD1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clg-doisneau-gonesse.ac-versailles.fr/spip.php?article284|title=Nazis et collaborateurs devant leurs juges|year=2009|publisher=Collège Robert Doisneau de Gonesse|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWAW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schudak.de/timelines/france-theaftermathofliberation1945-1998.html|title=FRANCE&amp;nbsp;— The Aftermath of Liberation Timeline|publisher=The World at War|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war the fort changed vocation to serve the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], the French atomic energy agency (CEA), and was the site of [[Zoé (reactor)|Zoé]], the first French nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cia1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Office of Scientific Intelligence|date=13 November 1959|title=TheFrench Nuclear Weapons Program|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/wizards/osi_pdf/the_french_nu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Châtillon site was quickly superseded by a new atomic research facility at Saclay, which opened in 1952.

== Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux-Roses (CEN-FAR) ==
In 1957 the Fort de Châtillon changed its name to the ''Centre d'Études Nucléaires de Fontenay-aux-Roses''. Only the entry and some buildings of the old fort were saved.  The rest was demolished between 1957 and 1970. From 1974 the site housed a [[tokamak]] fusion reactor prototype, the [[Tokamak de Fontenay aux Roses|TFR]]. It became difficult to maintain such activities in the densely populated area, and Zoé was shut down in 1977.  The site became more oriented to other areas of nuclear research, particularly in the areas of radiation protection and nuclear waste management. The site also accommodates administrative services of the CEA. A 1996 fire in the administration building precipitated a change in use. A portion of the building that housed Zoé became the Museum of the Atom, while the remainder was dedicated to research into the life sciences.&lt;ref name="CEA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-dsv.cea.fr/dsv/le-centre-de-fontenay-aux-roses/actualites/une-cli-pour-accompagner-la-denuclearisation-du-site|title=Une CLI pour accompagner la dénucléarisation du site |publisher=CEA|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-dsv.cea.fr/dsv/le-centre-de-fontenay-aux-roses/actions-pedagogiques/les-enfants-du-patrimoine-br-venez-visiter-zoe|title=Les Enfants du patrimoine: venez visiter Zoé ! |date=20 August 2009|publisher=CEA|language=French|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several buildings on the site remain dedicated to the  ''Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire'' (Nuclear Safety Authority) (ASN) and the ''[[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire]]'' (Institute for Protection and Safety against Nuclear Radiation) (IRSN). The site is no longer spoken of as the "Fort" or "Annex", but as CEN-FAR or IRSN Fontenay-aux-Roses.

== Other Forts de Châtillon ==
Other Forts de Châtillon include one at [[Châtillon-le-Duc]] near  [[Besançon]], as well as a Fort de Châtillon at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] built in the 16th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13720">The '''Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation''' is the country's largest statewide, nonprofit preservation organization with more than 8,000 members. Founded in 1973, the Trust is committed to preserving and enhancing Georgia’s communities and their diverse historic resources for the education and enjoyment of all.

The Georgia Trust generates community revitalization by finding buyers for endangered properties acquired by its ''Revolving Fund''; encourages neighborhood revitalization and provides design assistance to 105 Georgia ''Main Street'' cities; trains Georgia’s teachers to engage students in 61 Georgia school systems to discover state and national history through their local historic resources; and advocates for funding, tax incentives and other laws aiding preservation efforts.  The Georgia Trust is a recipient of the Trustees Award for Organizational Excellence from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatsnew/boilerplate.htm]

[[Image:Rhodes Hall Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Rhodes Hall]] serves as the headquarters for the Georgia Trust.]]
The Georgia Trust operates two historic house museums:
* [[Johnston-Felton-Hay House|Hay House]], 1859, Macon
* [[Rhodes Hall]], 1904, Atlanta

== Georgia Trust Programs ==
In addition to providing preservation resources for individuals and communities throughout the state, The Georgia Trust helps save endangered houses and buildings, uncover the beauty of downtown buildings, educate the next preservation generation, and advocate for preservation funding and laws through the following programs:

=== Revolving Fund for Endangered Properties ===
The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation established the Revolving Fund for endangered properties in 1990 to provide effective alternatives to demolition or neglect of architecturally and historically significant properties by promoting rehabilitation and enabling owners of endangered historic properties to connect with buyers who will rehabilitate their properties.

The Revolving Fund accomplishes this goal by either accepting property donations or by purchasing options on endangered historic properties. The properties are then marketed nationally to locate buyers who agree to preserve and maintain the structures. Protective covenants are attached to the deeds to ensure that the historic integrity of each property is retained, and purchasers are required to sign rehabilitation agreements based on the work to be performed on the structure.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/revolving_fund.htm]

=== Main Street Design Assistance Program ===
Since the Main Street program's start in 1980, The Georgia Trust has offered design assistance, on-site rehabilitation consultations, hands-on presentations and hand-drawn and digital renderings to help business owners and downtown managers rehabilitate and reuse their historic resources.

Services provided by The Georgia Trust's Main Street Design Assistance Program have become integral to downtown revitalization efforts. Supported by the Department of Community Affairs' (DCA) Office of Downtown Development, the program has assisted more than 3,000 business owners in 105 Main Street cities across Georgia to encourage the rehabilitation of historic downtown commercial buildings. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/main_streetda.htm]

=== Talking Walls ===
A recipient of a Governor's Award in the Humanities, the Talking Walls heritage education program has trained more than 1,700 teachers, who have reached more than 370,000 students in 61 school systems in Georgia since 1991. The program's teacher workshops and ongoing local support trains educators to use local historic resources such as photos, maps, oral histories and historic buildings as teaching tools in Georgia's mandated curriculum.

The Georgia Department of Education recently emphasized the Trust's key role as an important educational resource by approving the Trust as a partner in its Educational Initiatives Program. This status recognizes The Georgia Trust as an official collaborator with the DOE to provide quality instructional materials to educators across the state. Talking Walls also received statewide certification by the Georgia DOE, allowing the Trust to award professional recertification credits to teachers attending program workshops. [http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/talking_walls.htm]

=== Georgians for Preservation Action ===
Founded in 1987, the statewide coordinating council for historic preservation advocacy encourages laws, programs and policies that promote the preservation of Georgia’s historic resources by mobilizing grassroots preservationists across the state.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/whatwedo/georgians_preservation_action.htm]

Among its activities, GaPA:

* Annually develops and advocates a legislative agenda that represents a consensus of the leaders of key preservation constituencies on preservation issues. 
* Regularly communicates with historic preservation advocates about critical issues and legislation before the General Assembly. 
* Hosts a Legislative Reception for preservation supporters to meet with legislators. 
* Provides GaPA members with information on national preservation issues with news from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] and Preservation Action, the national lobbying arm for historic preservation.

== ''Places in Peril'' ==
The Georgia Trust releases an annual list of endangered historic sites throughout Georgia. The ''Places in Peril'' program seeks to identify significant historic, archaeological and cultural properties that are threatened by demolition, deterioration or insensitive public policy or development, and have a demonstrable level of community interest, commitment and support. Through this program, the Trust encourages owners and individuals, organizations and communities to employ preservation tools, partnerships and resources necessary to preserve and utilize selected historic properties in peril.

Historic properties are selected for listing based on several criteria. Sites must be listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or the Georgia Register of Historic Places and must be subject to a serious threat to their existence or historical, architectural and/or archeological integrity. There must also be a demonstrable level of community commitment and support for the preservation of listed sites.[http://www.georgiatrust.org/preservation_resources/places_in_peril.htm]

== Publications ==

=== ''The Rambler'' ===

The ''Rambler'' is The Georgia Trust's quarterly publication. It is distributed to members of The Georgia Trust from around the state and to other state and national preservation organizations.

=== ''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' ===

Architect J. Neel Reid (and his partners in Hentz, Reid &amp; Adler) founded the Georgia school of classicists after study at Columbia University and abroad. Many sources influenced Reid’s architecture, and his interior and garden designs. His travel diary, sketchbooks and scrapbooks, and extensive library reflect this. His early-twentieth-century interest in historic preservation and contextual design, in architectural education and professional standards of practice inspired others long after his tragic early death of a brain tumor in 1926.

Reid’s father’s family were Troup County, Georgia, pioneers; he grew up in Macon, beginning apprenticeship and practice there before, in 1909, moving to Atlanta.

''J. Neel Reid, Architect'' by William R. Mitchell, Jr. and published by The Georgia Trust, gives new life to Reid’s rich legacy, keeping his influence fresh in this new century. The J. Neel Reid Prize, provided by a Georgia Trust fund produced from the sale of the book, helps ensure continuation of Reid’s influence among a new generation of architects.

Proceeds from book sales help support the J. Neel Reid Prize, a yearly award to an architecture student, an architect intern or a recently registered architect for study travel that honors the legacy of Neel Reid.

=== ''Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol'' ===

Written by Timothy J. Crimmins and Anne H. Farrisee with photographs by Diane Kirkland, the award-winning ''Democracy Restored'' is a stunning and fully illustrated history of the Georgia Capital that not only pays tribute to a grand ole edifice, but also vividly recounts the history that was made—and that continues to be made—within and without its walls. The Georgia Capitol is a place where, for more than a century, legislators have debated, governors have proclaimed, and courts have ruled. It is also a place where countless ordinary citizens have gathered in lively tour groups, angry protest mobs, and at times, solemn funeral processions.

Proceeds go to The Georgia Trust and the Capitol Restoration Fund.

Richard Moss, ''New Atlas''. 14 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A full-waveform [[Lidar]] will be attached to the [[International Space Station]] to provide the first global, high-resolution observations of forest vertical structure. This will allow scientists to map [[habitat]]s and [[biomass]], particularly in the tropics, providing detail on the Earth's [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref name='B Insider 2015'&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/nasa-gedi-will-image-the-worlds-forests-in-3d-2015-3?r=US&amp;IR=T NASA has a plan to take the most detailed scans of the world's forests ever]. Pierre Bienaimé, ''Business Insider - UK''. 3 March 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Ralph Dubayah, at the [[University of Maryland]].

==Overview==
GEDI was competitively selected as a NASA Earth Ventures Instrument (EVI) mission in 2014. Cost-capped at $94 M, GEDI is led by the [[University of Maryland]] in collaboration with NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name='GEDI Goddard'&gt;[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13090 GEDI Media Resources]. NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. October 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] is closely tied to that of the carbon cycle.&lt;ref name='B Insider 2015'/&gt; GEDI produces high resolution laser ranging observations of the 3D structure of the forests Earth, which will provide answers to how deforestation has contributed to atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, how much carbon forests will absorb in the future, and how [[habitat degradation]] will affect global [[biodiversity]] and the [[water cycle]].&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt; This in turn, is also of value for [[weather forecasting]], [[forest management]], [[glacier]] and snowpack monitoring.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt; Overall, GEDI will help to better understand how the Earth behaves as a living system.

It is due for launch on 2 December 2018 on a [[Falcon 9]] and it is part of the [[SpaceX CRS-16]] mission. It will be mounted on the Exposed Facility of the Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibo'']] module for a two-year mission.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gedi.htm |title=GEDI |work=Gunter's Space Page |first=Gunter |last=Krebs |access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission is being led by Professor Ralph Dubayah of the University of Maryland.

==Instrument==

The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class, light detection and ranging ([[Lidar]]) laser system comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 parallel tracks of observations. Each laser fires 242 times per second and illuminates a 25 m spot (a footprint) on the surface over which 3D structure is measured. Each footprint is separated by 60 m along track, with an across-track distance of about 600 m between each of the 8 tracks. GEDI is expected to produce about 10 billion cloud-free observations during its nominal 24-month mission length.&lt;ref name='GEDI home'/&gt;&gt;&lt;ref name='New Atlas 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='GEDI Goddard'/&gt;

==School webcam controversy==
In the 2010 ''[[Robbins v. Lower Merion School District]]'' case, plaintiffs charged two suburban Philadelphia high schools secretly spied on students by surreptitiously and remotely activating webcams embedded in school-issued laptops the students were using at home, and therefore infringed on their privacy rights.  The schools admitted to secretly snapping over 66,000 webshots and screenshots, including webcam shots of students in their bedrooms.&lt;ref name="USATODAY"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/02/school-district-accused-of-issuing-webcam-laptops-to-spy-on-students/1|author=Doug Stanglin|title=School district accused of spying on kids via laptop webcams|date=February 18, 2010|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=February 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AKsnVJzj|archivedate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial LANrev System Findings|url=http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf|website=Lower Merion School District|accessdate=17 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615100827/http://lmsd.org/documents/news/100503_l3_report.pdf|archivedate=15 June 2010|format=PDF|date=May 2010|quote=LMSD Redacted Forensic Analysis, L-3 Services – prepared for [[Ballard Spahr]] (LMSD's counsel)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perbix had previously praised Theft Track, the name of the feature that lets administrators remotely photograph potential thieves if a computer is reported stolen, noting in a YouTube video he produced that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It’s an excellent feature. Yes, we have used it, and yes, it has gleaned some results for us. But it, in and of itself, is just a fantastic feature for trying to—especially when you’re in a school environment and you have a lot of laptops and you’re worried about, you know, laptops getting up and missing. I’ve actually had some laptops we thought were stolen which actually were still in a classroom, because they were misplaced, and by the time we found out they were back, I had to turn the tracking off. And I had, you know, a good twenty snapshots of the teacher and students using the machines in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/2/24/headlines/fbi_us_attorney_probing_penn_school_districts_computer_spying |title=FBI, US Attorney Probing Penn.

'''''Hackers Wanted''''' is an unreleased [[United States|American]] [[documentary film]].

Directed and written by [[Sam Bozzo]], the film explores the origins and nature of hackers and [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] by following the adventures of [[Adrian Lamo]], and contrasting his story with that of controversial figures throughout history. The film is narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].

Originally named "Can You Hack It?",&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the film failed to get a conventional release, according to Lamo, because of conflicts between its producer and others on the team. The more commonly cited reason is a problem with the quality of the finished product.  On May 20, 2010, a version of the film was leaked to [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Lamo has stated that he had no involvement in the leak.&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak"&gt;

On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites.&lt;ref&gt;

Health education can be defined as the principle by which individuals and groups of people, learn to behave in a manner conducive to the promotion, maintenance, or restoration of [[health]]. However, as there are multiple definitions of [[health]], there are also multiple definitions of health education.  The Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology of 2001 defined Health Education as "any combination of planned learning experiences based on sound theories that provide individuals, groups, and communities the opportunity to acquire information and the skills needed to make quality health decisions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joint Committee on Terminology| year = 2001 | title = Report of the 2000 Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology | url = | journal = American Journal of Health Education | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 89–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] defined Health Education as "compris[ing] [of] consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge, and developing life skills which are conducive to individual and community health." &lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (1998). List of Basic Terms. ''Health Promotion Glossary''. (pp. 4). Retrieved May 1, 2009, frogym oyohttp://www.who.int/hpr/NPHj/ddoocs/hp_glossary_en.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of health education teacher in primary school level==

From the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, the aim of public health was controlling the harm from infectious diseases, which were largely under control by the 1950s.  By the mid 1970s it was clear that reducing illness, death, and rising health care costs could best be achieved through a focus on health promotion and disease prevention.  At the heart of the new approach was the role of a health educator &lt;ref name = "Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education"&gt;Cottrell, Girvan, and McKenzie, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  A health educator is "a professionally prepared individual who serves in a variety of roles and is specifically trained to use appropriate educational strategies and methods to facilitate the development of policies, procedures, interventions, and systems conducive to the health of individuals, groups, and communities" (Joint Committee on Terminology, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;100).  In January 1978 the Role Delineation Project was put into place, in order to define the basic roles and responsibilities for the health educator. The result was a Framework for the Development of Competency-Based Curricula for Entry Level Health Educators (NCHEC, 1985). A second result was a revised version of A Competency-Based Framework for the Professional Development of Certified Health Education Specialists (NCHEC, 1996). These documents outlined the seven areas of responsibilities which are shown below.

==Motivation==
Education for health begins with people. It hopes to motivate them with whatever interests they may have in improving their [[living conditions]]. Its aim come is to develop in them a sense of responsibility for health conditions for themselves as individuals, as members of families, and as communities. In communicable disease control, health education commonly includes an appraisal of what is known by a population about a disease, an assessment of habits and attitudes of the people as they relate to spread and frequency of the disease, and the presentation of specific means to remedy observed deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm Washington State Department of Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107002810/http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm |date=2010-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health education is also an effective tool that helps improve health in developing nations. It not only teaches prevention and basic health knowledge but also conditions ideas that re-shape everyday habits of people with unhealthy lifestyles in developing countries. This type of conditioning not only affects the immediate recipients of such education but also future generations will benefit from an improved and properly cultivated ideas about health that will eventually be ingrained with widely spread health education. Moreover, besides physical health prevention, health education can also provide more aid and help people deal healthier with situations of extreme stress, anxiety, depression or other emotional disturbances to lessen the impact of these sorts of mental and emotional constituents, which can consequently lead to detrimental physical effects.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bundy D. |author2=Guya H.L. | year = 1996 | title = Schools for health, education and the school-age child | url = | journal = Parasitology Today | volume = 12 | issue = 8| pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)30011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kann L. |author2=Brener N.D. |author3=Allensworth D.D. | year = 2001 | title = Health education: Results from the School Health Policies and Programs Study 2000 | url = | journal = Journal of School Health | volume = 71 | issue = 7| pages = 266–278 | doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2001.tb03504.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credentialing==

Credentialing is the process by which the qualifications of licensed professionals, organizational members or an organization are determined by assessing the individuals or group background and legitimacy through a standardized process. Accreditation, licensure, or certifications are all forms of credentialing.

In 1978, Helen Cleary, the president of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE) started the process of certification of health educators. Prior to this, there was no certification for individual health educators, with exception to the licensing for school health educators.  The only accreditation available in this field was for school health and public health professional preparation programs.

Her initial response was to incorporate experts in the field and to promote funding for the process. The director if the Division of Associated Health Professions in the Bureau of Health Manpower of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Thomas Hatch, became interested in the project. To ensure that the commonalities between health educators across the spectrum of professions would be sufficient enough to create a set of standards, Dr. Cleary spent a great amount of time to create the first conference called the Bethesda Conference. In attendance were interested professionals who covered the possibility of creating credentialing within the profession.

With the success of the conference and the consensus that the standardization of the profession was vital, those who organized the conference created the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators. Funding for this endeavor became available in January 1979, and role delineation became a realistic vision for the future.  They presented the framework for the system in 1981 and published entry-level criteria in 1983. Seven areas of responsibility, 29 areas of competency and 79 sub-competencies were required of health education professionals for approximately 20 years for entry-level educators.

In 1986 a second conference was held in Bethesda, Maryland to further the credentialing process. In June 1988, the National Task Force in the Preparation and Practice of Health Educators became the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC). Their mission was to improve development of the field by promoting, preparing and certifying health education specialists. The NCHEC has three division boards that included preparation, professional development and certification of health educator professionals. The third board, which is called the Division Board of Certification of Health Education Specialist (DBCHES), has the responsibility of developing and administering the CHES exam. An initial certification process allowed 1,558 individuals to be chartered into the program through a recommendation and application process. The first exam was given in 1990.

In order for a candidate to sit for an exam they must have either a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from an accredited institution, and an official transcript that shows a major in health education, Community Health Education, Public Health Education, or School Health Education, etc. The transcript will be accepted if it reflects 25 semester hours or 37 quarter hours in health education preparation and covers the 7 responsibilities covered in the framework.

In 1998 a project called the Competencies Update Project (CUP) began. The purpose of the CUP project was to up-date entry-level requirements and to develop advanced-level competences. Through research the CUP project created the requirements for three levels, which included entry-level, Advanced I and Advanced II educators.&lt;ref&gt;Cottrell, R. R., Girvan, J. T., &amp; McKenzie, J. F. (2009). Principles and Foundations of Health Promotion and Education. New York: Benjamin Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patterson S. M. |author2=Vitello E. M. | year = 2006 | title = Key Influences Shaping Health Education: Progress Toward Accreditation | url = | journal = The Health Education Monograph Series | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 14–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Master Certified Health Education Specialist (MCHES) was created. The MCHES exam measures the knowledge of the advanced levels and sub levels of the Seven Areas of Responsibilities. The first MCHES exam was given in October 2011.

In order to be eligible to take the MCHES exam you must have at least a master's degree in health education or related discipline along with a least 25 credit hours related to health education.  In addition, five years of documented information of practice in health education and two recommendations of past/present supervisors must be provided. A vitae/resume must also be submitted.

The Competency Update Project (CUP), 1998-2004 revealed that there were higher levels of health education practitioners, which is the reasoning for the advancements for the MCHES. Many health educators felt that the current CHES credential was an entry-level exam.

==Teaching==

In the [[United States]] some forty states require the teaching of health education. A comprehensive health education curriculum consists of planned learning experiences which will help students achieve desirable attitudes and practices related to critical health issues. Some of these are: [[emotional health]] and a positive [[self image]]; appreciation, respect for, and care of the [[human body]] and its [[vital organ]]s; [[physical fitness]]; health issues of [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and [[drug abuse|abuse]]; health misconceptions and myths; effects of exercise on the body systems and on general well being; [[nutrition]] and [[weight control]]; [[sexual relationship]]s and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], the scientific, social, and economic aspects of community and ecological health; [[communicable disease|communicable]] and [[degenerative disease]]s including [[sexually transmitted disease]]s; [[disaster preparedness]]; safety and driver education; factors in the environment and how those factors affect an individual's or population's [[Environmental health]] (ex: air quality, water quality, food sanitation); [[life skills]]; choosing professional medical and health services; and choices of health careers.

The National Center for Education Statistics share that 99% of public schools conduct some type of nutrition education. For each grade from kindergarten through eighth, 50 percent or more of all schools have district or state requirements for students to receive nutrition education. However, only 40 percent have these requirements for ninth and tenth grades; and about 20 percent for eleventh and twelfth grades.  The issue still lies with the content and thoroughness that is being taught.  Topics taught in a most all of the schools are: the relationship between diet and health, finding and choosing healthy foods, nutrients and their food sources, the Food Guide Pyramid, and the Dietary Guidelines and goals. However, with the exception of the Food Guide Pyramid, less than half of schools cover these topics thoroughly.  Overall, schools focus on increasing students’ knowledge about what is meant by good nutrition, with less emphasis on influencing students’ motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors. Four of the five topics covered by more than 90 percent of all schools are related to knowledge. With the exception of finding and choosing healthy foods, less than one-third of schools provide thorough coverage of topics related to motivation, attitudes, and eating behaviors.  Not often are there teachers specific for nutrition.  Most of the time the nutrition content is taught by the primary teacher. https://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96852.pdf

==National Health Education Standards==

The National Health Education Standards (NHES) are written expectations for what students should know and be able to do by grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to promote personal, family, and community health. The standards provide a framework for curriculum development and selection, instruction, and student assessment in health education.  The performance indicators articulate specifically what students should know or be able to do in support of each standard by the conclusion of each of the following grade spans: Pre-K–Grade 12. The performance indicators serve as a blueprint for organizing student assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention. (2007). National Health Education Standards. Retrieved May 1, 2009, from https://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/SHER/standards/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Education Code of Ethics==
The Health Education Code of Ethics has been a work in progress since approximately 1976, begun by the Society of Public Health Education (SOPHE).  Various Public Health and Health Education organizations such as the American Association of Health Education (AAHE), the Coalition of National Health Education Organizations (CNHEO), SOPHE, and others collaborated year after year to devise a unified standard of ethics that health educators would be held accountable to professionally.  In 1995, the National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. (NCHEC) proposed a profession-wide standard at the conference: Health Education Profession in the Twenty-First Century: Setting the Stage.  Post-conference, an ethics task force was developed with the purpose of solidifying and unifying proposed ethical standards.  The document was eventually unanimously approved and ratified by all involved organizations in November 1999 and has since then been used as the standard for practicing health educators.

"The Code of Ethics that has evolved from this long and arduous process is not seen as a completed project. Rather, it is envisioned as a living document that will continue to evolve as the practice of Health Education changes to meet the challenges of the new millennium." &lt;ref&gt;Coalition of National Health Education Organizations. Introduction. Health Education Code of Ethics. November 8, 1999, Chicago, IL.  Retrieved May 1, 2009, from http://www.cnheo.org/code1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Education Code of Ethics Full Text==
'''PREAMBLE'''
The Health Education profession is dedicated to excellence in the practice of promoting individual, family, organizational,
and community health. The Code of Ethics provides a framework of shared values within which Health Education is
practiced. The responsibility of each Health Educator is to aspire to the highest possible standards of conduct and to
encourage the ethical behavior of all those with whom they work.

'''Article I: Responsibility to the Public'''
A Health Educator’s ultimate responsibility is to educate people for the purpose of promoting, maintaining, and improving
individual, family, and community health. When a conflict of issues arises among individuals, groups, organizations,
agencies, or institutions, health educators must consider all issues and give priority to those that promote wellness and
quality of living through principles of self-determination and freedom of choice for the individual.

'''Article II: Responsibility to the Profession'''
Health Educators are responsible for their professional behavior, for the reputation of their profession, and for promoting
ethical conduct among their colleagues.

'''Article III: Responsibility to Employers'''
Health Educators recognize the boundaries of their professional competence and are accountable for their professional
activities and actions.

'''Article IV: Responsibility in the Delivery of Health Education'''
Health Educators promote integrity in the delivery of health education. They respect the rights, dignity, confidentiality,
and worth of all people by adapting strategies and methods to the needs of diverse populations and communities.

'''Article V: Responsibility in Research and Evaluation'''
Health Educators contribute to the health of the population and to the profession through research and evaluation
activities. When planning and conducting research or evaluation, health educators do so in accordance with federal and
state laws and regulations, organizational and institutional policies, and professional standards.

'''Article VI: Responsibility in Professional Preparation'''
Those involved in the preparation and training of Health Educators have an obligation to accord learners the same
respect and treatment given other groups by providing quality education that benefits the profession and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Coalition of National Health Education Organizations. Introduction.

==Health Education Career Opportunities==

The terms Public Health Educator, Community Health Educator or Health Educator are all used interchangeable to describe an individual who plans implements and evaluates health education and promotion programs. These individuals play a crucial role in many organizations in various settings to improve our nations health. Just as a Community health educator works work toward population health, a school Health educator generally teaches in our Schools. A community health educator is typically focused on their immediate community striving to serve the public.

'''Health Care Settings''': these include hospitals (for-profit and public), medical care clinics, home health agencies, HMOs and PPOs. Here, a health educator teaches employees how to be healthy. Patient education positions are far and few between because insurance companies do not cover the costs. [1]

'''Public Health Agencies''': are official, tax funded, government agencies. They provide police protection, educational systems, as well as clean air and water. Public health departments provide health services and are organized by a city, county, state, or federal government. [2]

'''School Health Education''': involves all strategies, activities, and services offered by, in, or in association with schools that are designed to promote students' physical, emotional, and social development. School health involves teaching students about health and health related behaviors. Curriculum and programs are based on the school's expectations and health. [3]

'''Non Profit Voluntary Health Agencies''': are created by concerned citizens to deal with health needs not met by governmental agencies. Missions include public education, professional education, patient education, research, direct services and support to or for people directly affected by a specific health or medical problem. Usually funded by such means as private donations, grants, and fund-raisers.[4]

'''Higher Education''': typically two types of positions health educators hold including academic, or faculty or health educator in a student health service or wellness center. As a faculty member, the health educator typically has three major responsibilities: teaching, community and professional service, and scholarly research. As a health educator in a university health service or wellness center, the major responsibility is to plan, implement, and evaluate health promotion and education programs for program participants. [5]

'''Work site Health Promotion''': is a combination of educational, organizational and environmental activities designed to improve the health and safety of employees and their families. These work site wellness programs offer an additional setting for health educators and allow them to reach segments of the population that are not easily reached through traditional community health programs. Some work site health promotion activities include: smoking cessation, stress management, bulletin boards, newsletters, and much more. [6]

'''Independent Consulting and Government Contracting''': international, national, regional, state, and local organizations contract with independent consultants for many reasons. They may be hired to assess individual and community needs for health education; plan, implement, administer and evaluate health education strategies; conduct research; serve as health education resource person; and or communicate about and advocate for health and health education. Government contractors are often behind national health education programs, government reports, public information web sites and telephone lines, media campaigns, conferences, and health education materials. [7]

She is a founder of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. Dr. Nysawnder pursued her interest in public health at the Works Progress Administration during the depression. She served with the Federal Works Agency contributing to the establishment of nursery schools and child care centers to accommodate young mothers working in defense plants. She set up these centers in 15 northeastern states.  This did not happen quickly so she advocated all over the nation to train people to act as foster parents for the children of working women. Dr. Nyswander became the director of the City health Center in [[Astoria, Queens]] in 1939.  She spent her time as director promoting the idea of New York City keeping an eye on the health of children.  They would do this by keeping records that would follow them to whatever school they might move to.  She wrote "Solving School Health Problems" which is an analysis of the health issues in New York children.  This is still used in public health education courses today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RICHARD SEVEROPublished: December 29, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/29/us/dorothy-bird-nyswander-104-promoted-public-health-education.html?sec=&amp;spon= |title=Dorothy Bird Nyswander, 104; Promoted Public Health Education - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mayhew Derryberry'''

Dr. Derryberry was born December 25, 1902 and earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry and mathematics at the [[University of Tennessee]].  He began his career in 1926 with the American Child Health Association as the director of one of the first large-scale studies of the health status of the nation’s schoolchildren.  A year after his work with the American Child Health Association he earned his master's degree in education and psychology at Columbia University.  He then went on to earn his doctorate and moved to the [[New York City]] Health Department as the secretary to the sanitary superintendent. He finally moved to Washington DC and joined the US Public Health Service as a senior public health analyst. He became chief of the Public Health Service and began assembling a team of behavioral scientists. They studied the nexus of behavior, social factors, and disease. Two scientists and Derryberry conducted the study of the role of health beliefs in explaining utilization of public health screening services. This work contributed to the development of the Health Belief Model. This provided an important theoretical foundation for modern health education. His legacy was very important because he engaged behavioral and social scientists in the problems of public health and gave importance to the role of that health education plays on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mayhew Derryberry: Pioneer of Health Education |date=2003-08-27 |pmc=1448259 | pmid=14998797 |volume=94 |journal=Am J Public Health |pages=370–1 |doi=10.2105/ajph.94.3.370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health Education Worldwide==
There are many countries which developed a Health Education curriculum. For example:

===Romania===
Since 2001, the Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sports developed a national curriculum on Health Education. The National Health Education Programme in Romanian Schools was considered as being a priority for the intervention of the GFATM (Global Fund) and UN Agencies.

===Japan===

[[Shokuiku]] ([[Kanji]]: 食育) is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for "[[food]] [[education]]". The law defines it as the "acquisition of knowledge about food and [[nutrition]], as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [[health]]y [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]".

It was initiated by [[Sagen Ishizuka]], a famous military doctor and pioneer of the [[macrobiotic diet]]. Following the introduction of Western [[fast food]] in the late 20th century, the Japanese government mandated education in nutrition and food origins, starting with the Basic Law of Shokuiku in 2005, and followed with the School Health Law in 2008. Universities have established programs to teach shokuiku in public schools, as well as investigating its effectiveness through academic study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jneb.org/article/S1499-4046%2809%2900149-3/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Major concerns that led to the development of shokuiku law include:
* Schoolchildren skipping breakfast.
* Children purchasing meals at a convenience store instead of eating with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/buzz/bz0601.html|title=shokuiku - Buzzword - Trends in Japan - Web Japan|author=|date=|website=web-japan.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Families not eating meals together.



Classes in shokuiku will study the processes of making food, such as farming or fermentation; how additives create flavor; and where food comes from.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Frank. "[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006150011/en Food and Education II : The Shokuiku in English Project]". ''Bulletin of Keiwa College'' 15 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
Health education in Poland is not mandatory, but research has shown that even with implantation of health education that the adolescents of Poland were still not choosing to live a health lifestyle. Health education is still needed in Poland, but the factor of what is actually available, especially in rural areas, and what is affordable affects the decisions more than what is healthy.

=== Taiwan ===

The Health education in [[Taiwan]] focus on multiple topic, this included but not limit to&lt;ref name="Taiwan Health Promoting Schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|url=http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|website=Taiwan Health Promoting Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125114011/http://hpshome.giee.ntnu.edu.tw/en/index.html|archivedate=2014-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4197">[[File:Hinman collator.jpg|thumb|A Hinman collator owned by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]]]
The '''Hinman collator''', an early [[optical collator]], was an [[opto-mechanical]] device for comparing pairs of documents for differences in the text. Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of [[Literature|literary]] works.

Invented by [[Charlton Hinman]] in the late 1940s, the device used [[light bulb|lights]] and [[mirror]]s to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]] of texts by eye.

The idea built on earlier work such as [[Carl Pulfrich|Carl Pulfrich's]] [[blink comparator]] used to help identify the former planet [[Pluto]], and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during [[World War II]].

Hinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The [[printing]] and [[bookbinding]] processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], and subsequently wrote about his findings in ''Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collation.folger.edu/2011/08/welcome-to-the-collation/ |title=Welcome to The Collation |last1=Werner |first1=Sarah |date=August 18, 2011 |website=The Collation |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more compact types of collator were developed in the 1960s, the last Hinman was built in 1978. In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The device was developed further by Randall McLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Daniel. [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9706/fieldnotes.html ''Through the looking glass.''] Lingua franca, June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Bill of Rights Law''' ('''IBRL'''), founded in 1982, is a center for the study of [[constitutional law]] at the [[The College of William &amp; Mary Law School|William &amp; Mary School of Law]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/ibrl/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; The IBRL focuses on enhancing a scholarly understanding of the nation's [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] by hosting an annual "Supreme Court Preview" that brings together constitutional and legal experts from law schools in the United States, as well as reporters and affiliates from the nation's news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/ibrl/supremecourtpreview/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323112137/http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/ibrl/supremecourtpreview/index.php |archivedate=2009-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also enables [[research fellow]]s to conduct constitutional research with law professors at the law school, and co-sponsors the ''Constitutional Conflicts'' book series&lt;ref&gt;http://law.wm.edu/academics/intellectuallife/researchcenters/ibrl/publications/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Duke University Law School]]. The Institute of Bill of Rights Law sponsors events such as Constitutional Originalism debates and various symposiums.

== Supreme Court Previews ==
The 20th annual Supreme Court Preview, sponsored by the IBRL, was held September 14–15, 2007, at the Marshall-Wythe School of Law. Speakers included [[Erwin Chemerinsky]], [[Walter E. Dellinger III]], [[John Yoo]], [[Michael W. McConnell]], [[Linda Greenhouse]], [[Dahlia Lithwick]], [[Stuart Taylor Jr.]], [[Ted Cruz]] and William &amp; Mary's own [[William Van Alstyne]]. A September 15 panel on the [[Roberts Court]] (with Chemerinsky, Yoo and Greenhouse) was aired on [[C-SPAN]].

The 21st annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 26–27, 2008, again at William &amp; Mary's Law School. Panelists included appellate judges from the Sixth, Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits; journalists from [[CNN]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''; and Supreme Court advocates and U.S. legal scholars.

The 22nd annual Supreme Court Preview was held October 2–3, 2009, at [[The College of William &amp; Mary Law School|William &amp; Mary School of Law]]. [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] (retired) and Chancellor of [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], was the distinguished guest. Panelists included [[Beth Brinkman]] (Deputy Assistant Attorney General), [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] (Dean, [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]]), two former Solicitors General of the United States, and journalists and law professors from all over the nation. 

The 23rd annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 24–25, 2010. In addition to reviewing the Supreme Court's forthcoming docket, panels were held on [[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]], the same-sex marriage case then on appeal before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and on the constitutionality of the recently passed [[health insurance mandate]]. Panelists included four former Solicitors General, [[Jeffrey Sutton]] ([[United States Court of Appeal|U.S. Court of Appeals]] for the Sixth Circuit), law professors from [[Yale Law School]] and [[Stanford Law School]], and Supreme Court correspondents for five national publications.

The 25th annual Supreme Court Preview was held September 28–29, 2012. The moot court case was Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin, argued by Erwin Chemerinsky (University of California at Irvine) and Amy Wax (University of Pennsylvania Law School). Other panel topics included Gay Rights, Business Law, and Election Law. Participants included [[Debo P. Adegbile]] (NAACP), Joan Biskupic (Reuters), Michael Carvin (Jones Day), Walter Dellinger (O'Melveny &amp; Myers), Linda Greenhouse (Yale Law School), Neal Katyal (Hogan Lovells), and Adam Liptak (New York Times).

== Leadership ==
The director of the IBRL is currently Neal E. Devins, Goodrich Professor of Law at William &amp; Mary. Past directors include Davison M. Douglas (Arthur B. Hanson Professor of Law at Marshall-Wythe) and [[Gene Nichol]].

'''Lauric acid''' or systematically, '''dodecanoic acid''', is a [[saturated fat|saturated]] [[fatty acid]] with a 12-carbon atom chain, thus having many properties of [[Medium-chain triglyceride|medium-chain fatty acids]], is a bright white, powdery solid with a faint odor of bay oil or soap.  The [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s of lauric acid are known as '''laurates'''.

==Occurrence==
[[File:ローレルオイル.JPG|200px|thumbnail|left|Laurel oil contains lauric acid.]]
Lauric acid, as a component of [[triglyceride]]s, comprises about half of the fatty-acid content in [[coconut milk]], [[coconut oil]], [[Laurus nobilis|laurel oil]], and  [[palm kernel oil]] (not to be confused with [[palm oil]]),&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |title=Lexicon of lipid nutrition (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=685–744 |url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/73/4/0685/ |doi=10.1351/pac200173040685 |last1=Beare-Rogers |first1=J. |last2=Dieffenbacher |first2=A. |last3=Holm |first3=J.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J.

It is also found in human [[breast milk]] (6.2% of total fat), cow's milk (2.9%), and goat's milk (3.1%).&lt;ref name="lexicon" /&gt;

==Properties==
Although 95% of medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed through the [[portal vein]], only 25-30% of lauric acid is absorbed through it.&lt;ref name="pmid26946252"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Eyres L, Eyres MF, Chisholm A, Brown RC | title=Coconut oil consumption and cardiovascular risk factors in humans | journal= [[Nutrition Reviews]] | volume=74 | issue=4 | pages=267–280 | year=2016 | url=https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | doi= 10.1093/nutrit/nuw002 | pmc= 4892314 | pmid = 26946252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other [[fatty acid]]s, lauric acid is inexpensive, has a long shelf-life, is nontoxic, and is safe to handle. It is used mainly for the production of [[soap]]s and [[cosmetics]].  For these purposes, lauric acid is reacted with [[sodium hydroxide]] to give [[sodium laurate]], which is a [[soap]].  Most commonly, sodium laurate is obtained by [[saponification]] of various oils, such as coconut oil.  These precursors give mixtures of sodium laurate and other soaps.&lt;ref name="Ullmann" /&gt;

===Niche uses===
In the laboratory, lauric acid may be used to investigate the [[molar mass]] of an unknown substance via the [[freezing-point depression]]. The choice of lauric acid is convenient because the melting point of the pure compound is relatively high (43.8°C). Its [[cryoscopic constant]] is 3.9°C·kg/mol. By melting lauric acid with the unknown substance, allowing it to cool, and recording the temperature at which the mixture freezes, the molar mass of the unknown compound may be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523055404/https://eee.uci.edu/programs/gchem/02MANfrzptdep.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-05-23 |publisher=[[University of California, Irvine]] |title=Using Freezing Point Depression to find Molecular Weight |date=2010-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential medicinal properties===
''[[In vitro]]'' experiments have suggested that some fatty acids including lauric acid could be a useful component in a treatment for [[acne]], but no clinical trials have yet been conducted to evaluate this potential benefit in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakatsuji|first1=T|last2=Kao|first2=MC|last3=Fang|first3=JY|last4=Zouboulis|first4=CC|last5=Zhang|first5=L|last6=Gallo|first6=RL|last7=Huang|first7=CM|title=Antimicrobial Property of Lauric Acid Against Propionibacterium acnes: Its Therapeutic Potential for Inflammatory Acne Vulgaris|journal=The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=129|issue=10|pages=2480–8|year=2009|pmid=19387482|pmc=2772209|doi=10.1038/jid.2009.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Yang|first1 = D|last2 = Pornpattananangkul|first2 = D|last3 = Nakatsuji|first3 = T|last4 = Chan|first4 = M|last5 = Carson|first5 = D|last6 = Huang|first6 = CM|last7 = Zhang|first7 = L|title = The Antimicrobial Activity of Liposomal Lauric Acids Against Propionibacterium acnes|journal = Biomaterials|volume = 30|issue = 30|pages = 6035–40|year = 2009|pmid = 19665786|pmc = 2735618|doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauric acid increases total serum [[cholesterol]] more than many other fatty acids, but most of the increase is attributable to an increase in [[high-density lipoprotein|high-density lipoprotein (HDL)]] (the "good" blood cholesterol). As a result, lauric acid has been characterized as having "a more favorable effect on total HDL cholesterol than any other fatty acid [examined], either saturated or unsaturated".&lt;ref name=Mensink2003&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials | url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/77/5/1146.full?ijkey=846a72387ebc0d82545acd5442a0c3a9e9fc3566 | journal =American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |vauthors=Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB | volume=77 | issue=5  | pages = 1146–1155 |date=May 2003 | issn = 0002-9165 | pmid = 12716665}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a lower total/HDL serum cholesterol ratio correlates with a decrease in atherosclerotic risk.&lt;ref name=Thijssen&gt;Thijssen, M.A. and R.P.

'''Loss exchange ratio''' is a [[figure of merit]] in [[attrition warfare]]. It is usually relevant to a condition or state of war where one side depletes the resources of another through attrition. Specifically and most often used as a comparator in aerial combat, where it is known as a '''kill-ratio'''. For example, during the [[Korean War]], American combat jets had a kill-ratio of 4-1.{{dubious|date=January 2013}} This means for every four aircraft shot down by an American aircraft, one American plane was shot down by an enemy fighter.

== Historical applications ==
Loss exchange ratio has played a significant role in past wars, especially those that have devolved into [[stalemate]] and become wars of [[attrition warfare|attrition]]. For example, the German objective at the [[Battle of Verdun]] (1916) during World War I was not the seizure of any strategic objective, but rather to inflict an LER of 2:1 on the French forces and thereby cripple the French army.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}

During the [[First Indochina War]], [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], the leader of the [[Việt Minh]], told his French opposite number that "you can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, and at that rate, I will still triumph." In fact, the LER was approximately 3:1 in favor of the French, and they did indeed withdraw in defeat. A total of 500,000+ Vietnamese were either killed, wounded or captured during the First Indochina War.&lt;ref&gt;Smedberg, M (2008), ''Vietnamkrigen: 1880–1980''. Historiska Media, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary employment==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{See also|Network-centric warfare}}
It is arguable that the concept of the Loss exchange ratio has become relatively less important in modern Western military doctrine, as some military theories{{who|date=January 2013}} posit that it is just as militarily effective to [[Interdiction|disrupt enemy forces]] and outmaneuver them, thereby reducing their combat effectiveness without necessarily inflicting massive casualties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2414">'''Masreliez theorem''' describes a [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive algorithm]] within the technology of extended [[Kalman filter]], named after the Swedish-American [[physicist]] [[C. Johan Masreliez|John Masreliez]], who is its author.  The algorithm estimates the state of a [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]] with the help of often incomplete measurements marred by [[distortion]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Cipra &amp; A. Rubio; [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k638271765473144/ ''Kalman filter with a non-linear non-Gaussian observation relation''], Springer (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Masreliez's theorem produces estimates that are quite good approximations to the exact [[Conditional expectation|conditional mean]] in [[Non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussian]] additive outlier (AO) situations.  Some evidence for this can be had by [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]]s.&lt;ref name=jasa87&gt;{{Citation|author=R. Douglas Martin and Adrian E. Raftery |accessdate=2016-03-27 |date=December 1987 |publication-date=2003-10-15 |title=Robustness, Computation, and Non-Euclidean Models |trans-title= |pages=1044–1050 |publisher=[[Journal of the American Statistical Association]] |language= |url=https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/martin1987.pdf |quote= }} (PDF 1465 kB)&lt;!--Journal of the American Statistical Association December 1987. Vol. 82. No. 400, Theory and Methods--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The key approximation property used to construct these filters is that the [[Density (disambiguation)#Mathematics|state prediction density]] is approximately [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]]. Masreliez discovered in 1975 that this approximation yields an intuitively appealing [[Non-Gaussianity|non-Gaussian]] filter recursions, with [[Data dependency|data dependent]] [[covariance]] (unlike the Gaussian case) this derivation also provides one of the nicest ways of establishing the standard Kalman filter recursions.  Some theoretical justification for use of the Masreliez approximation is provided by the "continuity of state prediction densities" theorem in Martin (1979).&lt;ref name=jasa87/&gt;

'''Minnie Cumnock Blodgett''' (1862&amp;ndash;1931) graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1884, later becoming a trustee (1917&amp;ndash;1931). She is the mother of Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20), who was also a Vassar trustee (1942&amp;ndash;1954), and was chairman of the Board (1945&amp;ndash;1952).&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1928/1928-blodgett.html |title= The Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics was completed, York &amp; Sawyer, architects. -  - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu/ |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, [[John W. Blodgett]], built their estate, which they named [[John W. Blodgett Estate|Brookby]], where they made their Grand Rapids home.

==Vassar College and Euthenics program==
After [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932), another of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae, continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in [[euthenics]] at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna Minnie Cumnock Blodgett, who with her husband, John Wood Blodgett, offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]].  Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar President [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, through a gift of $550,000.00 from Mrs. Blodgett, the Institute of Euthenics was founded at Vassar.  Its aim was "to supply scientific knowledge of the complex problems of adjustment between individuals and the environment, emphasizing home and family."&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D1EFC395F177A93C6A8178BD95F458385F9 |title= SOCIAL WORKER DIES AT 68 ON VISIT HERE - Mrs. John W.

Their intention was to bring into the curriculum of the College a course of study specifically designed around the ideas of Ellen Swallow Richards."

==Death==
Mrs. John Wood Blodgett died suddenly of heart disease on October 13, 1931 in her suite in [[The St. Regis Hotel]], New York, NY.  She was there to attend meetings for two health organizations and spend some time visiting her daughter and son-in-law.  According to her obituary in the ''New York Times'', she was a director of  the Child Study Association, the National Organization for Public Health Nursing, and was a member of the National Committee on Mental Hygiene. She was the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Alexander G. Cunnock [sic] of Lowell, Mass. She was also president of the D.A. Blodgett Home for Children, and sat on the board of trustees at Vassar College.&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary" /&gt;

===Quantum Dot Enhancement Film (QDEF)===
{{see also|Quantum dot display}}
Nanosys Quantum Dot Enhancement Film, or QDEF, is an optical film component for LED driven LCDs. Each sheet of QDEF contains trillions of tiny [[Quantum Dot]] [[Phosphors]]. QDEF enables [[LED-backlit LCD]]s to be brighter and more colorful by providing a high quality, tri-color white light from a standard blue [[LED]] light source. Larger than a water molecule, but smaller than a virus, these tiny phosphors convert blue light from a standard [[Gallium Nitride]] (GaN) LED into different wavelengths based upon their size. Larger dots emit longer wavelengths (red), while smaller dots emit shorter wavelengths (green). Blending together a mix of dot colors allows Nanosys to precisely engineer a new spectrum of light to customer specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://www.economist.com/node/18833511?story_id=18833511
| title = The Economist: Dotting The Eyes, How tiny crystals can improve picture quality
| date = June 16, 2011
| accessdate = July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quantum Dots are tuned to create better color by changing their size during fabrication to emit light at just the right wavelengths. Traditional light emitting materials such as crystal phosphors have a broad fixed spectrum. Quantum dots can convert light to nearly any color in the visible spectrum, giving display designers the ability to tune and match the spectrum more accurately to color filters while improving energy efficiency.
Designed to replace the functionality of a diffuser sheet while actively converting color, QDEF can be added to an LCD's film stack with little change in overall thickness or manufacturing process (Fig 1).

QDEF was announced on May 17, 2011 at the [[Society for Information Display]] (SID) Display Week tradeshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Pancar Merah has a circular shape with a diameter of 50-70 mm, it is made from silver, copper, silver plated copper or brass and is richly engraved on both sides with Arabic scripts.
On the front side a Pancar Merah is usually engraved with the [[99 Names of Allah]] (Al Asma Ul Husna) and the back side is engraved in accordance with the wishes of the talisman`s orderer (fortune, charisma, security, love or similar).

Pancar Merah is made by a skilled person with a high spiritual level, usually a kyai (ulama, sheikh), and it is crafted only in certain times or periods before or after praying or fasting.

The most notable pieces of Pancar Merah were made in desa (village) Dalam Pagar near [[Martapura, South Kalimantan]], Indonesia before World War II.

[[Image:PRIO.JPG|thumb|The Peace Research Institute Oslo]]
The '''Peace Research Institute Oslo''' ({{lang-no|Institutt for fredsforskning}}; '''PRIO''') is an independent [[peace and conflict studies]] research institution, based in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It is regarded as the world's "oldest and most prominent peace research center."&lt;ref&gt;David P. Barash,Charles P. Webel, ''Peace and Conflict Studies'', p. 26, SAGE Publications, 2013, {{ISBN|1483315827}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by [[Johan Galtung]], the principal founder of peace and conflict studies, who was the institute's first director. The ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', the discipline's preeminent journal, is also published by the institute.

The institute is mainly funded by the [[Research Council of Norway]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and also receives funding from the [[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]], various international organisations such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Union]], and private foundations. The institute has around 75 employees. PRIO headquarters are located in central Oslo, next to the headquarters of the [[Norwegian Red Cross]].

==History and governance==
[[File:Johan Galtung - Trento.JPG|thumb|[[Johan Galtung]], PRIO's founder and first director, is regarded as the principal founder of [[peace and conflict studies]], and coined the term [[peacebuilding]]]]

PRIO was founded in 1959 by a group of Norwegian researchers led by [[Johan Galtung]]. The institute originally was a department of the [[Norwegian Institute for Social Research]] in Oslo and became an independent institute in 1966. It was one of the first centres of peace research in the world, and it is Norway’s only peace research institute.&lt;ref name=Forr &gt;Forr, Gudleiv. (2009). ''Strid og fred. Fredsforskning i 50 år: PRIO 1959-2009''. Oslo: Pax&lt;/ref&gt; The institute's director since 2009 is [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]], with [[Inger Skjelsbæk]] as deputy director. Since 2005, the institute has been located in the former gas works building in central Oslo.

PRIO is an independent foundation, governed by a seven-member board. The board includes two PRIO employees, two members appointed by the [[Research Council of Norway]], one member appointed by the Institute for Social Research, one by the [[University of Oslo]], and one by the [[Nordic International Studies Association]].&lt;ref name=statutes &gt;[http://www.prio.no/Global/upload/About%20Prio/PRIO-Statutes-2010.pdf PRIO statutes] (2010), Retrieved 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous PRIO directors are, chronologically, [[Johan Galtung]] (1959–69), [[Asbjørn Eide]] (1970, 1980–81), [[Helge Hveem]] (1971), [[Nils Petter Gleditsch]] (1972, 1977–78), [[Kjell Skjelsbæk]] (1973–74), [[Ole Kristian Holthe]] (1975–76), [[Tord Høivik]] (1979–80, 1984–86), [[Marek Thee]] (1981–83), [[Sverre Lodgaard]] (1986–92), [[Hilde Henriksen Waage]] (const., 1992–93), [[Dan Smith (British author)|Dan Smith]] (1993–2001), [[Stein Tønnesson]] (2001–09), [[Kristian Berg Harpviken]] (2009-2017), and [[Henrik Urdal]] (2017-present). After Galtung's resignation in 1969, the institute staff elected a leader for one year at a time. In 1986 this was changed to a three-year period, and again in 1993 to a maximum of two consecutive four-year periods.&lt;ref name=Forr /&gt;

PRIOs first chairman of the board was [[Erik Rinde]] (1966–79), director of [[Institute for Social Research]]. He was succeeded by [[Torstein Eckhoff]] (1979–1986), [[Bernt Bull]] (1987–94), [[Frida Nokken]] (1995-2000), [[Helge Pharo]] (2000–2003), [[Øyvind Østerud]] (2004–06), [[Bernt Aardal]] (2007–2016) and [[Åslaug Marie Haga]] (2016 - present).&lt;ref name=Forr /&gt;

== Research ==
The institute's purpose, as formulated in the statutes, is "to engage in research concerning the conditions for peaceful relations between nations, groups and individuals".&lt;ref name=statutes /&gt; Researchers come from a variety of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], [[human geography]], [[history]], [[history of religion]], and [[philosophy]]. Output from the research is primarily published as articles in [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journals]], anthologies or monographs, but also as more policy-oriented reports and papers such as PRIO's in-house series.

Approximately 15 percent of the institute's budget is made up of a core grant from the Research Council of Norway, and the remaining 85 per cent is funded on project basis.&lt;ref&gt;"Income Statement", in [http://www.prio.no/Global/upload/About%20Prio/Annual%20Reports/PRIO%20Annual%20Report%202011.pdf PRIO Annual Report 2011] (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The two largest project funders are the Research Council of Norway and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. Other funders include the [[European Union]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Defence]]. In 2009, PRIO initiated the founding of the US based Peace Research Endowment.

In Oslo, PRIO hosts the Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers. This is a joint initiative of PRIO, the [[Norwegian Red Cross]] and the [[Norwegian Church Aid]] to help block the spread of [[small arms]] to areas where they are likely to be used in warfare, armed violence or human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Ole-Petter Sunde (1999), [http://www.geneva-forum.org/Reports/salw_vol1/19990505.pdf "The Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers: West Africa and Beyond"], in ''The Geneva Forum. Seminars on Small Arms (Volume 1)'', Geneva: The Geneva Forum (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The staff comprises a core group of 40-50 full-time researchers and support staff. In addition, there are researchers with a part-time affiliation with PRIO, visiting scholars, interns and students. PRIO cooperates with the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in offering master programmes in international studies.

===Research centres===

====Centre for the Study of Civil War====
From 2003 to 2012, PRIO hosted the Centre for the Study of Civil War, one of the original 13 "Centres of Excellence" in Norway. The director for the full 10-year period was [[Scott Gates (academic)|Scott Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Lund &amp; Else Lie (2012), [http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Newsarticle/Supplying_tools_to_counteract_civil_war/1253981751008 "Supplying tools to counteract civil war"], Research Council of Norway website (retrieved 13 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyprus Centre====
The institute maintains a centre in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], known as the PRIO Cyprus Centre. Through its network, projects and dialogue forums, the PRIO Cyprus Centre aims to foster cooperation between [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] and strengthen regional cooperation in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus.prio.org/ PRIO Cyprus Centre website], Retrieved 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
PRIO owns two academic journals, both edited at the institute and published by [[SAGE Publications]]: ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', edited by [[Henrik Urdal]] and ''[[Security Dialogue]]'', edited by [[Mark B. Salter]].

==PRIO Annual Peace Address==
Initiated in 2010, the PRIO Annual Peace Address intends to create awareness, stir public debate and increase understanding about the conditions for peace in the world. Inviting researchers and other people with strong views on peace-related topics, the idea is to challenge the peace research community by suggesting new measures and bringing new perspectives on peace and war.

{{Spirituality sidebar |western}}
'''Perennial philosophy''' ({{lang-la|philosophia perennis}}),{{refn|group=note| more fully, ''philosophia perennis et universalis''; sometimes shortened to ''sophia perennis'' or ''religio perennis''}} also referred to as '''perennialism''' and '''perennial wisdom''', is a perspective in modern spirituality that views each of the world's religious traditions as sharing a single, metaphysical truth or origin from which all esoteric and exoteric knowledge and doctrine has grown.

Perennialism has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}

A more popular interpretation argues for [[universalism]], the idea that all religions, underneath seeming differences point to the same Truth. In the early 19th century the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] propagated the idea of a metaphysical Truth and universalism, which inspired the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], who proselytized among Indian elites. Towards the end of the 19th century, the [[Theosophical Society]] further popularized universalism, not only in the western world, but also in western colonies. In the 20th century universalism was further popularized in the English-speaking world through the [[neo-Vedanta]] inspired Traditionalist School, which argues for a metaphysical, single origin of the orthodox religions, and by [[Aldous Huxley]] and his book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which was inspired by [[neo-Vedanta]] and the Traditionalist School.

==Definition==

===Renaissance===
The idea of a perennial philosophy originated with a number of [[Renaissance]] theologians who took inspiration from [[neo-Platonism]] and from the [[theory of Forms]]. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the [[Theory of Forms|realm of ideas]].{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 508}} According to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–1494), a student of Ficino, truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 513}} According to [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p= 517}}

===Traditionalist School===
The contemporary, scholarly oriented [[Traditionalist School]] continues this metaphysical orientation. According to the Traditionalist School, the perennial philosophy is "absolute Truth and infinite Presence."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Absolute Truth is "the perennial wisdom (''sophia perennis'') that stands as the transcendent source of all the intrinsically orthodox religions of humankind."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} Infinite Presence is "the perennial religion (''religio perennis'') that lives within the heart of all intrinsically orthodox religions."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xii}} The Traditionalist School discerns a transcendent and an immanent dimension, namely the discernment of the Real or [[absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], c.q. that which is permanent; and the intentional "mystical concentration on the Real."{{sfn|Lings|Minnaar|2007|p=xiii}}

According to Soares de Azevedo, the perennialist philosophy states that the universal truth is the same within each of the world's orthodox religious traditions, and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine. Each world religion is an interpretation of this universal truth, adapted to cater for the psychological, intellectual, and social needs of a given culture of a given period of history. This perennial truth has been rediscovered in each epoch by [[Mysticism|mystics]] of all kinds who have revived already existing religions, when they had fallen into empty platitudes and hollow ceremonialism.{{sfn|Soares de Azevedo|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

Shipley further notes that the Traditionalist School is oriented on orthodox traditions, and rejects modern syncretism and universalism, which creates new religions from older religions and compromise the standing traditions.{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}}

===Aldous Huxley and mystical universalism===
One such universalist was Aldous Huxley,{{sfn|Shipley|2015|p=84}} who propagated a universalist interpretation of the world religions, inspired by Vivekananda's [[neo-Vedanta]]. According to Aldous Huxley, who popularized the idea of a perennial philosophy with a larger audience,
{{quote|The Perennial Philosophy is expressed most succinctly in the Sanskrit formula, [[tat tvam asi]] ('That thou art'); the Atman, or immanent eternal Self, is one with Brahman, the Absolute Principle of all existence; and the last end of every human being, is to discover the fact for himself, to find out who he really is.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

In Huxley's 1944 essay in ''Vedanta and the West'', he describes ''The Minimum Working Hypothesis''; the basic outline of the perennial philosophy found in all the mystic branches of the religions of the world:

{{quote| That there is a Godhead or Ground, which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestation.

That the Ground is transcendent and immanent.

That it is possible for human beings to love, know and, from virtually, to become actually identified with the Ground.

That to achieve this unitive knowledge, to realize this supreme identity, is the final end and purpose of human existence.

That there is a Law or Dharma, which must be obeyed, a Tao or Way, which must be followed, if men are to achieve their final end.|}}

==Origins==
{{Main|Neo-Platonism|Agape}}

The perennial philosophy originates from a blending of neo-Platonism and [[Christianity]]. Neo-Platonism itself has diverse origins in the syncretic culture of the [[Hellenistic period]], and was an influential philosophy throughout the Middle Ages.

===Classical world===

====Hellenistic period: religious syncretism====
{{See also|Religious syncretism}}

During the [[Hellenistic period]], [[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|campaigns]] brought about exchange of cultural ideas on its path throughout most of the known world of his era. The Greek [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries]] mixed with such influences as the [[Cult of Isis]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Indo-Greeks|Hinduism]], along with some Persian influences. Such [[cross-cultural]] exchange was not new to the Greeks; the [[Egyptian god]] Osiris and the [[Greek god]] Dionysus had been equated as [[Osiris-Dionysus]] by the historian Herodotus as early as the 5th century BC (see [[Interpretatio graeca]]).{{sfn|Durant|Durant|1966|p=188-192}}{{sfn|McEvilley|2002}}

====Roman world: Philo of Alexandria====
[[Philo]] of Alexandria (c.25 BCE – c.50 CE) attempted to reconcile Greek Rationalism with the Torah, which helped pave the way for Christianity with [[Neo-Platonism]], and the adoption of the Old Testament with Christianity, as opposed to Gnostic Marcion roots of Christianity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Philo translated [[Judaism]] into terms of [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] elements, and held that God is "supra rational" and can be reached only through "ecstasy." He also held that the [[oracles]] of God supply the material of moral and religious knowledge.

====Neo-Platonism====
{{Main|Neoplatonism}}

Neoplatonism arose in the 3rd century CE and persisted until shortly after the closing of the [[Platonic Academy]] in Athens in AD 529 by [[Justinian I]]. Neoplatonists were heavily influenced by [[Plato]], but also by the Platonic tradition that thrived during the six centuries which separated the first of the Neoplatonists from Plato. The work of Neoplatonic philosophy involved describing the derivation of the whole of reality from a single principle, "the One." It was founded by [[Plotinus]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/neoplato/ ''IEP'']&lt;/ref&gt; and has been very influential throughout history. In the [[Middle Ages]], Neoplatonic ideas were integrated into the philosophical and theological works of many of the most important medieval Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thinkers.

===Renaissance===

====Ficino and Pico della Mirandola====
[[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433–1499) believed that [[Hermes Trismegistos]], the supposed author of the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', was a contemporary of Mozes and the teacher of [[Pythagoras]], and the source of both Greek and Jewish-Christian thought.{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} He argued that there is an underlying unity to the world, the soul or love, which has a counterpart in the realm of ideas. Platonic Philosophy and Christian theology both embody this truth. Ficino was influenced by a variety of philosophers including Aristotelian [[Scholasticism]] and various pseudonymous and mystical writings. Ficino saw his thought as part of a long development of philosophical truth, of ancient pre-Platonic philosophers (including [[Zoroaster]], [[Hermes Trismegistus]], [[Orpheus]], Aglaophemus and [[Pythagoras]]) who reached their peak in Plato. The [[Prisca theologia]], or venerable and ancient theology, which embodied the truth and could be found in all ages, was a vitally important idea for Ficino.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}}

[[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463–94), a student of Ficino, went further than his teacher by suggesting that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. This proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] among other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} After the deaths of Pico and Ficino this line of thought expanded, and included [[Symphorien Champier]], and [[Francesco Giorgio]].

====Steuco====

=====De perenni philosophia libri X=====
The term ''perenni philosophia'' was first used by [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497–1548) who used it to title a treatise, ''De perenni philosophia libri X'', published in 1540.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}} ''De perenni philosophia'' was the most sustained attempt at philosophical synthesis and harmony.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=515}} Steuco represents the liberal wing of 16th-century Biblical scholarship and theology, although he rejected Luther and Calvin.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} ''De perenni philosophia'', is a complex work which only contains the term philosophia perennis twice. It states that there is "one principle of all things, of which there has always been one and the same knowledge among all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;''De perenni philosophia Bk 1'', Ch 1; folio 1 in Schmitt (1966) P.517&lt;/ref&gt; This single knowledge (or sapientia) is the key element in his philosophy. In that he emphasises continuity over progress, Steuco's idea of philosophy is not one conventionally associated with the [[Renaissance]]. Indeed, he tends to believe that the truth is lost over time and is only preserved in the [[Prisca theologia|prisci theologica]]. Steuco preferred Plato to Aristotle and saw greater congruence between the former and Christianity than the latter philosopher. He held that philosophy works in harmony with religion and should lead to knowledge of God, and that truth flows from a single source, more ancient than the Greeks. Steuco was strongly influenced by [[Iamblichus]]'s statement that knowledge of God is innate in all,&lt;ref&gt;''Jamblichi De mysteriis liber'', ed. Gustavus Parthey (Berlin), I, 3; 7-10&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave great importance to Hermes Trismegistus.

=====Influence=====
Steuco's perennial philosophy was highly regarded by some scholars for the two centuries after its publication, then largely forgotten until it was rediscovered by Otto Willmann in the late part of the 19th century.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=516}} Overall, ''De perenni philosophia'' wasn't particularly influential, and largely confined to those with a similar orientation to himself. The work was not put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] of works banned by the Roman Catholic Church, although his ''Cosmopoeia'' which expressed similar ideas was. Religious criticisms tended to the conservative view that held Christian teachings should be understood as unique, rather than seeing them as perfect expressions of truths that are found everywhere.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=527}} More generally, this philosophical [[syncretism]] was set out at the expense of some of the doctrines included within it, and it is possible that Steuco's critical faculties were not up to the task he had set himself. Further, placing so much confidence in the prisca theologia, turned out to be a shortcoming as many of the texts used in this school of thought later turned out to be bogus.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=524}} In the following two centuries the most favourable responses were largely Protestant and often in England.

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] later picked up on Steuco's term. The German philosopher stands in the tradition of this concordistic philosophy; his [[Pre-established harmony|philosophy of harmony]] especially had affinity with Steuco's ideas. Leibniz knew about Steuco's work by 1687, but thought that ''De la Verite de la Religion Chretienne'' by Huguenot philosopher [[Phillippe du Plessis-Mornay]] expressed the same truth better. Steuco's influence can be found throughout Leibniz's works, but the German was the first philosopher to refer to the perennial philosophy without mentioning the Italian.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=530-531}}

==Popularisation==

===Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism===
{{Main|Transcendentalism|Universalism}}

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882) was a pioneer of the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Leigh Eric. ''Restless Souls : The Making of American Spirituality''. San Francisco: Harper, 2005. {{ISBN|0-06-054566-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the major figures in [[Transcendentalism]], an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement, which was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref group=web name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopdeia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis"&gt;[http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm Jone John Lewis, ''What is Transcendentalism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of Hindu texts appeared, which were also read by the Transcendentalists, and influenced their thinking.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt; They also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.&lt;ref group=web name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Andrews"&gt;[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophical Society===
{{main|Theosophical Society}}

By the end of the 19th century, the idea of a perennial philosophy was popularized by leaders of the Theosophical Society such as [[H. P. Blavatsky]] and [[Annie Besant]], under the name of "Wisdom-Religion" or "Ancient Wisdom".&lt;ref name="key"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Theosophical Society took an active interest in Asian religions, subsequently not only bringing those religions under the attention of a western audience but also influencing Hinduism and Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Japan.

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main|Advaita Vedanta|Neo-Vedanta|Hinduism in the West|Neo-Advaita}}

Many perennialist thinkers (including Armstrong, Huston Smith and [[Joseph Campbell]]) are influenced by Hindu reformer [[Ram Mohan Roy]] and Hindu mystics [[Ramakrishna]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero p.166&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves have taken over western notions of universalism.{{sfn|King|2002}} They regarded Hinduism to be a token of this perennial philosophy. This notion has influenced thinkers who have proposed versions of the perennial philosophy in the 20th century.{{sfn|King|2002}}

The unity of all religions was a central impulse among Hindu reformers in the 19th century, who in turn influenced many 20th-century perennial philosophy-type thinkers. Key figures in this reforming movement included two Bengali Brahmins. [[Ram Mohan Roy]], a philosopher and the founder of the modernising [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious organisation, reasoned that the divine was beyond description and thus that no religion could claim a monopoly in their understanding of it.

The mystic [[Ramakrishna]]'s spiritual ecstasies included experiencing the sameness of Christ, Mohammed and his own Hindu deity. Ramakrishna's most famous disciple, [[Swami Vivekananda]], travelled to the United States in the 1890s where he formed the [[Vedanta Society]].

Roy, Ramakrishna and Vivekananda were all influenced by the Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prothero, Stephen (2010) ''God is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World—and Why Their Differences Matter'', p. 165-6, HarperOne, {{ISBN|0-06-157127-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they saw as the exemplification of a Universalist Hindu religiosity.{{sfn|King|2002}}

===Traditionalist School===
{{Main|Traditionalist School}}

The Traditionalist School was a group of 20th century thinkers concerned with what they considered to be the demise of traditional forms of knowledge, both aesthetic and spiritual, within Western society. The principal thinkers in this tradition are [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]].  Other important thinkers in this tradition include [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Martin Lings]], [[Jean-Louis Michon]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Jean Borella]], [[Elémire Zolla]]. According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the "philosophia perennis" designates a worldview that is opposed to the [[scientism]] of modern [[secular]] societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular [[developed world]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} This view is exemplified by [[Rene Guenon]] in his ''magnum opus'' and one of the founding works of the [[traditionalist school]], ''[[The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times]]''.

According to [[Frithjof Schuon]]:
{{quote|It has been said more than once that total Truth is inscribed in an eternal script in the very substance of our spirit; what the different Revelations do is to "crystallize" and "actualize", in different degrees according to the case, a nucleus of certitudes which not only abides forever in the divine Omniscience, but also sleeps by refraction in the "naturally supernatural" kernel of the individual, as well as in that of each ethnic or historical collectivity or of the human species as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Writings of Frithjof Schuon,'' Suhayl Academy, Lahore, 2001, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Aldous Huxley===
{{See also|The Perennial Philosophy}}

The term was popularized in more recent times by [[Aldous Huxley]], who was profoundly influenced by [[Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda's]] [[Neo-Vedanta]] and [[Universalism]].{{sfn|Roy|2003}} In his 1945 book ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' he defined the perennial philosophy as:
{{quote|... the [[metaphysic]] that recognizes a divine Reality substantial to the world of things and lives and minds; the [[psychology]] that finds in the soul something similar to, or even identical to, divine Reality; the [[ethic]] that places man's final end in the knowledge of the [[Immanence|immanent]] and [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Ground of being|Ground of all being]]; the thing is immemorial and universal. Rudiments of the perennial philosophy may be found among the traditional lore of primitive peoples in every region of the world, and in its fully developed forms it has a place in every one of the higher religions.{{sfn|Huxley|1945|p=vii}}}}

In contrast to the Traditionalist school, Huxley emphasized [[mystical experience]] over metaphysics:
{{quote|The Buddha declined to make any statement in regard to the ultimate divine Reality. All he would talk about was Nirvana, which is the name of the [[Phenomenology of religion|experience that comes to]] the totally selfless and one-pointed [...] Maintaining, in this matter, the attitude of a strict operationalist, the Buddha would speak only of the spiritual experience, not of the metaphysical entity presumed by the theologians of other religions, as also of later Buddhism, to be the object and (since in contemplation the knower, the known and the knowledge are all one) at the same time the subject and substance of that experience.{{sfn|Huxley|1945}}}}

According to Aldous Huxley, in order to apprehend the divine reality, one must choose to fulfill certain conditions: "making themselves loving, pure in heart and poor in spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that very few people can achieve this state.  Those who have fulfilled these conditions, grasped the universal truth and interpreted it have generally been given the name of saint, prophet, sage or enlightened one.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley argues that those who have, "modified their merely human mode of being," and have thus been able to comprehend "more than merely human kind and amount of knowledge" have also achieved this enlightened state.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. The perennial philosophy . [1st ed. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1945. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Age===
{{Main|New Age|New Age Movement}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy is central to the New Age Movement. The New Age movement is a [[Western culture|Western]] [[spirituality|spiritual]] movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. Its central precepts have been described as "drawing on both Eastern and Western spiritual and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] traditions and infusing them with influences from [[self-help]] and motivational [[psychology]], [[holistic health]], [[parapsychology]], consciousness research and [[quantum physics]]".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=12}} The term ''New Age'' refers to the coming [[astrological age|astrological]] [[Age of Aquarius]].&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"/&gt;

The New Age aims to create "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas" that is inclusive and [[religious pluralism|pluralistic]].{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=8}} It holds to "a holistic worldview",{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=11}} emphasising that the [[dialectical monism|Mind, Body and Spirit]] are interrelated&lt;ref group=web name="JGMelton"&gt;Melton, J. Gordon – Director Institute for the Study of American Religion. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060614001357/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/newage.html New Age Transformed], retrieved 2006-06&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is a form of [[monism]] and unity throughout the universe.&lt;ref name="Langone"&gt;Michael D. Langone, Ph.D. Cult Observer, 1993, Volume 10, No. 1. [http://www.csj.org/rg/rgessays/rgessay_newage.htm What Is "New Age"?], retrieved 2006-07&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality"{{sfn |Drury|2004 | p=10}} and embraces a number of forms of [[mainstream science]] as well as other forms of science that are considered [[Fringe science|fringe]].

==Academic discussions==

===Mystical experience===
{{Main|Mystical experience}}

The idea of a perennial philosophy, sometimes called perennialism, is a key area of debate in the academic discussion of mystical experience. Huston Smith notes that the Traditionalist School's vision of a perennial philosophy is not based on mystical experiences, but on metaphysical intuitions.{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} The discussion of mystical experience has shifted the emphasis in the perennial philosophy from these metaphysical intuitions to religious experience{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=554}} and the notion of [[nonduality]] or [[altered state of consciousness]].

[[William James]] popularized the use of the term "religious experience" in his ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge.&lt;ref group=web name="StanfordMysticism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mysticism/ Gellman, Jerome, "Mysticism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Writers such as [[Walter Terence Stace|WT Stace]], [[Huston Smith]], and [[Robert K.C. Forman|Robert Forman]] argue that there are core similarities to mystical experience across religions, cultures and eras.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman, Wesley J. (2010) ''Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary Comparative Inquiry: Envisioning a Future for the Philosophy of Religion'', p. 49, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|1-4384-3235-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stace the universality of this core experience is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for one to be able to trust the cognitive content of any religious experience.{{sfn|Prothero|2010|p=6}}{{check source|date=February 2017}}

[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of "religious experience" further back to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of "religious experience" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}

Critics point out that the emphasis on "experience" favours the atomic individual, instead of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process, embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices.{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=4-5}} Richard King also points to disjunction between "mystical experience" and social justice:{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}
{{quote|The privatisation of mysticism - that is, the increasing tendency to locate the mystical in the psychological realm of personal experiences - serves to exclude it from political issues such as social justice. Mysticism thus comes to be seen as a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than serving to transform the world, reconcile the individual to the status quo by alleviating anxiety and stress.{{sfn|King|2002|p=21}}}}

===Religious pluralism===
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}

[[Religious pluralism]] holds that various world religions are limited by their distinctive historical and cultural contexts and thus there is no single, true religion.  There are only many equally valid religions. Each religion is a direct result of humanity's attempt to grasp and understand the incomprehensible divine reality. Therefore, each religion has an authentic but ultimately inadequate perception of divine reality, producing a partial understanding of the universal truth, which requires syncretism to achieve a complete understanding as well as a path towards salvation or spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James. "Religious Pluralism and the Question of Religious Truth in Wilfred C. Smith." The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory 4, no. 3 (2003): pp.58-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although perennial philosophy also holds that there is no single true religion, it differs when discussing divine reality. Perennial philosophy states that the divine reality is what allows the universal truth to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, John Stephen. "Perennial Philosophy and Christianity." In Christianity: the complete guide . London: Continuum, 2005. pp.1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each religion provides its own interpretation of the universal truth, based on its historical and cultural context.  Therefore, each religion provides everything required to observe the divine reality and achieve a state in which one will be able to confirm the universal truth and achieve salvation or spiritual enlightenment.

'''Physicians for Social Responsibility''' ('''PSR''') is the largest [[physician]]-led organization in the [[United States|US]] working to protect the public from the threats of [[nuclear proliferation]], climate change, and environmental [[toxin]]s.  Continuing its long history of physician-led activism, PSR produces and disseminates its own publications, provides specialized training, offers written and oral testimony to congress, conducts media interviews, and delivers professional and public education.  PSR’s 50,000 members and e-activists, 30 state and local chapters, 39 student chapters, and 14 national staff form a nationwide network that target what they consider threats to global survival, specifically [[nuclear warfare]], nuclear proliferation, [[global warming]], and [[Poison|toxic]] degradation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.org/site/PageServer?pagename=PSROVERVIEW Physicians for Social Responsibility: About PSR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational history==
PSR was founded in Boston in 1961 by a group of physicians concerned about the public health dangers associated with the testing, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons.  Drs. [[Bernard Lown]], [[Victor W. Sidel]], Sidney Alexander, [[H. Jack Geiger]], Alexander Leaf, George Saxton, [[Robert Goldwyn]], and Bernard Leon Winter (1921–1985)&lt;ref name="LATimes 1985 Nov 8" /&gt; were among the founding group of physicians.  PSR's initial reports described the real human, physical, social and environmental consequences of a nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;CMAJ, 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=August 2016}} PSR originally opposed atmospheric [[nuclear testing]] by documenting the presence of testing byproduct [[strontium-90]] in children's teeth.

==Rebirth of PSR in the late 1970s==
By 1973 the organization was not active and in effect ceased to exist. In 1978, [[Helen Caldicott]], MD was asked by Arnold Relman, the then editor to write an article for the [[The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine|NEJM]] on the medical dangers of nuclear power. She was subsequently visited by a young intern from Cambridge City Hospital at Children's Hospital Medical Center where she worked in the cystic fibrosis unit, to ask for some relevant papers on nuclear power. After some discussion with him, Caldicott said - you know this is a medical issue, let's start a medical organization. The first meeting held a week later at the Boston home of Helen and Bill Caldicott with several physicians in attendance including one who had been the past the secretary of the old PSR, Richard Feinbloom. Feinbloom suggested that instead of bothering to incorporate a new organization in the State of Massachusetts, the group take the name of the old and then defunct Physicians for Social Responsibility and use it. They did. 

This newly reinvigorated organization took off soon after. One of the initial organizational actions was to place an ad in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] outlining what they considered to be the medical implications of nuclear power. The ad was serendipitously published the day after Three Mile Island melted down attracting 500 new members. Over five years the new PSR recruited 23,000 physician members and organized approximately 153 chapters in the US. Caldicott served as the President of PSR from 1978 until 1984 when she resigned.&lt;ref&gt;CMAJ, 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr Caldicott travelled widely and founded similar physicians organizations in other countries including England, Ireland, Scotland, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Holland, Germany, Belgium, Scandinavia, and Australia.

==Founding of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)==
PSR's work to educate the public about the dangers of nuclear war grew into an international movement with the founding of [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]] in 1980.  In 1980 Bernard Lown co-founded, with Evgeni Chazov of the Soviet Union, IPPNW, with PSR as its American affiliate and branches in many other nations, to continue this educational effort on a global scale. As the U.S. affiliate of this global professional network, PSR shared in the 1985 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] awarded to IPPNW "for spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare."

==PSR today==
Today, PSR's security program works to improve national policy formulation and decision-making about nuclear weapons and technology through the combined efforts of credible, committed health professionals and active and concerned citizen members. PSR articulates both the health threats and the security threats posed by nuclear weapons, as well as the importance of implementing new approaches to reduce U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons in national security policy. PSR works to lead the U.S. toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.  

Since 1992, when PSR formally created its environment and health program, PSR has worked to address global warming and the toxic degradation of the environment. PSR presses for policies to curb global warming, generate what they consider to be a sustainable energy future, minimize toxic pollution of air, food and drinking water, and prevent human exposure to toxic substances.  PSR's Code Black program has been a voice in the movement to reduce U.S. reliance on coal-fired power plants.  ''Coal's Assault on Human Health'', released in November 2009, is a groundbreaking report that reviews and summarizes the latest peer-reviewed medical literature on coal pollution, providing a full picture of how coal affects human health from mining to combustion to the disposal of post-combustion waste.  

In 2008, concerned about the push to promote nuclear energy as the solution to environmental problems, PSR launched what they called a safe energy program aimed at stopping the construction of new nuclear power plants and to sound the alarm about what they consider to be the true costs of, and the dangers associated with, nuclear energy. 

Student Physicians for Social Responsibility (SPSR), a network of 39 chapters and 650 students, mobilizes medical students to engage in the work against nuclear proliferation, environmental degradation, and social justice issues.  SPSR orients every new generation of medical students to be engaged in creating positive change through medical activism.

PSR state and local chapters work on a range of issues, including the 'greening' of hospitals, what they consider sustainable agriculture, health care reform, and domestic violence.  Several PSR chapters are also active in the [[gun control]] movement, working to ban handguns in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/pressreleases/may99/052099d.htm "Physicians Escalate Gun Control Demands"] May 20, 1999 press release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/pressreleases/july99/073099a.htm "Physicians Call for Ban on Handguns"] July 30, 1999 press release&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psrla.org/program_gun_violence.htm Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''pluripotency''' of biological compounds describes the ability of certain substances to produce several distinct biological responses. Pluripotent is also described as something that has no fixed developmental potential, as in being able to differentiate into different cell types in the case of pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pluripotent|title = Pluripotent|date = |accessdate = 14 March 2015|website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of pluripotent cell, called a hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate into a large variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells have a different function, but they all work together as part of the immune system. 
[[Monocytes]] can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. [[Macrophages]] are covered with chemical receptors and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. [[Dendritic cells]] phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the acquired immune system (lymphocytes) as backup.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prescott's microbiology |last = Willey, J., Sherwood, L., &amp; Woolverton, C. |first = |publisher = McGraw Hill |year = 2014|isbn = 0073402400|location = Innate Host Resistance and Adaptive Immunity |pages = 723&amp;ndash;788|work = |editor-last =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example are lymphocytes called naïve T-helper cells. These cells can differentiate into many subtypes once activated by [[antigen presenting cells]] (APCs) like dendrites. They divide into memory cells, TH1, TH17, and TH2 cells, to name a few. Memory cells are made solely for the purpose of having a template to use in the case of reinfection so the body has a jump start instead of starting over as if never infected. TH17 cells do a variety of tasks including recruiting [[neutrophils]], creating [[defensins]], and mediating inflammation in the intestinal epithelium and skin. TH2 cells produce cytokines that will trigger certain B cells. [[B cells]] can differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells. The B plasma cells produce the [[antibodies]] that are used to tag invading cells so they can be attacked, among other functions. TH1 cells are created to make cytokines, like interferon gamma, that activate macrophages and [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs).&lt;ref name="Prescott"/&gt;

[[Interferon gamma]] represents an example of pluripotency in itself. Many cytokines are pluripotent, in that each of these compounds can activate specific behavior in some cell types and inhibit other behavior in other cell types.  Once activated by T lymphocytes or Natural Killer cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Ikeda, H., Old, L., &amp; Schreiber, R. | title= The roles of IFN in protection against tumor development and cancer immunoediting| journal= Cytokine &amp; Growth Factor Reviews | volume= 13|issue= 2| pages=95–109| year= 2002| doi= 10.1016/S1359-6101(01)00038-7 | pmid= 11900986}}&lt;/ref&gt; interferon gamma upregulates expression of macrophages and both types of [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]] (MHC) antigens. In [[B lymphocytes]] (B cells), interferon gamma stimulates antibody class switching. All of these cells have different, specialized functions, but they all came from one pluripotent cell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''''Postminimalism''''' is an art term coined (as '''''post-minimalism''''') by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 569. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used in various artistic fields for work which is influenced by, or attempts to develop and go beyond, the aesthetic of [[minimalism]]. The expression is used specifically in relation to music and the visual arts, but can refer to any field using minimalism as a critical reference point.  
In music, ''postminimalism'' refers to music following [[minimal music]].

==Visual art==
{{See also|List of postminimalist artists}}
In visual art, postminimalist art uses minimalism either as an aesthetic or conceptual reference point. Postminimalism is more an artistic tendency than a particular movement.  Postminimalist artworks are usually everyday objects, use simple materials, and sometimes take on a "pure", [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] aesthetic. However, since postminimalism includes such a diverse and disparate group of artists, it is impossible to enumerate all the continuities and similarities between them.

The work of [[Eva Hesse]] is also postminimalist: it uses "grids" and "seriality", themes often found in minimalism, but is also usually hand-made, introducing a human element into her art, in contrast to the machine or custom-made works of minimalism. [[Richard Serra]] is a prominent post-minimalist.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta (April 14, 2011). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/richard-serras-drawings-at-metropolitan-museum-of-art.html?pagewanted=all Richard Serra's Drawings at Metropolitan Museum of Art]", ''NYTimes.com''. Accessed 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of postminimalist composers}} 
In its general musical usage, ''postminimalism'' refers to works influenced by [[minimal music]], and it is generally categorized within the meta-genre [[art music]]. Writer [[Kyle Gann]]&lt;ref name="Gann2001"&gt;Kyle Gann. 2001. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040811/http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=1536 Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism's Immediate Legacy: Postminimalism]". ''New Music Box: The Web Magazine from the American Music Center'' (November 1) (Accessed 4 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; has employed the term more strictly to denote the style that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and characterized by: 
#a steady [[pulse (music)|pulse]], usually continuing throughout a work or movement; 
#a [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] pitch language, [[tonality|tonal]] in effect but avoiding traditional [[diatonic function|functional tonality]]; 
#general evenness of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], without strong climaxes or nuanced emotionalism; and 
#unlike [[minimalism]], an avoidance of obvious or linear formal design.

Minimalist procedures such as [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm|additive]] and subtractive [[process music|process]] are common in postminimalism, though usually in disguised form, and the style has also shown a capacity for absorbing influences from world and popular music ([[Balinese gamelan]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], Jewish [[cantillation]], and so on). 

For a musical style derived from minimalism, see [[Totalism (music)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20122">'''Primary consciousness''' is a term the American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] coined to describe the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of [[consciousness]] is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky&gt;Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[secondary consciousness|higher order consciousness]] can be described as being "conscious of being conscious"; it includes reflective thought, a concept of the past, and speculation about the future.

Primary consciousness can be subdivided into two forms, focal [[awareness]] and peripheral awareness. Focal awareness encompasses the center of [[attention]], whereas peripheral awareness consists of things outside the center of attention, which a person or animal is only dimly aware of.&lt;ref name = Johanson&gt;Johanson, M., Revonsuo, A., Chaplin, J., &amp; Wedlund, J.-E. (2003). Level and contents of consciousness in connection with partial epileptic seizures. ''Epilepsy &amp; Behavior'', 4(3), 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
One prominent [[theory]] for the [[neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] basis of primary consciousness was proposed by Gerald Edelman. This theory of consciousness is premised upon three major assumptions:
# The laws of [[physics]] apply to [[consciousness]], which rules out concepts such as spirits and a soul and allows for a purely [[physiology|physiological]] model of consciousness.
# Consciousness is an evolved characteristic, which means it is a helpful characteristic from a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] perspective.
# There is no such thing as a "[[qualia]]-free" observer. Qualia are collections of personal or subjective experiences, feelings, and sensations that inevitably come with human awareness.&lt;ref name = Edelmantheory/&gt;

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during [[evolution]] helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt; This connection allows past signals related to values set by the limbic-brain stem system and categorized signals from the outside world to be correlated, resulting in memory in conceptual areas. This memory is then linked to the organism's ''current'' perception, which results in an awareness of the present, or primary consciousness. In other words, Edelman posits that primary consciousness arises from the correlation of ''conceptual'' memory to a set of ''ongoing'' perceptual categorizations—a "remembered present".&lt;ref name = Edelmansky/&gt;

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Merker&gt;Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.&lt;ref name = Merker/&gt; Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.

==Neurophysiological basis==
Physiologically, three fundamental facts stand out about primary consciousness:&lt;ref name = SethND&gt;Seth, A. K., &amp; Baars, B. J. (2005). Neural Darwinism and consciousness. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 14(1), 140–168.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Waking consciousness is associated with low [[amplitude]], irregular [[EEG]] activity in the 20–70&amp;nbsp;Hz range.
#* Conversely, unconscious states like deep sleep, [[coma]], [[general anesthesia]], and [[epilepsy|epileptic states]] of absence show a predominance of low [[frequency]], high-[[amplitude]] and more regular [[voltage]]s at less than 4Hz.
#Consciousness seems to be intrinsically associated with the thalamus and cortex, even if the extent to which this true is argued among scientists.
#* Damage to the [[brainstem]] or thalamus can abolish consciousness, while damage to the sensory cortex appears to delete specific conscious features such as [[color vision]], visual motion, conscious experiences of objects and faces, and the like.
#Consciousness is distinctively associated with widespread brain activation related to the conscious content.
#*Perhaps two dozen experiments show that sensory input supporting consciousness spreads from the [[sensory cortex]] to [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]], and [[temporal lobe|medial-temporal]] cortex, while closely matched input that does not reach consciousness activates mainly local sensory regions. Further, the widespread activity appears to involve more globally coordinated activity.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

==Measurement==
To be fully comprehensive, measures of consciousness must not only define and distinguish between [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] states, but must also provide a guide by which the conscious level, or extent of consciousness, can be determined.&lt;ref name = Morin&gt;Morin, A. (2006). Levels of consciousness and self-awareness: A comparison and integration of various neurocognitive views. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 15(2), 358–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of consciousness are each associated with particular theories.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures&gt;Seth, A. K. (2008). Theories and measures of consciousness develop together. ''Consciousness and Cognition'', 17(3), 986–988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain defining theories are included below:

'''Worldly discrimination theory''' asserts that any mental state that is manifested in [[behavior]] is conscious; thus, an organism is consciously aware of something in the world if it can discriminate it with choice behavior.
'''Signal detection theory''' quantifies discriminability of a stimulus among a set of different stimuli.
'''Integration theories''' focus on finding a divide between conscious and unconscious processes. According to integration theories, conscious contents are widely available to many [[cognitive]] and/or neural processes.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2&gt;Seth, A. K., Dienes, Z., Cleeremans, A., Overgaard, M., &amp; Pessoa, L. (2008). Measuring consciousness: relating behavioural and neurophysiological approaches. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 12(8), 314–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are then accompanied with measures of the level of consciousness, which are subdivided into [[behavioral]] measures and [[physiological]] measures.&lt;ref name = Morin/&gt;

===Behavioral measures===

Behavioral measures of primary consciousness can be either objective or subjective. Regarding objective measures, knowledge is unconscious if it expresses itself in an indirect test. For example, the ability to pick which item might come next in a series can indicate unconscious knowledge of regularities in sequences.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures2 /&gt; "Strategic control measures" use a person's ability to deliberately use or not use knowledge according to instructions. If they use information despite intentions not to use it, it indicates unconscious knowledge.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt; Post-decision wagering can also be used. In this method, subjects make a first-order discrimination (i.e. a choice) and then place a wager regarding the outcome of the discrimination. Some scientists view this as a direct and objective measure of consciousness, and it can be used with children and animals. However, this method has been argued to be subjective and indirect.&lt;ref name = Sethmeasures/&gt;

===Physiological measures===

[[event-related potential|Event-related cortical potentials (ERPs)]] have been used to assess whether a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] is consciously perceived or not. These [[EEG]] measures either float free of theory, gaining credibility through reliable correlation, or assume a version of integration theory in which the appearance of a particular ERP indicates global availability or locally recurrent processing.&lt;ref name = Sethcomputation&gt;Seth, A. (2009). Explanatory Correlates of Consciousness: Theoretical and Computational Challenges. ''Cognitive Computation'', 1(1), 50–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant evidence indicates that consciously perceived inputs elicit widespread brain activation, as compared with inputs that do not reach consciousness.

The '''dynamic core hypothesis (DCH)''' proposes that consciousness arises from neural dynamics in the thalamocortical system, as measured by the quantity '''neural complexity (CN).''' ''CN'' is an information-theoretic measure; the ''CN'' value is high if each subset of a neural system can take on many different states, and if these states make a difference to the rest of the system.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;
The '''information integration theory of consciousness (IITC)''' shares with the DCH the idea that conscious experiences provide informative discriminations among a vast repertoire of possible experiences. In the IITC, the quantity ''phi'' is defined as the information that is integrated across the informational "weakest link" of a system. Importantly, ''phi'' is a measure of the capacity of a neural system to integrate information, whereas ''CN'' is a measure of the actual dynamics of the system. A third measure, '''causal density ''(CD)''''', measures the fraction of causal interactions among elements of a system that are statistically significant.&lt;ref name = SethND/&gt;

===Challenges in measuring===

It is important to note that subjective measures are always indirect and can be vulnerable to many biases (e.g., reluctance to report uncertain experiences). An|metacognitive]] conscious content assumes primary consciousness but not vice versa, subjective measures risk missing or rejecting the presence of sensory consciousness simply because metacognition isn't observed.&lt;ref name= Morin/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the problem of post-decision wagering, which has been criticized because there is a possibility that advantageous wagering could be learned unconsciously; as a result, post-decision wagering would not in fact be considered a conscious behavior. For example, individual differences in [[risk aversion]] may lead to variations in wagering performance even with the same underlying conscious phenomenology.&lt;ref name= Sethmeasures2/&gt;

Thus, although behavioral measures are mostly used for assessing which contents are conscious, some brain-based measures seem better suited for measuring conscious level. Objective measures also have their challenges, however. First, objective measures still require a response criterion, for example the decision of whether or not to push a button. Second, they may not even measure consciousness at all because many behavioral proxies, such as forced-choice decision accuracy, are capable of being learned unconsciously.&lt;ref name= Edelmansky/&gt;&lt;ref name = Edelman&gt;Edelman, G. (2001). Consciousness: the remembered present. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 929, 111–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous studies==

===In lucid dreams===

Hobson asserts that the existence of [[lucid dreaming]] means that the human brain can simultaneously occupy two states: waking and dreaming. The dreaming portion has experiences and therefore has primary consciousness, while the waking self recognizes the dreaming and can be seen as having a sort of [[secondary consciousness]] in the sense that there is an awareness of mental state. Studies have been able to show that lucid dreaming is associated with EEG power and coherence profiles that are significantly different from both non-lucid dreaming and waking.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt; Lucid dreaming situates itself between those two states. Lucid dreaming is characterized by more 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power than non-lucid dreaming, especially in frontal regions. Since it is 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power that has been correlated with waking consciousness in previous studies, it can be suggested that enough 40&amp;nbsp;Hz power has been added to the non-lucid dreaming brain to support the increase in subjective [[awareness]] that permits lucidity but not enough to cause full awakening.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

Dreaming is thus a [[virtual reality]] experience with a remarkably predictive simulation of external reality. Lucid dreamers may experience primary consciousness (the dream) and secondary consciousness (the waking) separately but simultaneously. Moreover, primary consciousness has recently been proposed by us to be characteristic of dreaming. It remains to be seen whether the enactment of dream behaviors uses the same brain processes as those that mediate those very behaviors in waking, and whether conscious within a dream is governed by the same processes.&lt;ref name = Hobson/&gt;

===In epileptic seizures===

Studies show that it is possible to retain primary consciousness and even [[secondary consciousness]] during [[complex partial seizure|complex partial epileptic seizures]]. One study analyzed 40 patients with complex partial seizures to determine their level of consciousness during seizures. The data acquired was based on patients' subjective descriptions of their experience and descriptions from family members who witnessed the seizures.&lt;ref name = Johanson/&gt; This study found there was a complete absence of consciousness in only 65% of people during the core period of the seizures. Meanwhile, 35% of seizures included some form of primary consciousness. Five seizure descriptions even reported some form of secondary consciousness, albeit short and intermittent. The level and contents of consciousness during epileptic seizures show considerable variability.&lt;ref name= Johanson/&gt;

===In thirst===

In one study, 10 adult males underwent [[positron emission tomography]] scans in three different scenarios:&lt;ref name=Denton&gt;Denton, D., Shade, R., Zamarippa, F., Egan, G., Blair-West, J., McKinley, M., et al. (1999). Neuroimaging of genesis and satiation of thirst and an interoceptor-driven theory of origins of primary consciousness. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', 96(9), 5304.&lt;/ref&gt;
# During generation of moderate thirst by infusion of [[intravenous]] [[hypertonic]] saline 0.51 M
# After wetting of the mouth with water to remove the sensation of dryness
# 3, 14, 45, and 60 minutes after drinking water to fully quench thirst

The data suggest that the anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]] as well as the anterior wall of the third [[ventricular system|ventricle]], are major elements of a circuit including [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites that are needed for the generation of consciousness of thirst.&lt;ref name = Denton/&gt;
This study shows that consciousness of some key sensations like thirst is governed by the oldest regions of the brain, which raises the question of whether it is really then possible to say when primary consciousness developed.&lt;ref name= Denton/&gt;

=== In meditation ===

In some types of meditation/yoga it is possible to have the experience known as Samadhi, where there is inner alertness but no object of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.&lt;/ref&gt; This mental state corresponds with specific physiological parameters.&lt;ref&gt;Travis, F. &amp; Pearsoon. C. (2000) Pure Consciousness: Distinct phenomenological and physiological correlates of "consciousness itself", ''International Journal of Neuroscience'', 100 pp. 77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">'''Regulatory science''' is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for food and medical products, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] for the environment, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] for work safety.

"Regulatory science" is contrasted with [[regulatory affairs]] and [[regulatory law]], which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' ''scientific'' underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=AM|title=Science and trans science|journal=Minerva|date=1970|volume=10|pages=209–222|doi=10.1007/BF01682418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science.  The origin of the term '''regulatory science''' is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by [[A. Alan Moghissi]] who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new [[scientific discipline]] because “science is science” regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies “at the interface between science and the regulatory system”  Moghissi et al.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA

==Definition==
Moghissi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) “Regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives”. An abbreviated definition consists of “regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives”

The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/regulatoryscience/ucm228444.pdf|title=Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health|last=|first=FDA|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide a basis to: 

* Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products,
* Modernize current regulatory pathways,
* Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none.

There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and “normal science”, “academic science”, “research science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=S|title=The fifth branch: science advisors as policy makers|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compliance with regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gad|first1=SC|title=Regulatory Toxicology|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties.

==Application of regulatory science==
Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Straja|first2=Sorin R.|last3=Love|first3=Betty R.|last4=McBride|first4=Dennis K.|last5=Stough|first5=Roger R.|date=2014|title=Innovation in Regulatory Science: Evolution of a new scientific discipline|journal=Technology and Innovation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3727/194982414X14096821477027|last1=Moghissi|first1=AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: 
*Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies 
*Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community.
*Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community.

The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council.   
The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. ( Moghissi et al.)

==Regulatory engineering==
[[Engineering]] is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations.  Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation.

Sometimes the term "regulatory engineer(ing)" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, "engineering" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see [[Regulation and licensure in engineering]]).

==Areas of focus==

===Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine===
Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that “Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.”
Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both [[interdisciplinary]] and [[multidisciplinary]] and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of “regulatory science” is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry’s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient’s involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas – not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FDA (Food and Drug Administration)|title=The Promise of regulatory science|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm228206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes.

===Human health===
By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas – including pollution and [[toxicology]], work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others.

===Ecology===
Regulatory [[ecology]] covers resources the [[Protected species|protection of various species]], [[Wetland conservation|protection of wetlands]], and numerous other regulated areas including [[ecotoxicology]].

For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves.

The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies.

The US Department of Interior, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] (FESA), [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]], and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area.

==Regulatory economics==
There are numerous [[Regulatory economics|economic decisions]] in the regulatory process including the [[economics]] part of [[cost-benefit analysis]].

==Science in legislation and in courts==
Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of [[Legislation|legislative]] decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly [[Court of law|courts]] have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements.

'''Religious exclusivism''', or '''exclusivity''', is the doctrine or belief that only one particular [[religion]] or [[belief system]] is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of philosophy of religion|page=345|author=William J.

==Islamic exclusivism==
{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

[[File:Sexting.jpg|thumb|A simulated sexting conversation using early Renaissance artist [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]''.]]

'''Sexting''' is sending, receiving, or forwarding [[sexually explicit]] messages, photographs, or images, primarily between mobile phones, of oneself to others. It may also include the use of a computer or any digital device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salter|first=Michael|year=2013|title=Beyond Criminalisation and Responsibilitisim Sexting, Gender and Young People|url=|journal=Sydney Law School|volume=24|pages=310–315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was first popularized early in the 21st century and is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Human sexual activity|sex]]'' and ''[[text messaging|texting]]'', where the latter is meant in the wide sense of sending a text possibly with images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Redmond | first = Teresa |url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/education/84932002_Parents__students_get__the_4-1-1_on_sexting_.html|title = Ringwood community addresses sexting|accessdate = 30 May 2010 |date = 22 February 2010 |work =NorthJersey.com |publisher = North Jersey Media Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the word ''sexting'' was listed for the first time in [[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Leanne|title=F-bomb makes it into mainstream dictionary|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/13/f-bomb-makes-it-mainstream-dictionary/|work=The Washington Times|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first published use of the term ''sexting'' was in a 2005 article in the Australian ''[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="SunTele"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Yvonne |title=The one and only |date=31 July 2005 &lt;!--|accessdate=14 January 2009--&gt; |page=22| work =[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|Sunday Telegraph Magazine]]| publisher =[[News Corp Australia]]|location=Sydney, Australia |quote=Following a string of extramarital affairs and several lurid "sexting" episodes, Warne has found himself home alone, with Simone Warne taking their three children and flying the conjugal coop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Research Center]] commissioned a study on sexting, which divides the practice into three types:&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt;
# Exchange of images solely between two romantic partners.
# Exchanges between partners that are shared with others outside the relationship.
# Exchanges between people who are not yet in a relationship, but where at least one person hopes to be.
Sexting has become more common with the rise in [[camera phone]]s and [[smartphone]]s with Internet access, that can be used to send explicit photographs as well as messages.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt; While sexting is done by people of all ages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDaniel | first1 = Brandon T. | last2 = Drouin | first2 = Michelle | author-link2 = Michelle Drouin | title = Sexting among married couples: who is doing it, and are they more satisfied? | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 628–634 | doi = 10.1089/cyber.2015.0334 | pmid = 26484980 | pmc = 4642829 | date = November 2015 | ref = none }}&lt;/ref&gt; most media coverage fixates on negative aspects of adolescent usage. Young adults use the medium of the text message much more than any other new media to transmit messages of a sexual nature,&lt;ref name="Drouin 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drouin | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Kimberly N. | last3 = Surbey | first3 = Alisen | last4 = Stills | first4 = Julie R. | author-link1 = Michelle Drouin | title = Let's talk about sexting, baby: computer-mediated sexual behaviors among young adults | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = A25–A30 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.030 | date = September 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and teenagers who have unlimited text messaging plans are more likely to receive sexually explicit texts.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"&gt;{{cite report|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|title=Teens and sexting|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/12/15/teens-and-sexting/ | publisher = [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2009/PIP_Teens_and_Sexting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of sexting being a relatively recent practice, [[ethics]] are still being established by both those who engage in it and those who create legislation based on this concept. Whether sexting is seen as a positive or negative experience typically rests on the basis of whether or not consent was given to share the images. Nevertheless, Australian laws currently view under-18s as being unable to give consent to sexting, even if they meet the legal age for sexual consent.&lt;ref name="Beyond Megan"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kath |last1=Albury |first2=Kate |last2=Crawford | title = Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: beyond ''Megan's Story'' | journal = [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–473 | doi = 10.1080/10304312.2012.665840 | date = June 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{where?|reason= where do such laws apply?|date=May 2015}}

=== Social media applications ===
[[File:Snapchat (15021193310).jpg|thumb|[[Snapchat]] and other applications have been used by teens as another medium of sexting]]

Sexting has been promoted further by several direct messaging applications that are available on smartphones. The difference between using these applications and traditional texting is that content is transmitted over the Internet or a data plan, allowing anyone with Internet access to participate. Kik and WhatsApp appeal to teens because of the anonymity of the applications. Snapchat appeals to teens because it allows users to send photos for a maximum of ten seconds before they self-destruct. Those sending photos over Snapchat believe they will disappear without consequences so they feel more secure about sending them. There have been several cases where teens have sent photos over these applications, expecting them to disappear or be seen by the recipient only, yet are saved and distributed, carrying social and legal implications. Even though users believe their photos on Snapchat for example will go away in seconds, it is easy to save them through other photo capturing technology, third party applications, or simple screenshots. These applications claim no responsibility for explicit messages or photos that are saved. Snapchat's privacy policy on sexting has evolved to include sending content over new smartphone applications because of their appealing features such as the anonymity or temporary elements. Unfortunately these applications carry the same risks and consequences that have always existed.

==== Snapchat ====
A 2009 study found that 4 percent of teenagers aged 14–17 claim to have sent sexually explicit photos of themselves. Fifteen percent of these teens also claimed to have received sexually explicit photos. This suggests a consent issue of people receiving photos without asking for them. This is enhanced with [[Snapchat]], as the person receiving snapchats will not be aware of the contents until they open it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenhard|first1=Amanda|title=Teens and Sexting How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.|url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/pewinternet_teensandsexting_12-2009.pdf|website=pewinternet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sexting through Snapchat is popular, "joke sexting" is more prevalent among users. Sending sexual images as a joke makes up approximately a quarter of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Utz | first1 = S. | last2 = Muscanell | first2 = N. | last3 = Khalid | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Snapchat Elicits More Jealousy than Facebook: A Comparison of Snapchat and Facebook Use | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 141–146 | doi = 10.1089/cyber.2014.0479 | pmid = 25667961 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Sexting is a prevalent and normalized practice among youth in many western, liberal democracies.&lt;ref name="yeungth,etal."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yeung | first1 = Timothy H. | last2 = Horyniak | first2 = Danielle R. | last3 = Vella | first3 = Alyce M. | last4 = Hellard | first4 = Margaret E. | last5 = Lim | first5 = Megan S.C. | title = Prevalence, correlates and attitudes towards sexting among young people in Melbourne, Australia | journal = Sexual Health | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 332–339 | doi = 10.1071/SH14032 | pmid = 25087581 | date = September 2014 | url = http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/164/paper/SH14032.htm | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many couples engage in sexting. In a 2011 study, 54% of the sample had sent explicit pictures or videos to their partners at least once, and ⅓ of their sample had engaged in such activities occasionally.&lt;ref name="Drouin 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Drouin | first1 = Michelle | last2 = Landgraff | first2 = Carly | author-link1 = Michelle Drouin | title = Texting, sexting, and attachment in college students' romantic relationships | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 444–449 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.015 | date = March 2012 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas where [[gender role]]s traditionally expect men to initiate sexual encounters, sexting is used by women to offer nude images to male partners, allowing women greater latitude to instigate sex.&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hasinoff | first = Amy Adele | title = Sexting as media production: rethinking social media and sexuality | journal = New Media &amp; Society | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 449–465 | doi = 10.1177/1461444812459171 | date = June 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visuality.org/genderedcyborgs/wmst320_readings/sexting_mediaproduction.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722213003/http://www.visuality.org/genderedcyborgs/wmst320_readings/sexting_mediaproduction.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mass media does not encourage teen or underage sexting, because of the child pornography laws they could violate.&lt;ref name="visuality.org"/&gt;{{according to whom|date=November 2015}} However, a recent study found young women are significantly more likely than young men to be pressured into sending a nude photo, by their partner. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brook.org.uk/press-releases/digital-romance|title=Brook {{!}} Press releases {{!}} Digital Romance|website=www.brook.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, it was found that sexting is often used to enhance the relationship and sexual satisfaction in a romantic partnership. Sexting thus can be considered a "behaviour that ties into sexuality and the subsequent level of relationship satisfaction experienced by both partners". Based on the interviews conducted by Albury and Crawford, they discovered that sexting is commonly used in positive aspects. According to Albury and Crawford, sexting was not only an activity occurring in the context of flirtation or sexual relationships, but also between friends, as a joke or during a moment of bonding.”&lt;ref name="Parker 2013 1–12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = Trent | last2 = Blackburn | first2 = Kristyn M. | last3 = Perry | first3 = Martha S. | last4 = Hawks | first4 = Jillian M. | title = Sexting as an intervention: relationship satisfaction and motivation considerations | journal = The American Journal of Family Therapy | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | doi = 10.1080/01926187.2011.635134 | date = January 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, [[hedonism]] played a role in motivating sexting, and the length of relationship was negatively correlated with sexting behaviors. The study had a small sample size, so more research needs to be done surrounding sexting and motivation, but it is clear that sexting is a phenomenon that is not constrained to simply unattached individuals looking for fun; it is used by those in intimate relationships to increase feelings of intimacy and closeness one's partner.&lt;ref name="Parker 2013 1–12"/&gt; For teens, sexting can also act as a prelude (or in lieu of) sexual activity, as an experimental phase for those who are yet to be sexually active, and for those who are hoping to start a relationship with someone.&lt;ref name="Lenhart 2009"/&gt; In a 2013 study conducted by [[Michelle Drouin|Drouin]] et al., it was found that sexting is also associated with attachment styles, as those with [[Attachment theory|attachment avoidance]] are more likely to engage in sexting behaviours (just as these individuals are also more likely to engage in casual sex). Thus, instead of increasing intimacy in these types of relationships, sexting may act as a buffer for physical intimacy.&lt;ref name="Drouin 2011"/&gt;

In a 2008 survey of 1,280 teenagers and young adults of both sexes sponsored by ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy'', 20% of teens (13–20) and 33% of young adults (20–26) had sent nude or semi-nude photographs of themselves electronically. Additionally, 39% of teens and 59% of young adults had sent sexually explicit text messages.&lt;ref name="TNCPTP_survey"&gt;{{cite web |title = Sex and tech | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100621211719/http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/sextech/PDF/SexTech_Summary.pdf | archive-date = 21 June 2010 |url = http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/sextech/PDF/SexTech_Summary.pdf|format = PDF | publisher = The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy|date = 10 December 2008|accessdate = 20 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely cited 2011 study indicated the previously reported prevalence was exaggerated. Researchers at the [[University of New Hampshire]] surveyed 1,560 children and caregivers, reporting that only 2.5 percent of respondents had sent, received or created sexual pictures distributed via cell phone in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Namuo|first=Clynton|title=UNH study finds 'sexting' not so prevalent|url=http://www.unionleader.com/article/20111205/NEWS04/712059957|work=[[Union Leader]] | location = New Hampshire| publisher = Joseph W. McQuaid|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps shedding light on the over-reporting of earlier studies, the researchers found that the figure rose to 9.6% when the definition was broadened from images prosecutable as child pornography to any suggestive image, not necessarily nude ones.&lt;ref name="WP2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=D'Arcy|first=Janice |title=Kids sexting less common than thought, study says  |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-parenting/post/kids-sexting-less-common-than-thought-study-says/2011/11/30/gIQAzBPxLO_blog.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | publisher =[[Jeff Bezos|Nash Holdings LLC]] |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, a 2012 study conducted by the [[University of Utah]] Department of Psychology&lt;ref name="Strassberg 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strassberg | first1 = Donald | last2 = McKinnon | first2 =Ryan K. | title = Sexting by high school students: an exploratory and descriptive study | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9969-8 | pmid = 22674035 | date = January 2013 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120613132939.htm Abridged text.]&lt;/ref&gt; has received wide international media attention for calling into question the findings reported by the University of New Hampshire researchers. In the University of Utah's study, researchers Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael A. Sustaíta, and Jordan Rullo surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14–18 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others. In addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. Strassberg, McKinnon, ''et al''. note: "The news-worthiness of [the University of New Hampshire study] derives from [their] figure [2.5%] being far below (by a factor of 5 or more) the prevalence rates reported in the previous surveys. However, while technically accurate, the 2.5% figure is actually rather misleading. As seen in Table 1 of their publication, Mitchell et al. found that among the quarter of their sample that were ages 10–12, [less than] 0.6% 'appeared in, created, or received a nude or nearly nude image' while among those age 15–17, 15% of participants reported having done so. Despite it being widely reported in the media, the overall prevalence figure of 2.5% masks a dramatic age effect that indicates that more than 1 in 8 mid-teen minors admit to having sexted." Strassberg, McKinnon, et al. conclude: "These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people."&lt;ref name="Strassberg 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maffly|first=Brian|title='Sexting' prevalent among high-schoolers, study finds|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54324965-78/explicit-messages-nearly-onlinetoday.html.csp|work=[[Salt Lake Tribune]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Lois|title=As many as 20% of teens have 'sexted', according to new study|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all|work=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a writing by professor Diane Kholos Wysocki, although both men and women participate in "sexting", "women are more likely to sext than men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/fashion/women-are-more-likely-to-sext-than-men-study-says-studied.html|title=Women Are More Likely to ‘Sext’ Than Men, Study Says: Studied|last=Paul|first=Pamela|date=15 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article claims that women are more likely to sext than men, the article does not claim that women are the only ones receiving the images. In a study, close to half of the adults' interviewed had sexual photos or texts on their mobile device(s). Many of these intimate images and words are actually sent to complete strangers.  In an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', however, the article says that men are actually more likely to initiate some form of intimate communication, like sending nude photographs or suggestive text messages. The reasoning behind this is that men seem to be more open about their sexual drive, which promotes the instigation of sexual contact. Also in this article, it says, "The age group that is most keen on sexting is 18 to 24- year olds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sext-much-if-so-youre-not-alone/|title=Sext much? If so, you're not alone|newspaper=Scientific American|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is when young adults are at their prime of sexuality, and are looking to find their partners while also exploring their bodies and sexuality. Amy Adele Hasinoff published an article trying to get rid of the stigma that sexting is simply exploitation of sexual matters. Women are sexualized whenever they post or share any form of intimate media. Men are not. When it comes to sexting, there is a big difference between sexual exploitation and a consensual decision to express one's sexuality and share an image of their own body with someone who wants to see it. Hasinoff points out that “Many digital media scholars stress that the Internet can enable young people to explore their identities and develop social and communication skills (Boyd, 2008; Tynes, 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasinoff|first=Amy Adele|date=1 June 2013|title=Sexting as media production: Rethinking social media and sexuality|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/15/4/449|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=449–465|doi=10.1177/1461444812459171|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt;” and suggests that consensual sexting might serve a similar function for some people.

The University of Utah study (with a population sample of 606 teens ages 14–18) stated that about one third of respondents did not consider legal or other consequences when receiving or sending sexts.&lt;ref name="Lohmann"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lohmann|first=Raychelle Cassada|title=The dangers of teen sexting (blog)|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/teen-angst/201207/the-dangers-teen-sexting|work=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|date=20 July 2012|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers may not be thinking about the risks and repercussions when they participate in sexting; however, a study by Kath Albury titled ''Selfies, Sexts, and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Presentation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/3132|title=Selfies- Selfies, Sexts and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Representation|first=Kath|last=Albury|date=15 May 2015|publisher=|volume=9|page=12|via=ijoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that teenagers engaging in sexting were concerned that their parents may see or find out about their involvement with sexting. Some teenagers shared that their "main risks of parental discovery were embarrassment (for both parents and young people) and 'overreaction' from adults who feared the photo had been shared."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albury|first=Kath|date=2005|title=Selfies, Sexts, and Sneaky Hats: Young People's Understandings of Gendered Practices of Self-Representation|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication |volume=9|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teenagers felt less compelled to worry about the legal risks with sexting, they worried that their parents would find out about their involvement with sexting. Albury and Crawford (2012) argue that adolescents are well aware of the differences between consensual sexting and distribution of private images with negative intent. Further, they argue young people are developing norms and ethics of sexting based on consent.

Creation and distribution of explicit photos of teenagers violates [[child pornography]] laws in many jurisdictions (depending on the age of the people depicted), but this legal restriction does not align with the social norms of the population engaging in the practice, which distinguish between consensual activity and harassment or revenge.&lt;ref name="visuality.org" /&gt; Senders in some jurisdictions may also be charged with distribution of indecent material to a minor, and could be required to register as a [[sex offender]] for life.

While mainstream media outlets, parents, and educators are rightfully worried about the negative legal, social, and emotional ramifications of teen sexting, much less is said about the issue of [[sexual consent]]. According to a 2012 study conducted by professors at the University of New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: Beyond Megan's Story|first1=Kath|last1=Albury|first2=Kate|last2=Crawford|date=1 June 2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=463–473|doi=10.1080/10304312.2012.665840|journal=Continuum}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to child pornography laws that prohibit any minor from consenting to sexual activity, issues of consent among adolescent teens is seldom discussed. Much like the discourse surrounding [[abstinence-only education|"abstinence-only" education]], the prevailing attitude towards sexting is how to prevent it from occurring rather than accepting its inevitability and channeling it in healthier ways. According to the study, instead of criminalizing teens who participate in sexting, the law should account for whether the images are shared consensually. This would mean adopting an "ethics" approach, one that teaches and guides teens on how to respect bodily autonomy and privacy.

According to a study done by the health journal ''Pediatrics'', more than one in five middle school children with behavioral or emotional problems has recently engaged in sexting. Those individuals who have reported sexting in the past six months were four to seven times more likely to engage in other sexual activities such as intimate kissing, touching genitals, and having vaginal or [[oral sex]], compared to children who stated they did not partake in sexting. The study included 420 participants who were between the ages of 12 and 14 years old. The children were pulled from five urban public middle schools in [[Rhode Island]] between 2009 and 2012. Seventeen percent of the children tested claimed they had sent a sexually explicit text message in the past six months.

Sexting is generally legal if all parties are over the [[age of majority]] and images are sent with their consent and knowledge; however, any type of sexual message that both parties have not consented to can constitute [[sexual harassment]].

Sexting that involves [[Minor (law)|minors]] under the [[age of consent]] sending an explicit photograph of themselves to a romantic partner of the same age can be illegal in countries where anti-[[child pornography]] laws require all participants in pornographic media to be over the age of majority. Some teenagers who have texted photographs of themselves, or of their friends or partners, have been charged with distribution of child pornography, while those who have received the images have been charged with possession of child pornography; in some cases, the possession charge has been applied to school administrators who have investigated sexting incidents as well. The images involved in sexting are usually different in both nature and motivation from the type of content that anti-child pornography laws were created to address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Clark-Flory | first = Tracy | title = The new pornographers | url = http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2009/02/20/sexting_teens | website = [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]] | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon Media Group]] | date = 20 February 2009 | access-date = 6 February 2016 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110902123953/http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2009/02/20/sexting_teens | archivedate = 2 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitz | first1 = Sandra | last2 = Siry | first2 = Lawrence | title = Teenage folly or child abuse?

A 2009 UK survey of 2,094 teens aged 11 to 18 found that 38% had received an "offensive or distressing" sexual image by text or email.&lt;ref name="Beatbully_survey"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer |title = Truth of sexting amongst UK teens|website = Beatbullying.org | publisher =  |date = 4 August 2009|url = http://www.beatbullying.org/docs/media-centre/news-archive/August%2009/truth_of_sexting.html|accessdate = 20 October 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808091855/http://www.beatbullying.org/docs/media-centre/news-archive/August%2009/truth_of_sexting.html|archivedate = 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, anyone who is involved in the electronic distribution of sexual photos of minors can face state and federal charges of child pornography. The laws disregard the consent of parties involved."...regardless
of one’s age or consent to sexting, it is unlawful to produce, possess, or distribute explicit sexual images of anyone under 18."&lt;ref name="visuality.org"/&gt;  The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolak|first1=Janis|last2=Finkelhor|first2=David|last3=Mitchel|first3=Kimberly J.|title=Trends in Arrests for Child Pornography Production: The Third National Juvenile Online Victimization Study (NJOV‐3)|url=http://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1046&amp;context=ccrc|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kath Albury discusses in an article titled "Sexting, Consent, and Young People's Ethics: Beyond Megan's Story" that if teens are convicted of a sexting charge, they have to register as a sex offender, and this takes away the impact of the title of sex offender. A girl who agreed to send her girlfriend a naked picture is not as dangerous to the community as a child molester but the charge of sex offender would be applied equally to both of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;[Kath Albury &amp; Kate Crawford (2012): Sexting, consent and young people's
ethics: Beyond Megan's Story , Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies, 26:3, 463-473], more text.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview, assistant professor of communications at the University of Colorado Denver, Amy Adele Hasinoff, who studies the repercussions of sexting has stated that the "very harsh" child pornography laws are "designed to address adults exploiting children" and should not replace better sex education and consent training for teens. She went on to say, "Sexting is a sex act, and if it's consensual, that’s fine..." "Anyone who distributes these pictures without consent is doing something malicious and abusive, but child pornography laws are too harsh to address it."&lt;ref name=2013CaNPSelfiePorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Karen|title=Child pornography laws 'too harsh' to deal with minors sexting photos without consent, experts say|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/11/16/child-pornography-laws-too-harsh-to-deal-with-minors-sexting-photos-without-consent-experts-say/|work=National Post News | location= Canada| date = 16 November 2013|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Amy Hasinoff, if sexting was viewed as media production and a consensual activity, this would change the legal assumption that sexting is always non-consensual and reduce the culpability of victimized youth. This turns sexting into a situation that would lead to different legal consequences when distribution of the material was not consented to by the creator.&lt;ref name="visuality.org" /&gt;  Alvin J. Primack, who draws from Amy Hasinoff's work, argued a media production model may be useful for distinguishing between child pornography and sexting from a First Amendment perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=Alvin J.|date=2017|title=Youth sexting and the First Amendment: Rhetoric and child pornography doctrine in the age of translation|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=8|pages=2917–2933|doi=10.1177/1461444817737297}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alvin J. Primack,  the motivation for creating and distributing sexts (e.g., pleasure, relationship building) differs from the motivation for creating and distributing child pornography (e.g., abuse, exploitation), and the market of circulation is generally different between the two as well. For these reasons, there may be arguments - grounded in reasoning provided by First Amendment doctrine - for finding some youth sexts exchanged between persons who are of the age of consent to be legally-protected speech. 

Legal professionals and academics have expressed that the use of "child porn laws" with regard to sexting is "extreme" or "too harsh". Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that "I do not believe that our child pornography laws were designed for these situations&amp;nbsp;... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up to five years in prison for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Seltzer | first = David S. | title = Miami criminal defense lawyer | url = http://www.cybercrimelawyerblog.com/2008/12/miami_criminal_defense_lawyer_1.html | website = cybercrimelawyerblog.com | publisher = Seltzer Law, Pennsylvania | date = 19 December 2008 | access-date = 6 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics have argued that ''sexting'' is a broad term for images being sent over Internet and cell phones, between minors, adults, or minors and adults, and in an abusive manner or in an innocent manner. In order to develop policy better suited for adolescent sexting cases, it is necessary to have better terms and categories of sexting. University of New Hampshire [[Typology (linguistics)|typology]] has suggested the term ''youth-produced sexual image'' to classify adolescent sexting. Furthermore, they branch into two sub-categories: ''aggravated'' and ''experimental youth-produced sexual image''. Aggravated cases include cases of sexual assault, coercion, cyber-bullying, forwarding images without consent, and abusive behavior. Experimental cases are cases in which an adolescent willingly takes a picture and sends it to someone with no criminal intent and is attention-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = Abigail | year = 2012 | title = "Sexting" Among U.S. Adolescents: Psychological and Legal Perspectives | url = http://abigailjudge.com/img/amj-hrp-2012.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Review of Psychiatry | volume =  | issue = | page =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology could lead to more appropriate action towards adolescents who engage in sexting.

===Legal cases===
* In 2007, 32 Australian teenagers from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were prosecuted as a result of sexting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Liz|title=Malice in wonderland |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/malice-in-wonderland/2008/08/09/1218139163632.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |date=10 August 2008 |accessdate=14 January 2009 |work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, an assistant principal in the US state of [[Virginia]] was charged with possession of [[child pornography]] and related crimes after he had been asked to investigate a rumored sexting incident at the high school where he worked. Upon finding a student in possession of a photo on his phone that depicted the torso of a girl wearing only underpants, her arms mostly covering her breasts, the assistant principal showed the image to the principal, who instructed him to preserve it on his computer as evidence, which he did. The court later ruled that the photo did not constitute child pornography because under Virginia law, nudity alone is not enough to qualify an image as child pornography; the image must be "sexually explicit". [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]] prosecutor James Plowman stood by his initial assessment of the photo and says he would not have pursued the case if the assistant principal had agreed to resign. Instead, the assistant principal took out a second mortgage on his house and spent $150,000 in attorneys' fees to clear his name.&lt;ref name=Zetter&gt;{{cite news | last = Zetter | first = Kim | title = 'Sexting' hysteria falsely brands educator as child pornographer | url = http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2009/04/sexting-hysteri.html | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Condé Nast]] | date = 3 April 2009 | access-date = 6 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Oei | first = Ting-Yi | title = My students.

===Legislative responses===
In Connecticut, Rep. [[Rosa Rebimbas]] introduced a bill that would lessen the penalty for "sexting" between two consenting minors in 2009.
The bill would make it a Class A misdemeanor for children under 18 to send or receive text messages with other minors that include nude or sexual images. It is currently a felony for children to send such messages, and violators could end up on the state's sex offender registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falcone|first=Amanda|title=Rookie legislator in national eye with bill To lessen 'sexting' penalty for consenting minors|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-04-05/news/hc-ct-rosa-rebimbas-0402.artapr05_1_rep-rosa-rebimbas-sexting-minors|work=Hartford Courant|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=5 April 2010|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermont lawmakers introduced a bill in April 2009 to legalize the consensual exchange of graphic images between two people 13 to 18 years old. Passing along such images to others would remain a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Associated Press|author-link=Associated Press|title=Vermont considers legalizing teen 'sexting'| url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,514875,00.html| work = Fox News Channel| date = 13 April 2009|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ohio, a county prosecutor and two lawmakers proposed a law that would reduce sexting from a [[felony]] to a first degree [[misdemeanor]], and eliminate the possibility of a teenage offender being labeled a sex offender for years. The proposal was supported by the parents of Jesse Logan, a Cincinnati 18-year-old who committed suicide after the naked picture of herself which she sexted was forwarded to people in her high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russ|first=Dick| title = Ohio to address 'sexting' laws| url = http://www.wkyc.com/print.aspx?storyid=111478| work = [[WKYC|WKYC-TV]]|publisher =[[Tegna, Inc.]] | location = Cleveland, Ohio | date = 13 April 2009|access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York, Assemblyman Ken Zebrowski (D-Rockland) has introduced a bill that will create an [[affirmative defense]] where a minor is charged under child pornography laws if they possesses or disseminate a picture of themselves or possess or disseminates the image of another minor (within 4 years of their age) with their consent. The affirmative defense will not be available if the conduct was done without consent. It also creates an educational outreach program for teens that promotes awareness about the dangers of sexting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Galef |first=Sandy | author-link = Sandy Galef |title=Bill no: A08622 summary|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A08622&amp;term=2015&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Text=Y&amp;Votes=Y |date= 16 December 2015 |website=assembly.state.ny.us |publisher=[[New York State Assembly]] |access-date=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian state of Victoria, the law was reformed in 2014 to create a defence for young people who engage in consensual sexting and the introduction of the new offences of distribution of an intimate image, and threat to distribute an intimate image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.asn.au/News/victoria-passes-sexting-laws/|title=Victoria passes 'sexting' laws...|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14886">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''small-bias sample space''' (also known as '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space''',  '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased generator''', or '''small-bias probability space''') is a [[probability distribution]] that fools [[parity function]]s.
In other words, no parity function can distinguish between a small-bias sample space and the uniform distribution with high probability, and hence, small-bias sample spaces naturally give rise to [[pseudorandom generator]]s for parity functions.

The main useful property of small-bias sample spaces is that they need far fewer truly random bits than the uniform distribution to fool parities.  Efficient constructions of small-bias sample spaces have found many applications in computer science, some of which are [[derandomization]], [[error-correcting code]]s, and [[PCP theorem|probabilistically checkable proofs]].
The connection with [[error-correcting code]]s is in fact very strong since &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample spaces are ''equivalent'' to '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced error-correcting codes'''.

==Definition==

===Bias===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
The ''bias'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a set of indices &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref&gt;cf., e.g., {{harvtxt|Goldreich|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{bias}_I(X)
=
\left|
\Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 0\right)
-
\Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 1\right)
\right|
=
\left|
2 \cdot \Pr_{x\sim X} \left(\sum_{i\in I} x_i = 0\right)
-1
\right|
\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is taken over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[finite field]] with two elements. In other words, the sum &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I} x_i&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if the number of ones in the sample &lt;math&gt;x\in\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; at the positions defined by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is even, and otherwise, the sum equals &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.
For &lt;math&gt;I=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, the empty sum is defined to be zero, and hence &lt;math&gt;\text{bias}_{\emptyset} (X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== ϵ-biased sample space ===
A probability distribution &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space'' if
&lt;math&gt;
\text{bias}_I(X) \leq \epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
holds for all non-empty subsets &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== ϵ-biased set ===
An &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that is generated by picking a uniform element from a [[multiset]] &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set''.
The ''size'' &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; of an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the multiset that generates the sample space.

=== ϵ-biased generator ===
An &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased generator &lt;math&gt;G:\{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a function that maps strings of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; to strings of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the multiset &lt;math&gt;X_G=\{G(y) \;\vert\; y\in\{0,1\}^\ell \}&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set. The ''seed length'' of the generator is the number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; and is related to the size of the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set &lt;math&gt;X_G&lt;/math&gt; via the equation &lt;math&gt;s=2^\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connection with epsilon-balanced error-correcting codes ==
There is a close connection between &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets and ''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced'' [[linear code|linear error-correcting codes]].
A linear code &lt;math&gt;C:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^s&lt;/math&gt; of [[Block code#The message length k|message length]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The block length n|block length]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is
''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced'' if the [[Hamming weight]] of every nonzero codeword &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is between &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon)s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon)s&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a linear code, its [[generator matrix]] is an &lt;math&gt;(n\times s)&lt;/math&gt;-matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;C(x)=x \cdot A&lt;/math&gt;.

Then it holds that a multiset &lt;math&gt;X\subset\{0,1\}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased if and only if the linear code &lt;math&gt;C_X&lt;/math&gt;, whose columns are exactly elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09"&gt;cf., e.g., p. 2 of {{harvtxt|Ben-Aroya|Ta-Shma|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constructions of small epsilon-biased sets ==
Usually the goal is to find &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets that have a small size &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; relative to the parameters &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because a smaller size &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; means that the amount of randomness needed to pick a random element from the set is smaller, and so the set can be used to fool parities using few random bits.

=== Theoretical bounds ===
The probabilistic method gives a non-explicit construction that achieves size &lt;math&gt;s=O(n/\epsilon^2)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;
The construction is non-explicit in the sense that finding the &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set requires a lot of true randomness, which does not help towards the goal of reducing the overall randomness.
However, this non-explicit construction is useful because it shows that these efficient codes exist.
On the other hand, the best known lower bound for the size of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets is &lt;math&gt;s=\Omega(n/ (\epsilon^2 \log (1/\epsilon))&lt;/math&gt;, that is, in order for a set to be &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased, it must be at least that big.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;

=== Explicit constructions ===
There are many explicit, i.e., deterministic constructions of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets with various parameter settings:
* {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} achieve &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= \frac{n}{\text{poly}(\epsilon)}&lt;/math&gt;. The construction makes use of [[Justesen code]]s (which is a concatenation of [[Reed–Solomon code]]s with the [[Wozencraft ensemble]]) as well as [[expander walk sampling]].
* {{harvtxt|Alon|Goldreich|Håstad|Peralta|1992}} achieve &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon \log (n/\epsilon)}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;. One of their constructions is the concatenation of [[Reed–Solomon code]]s with the [[Hadamard code]]; this concatenation turns out to be an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced code, which gives rise to an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sample space via the connection mentioned above.
* Concatenating [[Algebraic geometric code]]s with the [[Hadamard code]] gives an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-balanced code with &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^3 \log (1/\epsilon)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="BA-TS-09" /&gt;
* {{harvtxt|Ben-Aroya|Ta-Shma|2009}} achieves &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2 \log (1/\epsilon)}\right)^{5/4}&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Ta-Shma|2017}} achieves &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s= O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^{2+o(1)}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; which is almost optimal because of the lower bound.
These bounds are mutually incomparable. In particular, none of these constructions yields the smallest &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased sets for all settings of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Application: almost k-wise independence ==
An important application of small-bias sets lies in the construction of almost k-wise independent sample spaces.

=== k-wise independent spaces ===
A random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''k-wise independent space'' if, for all index sets &lt;math&gt;I\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the [[marginal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;Y|_I&lt;/math&gt; is exactly equal to the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, for all such &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and all strings &lt;math&gt;z\in\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt;, the distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Pr_Y (Y|_I = z) = 2^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Constructions and bounds ====
k-wise independent spaces are fairly well understood.
* A simple construction by {{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} achieves size &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Alon|Babai|Itai|1986}} construct a k-wise independent space whose size is &lt;math&gt;n^{k/2}&lt;/math&gt;.
* {{harvtxt|Chor|Goldreich|Håstad|Freidmann|1985}} prove that no k-wise independent space can be significantly smaller than &lt;math&gt;n^{k/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Joffe's construction ====
{{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} constructs a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over the [[finite field]] with some prime number &lt;math&gt;n&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of elements, i.e., &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^n&lt;/math&gt;. The initial &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; marginals of the distribution are drawn independently and uniformly at random:
:&lt;math&gt;(Y_0,\dots,Y_{k-1}) \sim\mathbb F_n^k&lt;/math&gt;.
For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \leq i &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal distribution of &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is then defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Y_i=Y_0 + Y_1 \cdot i + Y_2 \cdot i^2 + \dots + Y_{k-1} \cdot i^{k-1}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the calculation is done in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n&lt;/math&gt;.
{{harvtxt|Joffe|1974}} proves that the distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; constructed in this way is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent as a distribution over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^n&lt;/math&gt;.
The distribution &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is uniform on its support, and hence, the support of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; forms a ''&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent set''.
It contains all &lt;math&gt;n^k&lt;/math&gt; strings in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_n^k&lt;/math&gt; that have been extended to strings of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; using the deterministic rule above.

=== Almost k-wise independent spaces ===
A random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent space'' if, for all index sets &lt;math&gt;I\subseteq\{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the restricted distribution &lt;math&gt;Y|_I&lt;/math&gt; and the uniform distribution &lt;math&gt;U_k&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^k&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-close in [[p-norm|1-norm]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Big\|Y|_I - U_k\Big\|_1 \leq \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Constructions ====
{{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} give a general framework for combining small k-wise independent spaces with small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased spaces to obtain &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent spaces of even smaller size.
In particular, let &lt;math&gt;G_1:\{0,1\}^h\to\{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear mapping]] that generates a k-wise independent space and let &lt;math&gt;G_2:\{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^h&lt;/math&gt; be a generator of an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased set over &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^h&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, when given a uniformly random input, the output of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; is a k-wise independent space, and the output of &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;-biased.
Then &lt;math&gt;G : \{0,1\}^\ell \to \{0,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;G(x) = G_1(G_2(x))&lt;/math&gt; is a generator of an &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-wise independent space, where &lt;math&gt;\delta=2^{k/2} \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Section 4 in {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned above, {{harvtxt|Alon|Babai|Itai|1986}} construct a generator &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h=\tfrac{k}{2} \log n&lt;/math&gt;, and {{harvtxt|Naor|Naor|1990}} construct a generator &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\ell=\log s=\log h + O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, the concatenation &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; has seed length &lt;math&gt;\ell = \log k + \log \log n + O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt;.
In order for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; to yield a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-almost k-wise independent space, we need to set &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \delta 2^{-k/2}&lt;/math&gt;, which leads to a seed length of &lt;math&gt;\ell = \log \log n + O(k+\log(\delta^{-1}))&lt;/math&gt; and a sample space of total size &lt;math&gt;2^\ell \leq \log n \cdot \text{poly}(2^k \cdot\delta^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute''' ('''STRI''', {{lang-es|Instituto Smithsonian de Investigaciones Tropicales}}) is the only bureau of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] based outside of the United States, in [[Panama]]. It is dedicated to understanding the past, present and future of tropical ecosystems and their relevance to human welfare. STRI grew out of a small field station established in 1923 on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to become one of the world's leading tropical research organizations. STRI's facilities provide for long-term ecological studies in the tropics and are used by some 1,200 visiting scientists from academic and research institutions around the world every year.

==History==
[[File:Barro Colorado Research.JPG|thumb|right|Barro Colorado Research Station]]
Smithsonian scientists first came to Panama during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] from 1904 to 1914. 
The Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], reached an agreement with [[Federico Boyd]] to conduct a biological inventory of the new Canal Zone in 1910, and this survey was subsequently extended to include all of Panama. Thanks largely to their efforts, the governor of the Canal Zone declared Barro Colorado Island (BCI) a biological reserve in 1923,&lt;ref name="SIA1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=1975 | title=Oral history interview with Charles F. Bennett, Jr., and Anna Carole Bennett, 1975 | work= | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]] | url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217731 | accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the earliest biological reserves in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | title=100 years of the Smithsonian's relationship with Panama | author=Eric Jackson | work=The Panama News | date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=August 8, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060302/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | archivedate=June 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s BCI, in [[Gatun Lake]], became an outdoor laboratory for scientists from U.S. universities and the Smithsonian Institution. By 1940, when BCI was designated the Canal Zone Biological Area (CZBA), more than 300 scientific publications had described the biota of BCI. In the Government Reorganization Act of 1946, BCI became a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) was created in 1966.&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt;

With the establishment of STRI, permanent staff scientists were hired and fellowship programs were initiated to support aspiring tropical biologists. The first director after the name change was [[Martin Humphrey Moynihan]].&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt; A strong relationship with the Republic of Panama was formalized in the [[Panama Canal Treaties]] of 1977, which gradually transferred control of the Canal Zone to Panama. The treaties created the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which included BCI and five surrounding peninsulas, and granted STRI custody of the monument. Panama granted STRI International Mission status in 1985 and, in 1997, the nation extended STRI's custodianship of facilities beyond the culmination of the Panama Canal Treaties in 1999.

STRI's first director after the institute's establishment in 1966 was Martin Humphrey Moynihan. Geographer and scientist Charles F. Bennett, along with his wife, Anna Carole Bennett, participated in STRI during the 1960s, assisting in the organizing of the library, researching and collecting [[microclimate]] data, and studying [[neotropical]] forests. In 1966, Bennett became an honorary Research Associate of STRI.&lt;ref name="SIA1" /&gt; A large collection of papers by STRI researchers at Barro Colorado Island was published as an anthology in 1982, ''The Ecology of a Tropical Rainforest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.

STRI has an average of 350 ongoing research projects and publishes more than 400 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=2016-12-19|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
STRI's research facilities allow staff scientists, fellows and visiting scientists to achieve their research objectives. Most of STRI's staff scientists reside in the tropics and are encouraged to pursue their own research priorities without geographic limitations. The continuity of their long-term programs enables in-depth investigations that attract an elite group of fellows and visitors. Active support for fellows and visitors leverages resources further and attracts more than 1,200 scientists to STRI each year.

==Academic programs==
STRI hosts 10-15 university field courses every year. Participating universities include Princeton, McGill, Northeastern, Wisconsin Green Bay, Yale, Harvard, Ohio State, Arizona State, Marquette, Texas A&amp;M Butler, Cambridge, Dartmouth College and University of Vermont. STRI also runs an intensive field course for Panamanian and Central American undergraduates. Since 1965, STRI has supported some 5,500 fellows and interns of various academic levels, from undergraduate, master and PhD students, to postdoctoral and senior researchers.

==Barro Colorado Nature Monument==
The Barro Colorado Nature Monument includes the 16&amp;nbsp;km² [[Barro Colorado Island]], which is covered with tropical forest and boasts a nearly intact mammal fauna. It also includes 40&amp;nbsp;km² of surrounding mainland peninsulas covered by forests in various stages of succession, serving as a site for manipulative field experiments. The monument adjoins Panama's 220&amp;nbsp;km² [[Soberania National Park]].

With an unparalleled store of background information reflecting almost a century of research in a protected setting, Barro Colorado Island has become a major global center for tropical research.

Barro Colorado is open for public day visits, but advance reservations must be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stri.si.edu/visit/barro-colorado|title=Visit Us at Barro Colorado|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=stri.si.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/panama/the-canal-and-central-panama/review-453607.html|title=Isla Barro Colorado Review &amp;#124; The Canal and Central Panama &amp;#124; Fodor's Travel Guides|date=|publisher=Fodors.com|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other research sites==
Although STRI is based in Panama, research is conducted throughout the tropics. The Smithsonian's Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) network uses standard study protocols to monitor 66 tree plots in 27 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The protocols were developed on BCI in the early 1980s. More than six million individual trees representing 10,000 species are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forestgeo.si.edu|title=ForestGEO|website=ForestGEO|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI's Biological Diversity of Forest Fragments project created experimental forest fragments of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0&amp;nbsp;km² to study the consequences of landscape transformation on forest integrity in the central Amazon region. STRI marine scientists are conducting a global survey of levels of genetic isolation in coral reef organisms.

=== Facilities in Panama City ===
STRI is headquartered at the Earl S. Tupper Research, Library and Conference Center in [[Ancón, Panama|Ancón]], [[Panama City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/earl-s-tupper|title=Earl S.

'''Sonic characteristics of marine species''' - Noise in the [[ocean]] is of utmost importance for ocean explorations, [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] as well as [[fisheries]] studies, [[sonar]] operations, etc. The wide range of systems for ocean research demands the need for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean. The ambient noise in the ocean is composite in nature, with components emanating from a variety of noise sources. The problem of identification of noise sources in the ocean is of prime importance because of its diverse practical applications. In view of the importance of the area of identification of noise sources, there is a need and requirement for characterizing the noise sources in the ocean which are of both man made and biological in origin.

The structure of style: algorithmic approaches to understanding manner and meaning. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylometry is often used to attribute [[authorship]] to [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] or disputed documents. It has legal as well as academic and literary applications, ranging from the question of the [[Shakespeare attribution studies|authorship of Shakespeare's works]] to [[forensic linguistics]].

==History==
Stylometry grew out of earlier techniques of analyzing texts for evidence of authenticity, author identity, and other questions.

The modern practice of the discipline received major impetus from the study of authorship problems in English Renaissance drama. Researchers and readers observed that some playwrights of the era had distinctive patterns of language preferences, and attempted to use those patterns to identify authors in uncertain or collaborative works. Early efforts were not always successful: in 1901, one researcher attempted to use [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher's]] preference for "'em", the contractional form of "them", as a marker to distinguish between Fletcher and [[Philip Massinger]] in their collaborations—but he mistakenly employed an edition of Massinger's works in which the editor had expanded all instances of "'em" to "them".&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Schoenbaum]], ''Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method,'' p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basics of stylometry were set out by Polish philosopher [[Wincenty Lutosławski]] in ''Principes de stylométrie'' (1890). Lutosławski used this method to build a chronology of [[Plato's Dialogues]].

The development of computers and their capacities for analyzing large quantities of data enhanced this type of effort by orders of magnitude. The great capacity of computers for data analysis, however, did not guarantee quality output. In the early 1960s, Rev. A. Q. Morton produced a computer analysis of the fourteen Epistles of the New Testament attributed to St. Paul, which showed that six different authors had written that body of work. A check of his method, applied to the works of [[James Joyce]], gave the result that ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Joyce's multi-perspective, multi-style masterpiece, was written by five separate individuals, none of whom apparently had any part in the crafting of Joyce's first novel, ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Schoenbaum]], ''Internal evidence and Elizabethan dramatic authorship; an essay in literary history and method,'' p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, however, and with practice, researchers and scholars have refined their approaches and methods, to yield better results. One notable early success was the resolution of disputed authorship in twelve of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book 
 |author1=F. Mosteller  |author2=D. Wallace
 |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Inference and Disputed Authorship: The Federalist
 | location = [[Reading, MA]]
 | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]]
 | year = 1964
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While questions of initial assumptions and methodology still arise (and, perhaps, always will), few now dispute the basic premise that linguistic analysis of written texts can produce valuable information and insight. (Indeed, this was apparent even before the advent of computers: the successful application of a textual/linguistic approach to the Fletcher canon by [[Cyrus Hoy]] and others yielded clear results in the late 1950s and early '60s.)

==Applications==
Applications of stylometry include literary studies, historical studies, social studies, gender studies, and many forensic cases and studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Book|last=Chaski|first=Carole|author-link=Carole Chaski|title=Author Identification in the Forensic Setting|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199572120.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199572120-e-36|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law|language=en|pages=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199572120|location=|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199572120.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WechtRago2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIjLBQAAQBAJ|title=Forensic Science and Law: Investigative Applications in Criminal, Civil and Family Justice|author1=Chaski|first=Carole|date=22 December 2005|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=978-1-4200-5811-6|editor-last=Wecht|editor-first=Cyril H.|location=|pages=|editor-last2=Rago|editor-first2=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be applied to [[code stylometry|computer code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/16/identifying_anonymous_programmers/|title=FYI: AI tools can unmask anonymous coders from their binary executables|last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 16, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.|date=2008-09-29|title=Reassessing authorship of the Book of Mormon using delta and nearest shrunken centroid classification|url=https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/23/4/465/1039019|journal=Literary and Linguistic Computing|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=465–491|doi=10.1093/llc/fqn040|issn=0268-1145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, a critique by Schaalje et al. of the above paper by Jockers et al. was published in Literary and Linguistic Computing (now Digital Scholarship in the Humanities), showing the Jockers et al. application (using a closed set of candidate authors, rather than an open one) of nearest shrunken centroid (NSC) classification to be misguided. The closed-set method leads to nonsensical results when applied to other authorship attribution problems, as the Schaalje et al. paper shows. Schaalje and colleagues produced results from an open-set NSC method showing that Sidney Rigdon was a very unlikely author—a result that comports with documented history that Rigdon and Smith did not even know each other in 1829 or early 1830, when the Book of Mormon was dictated and published, making it manifestly impossible for Rigdon to have been the author. Schaalje and colleagues also demonstrated that both Joseph Smith and the men who acted as scribes were unlikely authors, while also revealing multiple distinct voices aligning with the main purported authors of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaalje|first=G.

==Academic venues and events==

Stylometric methods are discussed in several academic fields, mostly as a tangential field of application as with machine learning, natural language processing, and lexicography.
===Forensic linguistics===
The [[International Association of Forensic Linguists]] (IAFL) organises the [[Biennial Conference of the International Association of Forensic Linguists]] (13th edition in 2016 in [[Porto]]) and publishes ''[[The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law]]'' with [[forensic stylistics]] as one of its central topics.

===AAAI===
The [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) has hosted several events on subjective and stylistic analysis of text.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yan Qu]], [[James Shanahan]], and [[Janyce Wiebe]]. "Exploring attitude and affect in text: Theories and applications." AAAI Spring Symposium Technical report SS-04-07. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jussi Karlgren]], [[Björn Gambäck]], and [[Pentti Kanerva]]. "Acquiring (and Using) Linguistic (and World) Knowledge for Information Access."

"Style and Meaning in Language, Art, Music, and Design" (2004). AAAI Fall Symposium. Technical report FS-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PAN===
PAN workshops (originally, plagiarism analysis, authorship identification, and near-duplicate detection, later more generally workshop on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social software misuse)  organised since 2007 mainly in conjunction with information access conferences such as ACM [[Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval|SIGIR]], [[Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation|FIRE]], and [[Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum|CLEF]].

==Case studies of interest==
# Around 1370 to 1070 BC, as recorded in the [[Book of Judges]], one tribe identified members of another tribe in order to kill them by asking them to say the word ''[[Shibboleth]]'' which in the dialect of the intended victims sounded like "sibboleth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Judges|12:5–6|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# In 1439, [[Lorenzo Valla]] showed that the [[Donation of Constantine]] was a [[forgery]], an argument based partly on a comparison of the [[Latin]] with that used in authentic 4th-century documents.
# In 1952, the Swedish bishop [[Dick Helander]] was elected bishop of [[Strängnäs]]. The campaign was competitive and Helander was accused of writing a series of a hundred-some anonymous libelous letters about other candidates to the electorate of the bishopric of Strängnäs. Helander was first convicted of writing the letters and lost his position as bishop but later partially exonerated. The letters were studied using a number of stylometric measures (and also typewriter characteristics) and the various court cases and further examinations, many contracted by Helander himself during the years up to his death in 1978 discussed stylometric methodology and its value as evidence in some detail.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;Text processing text analysis and generation – text typology and attribution.

# In 1975, after [[Ronald Reagan]] had served as governor of California, he began giving weekly radio commentaries syndicated to hundreds of stations. After his personal notes were made public on his 90th birthday in 2001, a study to determine which of those talks were written by him and which were written by various aides used stylostatistical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

(This case was only resolved after a handwriting analysis confirmed the authorship).

# In 2017, a group of linguists, computer scientists, and scholars analysed the authoship of [[Elena Ferrante]].  Based on a corpus created at [[University of Padua]] containing 150 novels written by 40 authors, they analyzed Ferrante's style based on seven of her novels.  They were able to compare her writing style with 39 other novelists using, for example, stylo.&lt;ref name="styloR"/&gt;  The conclusion was the same for all of them:  [[Domenico Starnone]] is the secret hand behind Elena Ferrante.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Savoy.

# In 2018, [[Mark Glickman]], senior lecturer in statistics at Harvard University worked with Ryan Song, a former statistics student at Harvard, and Jason Brown, a professor at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, applied stylometry to find that, most likely, [[The Beatles]]' song "[[In My Life]]" was composed by John Lennon, but with a 50% chance that Paul McCartney wrote the middle eighth.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Reuell. "You say John, I say Paul. But what does stylometry say?". https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/09/harvard-statistician-examines-beatles-mystery/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data and methods==
Since stylometry has both descriptive use cases, used to characterise the content of a collection, and identificatory use cases, e.g. identifying authors or categories of texts, the methods used to analyse the data and features above range from those built to classify items into sets or to distribute items in a space of feature variation. Most methods are statistical in nature, such as [[cluster analysis]] and [[discriminant analysis]], are typically based on [[philological]] data and features, and are fruitful application domains for modern [[machine learning]] approaches. 

Whereas in the past, stylometry emphasized the rarest or most striking elements of a text, contemporary techniques can isolate identifying patterns even in common parts of speech. Most systems are based on lexical statistics, i.e. using the frequencies of words and terms in the text to characterise the text (or its author). In this context, unlike in [[information retrieval]], the observed occurrence patterns of the [[Most common words in English|most common words]] are more interesting than the topical terms which are less frequent.&lt;ref name="biber"&gt;[[Douglas Biber|Biber, Douglas]]. Variation across speech and writing. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karlgrencutting"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karlgren|first1=Jussi|author-link1=Jussi Karlgren|last2=Cutting|first2=Douglass|author-link2=Doug Cutting|title=Recognizing Text Genres with Simple Metrics Using Discriminant Analysis|journal=Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Linguistics|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary stylometric method is the [[writer invariant]]: a property held in common by all texts, or at least all texts long enough to admit of analysis yielding statistically significant results, written by a given author. An example of a writer invariant is frequency of [[function word]]s used by the writer.

In one such method, the text is analyzed to find the 50 most common words. The text is then broken into 5,000 word chunks and each of the chunks is analyzed to find the frequency of those 50 words in that chunk. This generates a unique 50-number identifier for each chunk. These numbers place each chunk of text into a point in a 50-dimensional space. This 50-dimensional space is flattened into a plane using [[principal components analysis]] (PCA). This results in a display of points that correspond to an author's style. If two literary works are placed on the same plane, the resulting pattern may show if both works were by the same author or different authors.

===Neural networks===
[[Neural network]]s, a special case of statistical machine learning methods, have been used to analyze authorship of texts. Text of undisputed authorship are used to train the neural network through processes such as [[backpropagation]], where training error is calculated and used to update the process to increase accuracy. Through a process akin to non-linear regression, the network gains the ability to generalize its recognition ability to new texts to which it has not yet been exposed, classifying them to a stated degree of confidence. Such techniques were applied to the long-standing claims of collaboration of [[Shakespeare]] with his contemporaries Fletcher and [[Christopher Marlowe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/4/203.abstract] ''Neural Computation in Stylometry I: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Fletcher'' Matthews RAJ &amp; Merriam TVN ''Lit Linguist Computing'' (1993) '''8''' (4): 203–209.
doi: 10.1093/llc/8.4.203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/1/1.abstract]''Neural Computation in Stylometry II: An Application to the Works of Shakespeare and Marlowe'' Merriam TVN &amp; Matthews RAJ ''Lit Linguist Computing'' (1994) 9 (1): 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed the view, based on more conventional scholarship, that such collaboration had indeed taken place. 
 
A 1999 study showed that a neural network program reached 70% accuracy in determining authorship of poems it had not yet analyzed. This study from Vrije Universiteit examined identification of poems by three Dutch authors using only letter sequences such as "den".&lt;ref name="oxfordjournalsllc"&gt;{{cite web|author=JF HoornZ|author2=SL Frank|author3=W Kowalczyk|author4=F van der Ham |url=http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/3/311.abstract |title=Neural network identification of poets using letter sequences |publisher=Llc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study used [[deep belief network]]s (DBN) for authorship verification model applicable for continuous authentication (CA).&lt;ref name="BROC2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brocardo | first1 = ML | last2 = Traore | first2 = I | last3 = Woungang | first3 = I | last4 = Obaidat | first4 = MS | year = 2017 | title = Authorship verification using deep belief network systems | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3259/full | journal = Int J Commun Syst. | volume =  30| issue = | page =  e3259| doi = 10.1002/dac.3259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with this method of analysis is that the network can become biased based on its training set, possibly selecting authors the network has more often analyzed.&lt;ref name="oxfordjournalsllc"/&gt;

===Genetic algorithms===
The [[genetic algorithm]] is another machine learning technique used in stylometry. This involves a method that starts out with a set of rules. An example rule might be, "If ''but'' appears more than 1.7 times in every thousand words, then the text is author X". The program is presented with text and uses the rules to determine authorship. The rules are tested against a set of known texts and each rule is given a fitness score. The 50 rules with the lowest scores are thrown out. The remaining 50 rules are given small changes and 50 new rules are introduced. This is repeated until the evolved rules correctly attribute the texts.

===Rare pairs===
One method for identifying style is called "rare pairs", and relies upon individual habits of [[collocation]]. The use of certain words may, for a particular author, idiosyncratically entail the use of other, predictable words.

==Authorship attribution in instant messaging==
The diffusion of Internet has shifted the authorship attribution attention towards online texts (web pages, blogs, etc.) electronic messages (e-mails, tweets, posts, etc.), and other types of written information that are far shorter than an average book, much less formal and more diverse in terms of expressive elements such as colors, layout, fonts, graphics, emoticons, etc. Efforts to take into account such aspects at the level of both structure and syntax were reported in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mining e-Mail Content for Author Identification Forensics|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/604264.604272|journal = SIGMOD Rec.|date = 2001-12-01|issn = 0163-5808|pages = 55–64|volume = 30|issue = 4|doi = 10.1145/604264.604272|first = O.|last = de Vel|first2 = A.|last2 = Anderson|first3 = M.|last3 = Corney|first4 = G.|last4 = Mohay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, content-specific and idiosyncratic cues (e.g., topic models and grammar checking tools) were introduced to unveil deliberate stylistic choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Automatically Profiling the Author of an Anonymous Text|url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1461928.1461959|journal = Commun.

Standard stylometric features have been employed to categorize the content of a chat over [[instant messaging]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Classification of Instant Messaging Communications for Forensics Analysis – TechRepublic|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/classification-of-instant-messaging-communications-for-forensics-analysis/|website = TechRepublic|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the behavior of the participants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can online behavior unveil deceivers? – an exploratory investigation of deception in instant messaging|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1265079&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications&amp;sortType%253Dasc_p_Sequence%2526filter%253DAND(p_IS_Number%253A28293)%2526rowsPerPage%253D75|journal = Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 9 pp.–|doi = 10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265079|first = L.|last = Zhou|first2 = Dongsong|last2 = Zhang}}&lt;/ref&gt; but attempts of identifying chat participants are still few and early. Furthermore, the similarity between spoken conversations and chat interactions has been neglected while being a key difference between chat data and any other type of written information.

The '''Transport Chemical Aerosol Model''' (TCAM) &lt;ref&gt;CARNEVALE C, DECANINI E, VOLTA M. (2008). Design and validation of a multiphase 3D model to simulate tropospheric pollution. SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT, vol. 390; p. 166-176, {{ISSN|0048-9697}},
doi: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V78-4R0CPPJ-2&amp;_user=5674558&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000020562&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=5674558&amp;md5=f4cc6a5a8566880583540b36e5c74b38 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.09.017]&lt;/ref&gt; is a multiphase three-dimensional eulerian grid
model designed for modelling dispersion of pollutants (in particular photochemical and aerosol) at mesoscale.

TCAM is developed by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100802080538/http://automatica.ing.unibs.it/esma/esma.html ESMA] (Environmental Systems Modeling and Assessment) group of University of Brescia.
